            "\u00a0Strengths: model organisms, Dr. Moreno. The labs were very cool! Seeing live zebrafish embryos and working with live c. elegans was very fun. Dr. Moreno herself is a great resource for writing and lab work in general. She pushes you but in a good way!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: grading system. The grading is 100% determined by your TA. The TA for my section was very harsh and so my entire section's grade suffered. Other TAs were very lenient and so those students are going to get better grades for no reason other than luck. I compared reports with friends in other sections and things I was losing points for my friends were not even getting comments on... ",

            "\u00a0I would caution another student about taking this course. The reports are pretty brutal (15-20+ pages each week), you have a weekly quiz, a lab notebook that is going to be nit-picked to the high heavens, and you have to prep for lab each week (which always runs to 5:30...). Additionally, while Dr. Moreno is great, not all of the TAs are. The TA for our section was very harsh and essentially made their own guidelines for grading. Everyone in our section did horribly on every report such that it got to the point where we were all considering dropping together. So, be warned that this is also a course where your TA will have a HUGE influence on your final grade. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely not. If you think this class gets better, it does not. After the first two lab reports, instructions are not clear and grading guidelines do not make sense. There are much easier bio labs and you should take those! ",
            "\u00a0No. I wouldn't recommend taking this class unless you absolutely have to. ",
            "\u00a0This would be a terrific course to take freshmen/sophomore year as an introduction to basic laboratory skills before joining a research lab. However, if you take it later in your career, I doubt you'll take away any new technical skills. The workload is way over the top for 0.5 credits, especially at the start of the semester. The reports do help you become a more efficient scientific writer. "
