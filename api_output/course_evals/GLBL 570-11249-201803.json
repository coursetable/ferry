            "\u00a0- Negotiations\r\n- Drafting memos\r\n- Strategy! ",
            "\u00a0Great course, great introduction to the practical skills and strategic thinking involved in negotiating complex agreements. ",
            "\u00a0Better understanding of climate change negotiations process ",
            "\u00a0After taking this course, I'm able to comfortably articulate the history, structure, and content of the international climate change regime, from the UNFCCC to the Paris Agreement. I understand pretty clearly the process of negotiation, and all the tools negotiators use to resolve differences. I can also explain the key issues, both past and current, of the Paris Agreement and understand climate change related news much better. ",
            "\u00a0This was a great introduction to a very particular kind of document and the nuances of its drafting, negotiation, and revision. I gained a lot of insight into what happens before, during, and after the development of international climate agreements, as well as general principles that apply to the development of international agreements more broadly. ",
            "\u00a0I developed negotiation skills and learned about the evaluation of the climate change regime. ",
            "\u00a0I gained insights into the current status of climate change under the international legal order, the history of climate change treaties, and international negotiations in general. ",
            "\u00a0In this course we learned about the international climate regime, discussing how each tool characterized common but differentiated responsibilities, legal bindingness, ambition, transparency, etc. We also learned the mechanics of negotiations and the components of an international agreement. ",
            "\u00a0I gain a clear understanding of the Climate Change Agreements and the negotiations that took place behind all of them.\r\nFirst-hand insights on the international negotiations world\r\nLearn and practice negotiation techniques ",
            "\u00a0Unbelievable amount of behind-the-scenes knowledge from a leading practitioner, mostly around how to find landing zones using different techniques that negotiators deploy. Very interesting "

            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n- Very interactive\r\n- Fun assignments\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- Reading was sometimes boring ",
            "\u00a0Terrific course overall. No complaints. We didn't always follow the syllabus too closely, but I don't think this was ever a problem. Excellent and helpful feedback on written assignments. ",
            "\u00a0While I appreciated the open-ended nature of the assignments and negotiations, sometimes it could have been helpful to get a bit more clarity and details about what would be expected. ",
            "\u00a0This course is extremely well organized and very comprehensive. One leaves with an understanding of most aspects of international climate-related governance topics. The homework assignments were thoughtful and contributed to our learning without adding unnecessary \"busy work\". Perhaps one area for improvement would be increased student discussion/participation opportunities. ",
            "\u00a0The only issue I saw was one of framing - some students expected to learn more about climate change, and some expected to learn about international agreements in general, whereas this landed squarely in the middle of the two subject areas. ",
            "\u00a0This was an amazing course! the material, reading and class discussion were excellent. Something that I really like was the examples and real-life situation given by the instructor. ",
            "\u00a0I found this course extremely interesting, and I think I learned a lot about the history of climate change negotiations and the current moment in climate change negotiation. I thought the class did a particularly good job of going over how to read legal writing and the importance of phrasing in international agreements.\r\n\r\nThough I'm extremely happy to know more about climate change, the course focused less on the mechanics of international negotiations than I initially expected. For example, how to structure the negotiation, how to use leverage, how to use negotiator personalities to improve outcomes, etc. The course definitely touched on these issues, but I would have preferred to study them more in depth. I think the course's objectives should be refined. I think it's currently billed as a class on international negotiations using the case of climate change, when it really felt like a class just on negotiating climate change. I learned many things that would be applicable to other negotiations, but that didn't feel like the purpose of the course. I think being a little more explicit about the course's focus at the start of the semester would be helpful.\r\n\r\nIn addition, my level of climate change knowledge was low compared to the FES students in the class, making it more difficult to participate since I sometimes felt lost. To help rectify any knowledge imbalances, I think the class should start off with an introductory text on the history of climate change negotiations and use more secondary readings throughout--sometimes I wasn't sure what I was supposed to get out of the primary sources. Furthermore, I think the class would benefit from a thematic organization rather than a chronological one if the focus is on international negotiations rather than climate change. Lastly, I think the class would benefit from two negotiations. For me, the negotiation solidified clarified many issues and helped me connect with the material; I would have benefited from a negotiation earlier on in the semester in addition to the one at the end. ",
            "\u00a0The course was thoroughly enjoyable. I enjoyed the structure of the classes and the method of teaching, and the only suggestion I have would be to incorporate more mock negotiations within the course of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0hard to find fault: homework was full of useful exercises that emphasized the week's learning; the small nature of the class allowed for lots of participation and direct exchange with the lecturer. "

            "\u00a0This was the most practical course I have taken at Yale.  Sue is an incredible resource who discusses the complex negotiation process in terms that are strikingly relevant and easy to comprehend.  I have become a much more informed citizen by taking this class--I cannot recommend this class enough. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Loved the hands-on experience negotiating, the assignments were very fun and the subject material was very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Anyone interested in international climate policy or diplomacy of any kind should take this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, for those interested in being involved with or learning more about climate change negotiations. As a novice to the field, it took a bit more effort to get up to speed and understand the jargon, but certainly relatively approachable to newcomers who are interested. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend that any student with any interest in climate change take this course! It's such an incredible opportunity to learn about this topic from the person who negotiated the climate change agreements for the US, and you get to hear so many fun stories about the negotiations that makes this topic so alive and engaging. To top it off, Sue Biniaz is an excellent instructor. Class is never dull and all the material is practical, interesting, and well-organized. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - it's a rare opportunity to learn about the development of the climate regime from someone who was there firsthand and had a role in its development. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! this is an ideal course for people focusing on climate change and/or international negotiations. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to other students, especially those who are interested in learning more about climate change and its legal framework. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0absolutely, the quality of instruction and opportunity to learn from someone who has actually led negotiations on the ground for the US govt was a huge opportunity that should be jumped on "
