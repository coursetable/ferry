            "\u00a0transcendental arguments, understanding of philosophical background Kant was working within, understanding of the project of the Critique, paper writing skills ",
            "\u00a0I feel like I have a much better grasp of the Critique of Pure Reason that I did initially. Professor Franks is also really excellent at providing relevant background in the history of philosophy, so I also feel like I have a much stronger grasp of the progression of thought around the Critique more generally. The paper topics for the two shorter topics are also designed in such a way that push you to careful close reading, and I think this class also helped further those skills. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a very good understanding of Kant's philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0This class is really hard! It's a lower level lecture and is not a lot of work but understanding Kant in and itself is an intellectual challenge. I learned much more about Critique of Pure Reason than I ever expected to. I would make this one of the intermediate or advanced level classes though because it is so intellectually difficult. Also, Franks teaches you argument reconstruction in this class, which is something to keep in mind if you have not had much experience with argument reconstruction. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Professor Franks carefully guides you through the Critique twice a week, and each class is an unbelievable learning experience. \r\n\r\nThe only weakness of the course was that the grading of papers was often delayed. This may have been a fluke this semester though, ",
            "\u00a0Honestly I think the only weakness of this class is that there is so much to cover and not enough time. I think Professor Franks did a really admirable job of covering things, but there are still lectures that I think would have been helped by having more time. That being said, this isn't a problem that anyone can fix really, and everything else was great. Professor Franks is great at balancing taking questions and explaining sections of text, and class was always really interesting. I also liked the combination of secondary and primary reading most weeks, and the way that the class allowed you to spend more time with small sections of text. ",
            "\u00a0This class takes you on a journey through one of most important texts in the history of Western philosophy, integral to any further study in philosophy. It hits all the main points and you really feel like you have a good grasp on the CPR by the time you finish the course. I would have liked to spend more time on the Analytic of Principles, but alas... ",
            "\u00a0Very good selection of text segments. The lectures were very helpful in making the text intuitive. ",
            "\u00a0I think a weakness is that there could have been more hand outs illustrating how the Transcendental Deduction and Analytic fit together, as well as handouts with argument reconstruction. I found that when we had handouts they were really helpful to my understanding Kant. A strength is that Franks is a very good lecturer and very knowledgable about Kant, but not everyone learns the best through listening to lectures. Having this class in the afternoon was also a good decision. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I think this class should be required for all philosophy majors. The class could not have been taught better. Professor Franks is an excellent instructor who somehow manages to make sense out of the complex reading every single class. It is also a strength of the class that it is a lecture and not a seminar. You can still ask questions, but you need Professor Franks to do most of the talking. This is not an easy class by any means, and you will have to put in the effort for the class to be worth taking. But when you are done, you will have a deep understanding of Kant's thinking because you will have developed opinions on the text with the three papers you write for the class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! There's a line in Professor Franks' syllabus as to the relevance of Kant in the history of philosophy, and I fully agree. I think understanding Kant's arguments and his position is important as a philosophy major, and Professor Franks does an excellent job of making a really difficult book interesting and somewhat digestible. This is a great class and an important one to take. The text can be intimidating, but I think the workload is fully reasonable and Professor Franks is also really kind and accessible in office hours. ",
            "\u00a0This course is amazing. It likely ranks as one of my favorite philosophy courses here at Yale. The content of the CPR touches upon so many different areas of philosophy and is utterly important for establishing a ground for your knowledge of the history of philosophy/philosophy as a whole. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you're genuinely interested in Kant this course will change your life. ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend this course. Having a decent understanding of Kant's philosophy is unavoidable for understanding almost anything that came after him. Even though the text is not an easy read, Professor Franks is an excellent lecturer and is particularly good at making Kant's ideas more intuitive. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would if they are excited by German idealism or metaphysics. I would not if they are trying to just finish a metaphysics requirement, because the course is very conceptually demanding for a 200 level Philosophy class. "
