            "\u00a0You learn so much math that you wouldn't learn in any other class. It's actually really awesome. ",
            "\u00a0Deeper appreciation for representation theory and its applications throughout mathematics. Nice overarching connections between disparate fields and a good opportunity to focus on a region of interest to you. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about doing independent research on a math topic, how to create a coherent presentation for class and write organized lecture notes. "

        [
            "\u00a0Getting to choose your own topic is a great feature of this class ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- Student choice of set of 3 lectures on a topic of his/her choice allows focus on a topic that interests you. Low workload makes class interesting and enjoyable.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- Other students teach the class. Their teaching ability and/or understanding often limits the comprehensibility of lectures.\r\n\r\nI think reading assigned sections of books/papers and holding a discussion on them might be a more helpful capstone project. ",
            "\u00a0The class was an interesting way to do some independent research and learn about some new topics, however all the topics Professor Frenkel suggested had to do with representation theory which made it less interesting because there lacked variety, and harder to follow because most of us had never taken any representation theory. "

            "\u00a0I mean the only reason you're taking this class is because you're some type of math major, but it is really cool and you can have a lot of fun with it ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed Math 480. The class consisted of each student selecting a topic and lecturing for two or three classes. I enjoyed learning about such a wide variety of topics, and Professor Frenkel does a good job of connecting the different lectures. He also helps you select a topic and find sources, and he adds fascinating insights. ",
            "\u00a0I mean, it is an easy way to complete the math major. It is really for those double majoring that do not have time to write a full lit review or for students with a very weak mathematics background. For that reason, the course often drags. But, it serves the purpose it was meant to. The focus of this course is representation theory, which I find interesting. So, it is not a total loss. ",
            "\u00a0You have to take this course if you are a Math Major. It is fine. It is a lot of work right before you present but then you barely have to do anything the rest of the time. Professor Frenkel basically makes everyone do representation theory which is annoying if you don't already have a background in representation theory because it makes the other students lectures harder to follow and it means there is less of a breadth of topics. If you are interested in doing something else, I would recommend looking to another professor you like in a subject area of math that interests you to help you pick a topic. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great seminar and required for the math major. It is definitely good and you will learn a lot about your own topic, but don't expect to fully (or even partially sometimes) understand other people's topics. I think I gave up trying to understand every other topic at some point during other people's lectures. Prof. Frenkel is very helpful and gives the seminar a much-needed laid-back atmosphere. "
