            "\u00a0This is the only course I've taken where I've done any quantitative analysis, so I learned how to do various types of analyses in Excel. I also learned about energy and sustainability challenges in China, China's governance structures and policies, and the relationship between China and the rest of the world as it relates to the environment and climate change. ",
            "\u00a0The material was carefully designed to allow students to develop an in-depth knowledge of China's environmental challenges. It shifted and challenged all my preconceived notions about China. ",
            "\u00a0Qualitative (regulatory, governance, civil society, etc.) and quantitative (basic modeling) understanding of China's energy and environmental challenges. ",

            "\u00a0The course was like drinking from a firehose. I learned a lot about Chinese energy policy and other environmental policy as well as China's history and possible future directions. However, I only retained a small portion of the information that was conveyed, given the fast pace of the course and the high amount of content covered. I expected to learn a ton, and the course exceeded that expectation, but I also expected to focus on building a foundation for further learning and analysis, and that wasn't really the case. ",

            "\u00a0Should better use the lecture time, I have learned much more from the lecture videos than in-class discussion ",
            "\u00a0I believe there were too many assignments, and that they were not very clearly explained. In terms of strengths, having Angel as the professor was simply fantastic, she is one of the best professors I've ever had in my life, and she is unique in her capacity of keeping a whole class engaged and participating even remotely. ",
            "\u00a0The field trip was a major strength. I got to experience and see much of what we had been learning in the classroom in person. \r\n\r\nSome of the quizzes had questions that were confusing based on the course material, and I got a number of questions wrong that I was confident I had answered correctly. I also found some of the analytical exercises confusing in terms of what was being asked. I went to office hours for the second one multiple times and thought I was on the right track but found out when I got my exercise graded that I was not. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The lectures and the reading materials were very engaging. The class was well-organized considering the distance/time challenges with Singapore.\r\nWeaknesses: I can't think of anything. ",
            "\u00a0Very strong course that is set up well to facilitate learning. Lectures were informative and jam-packed, and the professor and TA always made a strong effort to involve everyone in the discussion. Problem sets complemented the learning. The one piece I would change are the reading quizzes -- the questions are ambiguous and do not adequately reflect time spent on the reading. A different model should be used to incentivize students to do the reading. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Very well organized and taught in a flipped classroom setting, also field trip to Beijing is amazing!\r\nWeakness: Sometimes the discussion could feel a bit disorganized but not significantly ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I learned immensely from Angel's lectures and the depth of her expertise. The field trip was a huge effort and an incomparably valuable learning experience. It was novel to engage with the Yale-NUS students.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The flipped structure was a nice idea, but it didn't really work in practice (hard to have discussion on different sides of the planet and with vastly different levels of knowledge). The quantative assignments were interesting but the directions and Excel templates were very unclear, which led to frustration that inhibited learning. The quizzes had confusing wording. The final required a level of detail and insight that was unrealistic to produce in 3 hours. ",
            "\u00a0Angel Tsu knows her stuff. The in person experience was amazing and helped bring things together. \r\nThe technical assignments had the potential to be super great but they were poorly designed and often times the excel logic was broken or the directions didn't make sense.  A simple pass over ahead of time would have fixed this. "

            "\u00a0This was one of my favorite classes that I have taken at F&ES. I would highly recommend this class. ",
