            "\u00a0In this course I read and discussed a broad array of writing by migrants and refugees. I enjoyed thinking about how various migrants and refugees conceptualized and wrote about \"home.\" ",
            "\u00a0This course allowed me a much greater understanding of the background and the current events of migrant literature. I learned to think about literature from the perspective of a migrant. The course allowed for in depth analysis of the material.  The material was broad in scope and deeply interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to pay much greater attention to symbolism and other literary details in the communication of an author's otherwise inexpressible thoughts and feelings. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt a lot both about the world, and the forces of migration that shape it, and myself, and the narratives that came together to form me ",
            "\u00a0This class really encourages you to complicate the idea of \"home\". Through novels, supplementary readings and strong, insightful discussion, Professor Mirakhor creates a space in which one can engage the notions of belonging, of identity, of longing, and of nostalgia, in their most complex forms. This class taught me a new way of approaching reading, of paying attention to what we otherwise might miss but that which plays a large role in what the author attempts to bring out. This class also taught me how to really hone in on details in my writing, and how to better tease those details out in order to connect them to the greater ideas that this course encompasses. I absolutely loved going to class as even though we often left with more questions than answers, they were in and of themselves important questions to engage with in our lives outside of class. ",
            "\u00a0This class was awesome! First off, we read some really incredible literature (like Kumar's Immigrant, Montana, which President Obama listed as one of his favorite books of the year). Professor Mirakhor chose diverse selection that introduced me to a new range of writers and issues. I also found that I became a much better reader, writer, and seminar participant. Essays prompts were pretty tough to write and Professor Mirakhor expected a lot from us in class, but I appreciate it because I feel like I learned and improved so much. ",
            "\u00a0How to closely read texts. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Strengths - subject matter, texts chosen, Professor Mirakhor did a good job at asking us to put texts in conversation with each other \r\nWeaknesses - I think this course felt too broad at times because we were reading so many texts and from such a wide array of time periods / conditions of migration / nations. I kind of wish we were able to hone in more specifically on certain figures and writers or spend more time learning about maybe two or three specific migrant communities. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of the course was the material we read and watched.  The books we read and movies we watched were brilliant.  The other students were brilliant and insightful, though one might describe them as precocious. \r\nThe weakness was that the course however, lacked a cohesive overarching structure.  I was left with a sense that I had learned very much about the material, but was hard-pressed to connect it all.  The grading seemed to be even, if maybe a bit inflated. ",
            "\u00a0The reading selection for this course was amazing, and I thought the blog posts were really engaging.  Sometimes I felt that the same members of each class would speak and not others. ",
            "\u00a0the course was absolutely incredible\r\ngreat readings, great assignments, great discussions, a great professor ",
            "\u00a0My favourite thing about this class (and the first class that I have been in which did this) was that we discussed each person's comment posted for the week. Professor Mirakhor split us into two groups and had alternating groups post a comment each week, then giving each person a chance to talk about their comment in class. This encouraged really insightful posts and comments on readings as opposed to having us just write one for the sake of credit for completion. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength is the literature. Some of the books we read are now on my favorites list and I've been lending them out to all my friends. Professor Mirakhor is a great discussion leader and seminar was always fascinating. I really looked forward to it every week. We were also very lucky to meet Amitava Kumar, who was amazing! The only weakness of this class was that sometimes the work piled up. There were weeks when we had reading, an essay due, and a discussion post, which was a little overwhelming. ",
            "\u00a0Heavy reading load. ",
            "\u00a0This is a really well-taught and well thought-out class. I greatly enjoyed the texts and our class's weekly discussion of them. "

            "\u00a0Yes! Leah Mirakhor is great. If you like reading, it's a great course to take - very text-based. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a wonderful time.  I would recommend taking the course CR/D/F. I found there to be too few graded assignments and I was struggling to understand what my grade would be in the course.  The material is fascinating and worth reading regardless of taking the course.  My fellow classmates always had interesting opinions and never shied from sharing them.  This class is not for someone who will avoid the reading.  The class is not interesting if you have not read the book beforehand. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This course was an amazing in-depth dive into complex themes surrounding migration, nationalism, and identity construction.  The professor and readings are all incredible and the assignments are compelling. ",
            "\u00a0absolutely, 100% take this if you can  Prof Mirakhor is so passionate, her seminar discussions are eye opening in a way that sometimes makes you wonder how you didnt know any of it before ",
            "\u00a011/10 would recommend. I'd take it for the literature alone. You will read fascinating books that will really expand your knowledge. Seminar is also excellent and you have a lot of freedom to write about what you're interested it for your essays. Grading was super fair and instructive. My only caveat is that this class is more time consuming than I thought it would be. We moved relatively quickly and you have to read thoroughly, so the readings were not something that only took an hour or two. But if you have the time to do the readings, you can't go wrong. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class. It makes you a better reader and a better writer. "
