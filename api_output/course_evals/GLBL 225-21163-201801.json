",

I do hope the grading was such that we didnt get negative points for answering a multiple choice question wrong, though. I dont think it really serves any educational merit. ",
            "\u00a0This was the worst class I have taken at Yale so far. While initially it seemed that the course would be fine because its structure, I was very disappointed. Lecture was extremely dull, and honestly useless. I would have been better off staying at home and just looking at the slides than attending, but attendance was required. The tests were horribly written and did not judge a student's knowledge of the material at all. A large part of this was due to very poor wording of multiple choice questions, which often had multiple \"right\" answers in the eyes of many students. The fact that we had to go over the tests in section before even getting our exams back was a miserable experience. Section was also a complete waste of time. It did not add to the course at all. In the end, I was only in this course because it is a major requirement, so I tried to come in with an open mind, but after each class I became more and more disappointed and disillusioned with the class. I don't know of a single person who liked it. ",
            "\u00a0The course was well structured though I wish there had been problem sets.  The lectures were extremely clear and well thought out- the weakness was the student engagement (This is a larger reflection on the Global Affairs major in general but a solid proportion of students don't come to class and then complain about their grade toward the end as soon as they realize that participation/engagement in lecture counts as a portion of one's grade.  Francesco is wonderful professor but the students drove me CRAZY mainly because the way they behaved manifested in my mind as a lack of respect for someone who we are so lucky to have tech this class in a clear, thoughtful manner- their laziness and expectation to excel despite not putting in the work was mind boggling). ",
            "\u00a0It would be good if it  was more quantitative. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Intro level material that was presented in clear, legible ways. I appreciated the deeper look into multiple case studies and academic research currently occurring. \r\n\r\nWeakness: Likely too intro level for the caliber of the class -- given that we are almost all 3rd and 4th year year students, many of us had encountered this material before. I think this class could have been a good opportunity to take more nuanced dives into topics of development with a critical lens. I would have liked to have seen more about public-private partnerships that are currently taking place, rather than more basic level studies. Grading was a bit weird -- I think it would have been better to give slightly harder to tests (more written) and maybe a paper. ",
            "\u00a0Going to lecture and discussion sections were really a core part of my experience in this course. Professor Amodio really is a great lecturer and has a knack at explaining complicated concepts in a clear, concise manner. He also is great at playing the class discussion off of student questions, which is why participation is so important! I thought the lectures did a great job at summarizing the core concepts from the textbook chapters, as well as applying them to the interesting readings that were assigned--real-life empirical studies that I might not have fully grasped without the help of lecture. Discussion sections were also run efficiently--each minute in section was used wisely and I felt like they all had purpose to them. I suppose some might ask for more assignments or tasks to help distinguish the grade distribution, but I felt like the workload of the class was really optimal for me. ",
            "\u00a0By my knowledge, the course this year was wildly different than it was taught in the past, when most students absolutely loathed it. From my experience, it is a good course for what it is meant to be: a survey on topics in development. Grading was a bit arbitrary (my participation grade as someone who attended class regularly was the same as someone who did not attend any class since the second week), but I think this is something that will improve with time. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- interesting\r\nWeakness- could feel like a gut at times ",
            "\u00a0This course could benefit from either eliminating section or making it more engaging. Additionally, a lot of the material while interesting was presented in a lackluster way that was not necessarily critical of the neoliberal, paternalistic, and capitalistic elements that drive current discourses on international development. I would have loved to have had the opportunity to discuss the underlying theories that drive the particular manifestations of development in the 21st century. As a Latin American, I would have appreciated discourse on extractive industries (AJR theory) beyond noting that they were extractive. The history of political economy is critical to understanding that our perceptions of development are not sustainable. As a foundational course for he global major, the information was useful but left me worried about the gaps in knowledge and criticism about current development approaches. ",
            "\u00a0In terms of strengths, the set-up of the course was well organized and nicely planned. Lectures by Professor Amodio were comprehensive and thorough, and sections complemented the lectures very nicely. I appreciated the focus on qualitative aspects of the course. In terms of weaknesses, I thought that the review sessions in sections for the midterms could be more well though-out, as they could sometimes be uncomfortable and stress-inducing, as students in section start to admit what they got wrong and what they got correct on the exam. ",
            "\u00a0Great, easy introduction to development economics, basic econometric techniques, economic philosophy and the lens of an economist on the worlds welfare and future.\r\n\r\nInstructor:\r\n\tProfessor Amodio was visiting this year but did a very good job. He is a great lecturer even though he is not the best orator. If one listens carefully (not easy at 9 am), he says a lot of interesting things and always connects examples and facts to take-away principles, theories and great big ideas\r\n\tHe did a very good job with interaction in the beginning and asked a range of easy, difficult and fun questions in class for us to answer. However, by the end, he would ask no more than one question in class and interaction became limited to people asking him silly questions rather than engaging with the content/debate. The participation grade created perverse incentives for people to say things and ask stupid questions for the sake of the grade, to the detriment and waste of time of everybody. Professor Amodio talks a lot about incentives but he did not recognize the problem here and said the grade was based on quantity rather than quality of participation (just say anything it seemed)\r\nClass content (lecture):\r\n\tThe slides were very well prepared and did a great job summarizing information. Once in a while e.g. difference in differences or with the rural urban migration papers details, the slides were unclear and did not hammer home on a central message\r\n\tThe class time was well managed and would always end well/punctually \r\nClass content (readings):\r\n\tThe book wasnt needed for the class but it was very interesting (and a short) read and really took the lectures to the next level\r\n\tThe papers for the Section were also a nice balance but again a higher expectation should be set with reading and discussing the papers\r\nCourse assignments:\r\n\tThe professor and everyone realized that the class was too easy and except the first exam (that had one somewhat harder question on Solow), the exams were descriptive and too basic.\r\n\tThe MCQs on the exam were somewhat harder and required a solid understanding of what was going on. The negative marking on incorrect guesses wasnt necessary. Sadly  and this is unfortunate  the English language of some of the MCQs was unclear. Professor Amodio is not a native speaker so this is fine but I suggest he write harder essay questions rather than try to make the multiple choice complex and niche\r\n\tThere were no problem sets, which while the students enjoyed, was probably not a good idea.

            "\u00a0The main strength of this class is the emphasis on critical analysis of different studies and research techniques. Many of the studies we looked at were interesting and we were taught to try to find flaws with them, which I believe to be an important skill. In terms of weaknesses, overall, the course felt like it lacked unity, other than the very broad theme of development. The different topic sections were a bit disjointed. The instruction was very poor, but the professor is leaving after this semester so that is not relevant to future iterations of the course. Weekly discussion section was a waste of time: there was no productive discussion, and nothing outside of what we learned in class was brought up by the teaching fellow. The requirement that every student participate by asking a question in every class was ludicrous and detracted greatly from the quality of the class. We were told that we needed to participate in each class to receive full participation points, and that the quality of our questions was not important, so students were incentivized to say anything for the sake of talking, leading to many unproductive questions and points. The tests were poorly made and poorly graded. The multiple choice questions were often worded ambiguously and seemed designed to trick students. The short answer questions were graded according to a very specific, inflexible rubric, so one could demonstrate full knowledge of the subject and lose points for failing to mention an incidental detail. Overall, this course had far more weaknesses than strengths. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Amodio is a strong lecturer and the TFs were also very knowledgeable. Professor Amodio did a very good job of explaining complicated concepts in a simple manner. That said, the course didn't feel like it had too much content. Perhaps I would have felt overwhelmed by a more quantitative course, but a large part of me wishes that there had been more math and that we had incorporated Stata or R. One other consideration, is that the first time a person can take GLBL 225 is their sophomore spring (after having been accepted to global affairs). As a result, many students in the class have already taken a large number of more advanced global classes and/or economics. GLBL 225 might be more helpful earlier. The course was incredibly user-friendly and the textbook was a helpful supplement. Professor Amodio also picked very good readings. Section time was well used and interested. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were great, and the material was interesting.  It was well structured in terms of teaching.  The review sessions for exams should go beyond just going through a practice test (which was super helpful).  The grading for the exams was also a little weird.  I wish there were more opportunities for feedback besides the exams ",
            "\u00a0People should take it before junior spring but thats a problem with the major and not the course ",
            "\u00a0While this course gave a wide overview of international development, I do not think it expected enough of students. Sometimes lectures gave fairly elementary, cursory glances at topics, and I think that the course would be better if it was more in-depth and taught to a higher level. ",
            "\u00a0The information was presented in a clear manner.\r\n\r\nMultiple-choice questions on exams were often ambiguous. The participation component of the grade favors students who are naturally extroverted. "

As someone interested in the field, this class was a sincere disappointment in its (1) provincial view of international development and (2) high school level engagement of the material. With the former, we did not discuss multiple important components of int'l dev, ranging from nonprofits to historical context for the regions we discussed. In terms of the latter, there were no papers, just three exams that required memorization of lecture slides -- and not much more.\r\nI do think Professor Amodio is a kind person, but I sincerely hope the course gets revitalized for the next cohort of students.

Even though this is required for Global majors, I look back on this course not as a tedious requirement I had to fulfill, but rather an interesting and comprehensive class that set up a lot of foundational skills I could take elsewhere in the Global major (as an intro required course should actually be!). While you do get the necessary economics and statistical teaching to understand the readings and lectures, I appreciated how the class wasn't focused on just learning those concepts, but rather applying them to broader frameworks within development. As someone who came in interested in development economics and international development in general, but not knowing too much, I am really grateful I took this class early on because now I feel much better prepared for other classes. As a last note, at least with Professor Amodio, participate! Your experience and the experience of your classmates can only be improved by asking questions. ",

Unfortunately, being given a 9am slot at the Watson Center is never easy. The material was neither interesting nor challenging. However, these components of the class did not doom it. Rather, it was the exams that made this class so excruciating. \r\n\r\nThree exams covered the basics of the material. You just have to regurgitate what was on the slides. Literally, if you put an ounce of thought into a question, you were likely to get it wrong. The exams were designed to trick and frustrate you in a way I had never experienced in a Yale class. I've never taken a class that discouraged analytical thinking in such a way. \r\n\r\nThe material, at its core, could have been interesting. It was well-presented and clear.
