            "\u00a0The course is pretty nice. I learned a lot about convex optimization. Primal-dual methods, ADMM, gradient descent, and many more. ",

            "\u00a0I developed insights into optimization theory and techniques, also both theoretical and computational skills in this field. ",
            "\u00a0Concept of convex sets and functions. Gradient decent algorithm, Newton method, duality theory, convex optimization, interior point method. Mainly theoretical aspect of the algorithms (e.g., rigorous proof of performance scaling like # of iteration steps for given error threshold). ",
            "\u00a0Challenging introduction to the field--but it gives both low and high level insights into why optimization and convexity matter. You also gain a lot of practical tricks for working with inequalities and matrices and taking more difficult derivatives. Motivates aspects of calculus and linear algebra very effectively. ",
            "\u00a0Better ability to read optimization literature. ",
            "\u00a0I learned classic and new techniques in optimization algorithms in this course. ",

            "\u00a0The lectures are very informative and the problem sets help a lot in consolidating our knowledge. Dr. Tatikonda and Xinyang are very accessible and give us useful advice and feedback. My only suggestion is that maybe we can also have some programming/numerical experiments in the homework to help us develop detailed understanding in some aspects that are important but easily omitted (like tuning parameters, etc) ",

            "\u00a0Teach a little fast. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were very good. I wish the notes for every lecture were available to the students so I could spend all my attention on the lecture rather than devoting attention to rapidly writing down what was on the chalkboard. Often, professor would ask if anyone had any questions and people seldom did. I believe that some students would have had questions and would have been able to ask them if they were more engaged in the verbal aspect of the lecture rather than note taking. ",
            "\u00a0Weakness - too theoretical and professor provides little intuition. Many proofs are similar, and I'd like more of a theory intuition as opposed to jumping directly into the proofs. ",
            "\u00a0The course is well organized and well instructed. It will be better if slides or ppt of class content is provided. ",

            "\u00a0It seems a requirement in today's world, but make sure you have the mathematical chops to keep up. I did not and struggled. ",
