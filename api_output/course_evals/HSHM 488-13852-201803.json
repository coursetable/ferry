            "\u00a0Learned about a ton of different drugs--LSD, miltown, cigarettes, alcohol, prescription meds, etc, and how they shaped America today. I learned how to approach topics through a historical lens and how to write an op-ed and historical paper. ",
            "\u00a0great overview of cultural aspects of drugs in the 20th century ",
            "\u00a0I really improved my ability to think outside the reading about the societal impacts and context of what the subject of a piece is. ",
            "\u00a0We often discussed the implications of our language surrounding drug users -- how it varies based on race, like how our society treats minorities who use drugs in opposition to how we treat the upper and middle classes. We also got to talk a lot about drugs that I didn't know too much about but that are constantly being used around me, like adderall, marijuana, LSD... ",
            "\u00a0We learned about drugs and drug policies across the 20th century (and a little bit of the 19th), focusing especially on how the societal/legal policing of drugs affected marginalized communities. Every week there was a different theme, so it's a little hard to describe the course, but it was extremely interesting. I think that my writing and historical research skills improved, and I feel like a learned a lot about not only drugs but the cultural history of the US. ",
            "\u00a0Analysis of historical texts, medical historical literature reviewed ",
            "\u00a0Expansive understanding of the history of drugs up until modern day ",
            "\u00a0You will write an Op-Ed for your first assignment, which is a fun way of trying a new writing style and communicating historical research in a different way. It is also about a modern drug topic which might be more interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a LOT about the historical conceptions of drugs use, the different waves of people who use drugs, and how different legislation differentially treated different groups. The class is one of the favorite I have ever taken. "

            "\u00a0Really cool content. Assignments were relevant and interesting. Class discussion was great some days but on other days a little dry just because the readings weren't as exciting. ",
            "\u00a0- readings were sometimes too long \r\n- great discussions \r\n- great feedback from TF and professor ",
            "\u00a0I think this course is hit or miss depending on the people in the class. We had a very comfortable environment, which Tess sets up nicely, and because of that we were able to get into deeper levels of conversation and understanding. I can see a world in which the class doesn't go as well due to people being unwilling to delve into deeper issues, but that fortunately was not the case here. ",
            "\u00a0I think the biggest strengths were the topics selected by Prof. Lanzarotta (every week was so so interesting) and Prof. Lanzarotta herself. She and our teaching fellow, Maya were extremely knowledgeable and always led really great discussions. You can really tell that they spend a lot of time before seminar preparing activities and questions, and it makes a huge difference. They are both really kind, approachable and chill, which was great. The only weakness would be the fact that you don't really know anything about your grade until it comes out at the end of the semester (most of it is your final paper+participation), but that system is just how most humanities seminars are structured. ",
            "\u00a0no weaknesses! ",
            "\u00a0Great balance of going over readings and introducing new material/present day conversations about drugs. Only negative was not receiving many grades until the very end of the semester which made understanding where one stood more difficult ",
            "\u00a0Readings can be unnecessarily long but they're still interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Extremely interesting course material, great professor, great TA, and the content prevented you from taking it too seriously. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Maybe at times it was a bit unorganized? Not even though, I'm not even going to say that. The discussions were in Socratic seminar style, so it could give the appearance that it's unorganized but I would disagree on that point actually. In sum: organized as well. "

            "\u00a0Would definitely recommend!!! I learned so much about drugs in America and it helped explain so much about why present-day America is what it is. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend, because the professor is very insightful, humble, and helpful. The material is very engaging and at times surprising in a good way. ",
            "\u00a0I would! Drugs are all around us and are a very important part of society to understand! I think it is important to take this class and to expand how we view drugs, why we view them how we view them, and how we can work to make things more effective and orderly in society in comparison to historical cases of how we've treated drugs. There are two major assignments throughout the semester (1 op-ed piece and 1 final paper) in addition to weekly readings that are quite intriguing. Both the op-ed and the final paper are very free form, and you can write about whatever interests you. This is a class that focuses on the student's being a priority -- the point of the class is to help you learn about something that is highly stigmatized by society, not to drown you in busy work. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely. This is truly the best course I have taken at Yale. After every seminar, I feel like I walked away with my mind a little bit (or a lot bit) blown. The material is just so fascinating and Prof. Lanzarotta and Maya are the best. ",
            "\u00a0YES! Tess is so interesting and the topics shifting every week keep you engaged. ",
            "\u00a0Would definitely recommend if you are interested in an academic study of drugs and their effects on society. Up to you how intensely you focus on particular drugs and the openness of the paper topics allowed us to follow whatever we liked ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The professor and her TA were amazing and the readings are fascinating. The assignments are not bad at all and it gives you a new way of looking at how Americans perceive/use drugs. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Absolutely fascinating, with great instructors. Learned a lot. If you come from a background where drugs are an omnipresent reality, this class does a great job at contextualizing the many 'whys' you may have. "
