            "\u00a0This course really gave me an insight as to what my major is all about and gave me a look into evolutionary biology as a whole. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about evolutionary biology and difference subfields within the overall course. Additionally, I learned about different experiments that have been done in the field that have yielded important results. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to apply statistics to biology and how to create phylogenies, understand fitness landscapes, and apply the knowledge gained in biology 104 to a deeper and more in depth field of study. ",
            "\u00a0Better understood evolutionary mechanisms and their quantitative basis. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a good overview of current approaches to evolutionary biology. ",
            "\u00a0I learned basic concepts in evolutionary biology, at the gene and population level, expanding upon the concepts we encountered in BIOL 104. I also expanded upon my ability to read scientific papers. ",
            "\u00a0In this class, I learned a lot about the principles of evolutionary biology, particularly microevolution. You learn a lot about specific mechanisms and population genetics and not very much about life history. The first half of the course focuses on a lot of info that was covered in BIOL 104 and a lot of detail in population genetics. The second half focuses a lot on evolutionary tactics employed by microorganisms and the fitness landscape. ",
            "\u00a0The class was extremely insightful into the field of evolutionary biology. I learned so much about how life became the way it is and why, and about where the field is going. I thought it was very interesting to hear about the developments that have led to life as we know it. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about many different instances of evolution throughout history and in present day, along with a ton of different evolutionary processes and themes. I also got better at reading journal papers and understanding different figures and experiments related to evolution. "

            "\u00a0The slides are awesome, easy to refer back to, very informational. This class shouldn't have a section. The papers can be read and understood alone. Nothing against my TA, my TA was amazing and did her best to make the time worthwhile, but the concepts in the papers just weren't really difficult enough to merit section. ",
            "\u00a0This course is taught at an extremely fast pace and the first half of the course can get pretty confusing. ",
            "\u00a0Overall it was a good course. The material was interesting, and the discussion sections were enjoyable. I liked the papers we had to read for my discussion sections, and my TA (Mike) was good at leading engaging discussions. ",
            "\u00a0This class was really interesting in the latter half (Prof Sanchez was more engaging than Prof Powell) and I do feel like I learned the foundational material for Evolutionary Biology. However, and I cannot believe I am saying this, there was not enough work. No p-sets, very loose practice in section, no checks on the readings, no project, only exams (which I thought were good and fair and tested comprehension and application well). So, most weeks I engaged with the material very little outside of class. I would have liked to at least have a project of some type to help drive home the main points of the class. ",
            "\u00a0the tests could be more straight forward. Sometimes in answering the questions I didn't know if I was correctly doing what was asked of me. It would also be helpful to understand what were the important points from lecture because a lot of the times there are detailed math equations of laboratory concepts and it is unclear if it will be expected for us to understand what exactly we are required to know. Professor Sanchez however was very engaging and helped to teach the material well. ",
            "\u00a0The course has two very different teaching styles, because of the two professors. This can be challenging to get used to. ",
            "\u00a0This class was an alright survey. Having two professors made it feel somewhat disjointed. I thought the readings were generally well chosen. ",
            "\u00a0One strength of the course was Professor Sanchez's lecturing and the number of times he stopped to make sure we understood before moving on and encouraged us to ask questions. A weakness was the emphasis on the exams and the dryness and pace of Professor Powell's lectures. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course was that the content was very interesting and mostly accessible, and the professors seem pretty nice, especially Sanchez. My TA (Anne) was AMAZING, which really helped as well. The weakness of the class overall is that it was very easy to disengage from class, as there were no assignments or problem sets outside of studying for two midterms. This course would be greatly improved by having worksheets or problem sets or some sort of assignments that help students engage with the material. The weakness in the first half of the course is that Powell was a a tough lecturer to follow at times and focuses way too much on population genetics that was never tested upon. Sanchez was s great lecturer, but his material felt very repetitive at times. I really wish this class has also introduced some concepts of macroevolution as well, as that would have made it seem like a more comprehensive introduction into the E&EB department rather than a slightly more detailed version of BIOL 104. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I learned a lot of theoretical evolutionary biology that I never knew was part of the subject\r\nweakness: the class was very theoretical and focused too much on microevolution instead of a balance which was disappointing for some who like macroevolution. Also, there was too much math that was useless. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that the instructors were both strengths. They were both very good and very invested in the material and the course. When it came to the exams it was sometimes difficult because no work was given out during the semester, so it tended to be a lot of cramming. However, Sanchez's lectures were great because they always included questions highlighting the important pieces of lecture. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course are that both professors have a very engaging teaching style and seem to care a lot about their students, especially Sanchez. Also, the material is very interesting, though sometimes the more complicated details were a bit dry and confusing. The exams were also very fair and unambiguous for the most part. Some weaknesses were that 80% of your grade is based on two exams, and there are no other assignments for the entire semester (the final 20% is attendance for discussion section). This makes it very easy to slack off when there is no test coming up, and it can be hard to make sure you understand the material without any homework to test your knowledge. Also, it is very nerve-wracking to take the course for a letter grade when nearly half of your grade is based on a 9 or 10 question test on the last day of class. The discussion sections were sometimes useful, but towards the end we would just fill out question sheets in small groups and there was very little discussion. "

            "\u00a0Don't take it expecting a science gut if you have literally no science background, but if you took like, honors bio in high school or AP bio, you should be ok. There is some basic genetic background that is assumed, but it's largely pretty accessible if you're willing to put in any work. Exams: the first exam Powell goes through a crazy amount of math and then asked us one problem about heritability and the rest of the problems were all conceptual. Sanchez gets you all worried about the papers and the textbook being on the test, but neither are on the test in any greater depth than what he talks about in class. If you go to class and pay attention you'll be fine. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this class is really interesting if you enjoy biology.  However, I would only recommend it if you have take BIOL 104.  I took it without taking 104 and was behind the curve in the class. ",
            "\u00a0I would, it's an interesting course with a relatively low workload for a stem course. Overall, I learned interesting things and the course wasn't stressful. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this class gave a good broad-stroke overview of the foundational topics in Evolutionary Biology ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. There is very little day to day work however the exams make up a large portion of your grade and can be much more difficult than would be expected. If you are genuinely interested in Evolutionary Biology I would recommend and I would also say it is helpful to have some form of statistics background. ",
            "\u00a0This is a class that you pretty much take if you are an E&EB major. If you don't have to take it, I would not recommend. ",
            "\u00a0The course isn't a lot of work and the material is relatively interesting. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a good class, if you come in aware of its limitations and try to work around it. First of all, a lot of people take this class that aren't that interested in the material and are only doing it because they were forced. This is fine, but, overall, this class has a lot of potential to be a really fantastic class. This class doesn't really focus much on macroevolution, which is a negative, but the content covered in this class is really great. However, the lectures, especially Powell's, can be a bit disorganized at times, which detracts from the material. Additionally, sections seemed mostly pointless, and I wish they would've been better utilized. The biggest thing you need to know is that the ENTIRETY of your grade comes form the two exams, and you will have no idea how you are doing in the class throughout the entire semester. The first midterm was very detail-specific, and the second midterm was fairly hard, so really do the readings and keep up with the material so you can do well. I am glad I took the course, but I hope it can be improved upon in the future. ",
            "\u00a0I would if you have to take it for your major (E&EB). there is virtually no work except two tests, which can be daunting but actually aren't that bad you just have to study. If you are not majoring E&EB I wouldn't recommend; there are many other better ways to spend your time. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but the class is not a gut. While there is no work, the material can be challenging to understand. If you are interested in learning about life on earth, I think it is a great course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in evolution and knows they will actually go to class. I found the material very interesting, but it was hard to motivate myself to go each morning when there were no assignments or anything to force me to learn the material (until the exams). Even if you do well in the class by studying right before the exams, you wont get much out of the it unless you actually go to a majority of the classes and pay attention. If you dont like the pressure of having so much of your grade depend on exams, take it Credit/D, but honestly, the tests were not too bad, basically just memorization. "
