            "\u00a0Strengths: encouraged learning and exploring interests over grades/homework. There is so much media out there to explain difficult genetic concepts, so as opposed to trying to re-create the material, used what was available like high-quality videos. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not enough participation among a lot of students who were just on WeChat in the back of the room. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: This course provides students with a great experience learning in groups. Here I studied the most up-to-date technology and theories in this field. The course structure is well-designed. Starting from basic knowledge in gene area, we learned gradually about more specific and rare diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, vaccines, etc. ",

            "\u00a0Strength: Definitely Dr. Hoh. She has a lot of wisdom in the field and also knows a lot of people in the field of genetic and environmental diseases. I really appreciated that she asked us for what we wanted to see in the class and opened up class discussions for topics we were interested in. The cases we explored were ones that left me knowing more about the different diseases that are the most prevalent today, and perhaps the most interesting case study was the one in which two students used a 23andMe kit themselves to see truly close science may be. \r\n\r\nI liked the presentations and I actually wish we did more of it. I didn't like the idea of pinning teams against each other, but I did like having multiple group presentations so everyone got to hear a different perspective. I think the class could also be improved in having more discussion of the movies we watched rather than just watching--we leave having questions! ",

The bonus is that the work load is what you want to make of it, but it's such a fun and engaging subject I felt myself researching more in my free time. Always discussing very current events as opposed to reading articles from 20 years ago, which I really appreciated. Dr. Hoh tries to bring new subjects each class and has her own unique style to teaching that is all about self-discovery. ",
