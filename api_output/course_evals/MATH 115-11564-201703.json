            "\u00a0The course is flipped, however, the textbook is not clear nor helpful. The preclass videos are not thorough in explaining the concepts, either. This class would probably be better if it were not flipped, but rather just a lecture. ",
            "\u00a0The flipped class format is horrible. I think a majority of students would benefit from a complete restructuring of the course, as the format is not set up for students to succeed. ",
            "\u00a0I had difficulty adjusting to the flipped classroom style this course was taught in; In the beginning of the semester, I felt like there were not enough explanations given in class and I had to learn everything myself but this got better over the course. The practice problems given in class were helpful, and Psets were also reasonable, but I wish we could have gotten them back more quickly so I could look at them for the tests. ",
            "\u00a0Hated flipped classroom setting, but the online tutorials were helpful and going to peer tutoring helped. ",
            "\u00a0The class itself is fine. I think that the homework given is constructive, and the lessons we covered are essential. However, I think the structure of the course is strange, in that I think the final is far too large of a percentage of our grade overall. I don't feel like it can adequately demonstrate everyone's knowledge and that too many things could go wrong on such an important test. Additionally, when my friend and I asked about our tests and possible regrades, we were told that \"it looked like [we] understood it, but because it wasn't like the rubric we weren't going to receive credit back.\" I think that the TF's grade too much based on the rubric and not based on whether or not we understand the problem. I think that either the rubric should be changed, or the tests should be graded more holistically. ",
            "\u00a0I wasn't keen on the flipped classroom method when we first began (but you get used to it), and I definitely don't recommend this method if you haven't had any exposure to the material beforehand. I think it'd have been so difficult for me to follow along if I hadn't taken AP Calc BC a (long) while ago, and even then I still found class and homework challenging in terms of the problems we were asked to do after little exposure to the material. But the book is really helpful! Also, the practice exams issued for your studying before the two midterms are such big helps to get you ready for the types of questions you'll be asked on the midterms. Math 115 isn't trying to trick you - it's just a fast-paced class that won't be easy if it's your first time with the material. ",
            "\u00a0The fact that is a flipped course makes the class extremely difficult, personally. In theory, it is a good system but I found that it did not help me, just left be very confused. The videos are not enough to fully understand the material, and, in class, the time was spent going through worksheets that were not similar to the videos, quizzes, or tests-- which made them rather useless. This time could have been spent going over the material and examples for each topic. Also, I find there was great variability between the course instructors, which is not very fair. ",
            "\u00a0I think many people can agree that the split classroom really isn't utilized well enough. Kids who are confused in their dorm rooms come into class and leave just as confused since nobody considers running through the material before building on it with more complicated concepts.\r\n\r\nAlso, in my opinion, there isn't enough opportunity for struggling students to reach out to their teachers. I tried several times to curb my own grade by going to my professor for resources but (to be blunt) he barely responded to emails, didn't know where to direct me, etc. Not sure how to solve that problem, as it is a teacher-specific problem but hey, at least you know. ",
            "\u00a0The flipped course concept wss terrible and maybe the greatest weakness of the course. I always looked at them as something that I just wanted to get out of the way and never payed 100% of my attention. I much prefer learning in a classroom where I can engage actively into questions. Also the videos presented multiple IT errors. Additionally many of the professors were very hard to follow in many of the review sections. However, all the topics were covered in depth and the tests never way off from we were taught in class. ",
            "\u00a0This should not be taught in flipped classroom ",
            "\u00a0This course didn't seem to put a lot of focus on helping students succeed. It was hard for me to find information about other instructors' office hours. The questions on exams often went beyond what I was taught in class, and I felt pretty unprepared. Almost half of my homeworks were not returned to me by the time of the final, so I wasn't getting any feedback on my work. Prompt grading and comments would've helped me study. I liked the availability of peer tutors. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest weakness of this course was the flipped classroom teaching style. The videos themselves were actually fine, but the practice questions are too different from the videos and the format of answering them could be better. I wish there was somewhere in the class where they could post just a formula sheet or a sheet with an example problem of each concept worked out. ",
            "\u00a0This course definitely taught me how to approach different problems analytically and systematically, but I felt that the videos for the class were more harmful than helpful--they offered only an introductory look at the material. The worksheets provided in class were also not very helpful in guiding students towards the material; I often felt that they distracted from the course material rather than reinforced key concepts. I would have preferred more in-class practice problems covering a variety of different types of problems rather than individual discovery of key concepts via videos and worksheets. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Instead of a large lecture, students are divided into sections. Also, the topics are well-defined.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The \"flipped classroom\" wasn't effective; class time should be used to teach the material, not to troubleshoot by doing extraneous problems. The preregistration process was a nightmare; I was originally assigned to my sixth-choice section which conflicted with my schedule, and then I got into a different section with a terrible professor before finally getting into a decent section. The homework wasn't graded timely, which is a shame because it could have been an effective learning tool. The post-video questions, the homework problems, the in-class worksheets, and the exams were very inconsistent in difficulty. Some of the exam review sessions were unhelpful, and the exams are graded too harshly; many points are deducted for minor issues, so the grades don't reflect a student's understanding of the material. Worst of all, many students who learned the material in high school take the class to have an easy time, and they kill the curve for students like me who didn't have the opportunity to take Calculus II before.\r\n\r\nThe course could be improved by addressing the weaknesses outlined above, namely by \"unflipping\" the course, by improving the preregistration process, by better vetting the section professors, by grading & returning the homework sooner, by leveling out the difficulty of problems in different contexts, by improving the exam review sessions, by grading the exams with more lenience, and by separating the students who were previously taught the material from those who weren't. ",
            "\u00a0One weakness was the variability in teachers. Some of my friends in other sections had a drastically different learning experience I feel this might have affected the level of success of some students. Another weakness was the aspect of the flipped classroom. I felt that some material was never covered and other material was poorly explained as each teacher covered different things in class. ",
            "\u00a0I had some trouble with the flipped classroom for Math 115. I personally do not think that it is a way of learning that I am very compatible with, and it meant that there were times when I would get behind on some of the material. While the videos were sometimes helpful, I still would have greatly appreciated being taught the material for this course by a professor in person. The flipped classroom meant that the professor has trouble knowing which of their students is struggling. A lot of the material we learned online was therefore only covered superficially in class. ",
            "\u00a0The flipped classroom is only valuable if the time in the classroom is well used and I felt that this was wasted. There wasn't a valuable teaching process the took place at all. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Based on textbook (exams reflected textbook materials and problems); p-sets are good practice\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: very little instruction in each class- too practice-problem heavy; class lectures did not reflect exams very well ",
            "\u00a0I strongly disliked the flipped classroom setting of the course. Rather than spending class time to truly lecture and explain the content, I felt like class time was used poorly to go through a few rushed and not always well-thought out examples and then for the students to do a few practice worksheets. I eel as though time could be better utilized by the student and professors by sticking to a traditional classroom setting rather than give the students videos to watch at home to learn the content.

It's really good to take along with Physics 170/180 if you haven't done math for a while and need to brush up. ",

It is certainly not because any concept was explained to me better than it had been in high school (it was actually worse at times).  I usually like math a lot but I did not enjoy the makeup of this course. ",

            "\u00a0I would have trouble recommending this course to another student, as it is a course where there is very little connection between professor and student. I have yet to meet someone who enjoys the flipped classroom style of teaching, and it is primarily due to this class structure that I disliked the course. ",
            "\u00a0I think it is a valuable course to take since it provides a useful foundation and opens you up to interesting courses in the future, but I do not feel that it is the most fascinating course on of itself. ",
