            "\u00a0Great! I liked how practical the class is. However, I don't think that the course needs to be 1 hr 50 min. Much of the material that we covered could have been reviewed at a faster pace. ",

            "\u00a0I really learned SAS. Mayur is an excellent instructor. ",
            "\u00a0The course is strong in teaching SAS fundamentals and it overlaps nicely with Epi I/II. The course could go even further and teach more advanced epi concepts. Some of the coding was already covered in Epi II, so the class was redundant at points. ",
            "\u00a0I think this class was overall a great way to learn SAS and basic analysis techniques. I feel like I will use a lot of what was covered in class in my future either with my thesis or other work. My suggestion would be to maybe structure the labs differently. I feel like I would come to lab to get the code and then have to go and teach myself afterwards. I don't really know how to improve upon this going forward. Maybe labs should be more independent work and the TF is there to help you as you go along with the problem? I feel like in the lab there would be one person who would take charge and move the code along but if you were slower or needed more time to think you would be left behind. If you could work independently with the TF there for help you could work more at your own pace and really grasp the work more. ",

Only complaint is that TF teaching and grading is not consistent. Despite Mayur's expectations, some TFs gave their students the code (they consistently finished lab in 15-20 minutes) and were very lenient graders, while other TFs taught the whole 50 minutes and were harsh graders. In the future, this should be more standardized. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I learned a lot. It's required for most of us, but I'll be applying these skills not only within YSPH, but also throughout my future career as a data analyst.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Material can be tricky for students without a strong biostats background, but given the core curriculum at YSPH, this shouldn't be a problem.

            "\u00a0The final and midterm really allowed me to think critically about how to perform analyses independently. I think making the labs a little more independent (i.e. don't simply give out the code in lab) I think it could allow students to learn and be better prepared for the exams. ",

I can know say that I am comfortable with performing the basic and necessary tasks that are commonly used in epidemiological studies.\r\n\r\nMy one suggestion would be to cut the lecture time by an hour and add an hour (or so) to lab time.  I feel as though I learned the most during lab but labs were often rushed to get through all of the material.  Given Mayur's propensity to ramble (see below) we would have made it though the same amount of information in lecture had an hour been deducted.  SAS is a very hands-on learning experience, so more time actually playing around and asking questions of the TA with it would be beneficial. ",

            "\u00a0This course was the most helpful and practically applicable that I have ever taken. All of the material was clearly presented such that I could immediately go home and apply what I had learned to my own research. The lectures and labs were very complimentary and provided ample opportunity to clarify concepts and apply what we learned. I thoroughly enjoyed this course. ",
            "\u00a0I think Mayur is a good teacher and is a great help when you ask for it. I think the slides could include a little more information in regards to what is being discussed since the class moves quickly and it can be hard to keep up with notes. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot of practical skills through this course. ",
            "\u00a0Course was pretty good. I actually learned SAS unlike in biostats. Good professor. \r\n\r\nLectures were long and TAs needed to teach labs better. ",
            "\u00a0The labs for this class were great and where much of the learning occurred.  Dr. Desai was very entertaining and he was easy to pay attention to despite listening to lectures on SAS code an output, but the slides themselves were difficult to follow.  During class, Dr. Desai would ask what certain output met, referring to a specific number, but it would often be difficult to find the number he was referring to by \"this number\" with his pointer while trying to take notes on what he was saying at the same time.  I often missed the number he was pointing to, and then didn't have solid notes.  The class could be improved by adding a slide explaining key points of the output, which some lectures lacked.  I understand the importance of attending class to take notes on what isn't on the slides, but trying to quickly locate numbers in output that you do not yet understand while taking notes can be difficult and could be improved. I did not get much out of the lecture portion of the class for this reason.\r\n\r\nAlthough that aspect of the class could be improved, I learned so much from the labs.  If you want to learn SAS, definitely take this class to set a good foundation. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Taught the basics of running statistical analyses on SAS\r\n\r\nWeakness: The grading on labs was oftentimes very difficult, I didn't really even know what we were being evaluated on in the responses because something would always be wrong, even after correcting the mistakes from previous labs. The midterm/final had several portions that were a bit unclear, but asking questions was not technically discouraged by the professor but I felt that it was. Cheating on the midterm was also rampant, which caused the grading distribution to become incredibly harsh (i.e. one mistake would cause you to miss out on honors). I was aware of several incidents where students would talk about the take home exam even though it was explicitly banned, yet the only deterrent was a strongly worded email. I believe that choosing to condone this behavior undermines the very ethics that are taught in this school and think that in the future more should be done to prevent a situation where you are put at a disadvantage for being honest. ",
            "\u00a0Really useful for learning SAS, will be instrumental in writing my thesis next year ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:  \r\n- This course really honed my command over SAS.  \r\n- Applying SAS to data analysis complemented the other YSPH courses well, and became invaluable to me for the work I conducted on my thesis. \r\n- Professor was engaging. \r\n- Labs were interactive and helped a lot in applying what was learned in lecture. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- While I felt I had internalized a lot of the concepts/codes used to find unadjusted analyses, I wish there had been more time spent on linear and logistic regression lectures, which did feel a little rushed to me.  Otherwise, there weren't any notable weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0I actually feel confident in my SAS abilities after taking this course, which has been a clear upgrade over the core Biostatistics course. The course covers a comprehensive list of material, multivariate modeling being the most important in my opinion. The lab structure encourages you to think about the assignment logically and step-by-step rather than copying code from a set of slides. Additionally, there are many helpful TFs who help you through your mistakes and provide good feedback for your assignments. Admittedly, the lecture is boring at times since we go over code for nearly 2 hours. There is not much to do regarding this weakness, but small group discussions may \"liven\" up the lectures more. Overall, I learned a lot and feel like I can apply my acquired data analysis skill set to my research projects. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- Hands on learning of SAS\r\n- Mayur Desai is the best\r\n- utilized a real data set \r\n- Overall: felt like I was actually learning a valuable hard skill that I will use in the future\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Size of the course not as conducive to learning concepts \r\n- Extremely lecture based, and sometimes hard to see the \"big picture\" instead of just learning the coding procedures we need to finish the labs ",

            "\u00a0Overall, the course was very helpful.  I know a lot more about SAS now than I did before.  My main recommendation is that, if feasible, the course be switched to where we spend 2 hours in lab every week and 1 hour in class.  I learned so much more in lab that I did in class, and rarely drew upon my notes from class when doing the labs and tests. ",
            "\u00a0It was a great, great class.  Honestly, I wish we had more opportunities to practice all of the PROCs we learned in class, since we only covered a small sample of it on the exam and labs. ",

The only major weakness was the extreme strictness (and sometimes stylistic rather than content-focused aspects) of the grading rubric.  It also would've been nice to have a set cutoff for grades on the midterm and final rather than a curve, because getting a -1 this year meant a HP whereas in previous years you could've gotten -1 and earned an H.

I was disappointed by the exams (especially the final) -- I really felt that they compromised work I had to do for other classes. I am happy to spend that amount of time working through the code, but it's really hard to do that during an exam week -- it's cannibalizing. ",

            "\u00a0I found myself frustrated by SAS more often than not - it's not an intuitive platform but it appears to be pretty widely used among epidemiologists so I suppose getting the exposure was valuable.  That said, I hope to never see it again. ",

I LOVED how applied the course was; even though I am usually very diligent with course readings, this course didn't require that work and that was a relief because the labs were enough. The lectures may have been difficult for students who are not auditory learners but I didn't mind them and even appreciated how there was no break in the 2 hour course. There was a lot of subject matter to cover and I appreciated how Dr. Desai just charged through it. ",
            "\u00a0This is an amazing class. I learned so much and was able to use SAS in my own individual studies. I would recommend maybe changing the format to twice a week, and hour and 50 minutes is a long time. ",
            "\u00a0This course was useful and I learned how to use SAS. The labs were the most useful part, the lectures were not useful and very boring and could have been delivered online or by simply posting the PDFs for students to review on their own time. The helpful part of this course was actually coding and using SAS, and I think the lectures would have been much more engaging and useful if we had gone through coding examples in class with students actually coding along on their laptops instead of looking at endless slides that did not always make sense out of context (i.e. taken out of the context of the full SAS code and situation). ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the class. I found the labs to be very helpful although lectures can sometimes be dry. The heavy weighting of the final did worry me. ",
            "\u00a0The course is SAS-based, but we show up for a two-hour lecture to be shown PowerPoint slides documenting different codes. Professor doesn't provide enough background into why we are using what we do, nor does he take the time to go over meaningful interpretations. Seems silly to just show up and pay attention and watch him flip through slides of printed code (but I did each class - and took diligent notes). It was difficult to pay attention - a short, five-minute break would have made a ton of difference - or finding a way to have students code with the professor during class. Final was not at all fair based on what we learned and what was covered during lab sections. Similarly, it is frustrating when you abide by the honor code and work on the midterm and final solo but later learn that many other people did not - please find a way to better police other students - disappointing to find out others were not apprehended for their dishonest conduct. ",
            "\u00a0This course is well designed and covered all the important knowledge and skills related to epidemiology studies. ",
            "\u00a0This is a fantastic course for any student who plans to use SAS in the future. I wish I had taken this course sooner as so many other biostatistics courses assume a basic proficiency in SAS. I also found that this course was more helpful in clarifying key concepts in epidemiology, more so than the epi II course. I really appreciated the practical examples and found the pacing to be manageable, especially with a full course load. Finally, I really appreciated the guidance and support that both the instructor and the TA offered throughout the semester.\r\n\r\nThe one weakness of this course is the grading rubric feels very extreme and opaque. Making even a single mistake seems to carry such a heavy penalty. Moreover, making the final project worth 50% of the grade created unnecessary stress. I do agree, however, that this forced me to pay more attention to my final product. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: students learn a hard skill that is useful and will serve them well in the future for either their thesis or work beyond YSPH. Weakness: feedback methods for labs isn't super clear, especially with data interpretations. It was unclear what was good and what wasn't. There's a need for more examples for good interpretations of data. Another weakness was the amount of overall grade points were contributed to the midterm and final. The final was worth 50% of the entire grade for the course, which seemed too imbalanced and not necessary an accurate reflection of how students had done in the course overall. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were very long, with no break in between. I would recommend structuring the lecture to have a 10 minute break at the end of the first hour. The examples given may be better off if we could go through the lecture using SAS rather than reading print out throughout the lecture. The content in the lectures were often repetitive, and could be condensed. In fact, there were 3 powerpoints during the last lecture meeting that were breezed through. The slides themselves were very dense for every lecture, and hard to focus on. There was very little engagement with the students during the lecture. Most of my understanding came from the lab sections, which were very rushed. If there was a way to cut the lecture to just an hour, with fewer examples, and have the lab sections be an hour and a half each, this would be a better way to grasp the material. ",

The lab reports are graded out of 3 points and comprise a significant portion of the final grade. However, the reports are only given full credit if flawless, so any small mistake automatically drops you down to 66%. We are not given any rubrics for lab reports or exams, so when I was deducted a full point for a stylistic choice (reporting an odds ratio in parenthesis at the end of one sentence in a summary instead of stating it in the body of a sentence), I felt that the rest of my (seemingly correct) work had essentially amounted to nothing. Speaking with other students, I feel that this perpetuates an sense that we either have to be perfect or we'll fail. At many points in the semester, I felt discouraged to put effort into the assignments because it was inevitable that my hard work would go unrecognized. ",

However, the professor encouraged a \"cookbook\" approach to SAS (his words), rather than encouraging thinking, reasoning, logic, deduction, etc. Anyone can learn to type the same series of commands repeatedly into a computer program, but actually learning how to reason your way through problems using a statistical software would be a more valuable skill. What I learned in this class will be directly useful in the near term future, but I dont think I gained long term problem-solving skills and I don't think I really needed a course to show me how to type things into SAS.

            "\u00a0If you are looking to learn SAS (which is a valued skill in public health academia, consulting, and beyond), you absolutely should take -- or at least audit -- this course!  You will learn the basics as well as some neat tricks forcoding analyses of various kinds: methods for generating dummy variables, linear and logistic regression types, survival analysis.  The lab code you build each week is a seamless progression from the previous one, so you are unlikely to feel lost or confused.  If you have questions, the TFs have many office hours each week and you can attend another section to fortify your comprehension.  The programming and analytic skills you'll acquire will apply to other languages beyond SAS as well. ",
            "\u00a0Can be demanding, but rewarding at the end ",
            "\u00a0VERY useful skill, but a painful experience through and through -- just know what you're getting into. Would recommend. ",
            "\u00a0Great way to learn SAS, I would recommend it. ",
            "\u00a0The lecture content is hard to sit through - this is a much more application-based course and I didn't find that the lectures added nearly as much as the labs. This class would be far more effective if we switched the times allocated to the Lab and Lectures.  It would be nice if there was an opt-out for students that are on a track or trajectory that will not have them in a position that ever requires SAS, I will likely never use this again and there were other classes I could have taken that would have been far more applicable. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely YES if interested in learning how to manage big datasets and to conduct basic epi analysis!!! ",
            "\u00a0This course is a very realistic approach to SAS and will be very beneficial to any student who desires to do research (thesis or otherwise) and/or understand/interpret research. It is the most useful skill I've gained thus far at YSPH and I highly recommend it. ",
            "\u00a0AMAZING COURSE. It's much harder than biostats 2, but I think it's worth it and teaches you so much valuable information that can be used in other classes, for your thesis and in the real world. ",
            "\u00a0This course will teach you how to code with SAS, and while it is time intensive and can be very frustrating it is also very useful (employers love to see SAS on a resume! And SAS is also helpful to know how to use for other courses and future life activities). ",
            "\u00a0This class greatly helped me with improving my skill in SAS. ",
            "\u00a0Required, so you've got to take it. Good skills - but you learn them during the lab sections (and not during the course itself, even though we pay enough money where not showing up would be a mistake). Wish the lectures felt more useful, wish my TA wasn't as condescending and was more approachable. ",
            "\u00a0I strongly recommend this course. This course helps you summarize and reinforce all the important knowledges and skills related to epidemiology studies. ",
            "\u00a0This is definitely a good course to take if you want to learn SAS and the time commitment is reasonable to balance with other classes. Just be careful with the strict grading system and make sure you pay attention to your final products for homework assignments as well as midterm and final projects. ",
            "\u00a0This course is basically a \"how to run SAS, but only in a very specific way\" course. As Professor Desai described, there are many ways to do things. If you want to know all about SAS and go into the specifics, then you may as well read a SAS manual. This course doesn't really teach stats theory either, so you may end up knowing how to run a certain test on SAS, but not when or why. However, it was an efficient way to learn specific procedures and to get comfortable enough that you can put it on your resume, or run analyses for your thesis. ",
            "\u00a0Great course! You will learn a hard skillet, learning how to use SAS. Its a lot of work to keep up with but can become enjoyable if you allow yourself to be open to learning and excited about learning a new skill ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the class to fellow students because it is a good course to get a deeper understanding of SAS using. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, it's an okay course that needs a lot of work on improvement. SAS should not have to be taught so harshly with the current grading structure. Allow students to go back into their past labs and correct them to get better grades and not feel like failures throughout the course. The current way it is structured discourages students from enjoying the process of learning SAS and statistical analysis. There's no need to instill this type of fear.\r\n\r\nTake an R course instead. The industry does not use SAS as much so I don't know why it is emphasized within this program. R is more ubiquitous and versatile and a necessary skill for wherever you go (industry, academia, etc). ",
            "\u00a0Yes-- you'll feel much more equipped in handling SAS. ",
            "\u00a0Basically you will learn SAS in AAMIE. If you really get into the idea of data and coding, the midterms and finals actually end up being fun! A pretty chill way to pick up SAS, I'd say! ",
            "\u00a0Difficult class that takes a lot of time.  The take-home exams are a substantial amount of work and take over 10 hours to complete.  This class is valuable if you want to learn more about SAS but you should be prepared to spend a lot of time outside of class working on labs and assignments.  If you don't need this training, I would recommend not taking the course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It's a very useful class ",
            "\u00a0AAMIE is an excellent course. It really helps students learn SAS and analyze health data sets. I would strongly recommend this course for any public health students regardless of their concentration. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class! Even if you are not confident in your abilities to \"code,\" you should 100% push yourself to master these concepts. This is an introductory class and is meant for all levels of students. Also, understanding how to manage large data sets is such a valuable skill! ",
            "\u00a0Very useful ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to anyone who thinks they might want to use SAS in their work and/or thesis. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend people to take a class in R instead ",
            "\u00a0This course focused on using SAS to conduct data input, management, and analysis and summarizing table results. I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student, especially if they were looking to become more proficient in a data analysis tool, such as SAS, in their future career. Dr. Desai's notes are very useful and informative. ",
            "\u00a0This course is relatively difficult based on the nuances of SAS and the functions that are being covered in class. It is very easy to go wrong in the assignments and exams, which makes these assignments and the class pretty stressful and time-consuming. I would recommend it to other students who would like to gain a mastery of quantitative data analysis through SAS, but would caution them to allot significant time to the class and its assignments (avoiding piling on other time-consuming and difficult classes). ",
            "\u00a0Take it! SAS is actually fun. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommended! "
