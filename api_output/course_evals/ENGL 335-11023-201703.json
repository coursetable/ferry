            "\u00a0This course did a great job conveying both a breadth of Caribbean poets' work and allowing for careful study of them. It was well balanced to allow us to examine issues of coloniality, gender, and legacy with regard to the specific conditions of each poet's writing. ",
            "\u00a0A survey of Caribbean poetry and the themes, geography and history art from that region grapples with. ",
            "\u00a0I learned an incredible amount about how to read poets like Brathwaite, Goodison, and Walcott in the context of their environments in the Caribbean. I also learned how to place them in conversation with other poets they may have been influenced by. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about Caribbean history and culture, as well as skills related to analyzing and understanding poetry. ",
            "\u00a0Reading and interpreting of complex modern poetry; putting said poetry in a social, historical, and theoretical context; research; reading literary criticism; constructing close-reading and research papers ",
            "\u00a0I entered the course with experience in poetry, but not a lot of historical or literary context for the Caribbean. I greatly enjoyed learning about such aspects of the Caribbean in an interdisciplinary style. "

            "\u00a0I think the reading list is absolutely incredible--particularly Lorna Goodison, M NourbeSe Philip, and Dionne Brand. Professor Reed is also an excellent pedagogue, in terms of his knowledge of the material, in terms of his willingness to be critical, and in terms of how he attends to his students. Discussion was usually very good.\r\nI was glad we wrote blog posts because it both forced me to do the reading and forced me to engage critically with it. I do wish the course engaged more with the blog posts, however. As an exercise, I think its strength is in the instructor being able to know what issues interest us, and what we've been able to pick out so far. If Professor Reed were able to somehow engage with our blogposts (even if it were on the level of engaging with 5 students every week on the blog itself or in written feedback/response) beyond off-hand mentions in class, that would have given me a better sense of how I was doing in the course, and helped me grow more as a critic. ",
            "\u00a0The course is excellent in its detailed analysis of poetry and its place within a larger 'canon' of Caribbean literature, it seamlessly links secondary criticism and literature in a way that connects to the \"real world\" or contextualization of the works in a larger context. ",
            "\u00a0The course has such a brilliant and compelling syllabus that is supported by informative secondary texts. Professor Reed is one of the most incredible professors I've ever learned from. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this was a very interesting course. The workload was not too high, and all the readings and discussions were very interesting. The only thing I can think of is maybe it would be helpful to learn more specific strategies for analyzing poetry along the way, but this wasn't a real problem. ",
            "\u00a0The use of background material to put the texts in context was extremely helpful. The texts were all engaging and the workload was consistently manageable. Like a lot of seminars, we often ran out of time to cover everything in discussion. I found the times where we focused on a few excerpts or poems in great detail and in the context of the larger reading rather than trying to approach a whole text to be the most rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0This class prioritized collective discussion and creative thinking about the works of the semester. Professor Reed fostered a collaborative atmosphere in class. Conversely, there were few opportunities for feedback on writing, which at times made the final assignment more difficult. Greater writing feedback on blog posts would have been helpful. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course without reservation. If you get the chance to take a course with Professor Reed, you should--he is an absolutely phenom as a pedagogue and thinker. This course will expose you to a number of poets and frames of thinking, even if you have some familiarity with the literatures of the Caribbean, as I did. I also strongly encourage engaging with the reading and the blog post--it's not easy to half-ass 500 words, but it's not hard either. You should definitely do the work, because you will reap the rewards. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great class, but only if you have some previous exposure to the study of poetry and literature. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely ",
            "\u00a0If you want an interesting poetry course, or to learn more about the Caribbean, you should definitely take this! It's probably not best to take as a first poetry course, though. Also, be prepared to write weekly blog posts. ",
            "\u00a0Great class! Professor Reed is an excellent professor who's really good about making sure students aren't lost or overwhelmed. The poetry and associated theory is dense and complicated, but Prof. Reed makes it manageable even if you don't have a super strong background in literary criticism. The background reading is super helpful in making the reading parsable and I came away feeling much more confident in my ability to read and comprehend modern poetry. ",
            "\u00a0I am absolutely thrilled with Professor Reed and his teaching of the material. He cares deeply about each of his students understanding the work and is honest about his blind spots.The method of accompanying poetry with secondary reading was useful because so much of the intellectual framework for the material is foreign and outside of the Western canon. He always provided detailed and supportive feedback on my papers that was specific to my strengths and weaknesses. He encouraged me to consider myself as a scholar which is a foreign concept for me at time as an undergraduate student. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student, particularly one who was interested in growing their knowledge and experience with poetry. The class was always fascinating and challenging. "
