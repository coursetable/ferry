            "\u00a0I feel like I learnt a little about a lot of topics in Physics, mostly through mathematical models, but I don't know if I could use any of these models in different contexts, as the course was so fast-paced we didn't do anything in depth. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think theoretically about complex systems science. Additionally, I learned how to analyze real systems and how to use matlab in order to model them. I am extremely grateful for this course, and I feel as though it will help my research tremendously going forward. ",
            "\u00a0You gain a good overview of different topics in complex systems. I also improved my Matlab programming skills! ",
            "\u00a0A basic knowledge of MATLAB and constructing various interesting models, including differential equation solvers and cellular automata. A general overview of complex systems theory. ",
            "\u00a0I've long wanted to study dynamical systems theory after encountering terminology from it in a number of population biology papers but not understanding any of it, so I was really glad to be able to take this course and finally learn about bifurcation structures, Lorenz attractors, etc. The mean-field, renormalization and Monte Carlo approaches to analyzing high-dimensional systems were also really cool to study -- even though we didn't go very deep into any of them, I now feel like I know enough so that I can try exploring these approaches if ever encounter similar problems, whereas in the past I would just have been at a loss as to what to do. ",
            "\u00a0The number one skill I gained from this class was working in MATLAB. Every pset involves coding in it, which is great for building the skill. I have a good working vocabulary for cx systems, and a surface-level understanding of many topics. One thing I feel like I lack is the math skills to take on a whole new problem, but for that you should take math, physics, and chem classes. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The topics covered are very interesting and the demonstrations are great, but the homework can be very confusing if you don't have a strong Physics background or didn't entirely understand the lecture before. ",
            "\u00a0This was an excellent course and exposed me to an entire field of science. I loved the lectures and homework assignments, and learned a lot. However, the one thing I would improve is maybe focusing on fewer things so we can go more into depth. I felt like I appreciated studying so many things, but sometimes it felt hard to focus on any one of them. ",
            "\u00a0The course covers a number of exciting topics, and the instructor explains things with a different perspective than most professors which makes understanding things easier. He is also very available for office hours.\r\n\r\nBecause the course tries to cover so many things, I don't feel like I understood any one topic particularly well. Longer and more involved psets would help! Also, I would spend slightly less time on differential equations. ",
            "\u00a0The strength and weakness were both in the breadth of the course -- the wide range of topics made the class fast paced and interesting, but the quick movement also made some more nuanced topics, especially in statistical mechanics, more difficult to grasp. ",
            "\u00a0I kinda wish the course was slightly later in the day (even 9.25am would have made it easier), given how far the location was from central campus, but that's a minor issue. It'd also have been nice if there were official notes uploaded after class, or at least a list of textbook sections to refer to, since I ended up having to look through the textbooks myself to find the topics that were covered. But apart from that, I thought the pace of the course was great -- we covered a lot of topics, making it a good survey course, but also in sufficient mathematical depth such that I felt like I had genuine conceptual understanding. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Jun is a good lecturer, and the problem sets are challenging but rewarding. The material is quite interesting, and Jun makes it accessible to people from various levels of mathematical background. That said, the class is fairly heavy on Taylor series, linear algebra, and general algebraic manipulation. So while you don't have to be an expert in these things, be comfortable with them.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish Jun had given us more instruction in approaching a cx system from scratch. He walked us through many examples, and we had one pset where we sort of got to do it (the van der Waals equations for gases), but there was minimal chance for us to try those techniques de novo, for ourselves. That said, since cx systems are, well, really complicated, it's not an easy task for a prof teaching a first-semester intro to the topic. "

            "\u00a0If you're looking to get that high-level science course as your BS requirement or are really interested in the mathematical models people have pulled out of nowhere to solve Physics problems, this is the perfect course for you. If you want to be able to apply the stuff you've learned after you take a class, I'd stay away. This is a very broad survey course of modelling approaches taught via a lot of disjointed information, but if you can keep up, it can be fascinating. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This was a great way to get my science credit, and I learned how to program in matlab (without any prior coding experience) and how to apply complex systems science to my research. Additionally, the psets are challenging but reasonable, and there is one long final project that is useful to do. ",
            "\u00a0This is a fun class. You cover a number of cool topics and come away with a broad understanding of what is out there in complex systems. Do not expect to learn any of the topics in depth though; because so much is covered, I didn't feel like I fully understood any of the things we covered. Korenaga is great and very generous with his time. If you have more time than I did, go to his office hours and you will learn/get a lot more out of his class. ",
            "\u00a0Would recommend, especially for math majors looking for an advanced science credit for the B.S. ",
            "\u00a0This class is fast paced, yet also really interesting. The statistical mechanics portion was probably the most conceptually difficult. You end up learning a good amount of MATLAB through the course of the psets, as well as an awareness of ideas in nonlinear dynamics, which you  then get to apply in the final project. Overall, a solid workload but worthwhile class. ",
            "\u00a0If you're looking for a mathy science credit to take, or just want to learn a really cool set of tools to study how complex physical systems work, look no further. The stuff you learn in this course can apply from everything to understanding predator-prey interactions, ferromagnetism, chaotic weather patterns, earthquakes, and more! Or if you've ever seen terms like 'Hopf bifurcation', 'limit cycle', and 'strange attractor' but never really knew what they were, this is where to learn them (and is one reason I took the class). The content is really interesting, and IMO the pset workload is just enough so that you improve your conceptual understanding without burning too much of your time (unless you're completely new to MATLAB, but MATLAB is easy enough to learn). Easily one of my favorite STEM classes at Yale so far. ",
            "\u00a0This class serves as a great survey / introduction on complex systems and their analysis. The more math (lin al, diffeqs) and chemistry (stat mech, thermo) knowledge you have going in, the more it will make sense to you; but know that I had minimal to surface-level understandings of those topics, and I was fine. There are no tests, the psets are mostly coding in MATLAB with a bit of algebra / calculus, and the final project is a paper. "
