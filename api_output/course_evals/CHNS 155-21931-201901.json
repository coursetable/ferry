            "\u00a0Yes! Zhou Laoshi is fantastic. Such a kind and competent teacher who is willing to accommodate your needs. This class is also only 3 days per week; while the average nightly homework is about equal to the earlier courses in Chinese, only having class 3 times per week really alleviates pressure and makes the class seem much more manageable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is a great class for getting better at Chinese. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah, if you want to maintain your Chinese level and do more context work than language drills "
