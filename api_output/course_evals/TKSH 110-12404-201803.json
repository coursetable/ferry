We would sometimes have class in other places on campus which is really fun or if there was something related to Turkish politics, Islam, etc. we wanted to talk about, Selim was happy to discuss it with us. This was nice because I learned a lot about culture outside of just the Turkish language. This course could be improved by making the quizzes less hard. They were quite difficult at times because they used a lot of words that we had not learned before which made it difficult to apply the grammatical structures we were being tested on. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the cultural events and interactions we had in this class. Also, because of the small size of the class, we had a great amount of individual attention. ",
            "\u00a0The textbook was not great and the class could have been structured in a way to make learning easier. Turkish is a challenging language so even for basic concepts a lot of outside the classroom studying needs to be done . The cultural immersion through projects inside the class and outside the class events were the best part of the course. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to someone interested in Turkish, linguistics, the Middle East, or history. It is a very interesting (albeit hard to learn) language and Selim is great. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is a great course to learn Turkish. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class for another student, however, this student would have to be really invested and interested in learning the Turkish language. "
