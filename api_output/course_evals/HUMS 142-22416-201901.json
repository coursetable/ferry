            "\u00a0Analyzing medieval texts ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me read across different pieces of medieval literature with a critical eye. I think some writing courses focus on just one or two works for critical analysis, but we had broader, big picture discussions that I found fascinating. I also got more practice writing short, clear, and concise papers. ",
            "\u00a0history and how to write ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me to evaluate a work of literature from several, often surprising, perspectives. There are characters and events that might have been overlooked by past scholars, and might have never been pointed out at all, simply because those characters are women or those events are of a supernatural nature. Johanna led the class to explore their stories, listen to their desires and beliefs, ultimately coming to an educated analysis of what the authors might have intended in featuring these women and making them do and say things. ",
            "\u00a0Greater understanding of medieval literature and the role women play in it ",
            "\u00a0The new insights and skills that I developed in this class include my new understanding of the medieval times and the further development of my analytical skills. Through the readings I did in this class I have come to understand what makes the medieval times an era of chivalry and war, but most importantly I learned about the ways women were treated, and the parallels between their treatment then and their treatment now. I exercised my analytical skills when writing about these parallels and the way those antiquated ideas are still used to hold women up impossible standards. "

            "\u00a0Long class sometimes silences ",
            "\u00a0This course was engaging, productive, and enjoyable. Its greatest strength was its discussions, which Johanna fostered beautifully. Sometimes I wished I could hear a bit more from her, as she is an expert in the texts we read, but I also enjoyed hearing the thoughts of my classmates. ",
            "\u00a0everything was perfect ",
            "\u00a0The literature was fascinating and well-rounded, representing multiple aspects and issues pertaining to women, the supernatural, women of \"the other,\" monstrous women, motherhood, women and politics, women and sexuality etc. The discussion was lively and productive. Assignments were flexible, balanced, and clearly explained. The grading was transparent. Not too much reading, some weeks had slightly more reading than others, so just look ahead in the syllabus. ",
            "\u00a0Great readings, knowledgeable professor, overall a really interesting course ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are the readings chosen to read and their relevance today despite their antiquity. One of the weaknesses of this course is the length of the course because it did not permit us to really dive in to the texts and the conversations they inspired. "

            "\u00a0Yes! Good class ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this class! It's a great way to dig into medieval texts, coming at them from a feminist perspective. I had a lot of fun and improved my writing! ",
            "\u00a0yes! very interesting and manageable. I learned a lot ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you're lucky to get a seat, take it. It's a great course for humanities students, with a manageable amount of reading, assignments, and discussion. Non-humanities students will do just as well if you do the reading and think of talking points before going to class (I guess it's the same tactic for all discussion-based courses, but this class, in particular, can be a bit fast and advanced in terms of discussion, so you may get lost if you just skim the books the night before). The professor is incredibly kind, patient, and knowledgeable. Assignments are super flexible and fun, though you should come to office hours to get more feedback before and after a paper. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this course and would definitely recommend it ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to anyone that is interested in the medieval times or has an interest in learning and talking about the role women play in society and the ways they have been treated throughout history. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially to those interested in medieval society and to incoming first-years who may not be entirely comfortable with their writing skills. Prof. Johanna teaches an engaging seminar, supplying us with meaty material and facilitating discussion in a way that allows us to delve into its themes, both in our texts and in medieval society more broadly. She also helped steer our seminar back to the text and its themes if we ever started drifting into something that was too off-topic, something that I appreciate. The papers for the class -- three 2-3 page papers on a specific text, theme, or comparison, and one 8-10 page paper on a broader pattern -- are challenging but not daunting, and the guidance she provides is helpful for students who may not be fully confident in their own writing skills.
