            "\u00a0This was a wonderful course! I learned about disease spread, statistical tests and when to use them, qualifications for assuming causality, how to measure risk, and more. Definitely look to the syllabus.. we covered everything on there in depth and I feel like I actually understand everything on there. Marney White is fantastic and will make sure you leave the course feeling as though you've gained insight. ",

            "\u00a0Among other things, I can definitely do some stuff in SPSS now! ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the basics of epidemiology (definitions, history, the type of work done in the public health field). I also learned a lot of useful statistics related to this field. ",
            "\u00a0I learned SPSS techniques to analyze risk and the relationship between variables in the context of disease spread ",
            "\u00a0I learned about methods of disease surveillance, questionnaire formatting, and other methods of epidemiological research. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the core tenants of epidemiological theory and practice. I gained a firm grasp on statistical concepts as they pertain to public health. I mastered the concepts of relative risk, attributable risk, odds ratio, sensitivity/specificity, experimental designs (RCT, cohort studies, cross-sectional studies....). I also learned a lot about pop culture thanks to Professor Whites wonderfully entertaining lectures. ",
            "\u00a0I learned basic information about statistics and how it applies to the emergence of disease. ",
            "\u00a0This class gave me a solid introduction to SPSS and ways to collect public health research. Although I had learned many of the concepts about experimental design before, it was really great to see all the material through the public health lens. I learned how to pick out the important information from scientific papers and to gauge how credible studies are based on their design and questions asked. Many of the topics we covered translate directly into our daily lives! I thought the group grant proposal at the end of the semester was a great way to apply all the concepts we had learned. The four problem sets take quite a bit of time, as does the final presentation and studying for the midterm, so don't underestimate this class. ",
            "\u00a0I am interested in public health, so I thought this course gave me a lot of great vocabulary and information about public health. Professor White does a great job of getting us information that she feels is relevant to the course. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: Prof. White is wonderful. She really really cares about us and understands how to teach us the important things without making it super stressful, which is so rare. The exams are fair, the problem sets are harder but where you do the tougher learning, and the cases are low-stakes and fun!\r\nWeaknesses: I wish the class were more organized. Expectations for exams weren't always clear, but the worst example of this was the final presentation--the assignment Prof. White sent around didn't give enough clear direction, and we never went over it in class. I also think that the lectures could be better organized/streamlined. I appreciated the way Prof. White devoted a lot of every lecture to case studies and personal examples, but it made the content hard to follow at times. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: nice format (tuesday lecture, thursday in class assignment), wonderful professor, interesting material, practical skills for students interested in public health, accessible homework assignments and assessments, group project is a nice challenge\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lectures were often very fast, in class assignments were sometimes confusing to the point where we had to ask for help the whole time, online office hours were sometimes inefficient, not enough time to learn everything we wanted to! ",
            "\u00a0One learns quite a bit about how to conduct public health research and do epidemiology from a methods standpoint. \r\n\r\nI do think that allowing this class to be counted as a Quantitative Reasoning requirement would be helpful and appropriate given the amount of math done in the class.\r\n\r\nFinally, I think it's really important to discuss the implications of doing surveillance and epidemiological work. This class really decontextualized epidemiological methods from the systems of oppression and resistance that create and dictate how and when we use these things (the Black community in America in particular, but also many other marginalized groups, have been absolutely destroyed using epidemiology). Ultimately, not talking about the over surveillance of communities of color and the ways in which epidemiological findings have been used to further oppressive agendas is a form of erasure, which is in itself oppressive. Not centering marginalized populations in case studies, in midterms, and in class on a regular basis is both important and necessary, as epidemiology by design and default is a very white way of measuring disease. ",
            "\u00a0Should be better organized! ",

            "\u00a0it was not oppressively hard but gave you valuable skills along the way ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the alternating lecture and case structure. Cases forced us to have to apply every new concept that we learned, so mastering the material wasn't hard. I also thought that all the lectures were quite engaging. I do wish that the cases were organized a little better; sometimes it felt very chaotic trying to find people to be in groups and then trying to figure out how to best divvy the work (oftentimes we were unable to get through everything and that was always frustrating).  ",
            "\u00a0Professor White is a wonderful and genuine instructor. Coming to her class was like a breath of fresh air. I believe that I learned truly valuable statistic techniques for the future, especially within the research context. In terms of improvement, I believe that lectures could be presented in a clearer manner. Additionally, case works felt at times tedious and without enough instruction from Professor White or TFs. That being said, I thought that examinations were incredibly fair and loved taking the course ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the professor was engaging and the material was significant.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the class could have been more organized. ",
            "\u00a0This course was pretty interesting, and I think the online text was actually quite good. While I appreciated the convenience of online office hours, I did wish that there were some opportunities for at least in-person TA office hours because you can't really discuss conceptual questions at length on a google doc the same way you could in person. I also felt like we would learn a LOT of new (and important) content right before the midterms and didn't love having a problem set due the class before the exam. It felt like I had less time to study and I was learning content for the first time rather than reviewing it. That being said, the problem sets were interesting and did allow me to practice my SPSS skills, which I appreciated. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course is relating information back to real world applications. It could be improved by setting a prerequisite of statistics so everyone has baseline knowledge prior to the class. ",
            "\u00a0The course is set up so that on Tuesdays Professor White lectures, and then on Thursdays you apply those concepts to an in-class case study. I thought this was a very productive use of time and had both the elements of a lecture and a seminar. Professor White is delightful and does a fantastic job on engaging her audience. The best part about this class is that much of the work you do translates directly into real-life skills you'll need if you go into science or public health, like reading scientific literature and synthesizing and argument, or understanding what an odds ratio is.  One piece of advice I would offer is to organize the files differently in canvas (it was often hard to find things). Most students are also on their laptops during class, so I would consider changing the class to a laptop-free zone on Tuesdays to see if students pay more attention. ",
            "\u00a0Every week in this class, we did a practical \"lab\" in groups that were fun and helped us use what we learned.  A weakness of the class was that, as we use SPSS, we often didn't go into details about how the statistical tests we learned about are actually executed, because the computer can just do it for you. I took the class concurrently with a stats class, and I found that very helpful. "

            "\u00a0Yes! Prof. White makes the material lively and engaging, and you come away with the course with key quantitative tools to speak about pretty much any public health problem. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Professor White cares deeply about the course and her students. You will leave the course with important skills, and hopefully a passion for where you want to apply those skills. ",
            "\u00a0Please please take this course. Marney White is the best. Especially if you're interested in public health/Global Health Scholars. I feel like I know how to conduct the statistical tests I'll need when doing my own research now. It's an accessible class that's a ton of fun because of the professor. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The workload was quite reasonable, and Marney cares a lot about her students. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! A very pragmatic approach to statistic techniques, regardless of your previous background in stats. Interesting course with a very manageable workload. ",
            "\u00a0If the student is interested in any health studies or use of statistics in the health field. ",
            "\u00a0YES, YES, and YES! Professor Whites #1 goal is to effectively teach and inspire her students, and she does exactly that. I now feel confident speaking about public health (i.e. I speak the jargon!) and can effectively analyze epidemiological papers. Definitely take this course if you have any genuine interest in public health and medicine, or if you want to gain a valuable and kind mentor like Professor White. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Information is provided to make students better analyzers of information and give information that can easily be learned but isn't already common knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0This class could have gone much faster, to be honest. I liked it though! ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested in public health as it is now (not the history of public health), I would recommend this course. That being said, I would classify this first and foremost as an epidemiology course, not a public health course. A big part of epidemiology is focusing on what exactly you want to study and then how you're going to study it. While broadly speaking it sounds like many things you may be familiar with, there are a surprising amount of vocabulary terms and questions in the book that were not intuitive. That's just to say, this class is fair, but it's not a gut. "
