            "\u00a0Improved close reading/analysis of literature skills and ability to write academic papers about literature. This class definitely pushes you to think deeply and look closely at important works of American literature. Class discussions help improve your skills at formulating ideas and making connections between themes. ",
            "\u00a0This was one of my first English courses at Yale, so this is where I learned how to conduct a close reading of a text and engage with literary criticism. I also learned how to be a more effective, succinct writer and to fully engage with a text. ",
            "\u00a0I became a much better close reader and learned to go beyond an elementary analysis of text. The structure in which I wrote also drastically changed to reflect a flow of thoughts rather than a stagnant preplanned essay. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a wide view of American Literature, beginning with Whitman, but probably more importantly, taught close reading, rhetorical analysis, interaction with criticism, and writing clearly. ",
            "\u00a0Good overview of American Lit. A little male-centric, but Prof. Warner does his best to incorporate some later female writers, and he has interesting perspectives on the earlier books, too. Helped my writing, I think ",
            "\u00a0We covered a variety of works of American literature, including short stories, poetry, and longer novels. I learned more about the context of American literature and common themes amongst these authors. We also did exercises in close reading. ",
            "\u00a0We read some great works of American literature. There are too many great works to feel like after this class I \"understand\" American literature, but that wasn't the point of the class. It's not a survey. It's to teach critical literary skills through a selection of wonderful texts. ",
            "\u00a0I think the biggest development I saw from this class was my writing ability. Weekly reading responses and the different papers really helped with practice. Also, learning how to read a variety of texts, from straightforward to very abstract, helped develop a more open, less formal approach to reading. ",
            "\u00a0How to read closely, engage with academic criticism, and place the text in a historical context. "

            "\u00a0Professor Warner is great at leading discussions. The seminar is big (mine had the max number of 18 people). The size is nice because there's pretty much always someone to fill the silence, but it's also sometimes difficult to get your thought in if you're like me and are slow at thinking about literature/developing your ideas in class. The reading load is very manageable and overall I thought we read really interesting works. We were able to rewrite our first paper which was HUGE because many of us didn't have much experience with writing English papers and didn't know Professor Warner's expectations and thus would have done terribly on the first paper if we hadn't rewritten it. It's overall a very reasonable class workload wise and you learn a lot about close reading through interesting texts. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strength of the course for me would be the way the class was structured. Before class, we would have to write brief reading responses on Canvas about what we readsomething that initially felt annoying to me but, as I realized, actually forced me to think more critically about the texts (and saved me time when I was eventually drafting my papers). Class discussions were always interesting and would lead me to reapproach the text in different, unexpected ways. My class also got to go to the Beinecke and look at first-editions of Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass, which I thought was extremely cool.\r\n\r\nThe biggest weakness of the course (and I'm not sure whether this was only my class) was the fact that the only feedback grade-wise we got was via the three essays of the semester. I wish we got more feedback on our reading responses on Canvas and on our class participation. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: You get to read some amazing texts and are guided through them by the professor. The first draft of your essay is a revision which helps inform the structure of your next two essays. \r\nWeakness: Essay feedback was not always clear and often felt subjective. ",
            "\u00a0I thought Professor Warner was a great asset to this class. He has a brilliant mind for the literature and his one-on-one work with students as they begin writing their first papers was really something that no previous instructor (at any level, and I went to a very small high school with a very strong English department) of mine had ever done. With Professor Warner, the nature of the class is definitely not the most \"student discussion\" based seminar I've ever been in, but in a good way. Although there is able room and respect for student commentary, Warner is very much in control of the class. The weakness of the class would probably the slowness or lack of feedback. Although I didn't ever feel like I was totally in the dark, you won't get much feedback on the weekly reading responses  although Professor often brought them up in class discussion. This could also be a reflection of those as more of a check/check-plus type assignment, but I'm not really a hundred percent sure about my standing with them. Papers take some time to get back, but if you've met with him you probably know something of what to expect. ",
            "\u00a0On your first paper you get really extensive feedback. This was excellent. On later papers, however, feedback is pretty limited if you don't seek out more, so be aware. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly, having our writing ripped to shreds is terrifying. I wish there were a little more about how to improve it, as opposed to just everything thats wrong with it. Strengths are a good discussion, mostly interesting readings (Moby Dick did drag on a little), and a well-structured class. ",
            "\u00a0The works that this course covers are very interesting, but for an introductory English class, it doesnt provide much writing guidance. We only had four papers, and just the first one had a first and second draft. After that, we were expected to have mastered the art of revision, and never discussed writing in class. ",
            "\u00a0The texts and the professor's engagement were the strongest aspect of the course. One thing that could be improved is the fact that a couple of the papers were assigned later in the semester and so it felt like there wasn't a whole lot of time to brainstorm a topic and write a paper, though it was still manageable. ",
            "\u00a0I wholly enjoyed the selection of texts and found myself able to engage with rich themes, including race, gender, and sexuality. I wouldn't change any element of the syllabus. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to anyone looking to improve your skills in close reading, even if you're not an English major. I'm not an English major, nor am I particularly interested in American literature, but this class definitely taught me a lot about what it means to analyze literature and what to look for when reading. ",
            "\u00a0I would. It is a wonderful opportunity to become more familiar with the poets and novelists who have shaped American Literature. Like most classes, though, I think the course is really dependent on the professor. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend the course to a student who wants to learn how to conduct close readings of texts and get their introduction into the scholarly sphere of literary analysis. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course but with another professor. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend the class, specifically with Professor Warner. The texts can be challenging or you may find that you're uninterested in one or more of the texts, but it's still a highly rewarding experience, even just to hear Professor Warner's thoughts and takes many of which my peers nad I would likely never have come to on our own. ",
            "\u00a0This is marketed as an intro course, but I imagine if I were a freshman this class might have broken my spirit. If you want your writing highly challenged (but with little productive feedback), then take this class. If you want interesting gay perspectives into American Lit, take this class. If you need this for your major and youre not very excited and being told youre an awful writer stressed you out, maybe take a section with a different professor. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you are truly very interested in the topic and are willing to dedicate a good amount of time to the papers. If so, the literature you read is awesome, and you will have a positive experience. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. Our class had a good mix of grade levels including a number of English majors trying to fulfill their requirements, and seemed to be accessible to all. The papers were not very long (two 4-5 page ones, one 6-8 page) and we had short reading responses each week. Overall, it was manageable and interesting. Plus, I can't overstate how exciting it is to be in discussion with Michael Warner, who is an astute scholar and professor. The part of class I most enjoyed was just listening to him close read. He gives you a lot of very helpful feedback on your first paper, but not much on your next two. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any other student because, from my experience and the experiences of people in other sections, American Literature is a really solid course that isn't too difficult for first-years, whereas other intro courses like 114 seem to be hit or misses. ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus was extremely well-constructed, and provided plentiful opportunities to engage with themes of race, gender, and sexuality. I highly recommend people who are looking to engage with these themes to take this course. "
