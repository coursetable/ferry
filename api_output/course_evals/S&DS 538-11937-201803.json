            "\u00a0Some additional Bayesian statistics knowledge. I gained a better foundational understanding of how to calculate a posterior distribution. Less afraid of these sorts of simple statistical frameworks now. ",
            "\u00a0I picked up an appreciation of probability and stats from a bayesian framework. The theory, in particular, was a gentle introduction. I have programming background so the R exercises just helped me understand the underlying math. Props to MCMC and Metropolis stuff. ",
            "\u00a0Bayesian. Some other stuff. Maybe I should look at the material so I can do well on the exam. ",

            "\u00a0This class really helped me understand the intersection of probability and statistics; what the fields mean and how they relate. The culmination of the course is to learn how to use an incredibly powerful tool that helps compute statistics, and has been very practical for my research. ",

            "\u00a0Lectures were pretty weak. He spends a bit too much time talking about unimportant stuff and explaining simple details of R programming that one could learn during the homeworks, and less time than would be ideal focused on the actual statistics and theory. ",
            "\u00a0The class itself was clearly structured. Lectures were well prepared. The prof. responded to inquiry readily, eagerly, and quickly. Grades were returned in a timely manner and the prof was more fair when it came to deadlines and grades. \r\n\r\nThe topics covered were pretty good, but the course felt rushed at the end where I feel like I missed some key insights that would have been great to walk away with. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: good structure, very helpful in terms of both theory and programming ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Joe Chang is an incredibly insightful and caring professor. His examples are useful for building up intuition around the concepts of the class, and he has excellent answers to questions when you meet. ",
            "\u00a0strength: Practical problem sets, great resources, great online support as well\r\nweaknesses: could be a lot of work for someone not having done math in a while ",
            "\u00a0I think the problem sets were extremely hard and lengthy, which ruined much of the learning value and joy from this course. \r\n\r\nI would suggest using less tricky notation (just changing superscripts or subscripts), expecting wild mental leaps we wouldn't know without the TAs and examples in Psets where we don't have to learn new course material whilst we are doing the PSet, but first try to even apply *exactly* what we learnt in class. ",
            "\u00a0It is easy to make students understand ",
            "\u00a0The course was well planned and had a satisfactory level of challenge. I liked the curriculum and the lectures.\r\n\r\nTo improve, I would suggest less formulaic midterms and final. These tests were so similar to the practice tests (taken from prior year exams) that they seemed to test how carefully those sample tests had been studied rather than actual understanding of course material. (For example, some questions would be very difficult to solve in the time allotted using just course knowledge, but they were near copies of sample questions.) "

            "\u00a0Yes. ",

If you are interested in a grounding in concepts of Bayesian statistics (different from Frequentist statistics, we did not talk much about p-values or t-tests, etc. other than to compare them with Bayesian concepts), then this is an excellent introductory class. The math is fun, the p-sets are challenging (be prepared to go to office hour(s) and spend several hours of time a week, and everything in the class comes together at the end to make for a very satisfying conclusion through MCMC and statistical inference. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Because it's a different type of probability and statistics. ",
