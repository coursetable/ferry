            "\u00a0I learned to how to make a film professionally, read Havel, Kundera, Kafka, and some Czech. ",
            "\u00a0In this class, I was able to learn a hodgepodge of new skills that enhanced my experience abroad. \r\n\r\nFirst off, I learned a lot about the Czech language and how it worked, and was able to learn to express myself in a few ways. I think that I have a good basis for how the language works so that if I wanted to continue the language, I could.\r\n\r\nSecondly, I learned a lot about Czech literature and how it relates to the history of the country, and reflects it through a number of carefully selected novels that truly enhanced my understanding of what has happened to the Czechs in the last 100 years.\r\n\r\nThirdly, I learned a lot about how film works in terms of consuming it through discussing a selection of notable Czech films, and how film works in terms of producing through our group project producing two Czech films. \r\n\r\nOverall, I felt that I learned a lot for one summer and was happy with every second of the class. ",
            "\u00a0This course allowed me to take advantage of the fact that I was living in Prague while I studied Czech culture. Besides the informational excursions and tours, I appreciated the manner in which it facilitated interactions with the regular Czech people. It allowed me to gain tremendous amount of insight into Czech culture, and it taught me the basics about films. Most importantly, it encouraged me to think about how centuries old history affects people in the present day. Particularly speaking, the selection of Czech authors and films it presented worked together to create an interesting picture of Czech history. ",
            "\u00a0This course was truly what you make of it. I was able to leave with a thorough understanding of the foundations of Czech Film and Literature as well as a decent understanding of the fundamentals of Czech. More importantly all students gain travel skills and insights into Eastern European culture! "

            "\u00a0The program was very well organized. A broad overview of Kafka, Kundera, Havel, and some Czech. The weekend excursions are a perfect complement to the material being learned. The final week of travel is absolutely fantastic! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The class had a lot of interesting texts, films, and other stuff we looked at. I felt that the dinners and trips we had complemented the lecture very well. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: At times, the class felt like a lot to handle. While we learned a lot, it was sometimes too many books or too many films. I honestly wouldn't change anything about the course, but would ask that KvK understand how much we are doing in just a few short weeks. Czech class also felt a bit disorganized at times, but this might have been a reflection on a few students who constantly disrupted the flow of the class. They would ask questions that were quite irrelevant to learning the language. I get the need to compare to our language, but the questions about how Czech was like Latin were quite frustrating to have to sit through. It messed up the plan that I could tell KvK had for teaching us Czech. ",
            "\u00a0The course needed more exams and honework checks for the language half. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely yes! ",
            "\u00a0100% yes. This abroad trip is honestly the most underrated of all the programs Yale has to offer. You get to visit 6 countries over the course of the program. I think my favorite part of the course, however, is KvK. Her focus is really to provide the best experience and stories for her students. She carefully selects everything, from the meals to the side trips to the other things about this program, with the students in mind. I've never in my 3 full years at Yale encountered such a caring professor whose main goal for the summer was giving the students their best summer. And if I may say, she did just that for me in 2018.\r\n\r\nIn terms of class work, it's not easy. There is A LOT to handle. You learn some Czech, watch movies and read some pretty cool books, and it sometimes just becomes a lot. It's manageable but I HIGHLY recommend reading the books beforehand. I know many students don't actually do that... I didn't. But it really helps take the stress off during the class. I still enjoyed the class without reading beforehand, but it did make things harder to have to skim these great works. ",
            "\u00a0This course allowed me to properly experience Czech culture and understand how history shapes people. If you are willing to put in the effort to talk to Czech people and do the readings, you will gain a lot out of it. ",
            "\u00a0This is hands down the best study abroad experience with the most varied and unusual side trips. And KVK is awesome. "
