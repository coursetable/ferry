R is quite different from SAS/SPSS so it's hard to take from his SAS/SPSS lectures and apply them. Especially when some of the models/functions in R could be explained in more detail (what different options are in the functions or how functions from similar packages work). I think the time on other languages could be scrapped (or saved to online files for people to access if they need) and the course could focus on R only. YSPH is transitioning to R anyways so there won't be a great need for SAS for those students anyways. ",

",

I felt like some non-programming homeworks would help me to understand the concepts more completely. As it stands it felt like I was learning more about R packages than statistics. ",

I suggest removing some of the content like \"this method and that method\", which are all options with the same goal, and just focus on some widely used methods. ",
