Professor Garsten makes sure that a reasonable amount of reading is assigned for each session so that we could engage with the texts carefully. It would be nice if we could start the class discussions with a passage from the book or questions from the students. "

Otherwise, this course is still worth taking for all Americans, for people who do not know much or have strong opinions about democracy, and for those with a general interest in political thought or intellectual history.
