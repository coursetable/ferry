            "\u00a0Mainly learned how to open up my mind to looking at life a different way as told by a non-european culture. As someone who had never taken an art history class, it was great to learn how to look at art. The wikipedia assignments were also amazing! I never thought I would have a teacher tell me to actually use wikipedia, but she did and I am grateful to have learned how to contribute to public knowledge about an often forgotten or misunderstood thing. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the basics of art analysis as well as an incredible amount of information relating to Aztec culture and its eventual destruction at the hands of the Spanish conquistadors. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to evaluate 16th-century codices, which I never thought I would do, and learned so much about Aztec history through their art. The title is a bit misleading the only architecture we really looked at were the temples, and that was in their astronomical context, but I liked it that way. There was a big emphasis on formal analysis and description, which I definitely improved at. ",
            "\u00a0How to write critically about art in general. ",
            "\u00a0We learned about many facets of Aztec arts- from the orientation of the Templo Mayor to the use of color in Aztec manuscripts. We also got to refine our visual analysis skills and write two wikipedia pages. Because so little is known about the Aztecs, we learned how to reap insights by looking very closely at Aztec art. We also learned how to have a critical eye when approaching sources written by settlers. Analysis of primary sources was central to the class. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the history of the Mexica and historical and contemporary intellectual debates about Aztec art and architecture. I also learned how to contribute to Wikipedia. "

            "\u00a0Strengths - Great class with a passionate professor that takes you out of your comfort zone. Weaknesses - Given that many of us had never taken an art history class before, I strongly believe that we should've gotten more guidance on the assignments and a little more slack with grading ",
            "\u00a0At times I had a hard time grasping the material of the course, having no background in Aztec culture or art. It seemed that there was a large discrepancy in levels of background knowledge that made the class more accessible to some and created uneven levels of participation ",
            "\u00a0The courses main strength is its breadth of topics it covers, in many ways this also felt like an anthropology class as understanding the how the Mexica viewed the world was integral to understanding their art. ",
            "\u00a0I often thought the reading was not necessary or superfluous to what we were actually talking about in class. Some of the readings were very interesting and useful, but many of the denser archaeology papers were difficult to understand and seemed largely unnecessary. A big strength was that class discussions were always super interesting, and Professor Mundy made an effort to engage everyone with something different every week. I also loved the trips to the YUAG and Peabody (especially the Peabody, where we got to handle actual artifacts and see things on a smaller scale). I would've loved to have spent more time at the Met and AMNH, because I felt like we barely got to see their collections and there were so many beautiful pieces that we didn't get to spend any time looking at. ",
            "\u00a0Great classroom discussion. ",
            "\u00a0A strength is Professor Mundy's lecturing. She is so passionate about the subject, and that really shined through during lectures. The class was also very well-organized, and readings were fair in length and interesting. I really enjoyed trips to the YUAG and to the MET. One thing that could be improved is that I felt that the wikipedia assignments were very tedious, and often more about fixing what previous editors wrote than about reaping new insights. I thought that one wikipedia article would've been sufficient instead of two counting as 40% of our grade. ",
            "\u00a0Great readings and assignments - I really enjoyed the Wikipedia assignments I think those are a real strength of the course. "

            "\u00a0Yes! I think its so great to have the ability to take classes totally out of your comfort zone at Yale and I would encourage everyone to take this class to really get a unique perspective about this amazing ancient culture. What's great about this class is that I felt like assignments were genuinely satisfying my intellectual curiosity. This was mainly because of the uniqueness of them (as a non- art history major), such as working on improving Wikipedia articles and doing formal analysis of piece of art at the YUAG. Definitely recommend, Professor Mundy is so nice and passionate about the subject that it really makes the class better. Plus get to take a trip to the MET! ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested in the Aztecs, this is a great class. I really enjoyed it, and there are a lot more hands on activities than I would have expected. The reading is also usually very interesting. I had never taken an art history course so it was also a great introduction to that. Professor Mundy is a super kind person. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This course can be an incredibly eye-opening experience, especially if taken with Professor Mundy. ",
            "\u00a0If that student is interested in older civilizations or their art or Mesoamerica then I would highly recommend this class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend any course with Professor Mundy! I loved learning about the Aztecs, and bothered my friends all semester with the facts I picked up. The wikipedia assignments were interesting and a change of pace from the usual art history papers, and I liked the course's emphasis on primary sources. Overall this was a great class, and left me wanting to learn more about the subject, which I don't usually feel at the end of a semester. It made me reconsider what we label as \"art\" versus \"craftsmanship\" and look deeply at both giant carved monoliths and tiny, colorful painted symbols. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Mundy is amazing, and so knowledgable about the subject. She is very open and friendly, and I enjoyed meeting with her to discuss papers. It is a class that all majors could and should take. I think it is really important to learn about Aztec art, as it is often left out of the art historical canon. It was interesting to study Aztec art because so little is known about it. It really forces you to use your visual analysis skills. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely recommend this course. The Wikipedia assignments are particularly valuable. "
