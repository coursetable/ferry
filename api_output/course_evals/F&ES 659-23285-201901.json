There's the direct silvicultural skills/knowledge that was delivered (and that I learnt), but through learning that knowledge it motivated a lot of new research questions for me and helped me see ecology in a different light that honestly inspired a lot of amazement! Specific concepts I learnt: shade-tolerance, successional stages and how it relates to species guilds, etc. I also learnt a lot from the classmates! ",

Additionally I learned a lot about the silvicultural practices to manipulate growth toward social management goals. ",

We learned how to do forest prescriptions, how to assess a forest condition, and many other skills that go along with forestry. The field trips helped a lot in translating theory into practice. ",

The class covered many different topics in silviculture from some basic concepts to advanced management practices. I also learned to read the landscape in New England from the field trips. What I have learned in this class would be a wonderful foundation for my research. ",

I also improved my tree ID skills, and began to develop the ability to read landscapes. Most importantly, silviculture brought together many pieces of knowledge that I had before (plant ecophysiology, soil science, stand dynamics) and made a coherent whole picture. ",

Availability of the lectures and textbook online was helpful for recapping work - it's hard to grasp everything in a lecture. The exams were really educational and well-set in my opinion. The content was also well organised and built on well to each other. Very informative!\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the sentences in the lectures drag on and don't end, and it's hard to catch what the professor is saying on a sentence-level.\r\nImprovement: Can it not be at 8.30am in the morning? :( ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course include the comprehensive knowledge about tree growth patterns in different ecological and social conditions. Weaknesses of this course were that it favored heavily towards traditional silvicultural practices and lacked modern day examples outside of the northeast temperate forest. Additionally, I would have benefited from more relevant figures, graphs, and examples used in lectures. ",

I think the field trip at Yale Myers was particularly insightful, however.\r\n\r\nThe course also assumes that students have a lot of background knowledge. As someone who has not taken a forestry class before, I felt I had to do extra studying to keep up with regular learning. ",

Occasionally it felt like students really wanted to follow up on specific issues, but didn't have the opportunity because the lecture exhausted the allocated time. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths are that Dr. Ashton knows a ton. Biggest weakness is that he obscures his message by telling irrelevant stories and metaphors. I appreciate some goofiness, but to be honest I thought it got in the way in this class. He knows a ton of fascinating info so I feel he could keep it interesting with that! The slides could also be made a little bit more regular and clear. ",

The extra lectures sometimes seemed excessive and beyond what students should be expected to contribute to the course for 4 units. At the same time, course time sometimes seemed to be used inefficiently. If there is a way to keep lectures on track and use lecture time efficiently, I wonder if these extra lectures to cover additional material is really necessary. ",

It is a good starting point if one wants to learn about some basic concepts of forestry and silviculture. It also covers so many topics in great depth. Each lecture is very informative. \r\n\r\nOne weakness is that two hours is a bit too long. I tend to zone out in the last 30 minutes. ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Ashton is a good lecturer and knows when to pause, when to emphasize a point, and when to repeat a key message. In fact, Dr. Ashton's repetition of key messages/facts made the gigantic amount of information in the class much more digestible. Those key messages were super helpful guiding principles that enabled me to think about any specific forest situation as a part of the larger pattern of forest ecology.\r\n\r\nAnother strength is the unbelievable multitude of examples Dr. Ashton seems to have at hand at all times, from many different parts of the world. This helps keep students with many different interests engaged. \r\n\r\nA weakness of the course is the quality of Dr. Ashton's slides, though I think this is a minor thing. On the one hand, I understand that fewer words and more photos/diagrams means students must pay close attention or risk missing something. But on the other hand, fewer words and more photos/diagrams makes it difficult to go back and review the slides. Dr. Ashton tries to account for this by providing printouts of his slides so students can write on them, so I acknowledge that he probably already knows this and is trying to account for it. "
