            "\u00a0In Advanced Sculpture, I was able to explore new ways of working (like performance). Professor Kersels encouraged me to push my art in different directions, and he provided support and insights throughout the semester which will remain valuable for years to come. "

        [
            "\u00a0I have taken several art classes while at Yale, and this class -- while being the least structured -- also managed to challenge & inspire me the most. For me, the strength of the class came from the way it was structured. The workload wasn't overwhelming, and the class was comprised of a mix of undergraduate and graduate students. This really allowed for students to express their ideas in an environment that was low-stress yet still highly engaging and intellectually challenging. ",
            "\u00a0This course was tremendously valuable because it provided a (rare) space for working on a large sculptural project. "

        [
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student who is a self-starter looking to work through their own artistic ideas throughout the course of the semester. There were only a few small assignments throughout the semester, and students were given a great deal of freedom in creating their final projects. I would recommend this class to any student looking to explore and expand their artistic practice on their own, while meeting with the class once a week for discussions and workshops. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in developing a large sculptural work (object or performance) or a set of works. Discussion is an integral part of the course as well. The conversations with Professor Kersels and fellow classmates were wonderfully stimulating and memorable. "
