            "\u00a0Taking this class helped me learn about the many educational resources Yale offers like the Beinecke, the Peabody, the Medical Library, and others. It also helped me to become better at both analyzing works of art and articulating trends across time or medium. ",
            "\u00a0This course developed my creative abilities, thought me the art of promblem solving from a creative standpoint and offered me a chance to learn to appreciate art ",
            "\u00a0How to think more like an artist, designer, develop precision, and become more aware of the vast resources we have here at Yale. Through Blue, we got to visit special collections in the HAAS art library, the Science Center/Peabody, Beinecke, and even see brains at the medical history library. And also, to realize that there's no formulaic way to do assignments for this class - it's okay to be creative, and to have one idea that you were starting out with evolve into another. Oh and of course, we did all of the above with blue as our vehicle. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to take advantage of all the resources that Yale offers. Throughout this class, we visited the Beinecke, the medical library, and the Whitney Humanities Center. I also learned how to develop my thought processes while planning projects, so that I created a piece of work that had meaning. ",
            "\u00a0How to experience Blue through different senses. The origins of blue, it's associations. ",
            "\u00a0Although Blue is listed as an arts class, it touches on so many other disciplines. I worked on video editing, did abstract/creative writing, and even learned the scientific reason for why birds' feathers are blue. If there's something you want to learn or work on, you can find a way to integrate that into your projects in this class. Even though we only met once a week, I found that to be enough to independently complete the weekly assignments. Almost every class was in a different place on campus; we visited the Beinecke, the Peabody Museum, the Cushing Brain Collection (to learn about the \"blues\"), the Yale Art Gallery, and more. Blue was a great intro to the resources at Yale and also how to think independently & critically about an abstract concept. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think visually and conceptually. After taking this course, I definitely look at everything I encounter in day-to-day life in a much more thoughtful way than before -- I now question more, think critically more, consider patterns and abstractions more. ",
            "\u00a0I developed the knowledge to not restrict myself and to take in my surroundings more carefully; I learned that lists are important and so are collections; blue is everywhere and can mean anything. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt about everything blue: artistic, historical, medical, literary, and more. We learnt the art of collecting and enjoyed visiting a range of Yale's collections, galleries, libraries, and museums. When it came to the final project we pulled together all of our ideas and perspectives on the colour blue and how to bring together what we had been conceptually and physically collecting. ",
            "\u00a0This class pushed me to think about a subject that I never thought I would study in depth. Itt is a very intensive and specific study into one color which leads to very abstract discussions that do not have correct answers. Because it is such an open ended and creatively taught course there was rarely structure; therefor,e it made me let go and think in a very different way then Im used to. ",

            "\u00a0This course gives the student a lot of room to explore didferent facets of creativity so that each and every one of us can know the best way and medium to creatively express ourselves. ",
            "\u00a0The class met once a week which worked well because it was for about a 2ish hour block. This way, we could do our cool visit / speaker / whatever was happening for that class in the 1st hour or so (if it didn't take up the entire class) and then talk about each other's homework projects for the next hour. The small size of this class also helps make it work really well - you get to know your classmates on a personal level. ",
            "\u00a0I liked meeting once a week in a large time chunk because we could watch films and explore exhibits. It also gave a longer amount of time to think about certain topics and mull over information from class. It might be better to make assignments due on days other than the meeting day so that we don't forget about the class over the weekend. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths definitely include all the places we were able to visit and explore, and also the occasional guest lecturers we would have. I also really enjoyed being able to look through rare books and manuscripts, as I feel like I wouldn't have gotten that opportunity my first semester otherwise.\r\n\r\nProf Helfand and Este (our TA) were amazing and really helpful in giving feedback as long as you knew the general direction you wanted to go. Coming from a mediocre public school, the open class structure was challenging for me at first, but everyone was helpful and patient. Some aspects of class discussion were a bit inaccessible to students who were not well-versed in art terminology or certain art periods. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are the various sites around Yale that you visit including the Peabody Museum and the Medical History Library. The homework assignments are challenging but very interesting and creative and every class leads to inciteful and intriguing discussion that are mostly student led. \r\n\r\nThe weaknesses were the lack of structure and guidance throughout the course which led to many students dominating and leading the class. The final project was also very open ended which pushed us to be very creative but also was very intimidating. "

            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this class to any student looking for a fun freshman seminar to explore art and their own personal voice. The class provides a unique perspective on art and literature by looking at it through the lens of the color blue - the scope seems fairly specific in that sense, but the class looks at a huge variety of media and artists. Overall, its an incredibly fun and engaging class (with a relatively forgiving workload). ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because of the intellectual stimulation it affords to each person. It abandons the rigorous approach to appreciating art and focuses more on personalizing the elements of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. Take this class. Even if your favorite color is red. As a first-year, this class is perfect to help you get introduced overall to all the resources you are going to have here at Yale. Also, Prof. Helfand cares about each one of her students so much. The workload is manageable (you typically have small readings and/or a project due each week) and it will depend on how much you want to put into your projects. So, you could finish it in an hour or take hours on end. Of course it's not intellectually challenging in terms of a difficult STEM class like physics, but it will intellectually challenge you as an creator; an artist and designer. Don't expect this class to be a history lesson on the color blue. You will have a few classes though where you discuss blue's origins, connotations, etc. I guess the best way to describe it is as something similar to an introductory art class with blue as its vehicle, but it is so much more than that. You will have fun in class - Prof. Helfand and your classmates will make it a worthwhile experience. This is my favorite class that I've taken so far and I'm pretty sure it will continue to be my favorite class for a while. ",
            "\u00a0As a freshman seminar, this class gives you a great introduction to all of the academic resources that Yale offers while also delving into an engaging topic: the color blue. I would definitely recommend this course to another student. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the workload is low and it's a very interesting class. You get to visit a lot of different places. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Blue was so broad that anyone can get something that interests them out of it. For our final project, students made everything from visual portraits to rap musicals to websites about pollution. You also get a good intro to all the cool resources on Yale's campus! However, we didn't get grades for any of our assignments during the semester, so I would caution against taking this class if you like to know for certain that you're doing well. The prof and TA are happy to give feedback, but Blue isn't as structured in the same way as most classes are. It's fluid and very much what you make of it, so if that fits your learning style, take it! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I'd definitely recommend it to others! If you're lucky enough to get in the class, TAKE IT. You will not regret it. You will learn so much about yourself, the way you think, the way others think; so much about the visual concepts and abstractions underlying everything in the world; you will be able to connect many different fields to create something new and unique and utterly yours. Plus, it's relatively low workload. Some assignments are definitely challenging and take up a considerable amount of time, but I had so much fun doing them that I didn't feel it was too bad at all. Oh, and professor Helfand is delightful. If nothing else, take it for her. She's brilliant and incredibly, unbelievably lovely. She builds a relationship with literally every single student in class! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, no matter what you're personally into, this course exercises your creative brain. We had students in comp-sci to film to organic chemistry in the class and everyone added their own unique take and produced equally unique work. ",
            "\u00a0If you are lucky enough to get it take it. Without doubt a very special course taught by a very special professor. ",
            "\u00a0This class is for a very specific kind of person. I would recommend it less to people interested in art and more to writers and philosophers. It is grounded in discussing and questioning instead of making. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the course is very unique, inspiring, and encouraging of self expression "
