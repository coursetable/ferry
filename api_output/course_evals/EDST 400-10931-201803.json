            "\u00a0How to write a research prospectus, use primary and secondary sources, and write a narrative literature review. ",
            "\u00a0This was my first course at Yale that really gave me an in-depth knowledge of how to go about conducting research, which says a lot about this class (and maybe a lot about the rest of my Yale experience, too). I gained a lot of the key tools of research that I haven't gotten elsewhere--how to submit an IRB, write a narrative literature review, think critically about research methodology, and, most importantly, brainstorm and grow a project based on a clear understanding of an answerable problem. All really, really critical skills that I wish I had gotten earlier. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me a better sense of what my Capstone project will be. I also learned about the IRB process and how to write a solid project prospectus. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to analyze primary sources, refine my research question, and fill out the IRB exemption form. I also learned about peer feedback. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about IRB / interviews / how to write a prospectus in general. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the components of a research paper and how to go about completing them (e.g. primary source analysis, lit review, introduction, etc.) ",
            "\u00a0this class would only be helpful to those in ed studies ",
            "\u00a0We talked a lot about how to conduct education-related research. ",
            "\u00a0We learned about research methodologies relevant to education and beyond - including how to develop a good research question, appropriate methodology, and how to write a literature review. We also got to learn through each others' experiences and help our classmates with their own projects. ",
            "\u00a0How to formulate a research topic and research question; how to go about the IRB process for social science research ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to refine my capstone project over several iterations with the help of Prof. Zemach-Bersin and the EDST advising team (Hersh, Debs, Horwitz). I gained practical knowledge of how to build an independent research proposal from scratch and formulate each component (e.g., narrative literature review, methodology). On top of that, this course is a test of will, persistence, and patience. The early stages of research are messy and nonlinear, and this class forces you to get comfortable navigating them. Fortunately, you have amazing mentors to guide you through the process. "

            "\u00a0Deadlines and instruction from Talya was very helpful and solidifying the capstone project. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: huge investment in our work from Talya and the mentors, reasonable structure of work that feels worthwhile and cumulative, giving us the tools to execute a successful project in the early spring. The decision to shift the focus this semester from reading and discussion to actual work on the capstone has been a godsend\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes lacking student investment? I'm not sure how to go about fixing this but there seems to be something lost from the cohort this year--folks dropping out, low attendance, etc. I get that Ed Studies is the thing that everyone does in addition to their major, but I think our class needed some kind of morale boost midway through the semester ",
            "\u00a0There were a lot of early deadlines that didn't seem to work for everyone. I personally found the early assignments helpful so I could nail down a topic I really wanted to spend a year thinking about. However, it seemed like there were a lot of people who went through these and still didn't have a clear project by the end of the semester. Having some early preliminary or exploratory data due in the first semester might be helpful (just having done one interview or survey etc. might help solidify theoretical plans early on). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: lots of structure and guidance, good to be in a class with peers who are passionate about the topic and able to provide clear feedback. Weaknesses: unclear expectations, inconsistent feedback, mismatch between professor and advisor. A lot of assignments assumed prior experience and/or the necessary background wasnt fully fleshed out in class (more like a cursory overview). ",
            "\u00a0This class is still in the process of being changed year to year. I think the fact that we didn't have any outside readings beyond our own capstone was great but feel like we were pressured to pick a capstone topic too early. This class is tough in general to teach / take because of the fact every student is in a different stage. How well this course goes entirely depends on who your primary mentor is and the feedback they give you (I had Talya and she was great) ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is that is brings together the entire Ed Studies senior cohort once a week - the opportunity to bounce ideas off each other and hear about each other's work was one I was very grateful for. I'm not sure how avoidable this weakness is, but I felt that the end of the semester became disorganized as everyone was at different places, which made it hard to get critical and timely feedback from Prof. Zemach-Bersin. ",
            "\u00a0a lot of deadlines! ",
            "\u00a0It's good to help students who have little experience with academic research and with seniors in the program who don't know what they want their capstone project to be. But for me, who already had both of these, it was pretty boring, monotonous, and not the most helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - TZB is a chill professor; lots of support from the ed studies faculty; workshopping groups. Weaknesses - the diversity of capstone projects is so broad that a lot of times going to class was honestly useless and pointless (for example, there were entire weeks spent on the IRB process and statistical analysis when a decent number of students would not be using either in their research). I remember halfway through the course we were all confused as to what was happening since everyone was on a different stage with their research and the topics in class were not necessarily aligned with our individual projects. Also another big weakness is that grading is VERY unclear - I'm pretty sure I did not receive any type of numerical grade for the class until the very end (so just one grade) ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: First and foremost, Prof. Zemach-Bersins research acumen and wisdom. She created a stellar arc with the course and left me feeling more capable and confident after almost every class. She consistently gave incisive feedback on my assignments that put into words everything I was trying to say and more. Another strength was the entire EDST advising teams dedication to our capstone projects and their effusive encouragement and reassurance. Their words of affirmation really came in handy during low points in the semester. I also enjoyed the opportunity to spend time with the EDST senior cohort.\r\nWeaknesses: There were one or two class periods that I felt lacked purpose and direction (there was one week we read two prospectuses from past years in class, even though we had already read several earlier in the semester), but then again we also had one free excused absence.\r\nImprovements: This might be too difficult for the EDST advising team to monitor with everything else on their plates, but it could be useful to make a regularly updated annotated bibliography a separate graded assignment. Many students were not disciplined about reading consistently throughout the semester when annotated bibliographies were no longer expected of us. Making it a larger portion of our grade could hold students accountable to not leaving the literature review until the last minute and actually doing the readings thoroughly rather than skimming them at the very end.

            "\u00a0YES! ",
            "\u00a0Obviously you're taking this class if you're an Ed Studies senior, so my advice would just be to stick with it! As rewarding as it is challenging! ",
            "\u00a0EDST advertises the capstone program as an opportunity to explore just about anything in education, but students interested in the EDST program should be told that the great majority of students actually end up writing literature reviews, not doing other types of projects. It often felt we were being pushed into doing projects that fit the syllabus of the course, rather than vice-versa. The syllabus should be more accommodating to the wide range of projects that students want to pursue. Because it was not, many of us felt we needed to change what we were doing for the project. ",
            "\u00a0You have to take it if you're in ed studies ",
            "\u00a0it was a helpful class ",
            "\u00a0Yes - this course is obviously required for all Education Studies scholars, but it is so worth it! I felt pretty ambivalent about taking the course and continuing with the Education Studies program, but this course (and really Professor Zemach-Bersin) made up for it. It is a unique experience to do original research in a structure environment, and benefit from one-on-one attention from brilliant professors who are invested in you and your work. ",
            "\u00a0I mean it's required, but if they transition to the Independent Study model I think that would be much better, because of the number of different types of projects students do for capstone ",
            "\u00a0Yes, all EDST seniors will benefit tremendously from this course. For most of you, this will be your first independent research experience. It turns out that designing and executing your own research project is much more complicated and involved than critiquing other peoples research, a skill that all Yalies hone in their normal classes. Its confusing to know where to begin and how to get back on track when you lose your footing, but Prof. Zemach-Bersin and your adviser will support you every step of the way. This class has made me a more constructive, creative, patient, prepared, and humble student, and it has deepened my respect for and appreciation of the research process. Plus, thanks to this course, I wont be scrambling during spring semester to find my bearings, as Ive already laid a solid foundation. ",
            "\u00a0It's required for ed studies seniors! \r\n\r\nPositives: it's clear that everybody involved really cares about the class improving. I think that this iteration, with the idea modules, was super helpful at getting us to think through multiple ideas. Workshopping was helpful. \r\n\r\nCould be improved:\r\nI think Prof Zemach-Bersin spent a lot of time at the beginning telling us all the things we couldn't choose as our projects - problems with empirical studies, interviews, working with people we know. I left a lot of the classes earlier in the semester super discouraged, and kind of dreading the whole process, since we had just been told that nothing we do would work. \r\n\r\nThe syllabus says open to all ideas, but I didn't really feel like the professors were. The format of the prospectus feels super rigid. Class is focused on the tools that Talya knows how to teach (interviews, narrative lit reviews). Prof ZB also makes the class and process seem tired and exhausting :( "
