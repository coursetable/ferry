            "\u00a0In Professor Brill's class I learned about the business and practice of journalism. I also learned about how to deal with a, at times, really challenging personality. I think Professor Brill considers his attitude part of his pedagogy, and I can definitely say my skin got thicker in his class, but it wasn't always pleasant, and there were times when I felt his schtick infringed on my ability to learn the content of the course. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about what it takes to be a successful journalist. Cut extraneous words from your writing. Show up and do the work. Pursue sources aggressively and give everyone implicated by your article ample opportunity to comment. ",
            "\u00a0Whether or not you've done journalism before, you will learn how to cover stories, design interviews, and cover the facts in innovative ways. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me to be a more careful, thorough journalist and challenged me to work harder and push myself further for each article I write. ",
            "\u00a0I learned some of the tricks of the journalism trade. For example: when you're writing an article, imagine the worst possible letter to the editor you'll receive because of that piece and defend yourself. Also, fact check, fact check, fact check. And generally, just work hard. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me how to better structure my stories and approach interviews in a different way. Professor Brill provides important tips on how to succeed in the world of journalism. He also does a solid job of discussing the business model of journalism and how to make money on the job. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I think this course could be strengthened by having more writing assignments and workshopping in class. For an advanced writing class, we did very little writing, just a profile of a classmate and then one long article. I think incorporating another serious and involved writing assignment in the middle of the semester would be a huge improvement. While I learned a lot in this class, I don't feel that my writing developed as much as I wanted it to or hoped it would in Professor Brill's class. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course: it is a rigorous introduction to reporting. Overall, its a very well-constructed and taught course, so my only criticisms are those listed below.\r\n\r\nThe weaknesses: Professor Brill believes that the ethics of reporting are as simple as having respect for your sources--definitely important, but sometimes I think this is more complicated than it seems. I wish that we considered ethical questions more seriously. For example, what about the skewed power imbalance if you're writing about someone from a disadvantaged group?\r\n\r\nI think a lot of members of my class had trouble coming up with story ideas that Brill thought were good enough (I sometimes did question his judgement and sometimes found that he flip-flopped on whether or not he thought an idea was good). Something that might help with this: Make us propose story ideas sooner. Devote more class time to discussing the proposed story ideas that students must come for class. I think pitching is one of the hardest parts of journalism, so I think that this could have helped us improve at this difficult task, and helped to make the class a bit more interactive--letting students talk with each other.\r\n\r\nI think that we should have spent more time talking about the assigned readings. They were all really interesting, and I think that our discussions only scratched the surface. What if we discussed more about the reporting process that led to each story, instead of just reading the final product?\r\n\r\nI think that we spent too much time on Bitter Pill. All of the other things that we read by Brill himself taught me much more than that book. Keep the one about the lawyer, the rubber room, and the healthcare piece for Time. Cut the Bitter Pill.\r\n\r\nI learned a lot from the profile and final project. I think that the plan for an interview with a hostile source was less helpful, but still relevant. The career planning assignment felt irrelevant, and the assignment in which we \"break\" a story in three news briefs on a day that Professor Brill chose felt forced. The news brief assignment would make a lot more sense if we got to choose the day that we \"broke\" the news, so that we could pick a day when something interesting was happening, rather than doing an assignment that feels like we're manufacturing news. ",
            "\u00a0This course is cool in that the journalism world is very connected - Steve Brill connected us with his friend Bob Woodward, he brought us to a journalism panel in NYC, and the journalism initiative hosted lunches with high-profile journalists. \r\n\r\nHowever:  the weekly readings and workload are insane, and they don't seem to add up to much. The first assignment, writing a profile on someone else in the class and interviewing 12 of their friends  is awkward. Woodward and Brill are frankly unkind, and caused a lot of stress and grief to people in the class. Brill's preference for legal/economic/political writing makes it difficult to sell stories on the finer things. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this course.  I learned a lot and felt really engaged with our readings, our class and our final assignment.  I found the profile assignment a bit stressful and think there should be more emphasis on not just searching for flaws in one's subject.  Reading more of Hiroshima and the other assigned texts could have been fun, but I plan to finish the books over break. ",
            "\u00a0This course is solid. If you're coming in expecting to become a better writer, don't. Stylistically, this class won't help you much. If you're coming in looking to become a better journalist, this class will give you some good pointers and get you thinking more like a pro. In terms of improvements, I'd just want to engage more with the readings and think more about the process of writing. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Brill is a great resource and has many connections in the industry. The class has interesting readings and you come out with a couple really solid writing samples. I really enjoyed my experience and learned a lot about how to be a successful journalist. The seminar can be a bit tense at times because Professor Brill is known to cold call on students, so you always feel like you need to come prepared. It's also on Monday's at 9am so that is not ideal. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend it but with several caveats. FIrst, be prepared to deal with Professor Brill, who can be a strong and difficult personality. Know that sometimes you need to take what he says with a grain of salt. He's also much ruder in emails than he is in person, at least most of the time. Second, the writing assignments are really what you make of them. Make sure you like your final article topicyou'll be sitting with it for close to half of the semester. Lastly, it's easy to take the class really seriously, really let it get to you and take over your life. Try to have a sense of humor about it, at least in the moments when you feel yourself becoming consumed. You'll be grateful for it later. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to any student who values independent thought or themselves. You learn not how to be a better writer, but instead how to cater absolutely to Professor Brill's whims, an activity that is as time consuming as it is soul crushing. ",
            "\u00a0\"Would you recommend this course to another student?\" This is a hard one for me to answer. I can't make this cost-benefit analysis for someone else, but I can provide some context on what to expect and advice for surviving the class. \r\n\r\nBrill says that he will get you a job. He does seem very well-connected in the industry, and I know other students who this has worked out for, but I haven't had success yet, even with his recommendation. There is, of course, still time, so hopefully this promise will prove true for me.\r\n\r\nBrill is incredibly harsh, and this course is a lot of emotional labor, in addition to also just being a lot of labor. Our class got emails from him telling us that our work was \"sloppy\" and \"pathetic.\" I sometimes dreaded whenever my email inbox pinged, wondering if it would be another devastating note from him. At the same time as he sends out these harsh emails, it's unclear to me how much he means the criticism? He commented to us as a group with a sort of apology, and told multiple students in one-on-one meetings that he only gave them such harsh comments on drafts to motivate them to work even harder--he didn't even fully mean it. So keep this in mind when you're receiving feedback from him and don't let emails scare you.\r\n\r\nYour final project will be incredible. You'll be intimidated into working incredibly hard, and Brill will provide lots of helpful feedback. He really does want you to succeed, and the devotion he puts into your final project shows this.\r\n\r\nYou will also learn a lot about journalism, and you will probably be scared into working so hard that you get an A. Not an easy A by any means, but still an A.\r\n\r\nHe cold calls in class, so you have to do all of the reading. \r\n\r\nFor Brill, if an assignment is due at midnight, turning it in at 12:01 is absolutely unacceptable, late, a failure. TURN THINGS IN ON TIME! ",
            "\u00a0You have to have a certain personality to take this class--aggressive, socially invasive, and insatiably curious about small details. Brill and Woodward are stuck in the old world of journalism, wearing suspenders, carrying around cigars, and ridiculing student work in an effort to help them rebuild. If you're someone who finds cold-calling and public shaming cruel and unusual, then this is not the class for you. But if you want to improve your journalism skills and you're 100% sure you can handle the heat, you'll have all the opportunity in the world with it. ",
            "\u00a0If you have any interest in journalism take this course!  You will improve as a writer and investigator, the readings are all interesting and you get to go on a fun New York field trip. Professor Brill has a reputation for being mean but this was not my experience at all.  He is harsh at times, but he seems to really care for his students and wants to see them succeed. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to learn some tricks of the trade, take this class. It's more focused on the actual trade of journalism than other classes. If you want to improve your writing style at the sentence by sentence level, take another creative non-fiction class. You will learn how to get rid of redundancies in this class, but it's definitely more about content than style. After taking this class, I write a bit more carefully than before, knowing that I can destroy my own career if I am not careful. \r\n\r\nBrill has a great network of journalists too, so this is a 5 star class if you can meet some of these people and learn from them/get a job. Brill also promises to get you a job if you tried in the class and need one, which is pretty incredible. He's a good person to have in your corner! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is definitely a class any students interested in journalism should take. Professor Brill is a great resource and has many years of experience in the business. It is a lot of work and you will be challenged, but your writing and interviewing skills will definitely improve. ",
            "\u00a0It's a good class if you are interested in learning about journalism (including the business side, digital journalism, interviewing and writing styles). It's also a requirement for the Journalism Initiative and I think most people who take the class in fall at least are going for that. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to learn to write, take another class. If you want to practice great reporting and learn more about the world of journalism as a whole, consider taking this class. I would recommend Brill's course to another student if and only if they can handle being told that their work is complete garbage. I found Brill amusing, but it seemed like a lot of other students found him demoralizing and/or obnoxious. Take him or leave him. Woodward seems nicer, but you'll learn different things from him I'm sure. "
