            "\u00a0I learned an incredible amount about Jamaican history and visual culture. In addition, I learned some useful frameworks and methodologies for writing about art and history with only a sparse supplementary record. ",
            "\u00a0I came into the course with a rather meagre amount of training / reading in postcolonial theory and issues of art and empire, so I really appreciated the chance to read key theoretical texts, as well as chapters from the book(s) (especially helpful in preparation for the trip). It was really nice having a sort of \"textbook\" (or almost encyclopedia) to follow and reference. I thought the structure of class time (into presentations, discussion, etc.) worked really well and I learned a lot from everyone's presentations. I was glad for the class meeting when Professor Cooke came in to give his lecture--it was incredibly helpful to get all of that information (especially before leaving on the trip). I also particularly enjoyed the days we spent at the YCBA actually seeing the materials--it was really helpful for the argument of the course about Jamaica's art history + the difficulties of preservation, decay, loss, etc. to actually be around the materials (and there are so many of them, surprisingly, at the YCBA). I really appreciated the ways the course nudged me to think more critically about the sort of heroic narrative we generally create/don't disrupt around (some) abolitionists--the class where we talked about Turner (among others) was particularly helpful for making me think through those preconceptions. I also, of course, really loved going to Jamaica and thought the experience was incredibly helpful for distilling many of the issues we had discussed in seminar, and really encouraged a different kind of \"looking\" and critical engagement than anything we could just get in a classroom. I am glad we had a chance to have a sort of roundtable discussion while we were in Jamaica, as I think it was really helpful for me to clarify to myself how I was feeling, but I suppose I would have also liked to get everyone's feedback on my paper ideas. Oh well--I can't have everything! "

            "\u00a0This course did an impressive job of introducing a complex topic. That said, more attention in class to grappling with the theoretical complexitiesand especially the readingsmight have helped. But it's almost petty to bring up, given the success of the texts and images chosen for the class and the interpretation both done and supported. ",

            "\u00a0Absolutely! It was a remarkably dense semester of material, presented with clarity. As much of a joy to take as it was a learning experiencebleak material handled with appropriate reverence but at no loss of academic rigor, and a broad range of interpretive options offered. ",
