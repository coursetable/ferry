It is at 9 am on science hill, but not once did I dread going-- I was always great start to the day. It's such a fun new skill to learn, and it would be hard to find an opportunity to ever get to do this outside of this context. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who has time in their schedule. It's a fantastic course to take your senior year to have an easier workload. But if you have the time your junior year, it would be a great course to take earlier, because you can use the glass shop after you take the course.  Even though there's no homework, it is a skill that requires a lot of practice so having time in your schedule to work outside of the class time is pretty essential if you want to improve at all. ",
            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY take it if you want to learn a new skill; Daryl and Preston are amazing and walk you through everything. Everyone always stayed after class ended to keep working because it was so enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Glassblowing is so unique from any other course I've taken at Yale. I highly recommend the course if you can get a spot. "
