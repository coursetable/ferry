            "\u00a0This provides a great foundational understanding of urban resilience. It gives students lots of exposure to how different cities and organizations across the globe are addressing urban resilience issues, and a great deal of insight into how 100 Resilient Cities engages with its cities. It provided a clear framework for students to think about urban challenges and some ideas for how to address these challenges. It also provided students with experience working in online global teams, which comes with its benefits and challenges. ",

            "\u00a0It met my expectations. I think I would have preferred more formal readings so that students could deepen their understanding of the issues outside of the classroom more fully. Some of the current readings felt very surface level and did not provide the depth I wished for. ",
            "\u00a0I expected the course to be survey-level but I would have liked to have gone deeper with a few case studies, instead of covering so many cities, issues, and having guest speakers almost every course. The most engaging part of this course was the city project. ",
            "\u00a0I don't think the presentations by the 100RC team were very helpful. I think it would have been more helpful to present many different urban resilience frameworks as opposed to a single framework. ",
            "\u00a0It exceeded it. I learned a lot from the practitioners and CROs. ",
            "\u00a0They mostly aligned, and though I found the units interesting, I thought the course could have gone deeper on a few topics. There was also some repetition between the different speakers who came in, and they could have been better coordinated to make sure they didn't discuss the same material (i.e. going back through the 100RC resilience framework so many times). "

            "\u00a0I found this course to be too broad with not enough depth. It felt like many of the presentations each week were fairly repetitive. They were largely sharing high level observations with not enough specificity. I think this course would benefit from a more thorough grounding in theory. ",
            "\u00a0A strength is that this course allows students from across the globe to learn from and interact with each other. Students come from a wide variety of backgrounds so it was very interesting to hear what other students thought about different aspects of the course. I think the best part of this class was the lectures from professionals in the field, whether in city government or other organizations. Hearing from people who are working on urban resilience on a daily basis was very interesting and informative. \r\n\r\nSome of the lectures/discussions felt a little bit disorganized or almost like they were thrown in as filler classes. Sometimes the discussions felt a bit forced, which may have been a result of the online nature of the class. I think we also heard the basic \"100 RC\" lecture a few too many times. I also think the class should not meet during holiday breaks or during the finals period. ",
            "\u00a0The client project with 100RC was a valuable and interesting experience, and probably where the bulk of my learning in this course came from. The guest speaker selection was great. You are exposed to many dimensions of resilience, and there isn't really time to go really in-depth into each, so it's more of an introduction - you could dive into the suggestion readings to go deeper. One weakness is that there are varying levels of commitment during the group project. ",
            "\u00a0I found it hard to stay engaged partially because of the online format but also because of the generality of the topics we covered. If we would have taken deeper dives into the material, I would have been more engaged. I felt like I got the most out of the city project. The guest lectures and reflections didn't offer me much because they went so fast and barely scratched the surface of the topics. But I guess with a class on resilience, in general, and not several aspects of resilience, it is hard to cover all topics in depth. The teaching team clearly put a lot of effort into having us stay engaged, which I appreciated. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is learning how to work in global virtual teams. The weakness of the course is that it is hard to really dig into the course material because the structure of the course was disjointed. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were in its diversity. It was great to see global sustainability issues from different perspectives. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - the class size was large. It was hard to hear from everyone or have questions answered. But, its size and diversity was also the strength, I would not change this. ",
            "\u00a0The main weakness of the course is unfortunately fundamental to it's design, which is that it all occurs online (since it is a GNAM course). This is necessary since the lead faculty is based in Vancouver, and students are around the world, and though I appreciated that component, I really thought a lot was lost by not physically gathering as a group, and having that in person face time with the professors each week. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- concepts of resilience as applicable to various urban challenges, instructors and support staff\r\n\r\nWeakness- Due to the online nature of instruction and duration of each class it is difficult to have all questions answered during the class. "

        [
            "\u00a0The online nature of this class can sometimes be frustrating, but it does provide a good basic understanding of the idea of urban resilience and really interesting case studies from around the world. The schedule can be annoying, because it currently meets during holidays and finals. However, if you are very interested in urban resilience or urban issues in general, it's a good class to take. ",
            "\u00a0Be honest with yourself about your learning style and whether it is a good match for this teaching format. Although I find the subject matter fascinating, I found it difficult to be very engaged with the skyping-in format. There is a lot of interesting material that you are exposed to, and the client project can be a great learning experience. Also note that this course does not follow the FES academic calendar - for example, class met the Tuesday of Thanksgiving break, and class meetings continued until the end of finals period. ",
            "\u00a0I wouldn't recommend this class. I think you can learn about issues of resilience in other courses in more depth. I think this course could be a half semester introduction to the aspects of resilience, or a full semester with a larger project component and fewer guest speakers/discussion. ",
            "\u00a0The scope of the final project seemed really broad. But after discussions with the chief resilience officer, the scope of the project narrowed a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Final project may appear to be challenging due to time constraints. Due to the global nature of the course, scheduling team meetings for group projects were difficult i.e. co-ordination between students from different time zones "
