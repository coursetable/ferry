I also gained many insights about niche or even 'taboo' topics from experts in the field! ",
            "\u00a0Developed an understanding of current ethical issues in biomedical research, and appropriate methods to handle such concerns. ",

            "\u00a0I thought this course was great, but I noticed that some of my classmates were reluctant to share their ideas in front of the visiting professors.  I wonder if the professors could join only for the second half of the class, or some other arrangement, so that all of the students can build confidence discussing the topic of the day first. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - very appropriate course load for a pass/fail class. Loved the rotating professors and the topics selected were very appropriate for our level. I enjoyed learning in a style that was primarily discussion- and activity-based.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Small detail, but for group activities within the course it might have been nice to be forced to form groups with different members of our cohort each time to be able to hear more specifically from a range of perspectives. ",
            "\u00a0A major strength of the course was the presence of faculty members, who provided wisdom and experience to the discussion. Another strength which overcame a weakness was that if we were dissatisfied with the day's discussion, we could always talk to a TA about it. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course was in some of the better discussion and some excellent faculty guests who really had expertise. The course was less successful when discussion seemed to not really be generated or when students felt unsure about sharing their opinions with some of the faculty guests. ",
