            "\u00a0I learned so much about the genre of tragedy and also about so many different incredible works of literature. All of the plays we read were very well-known, but I learned so many different fresh views and facts about them it made them very new and interesting. I learned how to close read some somewhat difficult texts, think about what the genre of tragedy means and how it changed over time, and why these works are so important in the European tradition. ",
            "\u00a0I really gained an appreciation for plays. I hadnt read that many before, so reading several all together helped me understand the interactions between author, text, director, and actor can shape a story. ",
            "\u00a0Generally, I gained an idea of tragedy: of tragedys ambiguities around cause and effect, of its arcs of misfortune, and of its complex interplay of society, the individual, and the divine (or metaphysical).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, in reading works of tragedy arranged chronologically I was able to see how literary themes develop from one era to the next.\r\n\r\nIn both the papers and the class meetings, I continued strengthening my ability to invent WORTHWHILE arguments and argue persuasively. ",
            "\u00a0I developed great insights about the genre of tragedy as a whole, the skills to effectively evaluate and analyze works throughout the entire canon of tragedy, from Homeric Greece all the way to modern Western Tragedy. ",
            "\u00a0How to write a confidently written close reading essay of a literary text. Beyond this, I've walked away with a better understanding of those works which have informed the Western canon. Studying tragedy across various generations provides lots of insight into what has been occupying the minds of writers for generations, including notions of justice, love, revenge, and redemption. This is a course that grapples with lots of questions and I feel all the better for trying to answer them. "

        [
            "\u00a0The course is really great in that the syllabus is set up really well. All of the works lead well into one another as in the transitions are great. Even if it seems like the works are unrelated they somehow enlighten things about each other in a really interesting way. I love that the course is very small and is discussion based. Also the amount of reading wasn't too heavy which was very nice. ",
            "\u00a0Katja was a fantastic guide to this as she provided valuable context for each work. As much as I enjoyed reading a good collection of texts, I did think that the discussions of the texts were a little rushed, especially with regard to the classical drama texts. ",
            "\u00a0I felt the course was challenging; like we read quite a lot of fairly difficult (but important!) works; and that we wrote a good number of papers with VERY thought-provoking, deep subjects and prompts.\r\n\r\nHowever, I never felt the course presented an unmanageable amount of work (or that the amount of work was ever unreasonable compared to that asked by other classes).\r\n\r\nAs I was able to see how literary themes develop from one era to the next (something a class had never allowed me to do, through my own readings, before), I think the fact this course is a survey is one of its greatest strengths.\r\n\r\nAs someone who appreciated the inclusion of so many plays (not having read many works of drama before, or thought about the additional layers of import present in them), I dont feel more non-play works need to be added to the curriculum. ",
            "\u00a0The curriculum for the course was very well designed and very effective. Overall a very effective class. Great instruction. ",
            "\u00a0This course's strengths include the fascinating seminar discussions as well as the incredibly interesting readings we completed over the semester. As for weaknesses, the English department could make a more concerted effort to include works from more diverse perspective for this class, especially with regards to the unit on modern drama. ",
            "\u00a0The material was fascinating and class discussions were lively. However, the structure of class periods and assignments was rather repetitive. ",
            "\u00a0The two plays we read by a white woman and then an African man (as opposed to all the other plays by white men) were the most complex works we read the whole semester. They were great. I can't imagine not reading them, even though it could have been that way. I wish there had been more diversity along the whole semester, but then again it's such a long tradition to cram into one semester that it's difficult. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It's definitely been one of my favorites at Yale in that the works are just so different yet incredibly written with very interesting ideas. Working through these plays with the other students and the professor is really just a great experience. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it if I knew the student was already interested in reading the texts. I liked it because I got to read plays that I otherwise might never have read, so the class gave me a good structure for pursuing this. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely would recommend this course to another student, if theyre at all interested in literature.\r\n\r\nThe survey aspect is great, and the instructor is phenomenal.\r\nI have just two pieces of advice for them:\r\n1.\tThey should definitely look into buying their books from someone whos already taken the class. Its not only cheaper but EASIER (it isnt difficult to verify that theyre buying the correct editions)\r\n2.\tThey should definitely try to spend some time in Katjas office hours, on weeks when papers ARENT impending. She offers great advice and a valuable viewpoint one-on-one. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I cannot recommend this course enough. It is undoubtedly a class with a heavier workload than most, but the readings were extremely engaging, thought provoking, and the instruction made it well worth the reading. ",
            "\u00a0I really recommend taking this course. Even if English isn't your favorite subject, the seminar discussions are superb and your writing will improve exponentially. Professor Lindskog is a caring, helpful teacher who gives you all the support you need to flourish in this class. ",
            "\u00a0Anyone with a strong interest in drama/literature should consider this course. "
