I definitely learned a lot about introductory linguistics, but many of the most significant take ways regarded how linguistics relates to studies of inequality, discrimination, stereotypes, etc. The professor really emphasized dissuading misconceptions about the illegitimacy or non-standard vernaculars and dialects.

            "\u00a0Strengths: The class does allow for very interesting discussions and benefits largely from having a set of students who speak a diverse variety of languages. The class itself is extremely manageable in terms of workload.  \r\n\r\nWhile the class is branded as illusions of language, much of the class is essentially an introduction to linguistics. As someone who was interested in the sociolinguistics side of the course, I was slightly disappointed on what I perceived to be the excessive amount of time studying phonology and morphology. \r\nMany students entered the class thinking it would be a \"gut\", leading to the class environment and structure reflecting such a perception. The first four homework assignments were not extremely engaging. I would recommend spending more time on the issues that drew student interest. I would also recommend eliminating section or making it optional. ",
            "\u00a0The course doesn't seem to be very well structured. Although it was designed to be a first-year seminar, it ended up being a lecture. Professor Kotek would often times digress into very niche topics to try to foster discussion but it just made it harder to advance through the material. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The instructors are all very passionate, dedicated, and qualified. The expectations of this course are clear.\r\nWeakness: After spring break, the coursework seemed a bit tenuous; it would have been more helpful if the material covered in class was more relevant to our assessments (blog posts) after the midterm. Given that we had a lot of choice with what to write about, the class material was sometimes helpful, but not necessarily. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very fun and full of interesting visuals and examples. I thought that the material was sometimes a little more than what an intro course demands, but it was still interesting and I had a good time in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The material was very interesting, it was well taught, the assignments were not too demanding but were still very engaging. I particularly enjoyed the second half of the course (the blog posts, presentations, essays and overall the topics more related to sociolinguistics). \r\n\r\nI don't think section should be required for this class though. It mainly served the same purpose as office hours. ",
            "\u00a0I wish that students would stop interrupting Hadas with questions. A lot of times, the questions did not really help me gain a better understanding, especially when I think what she has to say is a lot more interesting. Otherwise, I love how the course went through such breadth. I only wish I could learn more about such a large field. ",
            "\u00a0The course was relatively free-form in structure, which was both a strength and a weakness. It was nice to be able to ask questions and have discussions without feeling pressured to rush through anything, but this also meant that it was difficult to know what material was important or relevant to our assignments. While it was nice to be able to talk about what we wanted to talk about, I think there was a lot of confusion about the expectations of the work in this class. That being said, the course material is definitely a strength, in that you get to learn about things you do every day without even knowing, and you get to learn about the social influence of linguistics. ",
            "\u00a0I feel the grading was fair on the assignments; however if I had gotten feedback on each one earlier, I would have been able to improve for future assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: breadth of material, students are given the freedom to research/write about what interests them, grace days\r\nWeaknesses: student questions during lecture were excessive and took us off track a lot of the time, grading took too long ",
            "\u00a0This course presented information and materials in a way that was very interesting. Many students, including myself, enjoyed the lecture because of its engaging nature. However, at times, discussions got lengthy because many students asked questions, and the organization and structure of the lecture were somewhat compromised. ",
            "\u00a0An essay preceding the final would have been great and more prompt grading would've made the course a lot easier to understand. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were definitely the notes. They were well written, easy to understand, and useful in figuring out how to write the problem sets. Furthermore, the professor and TAs seemed to be well-mannered, kind people with good intentions. \r\n\r\nThat being said, as for weaknesses of the course, there were multiple. Ill name them here. \r\n\r\nOne, the class is flexible, but incredibly disorganized. The grades for our problem sets werent released until near the end of the semester, and we were never told explicitly how the class would be curved nor how well we were doing relative to the rest of the class. \r\n\r\nTwo, the lectures were unengaging. Not only did they simply reiterate what was already stated in the notes, but they often went off into long, not very pertinent tangents that were confusing as to what were the important takeaways. The professors lecturing tone, furthermore, was far from a dynamic tone of voice, and often went way too slowly for concepts which were very straightforward. There werent enough engaging participation tricks as were promised, and humor/polls/the like were grossly lacking. One of the most frustrating things was how we wasted time; on the last day, when presentations finished early, we had to wait for 20 minutes and watch completely unrelated YouTube videos instead of being released early.\r\n\r\nThree, the TAs were not helpful. Not only were they vague in explaining what exactly we needed help on in psets, but their feedback often failed to directly answer the questions we had in mind, pulling in tangential information that is unnecessary. \r\n\r\nOverall, there were more faults, but I believe Ive given an overview of the major ones, and what needs to be fixed for future iterations of this course. ",
            "\u00a0The course is well organized and the instructors take time to explain each concept in detail, giving time for students to engage with the material and ask their own questions, as well as lead the discussion in-part. However, this is also a weakness in the course. At times, the discussion was took too much time on certain points and got off-topic. Students would sometimes get stuck on their own personal linguistic experiences and the instructors would not remind them that individual experiences could vary regionally and locally. ",
            "\u00a0would be better in a seminar style or in a shorter lecture ",
            "\u00a0One strength of the course was how it was structured to first give a basic knowledge of linguistic tools of analysis and then gave the students to apply these skills to areas of linguistics that interested them. Although the breadth of knowledge and student participation was definitely enjoyable, I think the course could benefit from a little bit more of professor-guided lecture and explanation of fundamental linguistic concepts. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: great professor and TAs, fun content, great intro linguistics course \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: could be taught at a quicker pace; it goes pretty slowly ",
            "\u00a0Does not assume any knowledge of linguistics.  You get to just go be curious about language. ",
            "\u00a0This course was easily accessible and a great intro course to linguistics, both in the sense of basic linguistics knowledge and the sense of engaging new students to the discipline. "

        [
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student looking for a semi-interesting gut. For someone who had somewhat of a background in linguistics, this class was not extremely eye-opening, at least within the first half of the semester. The discussion we had in class, particularly in the classes after spring break, were extremely insightful. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student who's interested in taking an intro to linguistics course, but would like a more interactive experience than a regular lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only as long as you know what you're in for. It's pretty easy to do well in this course if you pay attention in lecture, attend Office hours to supplement what you don't know, and complete homework assignments on time. The TA's and prof are very passionate about teaching and working with students, and it's clear they care about your success.\r\nI wouldn't describe this class as one that is designed to revolutionize your ways of thinking. This course is called the Illusions of Language for a reason; It's really just focused on giving you a framework to avoid psychological biases resulting from a lack of linguistics knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0Yess ",
            "\u00a0Probably only if you really enjoy linguistics. It moved pretty slowly through topics that were not all that interesting. The first and last weeks were fun but in between it got a little dry. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone looking for a fun, low-stress class that will help you learn a lot about language and society as a whole. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course to students interested in sociolinguistics; however, I would caution them that the course technical especially at the beginning. Getting through the introductory concepts (morphology, phonology, etc.) might be a bit tedious at times if the students are not really interested in the subject matter. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course to get your feet wet with linguistics, and it will leave you yearning to learn more. It will also force you to notice all the intricacies that happen with language in your daily life. Not having a test was really great, because it was easy to just focus on learning the material without the stress of wondering if something is going to be tested. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to someone who is interested in linguistics. As someone who was only mildly interested, I found it fascinating to have linguistic phenomena pointed out to me, but I found it dry when learning about the mechanics behind them. The workload is light, and Hadas is a kind professor, but it can be easy to disengage from the material. ",
            "\u00a0Only if theyre pretty certain that they have an interest in linguistics (as in this shouldnt be someones point of entry into linguistics). ",
            "\u00a0yes, you are introduced to a broad range of concepts in linguistics while also getting to focus on the ones you like best on assignments ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in linguistics but never had a chance to receive formal training or education in the field. It is a great introductory course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It was a really fun introduction to linguistics but I would caution them to be sure to go to section and perhaps even office hours because there are problems on the psets that cannot be completed purely by going to lecture. ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend this class to a student who is looking for a gut, rather than an engaging class. I feel that illusions of language is the type of class where you dont put in any work, but you dont learn much as a result. It feels like a waste of time. The faults of this course, including the unengaging lectures that wandered off into tangents, the lack of communication regarding how students were performing relative to others in the course, and the indirect, nonhelpful work of the TAs lead me to vehemently not recommend this course to another student. \r\n\r\nA few other lowlights include the lack of guidance on psets, as the TAs were not helpful in offering advice on how to do them, and the confusion of the presentation   with whether or not it counted as a blog post. The grading system was disorganized, as we didnt receive problem set grades until near the end of the semester. The only metric we had that told us how well we were doing was Canvas system that told us the distribution. The paper was also confusing, as 1) the deadline for the paper was never explicitly stated 2) the way we had to write it was never explicitly outlined. Yes, the past papers we were given helped, but I would have much preferred to have a more detailed outline on what was expected.\r\n\r\nI cannot say this is entirely the fault of the teachers, as it was designed to be an engaging, interactive seminar for around 20 people. However, given the unexpected uptick in demand at the beginning of the year, there ended up being over 40+ people in the class, since freshmen and sophomores were guaranteed spots, and as a result, the course turned into a lecture being taught as if it was a seminar. This led to a rampant lack of class participation, as the discussions were hard to lead with such a numerous amount of people. Furthermore, as it was still being taught as a seminar, the discussions often went into tangents that made it impossible to want to listen. Indeed, people in the back of the classroom were not paying attention, while the same few continued to participate in class. And its not hard to see why, as everything that we talked about in lecture seemed to be exactly what was stated in the notes, such that doing the psets didnt require even going to lecture. I expected an engaging, interactive class, and while some parts were fun, like with the McGurk Effect and other nitpicks, overall it was antithetical to what it had promised. \r\n\r\nIn order for me to recommend this class to another student, it needs to be restructured for either a lecture format, with far less tangents, or restrict the number of kids who can take it. Until then, do not take this class unless you desperately need to fulfill a distributional requirement. I came in a prospective linguistics major and came out knowing I dont want to take another linguistics class at Yale again. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This is a fun and engaging class, somewhere between a seminar and a lecture most days.  You're sure to learn a lot and change your perspective on language as a whole, plus get a good introduction to all fields of linguistics if you want to continue. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It is a great way to balance out a heavy workload with an interesting, relatable subject that has practical applications later in life. It sparked my interest in relearning my native language and has helped me to see the differences and similarities between languages. ",
            "\u00a0yes if they are interested in linguistics and want a fairly easy class ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to someone who is interested in linguistics and wants to take a class that will introduce them to the field and allow them to discover what linguistic topics they find interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yep. Fun class, dont treat it like a gut but its one of the closest courses to a gut that you will get at Yale, great professors and TAs, and great intro course material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It is interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to students of any year wondering if they could be interested in linguistics. I was even disappointed, as a graduating senior, that it was too late for me to take more classes at Yale in linguistics, but I still do recommend it to seniors as one other engaging class in their schedule. Hadas Kotek and her TA team ease students into basic linguistics knowledge and make it very easy to expand where interested, whether on your own time by examining the people around you or by continuing your studies in the department or by some other method.
