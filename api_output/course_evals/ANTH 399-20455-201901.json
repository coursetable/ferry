            "\u00a0I learned how to use anthropological concepts to analyze other cultures' interpretations and understandings of space. ",
            "\u00a0I had never taken an anthropology class before, so this opened my eyes to a lot of topics in that field. Also, I feel that I came away from the class perhaps a bit more jaded about outer space, but certainly more thoughtful about it, particularly what it means on a cultural level. ",
            "\u00a0Understanding the various ways in which humans perceive and interact with outer space ",
            "\u00a0Learned about ethnography and other anthropological techniques; also learned about how anthropology relates to space. ",
            "\u00a0This course was an awesome introduction to anthropology through the lens out outer space. Taking this course gave me insights about how anthropologists think, as well as challenging some of my beliefs about nature and culture and the existence of human nature. In the final project, I got to dive deep into an aspect of \"Martian\" culture, learning a lot about a specific topic but also applying the anthropological principles I had learned. ",
            "\u00a0Ethnography, reading anthropology texts, understanding humans relationship to outer space ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the history of space as seen from different cultures (ancient Native American mythologies up through the Space Race of the 60s to present day and even thinking about the future, as well as how gender and race affect these thoughts). I also learned what their observations said about different people groups themselves and also a lot of the anthropological basics that these ways of thinking were grounded in. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a familiarity with anthropological writing/reading, as well as how to analyze how we relate to space from an anthropological perspective. ",
            "\u00a0In this class, we looked at a breadth of different topics like sci-fi, paintings, movies, linguistics, and museum curation. Every unit taught me how to look at these topics in a new and more informed/educated way. I now appreciate museums much more, pay more attention to how women are portrayed in sci fi, and more. ",
            "\u00a0This course broadened my view of who space impacts and how it does so. I gained insight into the diverse narratives surrounding space exploration. ",
            "\u00a0We learned about how different cultures view outer space and how that impacts different outer space concepts. "

            "\u00a0I really liked the format, although it was kind of an awkwardly large class size to do discussion/seminar-like questions in class-- it felt like fairly often we were only hearing the same opinions from the same people every time. I think I would have preferred either just a lecture, or a smaller class with more thoughtful debates/discussions. But I do get that the class was an awkward size for either of those options, and I'm super thankful that Professor Messeri did ont cap the class. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures in this course were generally interesting, but the readings were often hardly discussed in class. Since many of the readings were also difficult to grasp due to their density, it would have been nice to have either in depth discussion of them or to have shorter/easier readings assigned. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: really engaging and interesting, well thought out and well taught, a good overview. I was going to list the diversity of the class as a weakness but actually I think it's a strength, especially in the world building and final project stages of the course.\r\nWeaknesses: I guess the amount and density of reading could be kind of inconsistent? I'm sort of nitpicking because I don't have major weaknesses to complain about! ",
            "\u00a0I liked the diversity of topics that we covered, but I wish there could have been a little more structure, and maybe something tying the whole semester together. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Really interesting readings, class discussions, and the final project was so much fun! All the work we did felt meaningful and I learned a lot throughout the semester and in creating the final project. \r\nWeaknesses: It would have been helpful to have more guidance for some of the readings so that I could get the most out of them ",
            "\u00a0Lectures are fantastic, reading is manageable, and assignments are fairly graded. I don't know if I would change anything. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course are how interesting the material is, how passionate Prof. Messeri is about that material, and the engaging final project. One of the weaknesses of the course was that it probably would have been more engaging as a smaller class (though that's nobody's fault.) ",
            "\u00a0This class is very engaging, and Professor Messeri is great! This class covered a lot of topics that spoke to my heart, like exoplanets and Mars colonization. The readings were interesting, and I can't think of too many weaknesses for this class. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Messeri makes this class amazing. The class is very structured, as it is broken down into 4 units, and it was taught in a hybrid manner so that people who like lectures and people who like seminars are both happy. All of the readings are very interesting and play some sort of role in our class discussion. Everyone feels like they can participate in class because of the way the professor responds to students' ideas. "

            "\u00a0Yes, this course was attended by many people who had never taken anthropology or were STEAM majors taking it for a Humanities credit and they had a great time taking it. The course is very accessible for people of all disciplines and should be taken by anyone with an interest in space and its significance in culture. ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely! Especially if the final project stays as great as it was this year :) ",

            "\u00a0Absolutely take this course! It will be some of the most exciting, least drudgery-like work you do at Yale, especially the world building and final project at the end of the course. Every lecture was well thought out and although the class is technically a lecture, it frequently felt more like a seminar. You have to be motivated to do the reading and participate, but if you do, it's really interesting and worthwhile. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course for those who are interested in space and humanity's interest in space. However, I would not recommend this course to those who are looking for a rigorous anthropological exploration of non-human domains of being. This course is taught more for students without an anthropology background. ",
            "\u00a0YES ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The class lies at a very interesting intersection of science and anthropology. The content was engaging and the class was low-stress. Professor Messeri is a wonderful teacher. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely would recommend this course. It's fascinating learning about space from a more human-based point of view. Our course was laid out so that we had 4 reading responses, a midterm paper, and a final project and paper. Other than that, all readings were extremely manageable and Professor Messeri is an incredible lecturer. If you're looking for a 5th credit or a fun class to add to your schedule, definitely take this. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you're interested in the intersection of anthropology and space. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course! It is so fun, especially if you're a lover of sci-fi and outer space. As a STEM major, it was just a cool outlet to talk about all the warm and fuzzy reasons I love space. Definitely one of the most fun classes I've taken at Yale! The final project was a blast as well. ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely! Very cool blend of concepts and I learned about interesting idea that I'll continue to ponder for years. ",
            "\u00a0I would 100% recommend this course to other students regardless of major because I think there's an area of interest for everyone touched on. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! This class changed my perspective on many things, including outer space, art, culture, and humanity. Definitely take this class if Professor Messeri is teaching it! "
