            "\u00a0This class covered major themes and events in Asian American history, and did a great job delving into nuances even though it was very much an overview. Beyond the substance of the class, I learned how to think critically about the primary sources we were looking at, and how to conduct my own oral history based on others we read. I learned that while the moniker \"Asian American\" is very much a monolith, the diverse experiences and histories of the people it describes are anything but. Learning about migration histories, court cases and the evolution of public opinion and discrimination (from things like legal exclusion to housing and resource) was fascinating, and I think has equipped me to better make sense of the stereotypes and stories I hear about Asian Americans in the media and popular culture. ",
            "\u00a0I certainly developed the skills of re-thinking conventional American history lessons I had learned prior to taking this class, and I learned much more about the history of immigration, particularly of Asian immigrants, to the United States. I also learned so much about the varying experiences of Asian Americans within the United States, and how other elements of history affected their feelings of being included or excluded in America. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of facts about Asian American history as well as how to think critically about the way we are taught Asian American history/shown Asian American culture. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about Asian American history and the overarching processes of racial formation. ",
            "\u00a0This course covered (as obviously described) a wide breadth of Asian American history from the Spanish Galleon trade to present day (early 2000s) Asian American history. It was really neat to learn about the racialization process that many Asian American groups faced, and it was neat to learn about the kinds of obstacles that Asians have faced outside of the usual narrative which is fairly limited to things like Japanese internment and the Chinese Exclusion Act. Rather, we talked about many topics, and we compared the experiences of groups like Filipino vs. Korean vs. Japanese vs. Japanese Americans. For instance, we talked about the impact of the Vietnam War and how it led to Vietnamese refugee migration. We also discussed professional migration during the 1960s which led to the \"model minority\" myth. This was a really wide encompassing course that covered a ton of Asian American history. ",
            "\u00a0Histories of immigration of many different Asian ethnicities, laws and cases relating to Asian Americans, how politics and economy affected Asians and their status. SO many things - you will get a very good and insightful overview/analysis of Asian American history ",
            "\u00a0It's remarkable how little I knew about Asian-American history, which constitutes my own heritage. This class gave me a new foundation to understand that history. ",
            "\u00a0A greater understanding of what it means to be Asian American today, through a historian's lens, analyzing migration patterns, community formation, and legal processes.  Also a greater understanding of Asian identity and my own identity now. ",
            "\u00a0This was the best class that I've taken in my Yale career. As an Asian American, I learned about my history that had been erased in my high school's history curriculum. The class covers Asian American history beginning from the time of Magellan and the Manila-Acapulco trade all the way until the 1990 Immigration Act and Katrina's impact on the Vietnamese community in New Orleans. The course is very comprehensive, and covers the history of Asian countries like China, Japan, Korea, India, the Philippines, Vietnam, etc. as is relevant to their migrations. For example, it's important to understand a bit of Chinese history to understand why so many Chinese immigrants come from Guangzhou, whereas that sort of concentration isn't seen in other Asian countries. Professor Lui is also very inclusive -- this class doesn't just cover East Asian immigration, as you'll find in a lot of other schools' Asian American courses. \r\n\r\nMy largest insight coming out of this course is that discrimination against Asian Americans throughout history has been lost, and needs to be reclaimed. Chinese people, for instance, were the first illegal immigrants to this country, and anti-Asian riots that burned and killed groups of Chinese laborers because white laborers feared that their jobs were being taken away very much resemble the narrative against Latinx communities today. The way that Asian Americans were treated (until selective immigration during the Cold War to bring in STEM-focused professionals to give the US an edge against Russia) should not be forgotten. It reminds us that it is our community's role to fight alongside other communities, rather than allowing ourselves to be used as a wedge against them. ",
            "\u00a0This course was undoubtedly one of the most formative experiences in my Yale academic career. Although I had a fair amount of background in Asian American history, I learned so much from this class and increased my knowledge tremendously. Those who had less background probably felt the same, but even more so. The lessons from this course are so relevant to my daily life and lived experiences as an Asian American, allowing me to reclaim my identity and history for myself within an institution and nation that has historically preferred and promoted whiteness (and continues to struggle with these lasting legacies of racism). At the same time, I have also learned to think critically of myself and the ways I have bought into and continued to promote ideas, narratives, and social structures that disadvantage others. \r\n\r\nAcademically, I learned so much from this course and feel well prepared to dive into any other aspects of Asian American history and more broadly histories of other marginalized groups in more depth. I definitely learned a lot about how to think and write historically from my TFs through section and writing assignments. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the history of immigration, citizenship, geography, and legislation for Asian American. I also developed research and analytical skills. ",
            "\u00a0I learned not only about the history of Asian Americans (something that is always glossed over in history textbooks), but also new ways of thinking about what it means to be Asian American. This course is foundational in understanding Asian America and has given me the confidence to pursue other classes relating to Asian American studies and ethnic studies. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the material of Asian American history as well as a new lens to research history. ",
            "\u00a0A good overview of Asian American history from many different angles (economic, social, cultural, etc.); lots of good & diverse primary sources and secondary sources. Learned how to write historical analyses and read historical texts. ",
            "\u00a0This course covered aspects of American history that are rarely covered in depth, and provided exposure to interesting narratives, worthy of our study. This class was one of a kind, and helped developed skills in historical analysis, cultural criticism of sorts, and considering varying points of view. ",
            "\u00a0A comprehensive view of Asian American history, including immigration patterns, examining different ethnic groups, policies. Developed a critical lens for analyzing how Asian Americans are presented in the media. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think historically, through a critical and historical framework. The various papers that we wrote throughout the semester definitely facilitated this, as we were expected to situate many of the documents/questions in the context of history. ",
            "\u00a0As Professor Lui said the first day of class, this course supplemented what AP US History didn't teach me. It is often the easiest option to generalize broad groups of people into simplified histories. This course, however, taught me to look into the nuances of how events affected everyone, not just the majority group. This required significant investigation of primary texts, documents, and cases that are often overlooked through our broader American history. Taking this class in my first year of college really helped to develop my skills as a researcher and student; I learned not to generalize history and, instead, became fascinated with studying how deeply individual the Asian experience in America is. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a deeper understanding of migration patterns, immigration policies, and community formation for Asian and Asian Americans since the 1800s. I was also able to better contextualize a lot of historical events and policies that I had previously viewed in isolation. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to effectively incorporate historical analysis into history writing. ",
            "\u00a0I got a survey look into Asian American history and learned to contextualize broad events through smaller frameworks. ",
            "\u00a0A thorough understanding of the migration of Asians to America and their experience in America throughout the last few centuries to the present. Also a complex understanding of the racial formation of the Asian American and its legacies still seen today. ",
            "\u00a0This has been the most perspective-realigning class I've taken in my four years at Yale. I initially took this class to feel more connected to my heritage, and I walked away having learned an incredible amount about not just Chinese immigration, but also the social and economic legacies of legal exclusion; the complex forces that contribute to community formation and cultural representation; and how to recognize agency and resistance within the broader framework of racial formation. I found almost every lecture to be simultaneously enlightening, surprising, and sobering, and the things we learned were relevant to so many conversations I had this semester. I know I'll come back to what I learned over and over again in the future as I consider questions about race relations in the U.S. and political resistance in the face of adversity. ",
            "\u00a0A good broad overview of the development of Asian American history, although with a focus mostly on Chinese American history ",
            "\u00a0I learned some very cool things in this course: the history of Asian immigration to the US, the interrelations and differences between different Asian groups, how the US's (especially certain regions, like California and Hawaii) relationship with immigrants and especially with Asian Americans changed throughout the decades, how Asian immigrants navigated a black-white racial binary, how the immigration system was built. Skills-wise, I got advice on how to write a primary source paper (a necessary skill for any history major and a very useful one for other humanities people) and we did an oral history, which we could have maybe gotten some more guidance on, but nonetheless was an interesting and worthwhile assignment. I definitely feel like I'm walking away from this course with a lot of new knowledge, which is especially great for me as someone who is not Asian American but is involved in cultural stuff on campus and passionate about racial justice and immigration. ",
            "\u00a0This class gives a broad view of not just key facts about Asian American history, but key themes that have defined and continue to define the Asian American experience in the United States. Understanding the racialization, violence, discrimination, and exclusion that Asian Americans have faced is a crucial, often overlooked, component of American history. ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge of the deep history behind Asian immigration to the US and the development of Asian American communities since the 1800s ",
            "\u00a0Critical thinking, how to analyze primary sources, how to conduct an oral interview and use secondary sources to create a narrative. ",
            "\u00a0Really came to evaluate how history is taught in America and how Asian American history is often left out or greatly simplified. Because this was a survey course, it didn't go super in depth into any one thing, as it's the only Asian American studies course being offered this term. ",
            "\u00a0It was important for me to learn or think about history from an Asian American perspective -- or from any minority perspective. Taking this class made me interrogate the ways we document history -- deciding whose narratives are showcased or ignored -- and allowed me to think more critically about race, gender, and class in the US. It also improved my academic writing and reading abilities. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the way the model minority was constructed and how it gets updated through the decades. I learned how to take oral histories and about the ethics of editing those histories ",
            "\u00a0I learned about aspects of Asian American history which affected a variety of different Asian ethnic groups over time in the United States. The course went beyond what we may have learned in a general American history class, covering the historical events in Asian nations that drove the formation of Asian America and going in depth about the long history of anti-Asian discrimination and legislation in the United States. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about an array of topics related to Asian American history. Starting in the 1800s, we learned about Jeffersonian Republicanism and coolie laborers contracted to replace the end of slavery. We learned about the racialization of Chinese immigrants through yellowface and embodied racial performances. We studied Japanese internment in the context of WWII. And, we ended by exploring urban and suburban Asian communities in the modern day. ",
            "\u00a0Learned more about Asian American history and how to construct a historical paper ",
            "\u00a0You learn about Asian American history from the 19th century to present, and how Asian Americans have been agents in shaping American history. You learn so many things, like details about Japanese Internment and the Vietnam war that are very much glossed over in US history classes. Also, you get to learn new ways to think about Asian American-ness in the United States, like why the model minority narrative is a faulty. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to approach different types of primary and secondary sources from a historical point of view, pushing me to think about the purpose of this source as a mode of understanding history. I also learned how different events have contributed to an overall story about Asian American history. Overall, I've learned about Asian American history in ways that I'm certain no other class would otherwise have informed me of. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about Asian American experience that was severely lacking in my high school experience. I think this was a great introductory history course and talked about a broad range of topics with many underlying themes. I learned a lot about how immigration laws and other historical events affected the dynamics of class, gender, and of course race in Asian stereotypes, perceptions, and identity. ",
            "\u00a0This course ambitiously tried to cover as much of Asian American history as possible, starting from the first waves of Asian immigrants in the 1800s and ending in recent patterns of migration in the 21st century. We learned a great deal of history that is often left out of US history textbooks and know have a better understanding of the racial formation of Asians in America. ",
            "\u00a0My understanding of US history has expanded tremendously. By learning the role Asians played in shaping the America we know today, I've been able to really place modern conversations about race and inequality into context. As my first proper history class, I've also gained the critical thinking skills to question the source material. Particularly, to see what perspectives each narrative excludes. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a comprehensive overview of Asian American immigration, exclusion, labor, citizenship, and activism through various readings on different Asian groups, as well as Professor Lui's lectures. I really appreciated how Professor Lui debunked the stereotypical approach to Asian American History by including information on patterns of global capitalism and trade that linked Asia to the Americas far before the 1848 gold rush. It was interesting to read various primary sources and accounts of Asian immigration to the U.S. and then attempt to craft my own oral history of a family member. ",
            "\u00a0understanding of asian american immigration to america and historical trends upon their entry ",
            "\u00a0I gained knowledge about the complexity of Asian American history, particularly how certain concepts commonly talked about in traditional American history classes and popular media may not do justice to large groups of people. This complexity was a helpful reminder to keep questioning established historical narratives, and an insight into an often overlooked area of American history encompassing race/community formation, international politics, immigration, pop culture, and sociological concepts of space/land ownership. \r\n\r\nI would not say I gained any particular skills, but as a first-year, I was introduced to how Yale college students and faculty approach systems like large-scale lectures, TFs, and essay writing. There is a lot of responsibility placed on students in larger lecture courses like this to take academic initiative, as opposed to TFs or professors directly instructing students on pedagogical, analytical, or writerly skills and approaches. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a ton about Asian Americans in the United States. I feel confident enough to give a general timeline and outline of the history to others, and I truly learned about the social and legal implications of being Asian here in the US. ",
            "\u00a0Great oversight of asian american history and access to many primary documents related to the course. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about Asian American history (and American history more generally) that I didn't even know I didn't know about before. Also learned a lot about how past immigration policies have influenced or laid the foundations for present ones and its made me resent the whole system even more. ",
            "\u00a0Pretty much all the major themes in Asian American History from 1850s to present. ",
            "\u00a0I learned Asian American history that was never taught to me. I am really glad I took this class ",
            "\u00a0The complexity of racial formation and Asian-American history. I felt like much of what was learned in class could be applied to other areas of ethnic studies as well, specifically historical/primary source analysis. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This course was really interesting and seemed to fly by; I was rarely bored or confused about what was happening. I liked that often lectures would start by addressing a common narrative or misconception, and then give us evidence to contextualize/disprove it. I thought the readings and films added to what we covered in lecture and section, though sometimes they were a bit redundant. Especially considering the many different themes and wide time period covered in this class, I can't think of anything it was necessarily missing. The assessments were fair and fun to prepare for. My only suggestion would be to tweak the oral history project a bit in order because I had two issues with it: 1) the fact that the historian's introduction and the oral history itself were supposed to be the same length (I felt that, like the oral histories we read, the person's narrative should have merited more words/pages than our note contextualizing it) and 2) the requirement that the oral history be told in the first person. I think this ethnography/history would still be effective if it was written in the third person, and talked to several other students who shared the same sentiments. Because we spent so much time this semester reading these kinds of materials and learning about different ways to tell history, I think perhaps the oral history assignment could be restructured to reflect there is not just one right way to tell a person's story. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were certainly the oral history project assignment, which I really enjoyed, as well as the readings and lecture. Professor Lui gave a lot of very helpful context and her lectures were informative, interesting, and powerful. And, the readings were very interesting as they delved into topics I knew relatively little about and gave a very detailed explanation of many of the different aspects of the Asian American experience throughout history. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - Prof Lui is an amazing lecturer! \r\nWeaknesses - assignment formats could have been clearer, perhaps could have been done by posting sample essays. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is its depth and the overall engagement of all the students. Weakness I would say is the final workload--the take home final paper is assigned during the actual exam period. It would be helpful if it were either assigned at the beginning of the reading period or if the final project were expanded in scope so no take home final is needed. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are that this course covers a lot of material. Perhaps an unconventional weakness, but I think that this course would be a neat opportunity to practice more writing. In particular, it would be helpful to have this class with a WR option in order to get more practice doing historical analysis and writing argumentative essays.\r\n\r\nAnother \"weakness\" of the course is that it would be helpful to have lecture slides posted online. Oftentimes, after lecture, it would be helpful to go back and look at the images that contextualized the lecture! ",
            "\u00a0Every lecture was very insightful. Only weakness is that lecture notes are not posted online, so if you miss a lecture you will need to get notes from a friend ",
            "\u00a0I loved the Oral History Project and thought that the organization of the class made sense. There's a lot of reading, but I felt that all of it was necessary to understand the material. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Lui is amazing, the materials are great, and section really helps consolidate ideas together. If only this class could be two semesters long then delving into more of the histories of various communities would've been great (like more analysis of the Vietnam War, for example) ",
            "\u00a0The class' strength lies in the variety of assignment types. There is an in class midterm, take home final essay, oral history, section discussion questions, etc. For someone who has trouble with one type of assignment, the variation allows for room to make up any lost points. However, this variation in assignment type is also a weakness of the class. Whereas other courses are very essay-based and you improve your writing through feedback on your essays, the different assignments in this class mean that every assignment, due to its variation, is something you have to prepare for extensively. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course:\r\n- The inclusiveness of the course, you're learning about all Asian groups rather than just Chinese/Japanese/Korean.\r\n- Professor Lui as a lecturer -- she plans out everything that she says, and each sentence is intentional. She also includes a lot of primary documents in lecture, such as snippets of documentaries and comics that help put things in perspective. She's also funny and interesting to listen to!\r\n- The final project, which is an oral history project, is one of the most enjoyable and interesting final projects I've ever done. You go out and interview a person whose history is related to Asian American history, and write an oral history about their life. \r\n- Amazing TAs! They were all Professor Lui's graduate advisees, who were Asian women of color who were passionate about the class and their sections. Section was also a rare time to discuss Asian American issues, which I haven't really had a space for regularly before I took this class. \r\n- The readings are really interesting. A lot of perspectives are included, and a lot of them are primary documents. \r\n\r\nThe weaknesses of this course: \r\n- The final exam's prompt was really broad, and a bit confusing as a result. It was take-home though. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Lui is such an excellent lecturer, framing ideas in such a clear, interesting, and non-trivial way that is just mind blowing. The TFs are also so passionate and so helpful. I can't think of a way to improve this course. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were very engaging and the assignments were diverse and interesting. There could have been more structured review sessions for exams. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: As an Asian American, taking this class was personally very meaningful to me. It broadened my own understanding of what it means to be Asian American, as well as correcting many of my preconceptions about Asian Americans. Because Asian American history was always glossed over in my textbooks, having a class dedicated to this important history showed me not only how much I didn't know, but also how much I still don't know (even after taking this one class.) Professor Lui also teaches the material with a focus on intersectionality, emphasizing how gender, class, ethnicity, migration histories, and more shape different histories. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strength of this course is the professor, who is probably the best lecturer I've ever had at Yale. I think that the organization of the history and readings facilitates a clear understanding of the material. ",
            "\u00a0This course is really well-organized and goes through lots of content, but not in an overwhelming way. Lectures are amazing! Readings are also diverse and interesting. There could be more guidance to writing historical papers (e.g. providing examples or spending a section talking about it) just because a lot of people come into this class with no history background and they're different from other types of papers. I also think that there was a focus on East Asian history. ",
            "\u00a0The lecture was well-taught, and the content was very interesting. It was great getting access to these stories and perspectives, through this course. Sometimes section felt redundant and not as engaging as I would have hoped. Another aspect that could be improved could be structure and weight of the assignments, or perhaps the semester could have been better spaced out, since sixty percent of the course grade was determined in the two week reading/finals period. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: amazing TF and professor who are so willing to help answer questions. Not only that, but they pushed us to think critically about the texts we were assigned.\r\nweaknesses: sometimes an overwhelming amount of reading. Also, because the course isn't strictly chronological, the timeline can get confusing sometimes. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: AMAZING lecturesprobably the best of my Yale career. I usually hate going to lecture but I went *every single class* just to hear Professor Lui's insights. She is such an amazing Asian American scholar and highkey my academic inspiration. Along with the lectures, the readings were amazing as well. As an Asian American myself, many of them resonated deeply with me and I found myself doing ~ALL~ of them! \r\n\r\nWeakness: The workload is a bit hectictwo midterm assignments and two final assignments. They were amazing though, and I definitely learned a lot from them. I'm glad that I didn't let previous years' Coursetable reviews talking about the high workload deter me from taking this class. TAKE THIS CLASS but just keep in mind that you will have to work a lot in it! ",
            "\u00a0This course has incredible TFs, however, I feel in some ways that the grading was not standardized across different sections. It's understandable that TFs will have different grading styles, but the rubrics on some assignments seemed to be so general that some TFs counted points off for things others would let go as correct answers. This discrepancy in feedback became difficult to reconcile when studying for tests in groups. Otherwise, I thoroughly enjoyed Professor Lui's lectures and felt there was no problem with this course. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures of the course were excellent and were both engaging and informative. I really enjoyed the lectures and appreciated the large number of primary source documents that we had as part of our readings. I know that it's difficult to cover so much of history and so many different Asian groups in a single course, but I would have wanted to have a greater discussion of South Asians. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course. The lectures, readings, and sections were always interesting and easy to follow. ",
            "\u00a0This course does a good job of giving students an overview of history. I think it could be improved by more organization; I was sometimes unclear if lectures were organized by timeline or by topic and because of it I sometimes felt that we were jumping around or missing certain topics/revisiting the same ones. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are Professor Lui's lectures and section was actually engaging and useful. There are a lot of readings (all of them are usually amazing though and you want to read them) but just not enough time to fully do them. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the way Professor Lui organized the class overall. The way she structured lecture made it really engaging and really easy to understand. Professor Lui is so accessible and really happy to meet with students during office hours. I just wished there was more information on Korean Americans, but as my family is Korena I realize I am biased. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Prof. Lui is such a gifted lecturer. I genuinely looked forward to every class, and I loved that she was able to weave intriguing anecdotes and telling statistics into her articulate and nuanced arguments. The readings varied in length from week to week and were sometimes difficult to complete in their entirety, but they nevertheless complemented the lecture material well and offered a wide range of perspectives from both first-person narrators and renowned historians. Weaknesses: I think the timing of our various assignments could have been better -- we had our midterm exam one week after the midterm paper was due, and the take-home final was due one week after the oral history project during reading week/finals. These are both stressful periods of the semester with a lot of work from other classes, so I would have appreciated having things spread out a little more. ",
            "\u00a0This class was very interesting in that it was unique in the Yale curriculum. However, it was very stale in terms of readings and lecture. While Professor Lui did a good job of making lectures seamless, her lecturing style is very much reading from the pages. \r\n\r\nSection is incredibly good, but again, some of the reading is excessive and uninteresting. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: a great and obviously passionate prof, really knowledgeable TAs, good thorough explanation of all material. Weaknesses: since we focused so much on specifically Chinese American history, I never got a real grasp on the cohesiveness of Asian American as a political/historical unit, and especially on how South Asians were supposed to fit in to the narratives we studied. A lot of superfluous readings. I feel that section suffered as a result of no one having been able to do the massive amounts of reading: I would have really loved to see a more streamlined syllabus. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot from the readings I did, though they were sometimes very long or dry, and I wasn't able to get to all of them. Content-wise, I think I appreciated how showed how the U.S. majority population and government understood immigrants but also how immigrants themselves and their descendants navigated life int he US. I think something I would've liked to see more was how this history stands alongside immigration histories of other regions, which I think would've been a productive and insightful complements to the mentions of the black-white binary. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Comprehensive survey class; great lectures in which Prof. Lui easily draws the class to the big themes to consider; interesting readings; substantive section discussions; students are often very engaged in these personal histories; essential information on the history of Asian Americans that is often overlooked.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The levels of reading were often so high that I felt too overwhelmed to manage them (I would attempt to get through texts that seemed important, but often chose the wrong ones that weren't covered in section); the length of the semester makes it very hard to understand the topics very in depth. ",
            "\u00a0Very interesting material and great professor. Lots of readings and a lot of writing involved. This course should be a WR credit. ",
            "\u00a0Incredible course. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were very organized and clear. I felt like the readings were also very interesting. I think lectures always went over by a few minutes, so that was difficult for me for me to catch the next class. ",
            "\u00a0We covered a lot on Asian American history. The main draw of this class for me was how skillfully and effectively Prof. Lui was able to connect historical events to current events -- it made the course feel more urgent and relevant. However, as comprehensive as the course was, I felt that there was a lack of focus on South Asian Americans. We talked a bit about Sikh American history, but there was a very East Asian (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) focus in this course. I think that needs to change in the future. ",
            "\u00a0The class is very intensive and comprehensive. ",
            "\u00a0The readings and films were great supplements to the material covered in lecture, and it never felt like there was too much reading in a given week. When it came to assignments though, I was disappointed when I learned the final exam was essentially an essay. Since we had already written two essays for the course and taken a midterm exam, I expected the final's format to be like the midterm exam, with different sections and more short-answer questions. I think a lot of us were overwhelmed and surprised by the final exam's format and length. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a phenomenal exploration of Asian American history that is perhaps covered in 10 pages in your high school textbooks! I've learned so much about my own identity and culture and how to analyze social processes relating to Asian Americans. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: good mix of broad themes and individual narratives, interesting readings. Weaknesses: can sometimes get lost in how broad the narrative is. It's a ton of material. I wish there was more focus on non-East Asian groups in the diaspora, though Prof Lui seems to have accounted for that more given past course reviews? ",
            "\u00a0There are a lot of writing assignments that are not needed ",
            "\u00a0This course is excellent! There is a decent amount of reading, but all of it is very interesting. My favorite part of the course was probably my discussion section, which was an amazing space for open, non-judgmental discussion and clarifying key dates and events. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - discussion sections are meaningful and insightful, the major assessments have been very reasonable, Mary Lui is a very good lecturer, lectures were engaged and organized\r\nWeaknesses - not enough guidelines for major assessments, which can be hard especially for students who have never written an academic history paper before. Also too much reading, and sometimes section would go over it in-depth while other times looking at the larger picture and in broader contexts. This inconsistency made it difficult to determine how much of the reading to do (realistically, while balancing other classes it was difficult to read all 300+ pages per week) ",
            "\u00a0This course was very broad in topic, which is both a strength and weakness. It talked about so many different aspects of Asian American History from a range of time periods that it was difficult to go in-depth into all the different specificities. This was especially true in the readings, where there were around three to four readings a week, each usually focusing on a different topic. It was difficult/impossible to discuss all the readings in section and attempt to connect them to lecture. Often some readings would never be analyzed. I think condensing the readings and eliminating others would be beneficial to the class. Especially around the end of the semester readings would restate many aspects of Asian American history that we had already covered. If these readings were cut down, not only would the workload be more manageable, but there would be more room to discuss during section. I will say though that having many readings allowed us to choose which ones we wanted to talk about in section so we had more agency in deciding what needed further analysis. ",
            "\u00a0Prof Lui has some of the most engaging and interesting lectures at Yale, and as someone who is easily bored and distracted in lectures, I found myself paying close attention to her (most of the time). We cover a lot of history dating back to the 1800s, and although I realize that's critical to the foundation of Asian American history, I wish Prof Lui addressed the modern state of Asian Americans a bit more. ",
            "\u00a0A major strength is Professor Mary Lui and the way she narrates history. All lectures are so interesting, engaging, and enlightening because of her. She doesn't just describe historical facts; she illuminates them by tying other historical details together and placing them into a greater context. A weakness would be that the course is East Asian centric. But, I recognize the limitations of time and the difficulty of providing an inclusive teaching of all of Asian American history in just a semester. I think that points to the need for more Asian American studies classes at Yale to give all the histories the time they deserve. ",
            "\u00a0This course does a wonderful job of examining key events and patterns in Asian American history within the timespan of a semester. It also does a great job of engaging primary sources in the writing assignments. \r\n\r\nThis course could be more engaging if the reading loads were divided up into smaller chunks. Sometimes, reading an entire 200+ page book within one week was challenging. Section could have been more engaging if perhaps there were fewer readings that students were able to complete more comprehensively. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: lectures were fantastic, like story telling time. easy to comprehend and engaging. i loved them\r\nweaknesses: would love more southeast asian history that isn't vietnam ",
            "\u00a0The course's lecture was great. A sign of a good lecture, in my opinion, is one that students can simply sit back and listen to, with a level of trust that betrays the clarity, reliability, and pacing of the concepts in the lecture. The course material itself was not only diverse, but highly relevant (even crucial) to anyone that is looking for a well-paced and informative overview of American history. \r\n\r\nThe weaknesses of the course may simply be part of the nature of college instruction, but the discussion section was often unproductive for me. Although I enjoyed the conversions and people, I didn't feel like I really built much on the concepts of the readings/lecture, even regressing at times into broad generalizations, particularly when students hadn't fully read the generous weekly readings. \r\nThe expectations for class were often unclear, and I felt unsure whether putting in the effort to do the readings was worth it if the discussion would often diverge into related, but more conceptual discussion. \r\nI also didn't feel like I learned much about concrete approaches to Asian American history, and felt like feedback on my writing and in-class comments was sparse. Of course, I could have made more efforts to approach my TF/professor on these issues, but was nervous about asking them to put in extra effort to teach me something I was not sure was reasonable to ask for in the limited time I had outside of class. ",
            "\u00a0Great course, and my section was amazing. Strengths are Mary Lui and the TAs as well as the general scope of the lessons. Weakness is that there is no follow-up courses for more in-depth analysis of such an important history! Also it is very writing heavy and I think we could have had nice quizzes to test out concrete dates, etc. instead of all the writing assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Pros: As a Japanese American, it gave me the first time where I could talk about my family in an academic setting.\r\nCons: If you're not Asian American, might not be as fulfilling. ",
            "\u00a0It's a LOT of reading, so be prepared. I took it Credit/D and I'm really happy I did. ",
            "\u00a0Mary Lui is an amazing professor, section is hugely engaging. She comes into lecture 110% prepared, so make sure you are also ready to get everything you can out of this class. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are the organization of this course and the amazing ability of Professor Lui to effectively deliver the course material. While a lecture course, it involved the critical analysis and intellectual engagement with the material of a seminar. The readings are well varied, and though it seemed like the majority of the class were not as familiar with Asian American History, I believe that it would still be worthwhile for those familiar with the topic. The only weakness of the course would be that the final assignments were kind of a lot - we had an oral history paper and a take-home final that was essentially another paper. I had a great experience with the Oral History Paper so either only having that as the final assignment or moving up the due  date would have been helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The four assessments (two midterms and two finals) were too many. I felt like the midterm paper and Oral History were plenty in assessing our mastery of course materials and found myself repeating the same arguments in each of the assessments, rather than saying something new. In other words, more testing was not needed.\r\nThe obvious strength was the outstanding lectures by Mary Lui. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of reading at times (more than realistic for assigned time period, considering other courseloads) but overall engaging lectures and great Teaching Fellows. ",
            "\u00a0I loved going to every lecture and learning so much, just wish we could have had more in class discussion or see more of Prof Lui in section ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Lecture. Go to lecture! I took this class Cr/D and still went to every single lecture, they were like listening to stories. Also, the two assignments were enjoyable to do, especially the oral history.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Because this class is a class that is heavily Cr/D'd, the sections tend to be lacking in terms of student discussion since many students would not do the reading. Often, the more interesting discussions we would have centered around our own experiences or our thoughts and questions about what was discussed in lecture. Not really sure how to remedy this other than to not have as much reading or have some sort of supplemental summary at the beginning? \r\nSomething that I am curious about still after the conclusion of the course is how Asian-Americans mobilized with other minority groups, and how different identities (i.e. women, LGBTQ+ etc.) intersected with Asian-American history. "

        [
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to other students, especially (American) history majors who might not have ever taken a course focused specifically on Asian Americans. Whether or not you identify as Asian American yourself, it's really interesting to learn this history and how it intersects with the narratives in American history we have all been taught or the experiences we have in our own lives. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. One reason for my recommendation would be the oral history project--I loved the project as it gave me the opportunity to talk to an Asian American individual and hear their story in a way that I didn't know beforehand. And, Professor Lui's lectures are well-organized and well-structured, and taught me so much about Asian American history--she started the semester by explaining how traditional American history courses do not say much about the Asian American experience, and throughout the semester, I certainly found this to be true as I learned more about histories I didn't know before.

            "\u00a0Yes! I learned a lot and time in class as well as readings were enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially if you are Asian American! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Asian American or not, this is DEFINITELY a course you should take! It is a GREAT humanities credit, and it really adds a lot more depth to Asian American history beyond what our regular history classes teach us. The most IMPORTANT thing about this class is that it will teach you things you DIDN'T KNOW YOU DIDN'T KNOW! Honestly, it was one of coolest classes that I have taken so far (as a sophomore). ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely recommend this course to literally everyone. It isn't as much work as some people say it is, but if you are worried about that take it Credit/D. It's an amazing course and you'll learn a ton ",
            "\u00a0Yes - any student who wants to learn about a comparatively little-studied part of American history should take this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you want to learn more about Asian Americans, or are like me, an Asian American, seeking to learn more about your history and identity, definitely take this course. ",
            "\u00a0I would cautiously recommend this course to another student. I really enjoyed the content of the class and the professor is amazing. However, the workload is extremely difficult (especially the dual final exam and oral history) and the reading is a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! 100%, without reservations, especially if you're Asian American and want to learn about your own history. This course changed my life in a lot of ways, and I would re-take it if I could. It's only offered every two years, so don't miss your chance! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student at Yale, not just Asian American students. One of my biggest takeaways from this course is that Asian American history cannot and should not be viewed as simply a tangential footnote or oddity within the broader history of America. The history of Asian America IS the history of America, and by extension anyone interested in learning about their own history (whether they are Asian American or not) should strongly consider taking this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would. It was interesting, engaging, and challenging. I think this kind of history is important for all students to be familiar with. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Asian American history (and often, Asian Americans in society writ large) feels like a footnote, and this class helped me see why it shouldn't be. In her last lecture, Professor Lui emphasized how Asian Americans should not be afraid to take up space, and taking this class for me was a way of taking up my own spacephysically and intellectually. Additionally, I took this class alongside other history classes, and it was very cool to see the intersections between Asian American history and other takes on history. To me, this highlighted the need to understand Asian American history, because seeing those intersections showed me just how important Asian American history is. \r\n\r\nAlso, this class is only offered every other year so the best time to take it is as soon as it's offered! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Professor Lui teaches history like no other. Past the unique opportunity to learn from her, the history is one I hadn't been taught before and is crucial to the future of this country. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a lot of work - lots of reading every week, midterm paper + in-class midterm essay, & final paper & final take-home essay. If you are interested in Asian American history it's totally worth it because you learn SO much and ML is an amazing lecturer. You definitely get out as much as you put in. I came out of this class with a better understanding of my own relationship with Asian American history - particularly if you have a personal connection to/interest in this class, would highly recommend! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. It is a critical course to take for any student at Yale. It shines light on an often overseen piece of history, that is deeply entwined in the fabric of our nation. ",
            "\u00a0YES YES YES. Literally BEST LECTURE at Yale. Professor Lui is an insightful QUEEN and my idol. I learned SO much about Asian American history, how to think historically, how to develop a historical argument, and the like. As an Asian American myself, I was brought to tears in many of the lectures because much of the material resonated with me and my identity. I learned SO much from this class and you should DEFINITELY take this sometime during your Yale career. ",
            "\u00a0I would actively recommend this course to another student. Aside from Professor Lui's enjoyable and informative lectures, this course teaches a history that can't be taught in any other general American history course. The nuance of the Asian experience in America, deeply individual but also incredibly shared, is worth acknowledging and learning about. As much of Asian American history is left up to primary texts and oral histories as opposed to federal documents and archives, it's also helpful as a researcher to take this course. This course helped me gain an appreciation and understanding of these methods of research. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely! This course fundamentally changed the way that I view immigration history, especially for Asians and Asian Americans. It has allowed me to contextualize and gain a deeper understanding of a lot of historical events that I had previously held in isolation. Both the readings and the lectures in the course are excellent and engage with a lot of primary source documents. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in learning more about immigration history and Asian migration. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in Asian American history. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially Asian American students! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Not just even if you are Asian or Asian American. It's a really good ER&M course and you'll leave being able to really articulate the racial formation of the Asian American and understand the history of American nation-building and understand major American historical events in the context of Asian America. It also lends to a more full understanding of American history in general and has a lot of connections to other POC groups. ",
            "\u00a0This course is life-changing. Everyone should absolutely take it. I have told everyone I know to take it because it is not only extremely engaging (I cried in a couple of lectures) but because Asian American history is incredibly sparse in early history education (elementary through high school), and I didn't know how much I was missing until I took this course. I took the course for several reasons, but mostly because I am a history major and because I am Asian American and had a personal investment in the course. Professor Lui debunks a lot of misconceptions about Asian American history, showing that it dates back farther than just importation of Chinese labor for the gold rush. There are SO many things in this class that are so relevant to understanding the world today, most notably the ways in which Asian Americans are represented in pop culture/yellowface, the model minority stereotype, and the ways in which Asian immigration and Asian exclusion was absolutely instrumental in shaping immigration law as it exists today. If you are Asian American and haven't taken an Asian American history course, you must at some point in your life. This class reached me in personal ways that no other one has before. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, 100%!! I was a little skeptical of this course's rave reviews at first; as a senior, I've taken a few other bucket-list classes that didn't quite live up to the hype, and I wasn't sure how much I would gain from yet another intro survey lecture course. But Prof. Lui surpassed all of my expectations on the very first day. This course taught me just how glaringly absent Asian American voices, experiences, and literature are from traditional American history classes, as well as how critical Asian American history is for understanding the broader processes of racial formation in the United States. This is a class that everyone should take -- not only are there incredibly important lessons on exclusion and resistance and the model minority myth to be learned, but it was also such a pleasure to listen to Prof. Lui's eloquent, enthralling, and nuanced lectures. The vast majority of our class was of Asian heritage; this allowed for especially engaging conversations in section about shared experiences, but it was also sad to think about how so many Yalies were missing out on such important and meaningful subject material. If you want to gain a better understanding of how your own heritage fits into larger patterns of immigration, community formation and race relations, or if you just want to learn about an often-overlooked but integral part of American history, I would highly recommend shopping/taking this class! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but Id cautious that it focuses mostly on chinese American history. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would. I have learned so much, Mary Lui is a great lecturer and knows her stuff, and my TA was amazing. It also isn't just about narrowly learning Asian American history; personally, I've been putting my knowledge from this course together with what I know from African American history, Latinx immigration history, Cold War history, etc. to formulate a better understanding of the U.S. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Take this class! Prof. Lui is extremely dedicated to her students and works extremely hard to make sure material is understandable, accessible, and clear to those taking the class. The TF's are also equally dedicated to making HIST 183 a positive learning experience. Moreover, the class is a fundamental course in understanding the Asian American experiencewhich I believe is often an overlooked component of history within the United States. Whether you take this for personal or academic reasons, this class will give you a strong foundation in discussing and navigating the realities of being Asian American todayand how intricately linked that is to a history that extends for centuries. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! absolutely phenomenal course. You learn a lot in this class because Asian American history is not taught in high school history classes and there's so much to talk about. ",

            "\u00a0Definitely. Best humanities class I've ever taken. You'll learn so much about American history, and if you're Asian American, you'll learn so much about your family and yourself. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Don't just take this course if you are Asian American. I think this course is extremely relevant for anyone who is interested in exploring racial formations, immigration history, and minority narratives in American history. ",
            "\u00a0YES TAKE THIS COURSE but Mary Lui isn't teaching it any more so I don't know ",
            "\u00a0Of course! Take this class! Youll learn a lot about things you never learned about in history classes. Mary Lui is an excellent lecturer ",
            "\u00a0Yes! You will learn a lot about Asian American history and it will be a fulfilling experience. However, there is a lot of work! There is a 5-page analysis of a primary source, an in-class midterm, a 10 page oral history project, and a final paper of 6-8 pages. But, I found all of it very fulfilling and enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It was a good experience and taught a lot of U.S. history you don't learn in high school and before. ",
            "\u00a0Yes though workload is kind of heavy if this is your 4th/5th class. Lectures and readings are usually interesting. TAs are really good! ",

            "\u00a0Yes! If you have ever been curious about Asian American history, immigration policy, the model minority myth, then this course is great. The readings are super interesting, although there are a lot. The oral history project is one of the most interesting assignments I have worked on and gives you a chance to give a voice to the history you are learning. As an Asian American myself, I feel like I have so much more appreciation for the struggles of my parents and those who immigrated to US before me. Professor Lui is fantastic, a great lecturer, and such an inviting professor. The TAs were great and section was great. I took it Credit/D, and its been one of my favorite classes at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I think that Asian American history is an important class that everyone should be aware about, regardless of whether or not they identify as Asian American. The class isn't unnecessarily difficult and pushes you to write and analyze better. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. Not only is the professor amazing, but every lecture was so interesting and it really changed how I considered Asian Americans' place in both history and current events. Also there was a lot of interesting information in interactions between minorities and general racial formation that I found especially intriguing (I would have loved to have more of this topic in the class). However, I would warn that this class contains a lot of readings that are all interesting, but high in volume. ",
            "\u00a0I would strongly recommend this course to any student - not just an Asian or Asian American student -  who is interested in learning about the origins of racial formation in America. As we learned in class, the treatment of Asians in government and law helped shaped some modern racially motivated practices such as gatekeeping after 9/11. Thus, the knowledge gained in this class is not simply applicable to Asian Americans but relevant to any minority in this country. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. The sheer knowledge that you gain from this class regardless of your heritage will change your understanding of modern day racial dynamics. It entails a lot of readings but many are easy to read as they are books, personal narratives, and not a lot of academic articles. It's such engaging course material that you don't need to put in much effort to do well in the class - just attend the lectures and you will absorb so much. It also expands US history in a way that is not traditionally covered by high school level history classes, which is very crucial in shaping our understanding of the US. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely! As an Asian American, I was so inspired by the number of moments during this course when I felt like huge chunks of history were excluded from my high school's U.S. History curriculum - from the Rock Springs Massacre, Japanese Internment, Yellow Power movement, etc. Furthermore, I think this course is a must-take for ALL ETHNIC BACKGROUNDS because it examines important patterns of immigration and exclusion policy in our country that has affected populations far beyond Asian Americans. A wonderful course with extremely engaging lectures by Professor Lui, as well as truly caring TFs! ",
            "\u00a0do it. mary lui is a gem and this made me understand much about the asian american experience. don't expect it to be super relatable (especially if you're not from chinese background) because it's a really broad overview, but this class will teach you there is so much to explore in asian american studies.\r\n\r\n@ yale, why don't we have more classes like this one?
