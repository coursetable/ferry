            "\u00a0I learned how to analyze and respond effectively to works of art. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the many ways in which art overlapped with science and explored a lot of questions about what is Art or not. I also learned about how abstraction in science overlapped with abstraction in art and found an appreciation for both. ",
            "\u00a0I acquired an eclectic pile of knowledge. Some of what we learned was exceptionally interesting. Like very cool. Before taking this course, I had never taken an art history class before and had no clue how to write about art. This class taught me how to feel comfortable writing about art. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me develop skills in identifying connections across different academic disciplines. It helped me look at art through a scientific lens. ",
            "\u00a0I learned new ways of thinking about art, since I had not had much exposure to as extensive analysis of visual art and the accompanying historical and societal context. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how the development of art and science are similar to one another, in what ways each field effects the other, and how knowledge of both spheres enhances understanding in the other. ",
            "\u00a0How properly critique artwork and write extensive papers focusing on a single subject. "

            "\u00a0I believe that some of the lectures and readings were a bit boring. More attention could've been paid by the professor towards making the learning environment more inclusive for students. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths in this course were the field trips we took to the art conservation lab, museums, and the Albers Foundations. They allowed me to apply what we're learning through our readings to the real world, such as the relevance of pigments. The weaknesses in this course were there were readings that were really technical to the process of creating art, whereas I was more interested in the history of art/artists and how that overlapped with history of science, so I wasn't that engaged. Other strengths include the lectures on photography and abstraction near the end of the course. ",
            "\u00a0A strength was that it was sort of chill. It was a seminar-style class and we were encouraged to share all opinions even if they weren't fully formed yet. A weakness was that I felt like often too much reading was assigned and it became quickly clear that almost no one did all of it. I think by assigning less reading, and choosing which of the readings are most important, students would understand what the most important parts of the reading to do are. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this class included the readings. I found many of readings to be enriching and constructive in helping me learn about scientific paradigm shifts. The weaknesses of this course included it not necessarily covering topics that are at all correlated and assignments sometimes lacking thorough direction. ",
            "\u00a0The readings were a bit long at times and could have been substituted by a greater variety of learning platforms. ",
            "\u00a0There were several readings I thought were too extensive and dense making them difficult to discuss.\r\nOn the other hand however our conversations in class were really open ended and I learned a lot about art "

        [
            "\u00a0This course really opened my eyes to understanding how photography can be an art form. I also developed a love for abstract art through the readings we did. The 10-minute quickwrites we did in class to analyze art pieces helped me grow more comfortable with writing about art. It was a good class to develop an appreciation for art in general since those quickwrites weren't graded. Some of the readings really challenged how we take in the world as well, especially when it comes to \"perspective\" and images that are \"true-to-nature.\" Overall, I would recommend this course to those who have general knowledge of art history but would like to engage with that further, particularly in reference to science. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. Carol is great! Our class was really fun and the field trips really shake it up. It's nice having so many field trips to get you out of the classroom and they are probably what I will best remember about this class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student if they were very interested in different scientific discoveries. If a student was looking for an art-focused class with formal analysis of art, I probably wouldn't recommend it to them. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, as I believe the course was interesting and aided my learning. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend this course to other students for a writing credit, although I'm not sure how much I'd recommend this course to prospective STEM majors, as the focus of the course is much more in the \"art\" of \"art and science\". ",
            "\u00a0Yes because it adds a perspective on art and the sciences that I have not considered before. "
