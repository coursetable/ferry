            "\u00a0I learned a lot of the fundamentals of Aerodynamics for incompressible flow, and the fundamentals for compressible flows. This class built well on the material learned in fluid mechanics. "

            "\u00a0A very interesting course that went in depth on aerodynamics.  Prof de la Mora was able to focus on every student; I think this course benefits a lot from being such a small lecture.   My suggestion would be to slow down with some of the most difficult calculations, seeing as we had an abundance of time for review and I found myself very lost at times, such as during integral BL calculations. ",
            "\u00a0This course was small, which meant you were forced to learn the material quickly and be engaged. It would have been helpful to have a more structured idea of what would be covered each day. "

        [
            "\u00a0An interesting class that takes fluids and thermos and shows you how planes fly.  Prof de le Mora is very accessible and willing to help you out.  Definitely a class you should pay attention in lecture for! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in Aerospace engineering or Aerodynamics as it relates to airfoil design. "
