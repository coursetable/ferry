I thought it helped give people a better idea of what kind of work people could do using modeling and how modeling is used in the real world. I think I would just like some more background given per presenter because for some of them, I didn't really understand the work they were doing because there was background information about the models or the research itself that I didn't know so maybe sending out some information prior to the seminar about what the presenter presents on would be nice. ",
