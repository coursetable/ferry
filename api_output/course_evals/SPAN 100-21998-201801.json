            "\u00a0Students should not be able to take this course for credit if they have taken another Spanish class at Yale. I don't know why there isn't a restriction like this already in place because I know other departments have it. It would greatly improve the course quality for the other students. ",
            "\u00a0This is a course where you will truly get out what you put in. Professor Asensio will not make you do homework, but will give you everything you need to succeed. You may be in the class with a lot of people who are taking it as an easy class - thats their loss, but dont let it impact you. Put in the work! Youll enjoy it. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, if you need to maintain your spanish for your job or for research purposes, this is a great course for you! ",
            "\u00a0Take this course if you want a fast introduction to Spanish grammar. Do not take this if you have already taken Spanish, it will be useless to you, and there are other courses at Yale that you can get an A in and actually learn something new. Now that you can take just one semester of an actual language class for credit, I don't know if I would recommend this class for someone looking to get a semester's introduction to Spanish, but when this wasn't allowed, it was almost perfect. Pilar is really great too. ",
            "\u00a0This was a great course and I definitely recommend it. You will have two fairly easy projects over the course of the semester that involve translating works to English and guiding the class through a short translation. The professor was great as she encourages you to select things that you are actually interested in or particularly enjoy. She was very caring and a pleasant person to be around. Definitely take this class, it was a low time commitment. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I would recommend you take this class if you want an introduction to reading Spanish. I would NOT reccomend taking this class credit/D. I took it credit/D and of course got a credit, but I constantly felt bad because Professor Asensio wanted to help me succeed but I wasnt putting in the work. Professor Asensio is a gem and deserves for you to put in good work. ",
            "\u00a0YES. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. it is an easy to learn and the professor is a very good teacher. "
