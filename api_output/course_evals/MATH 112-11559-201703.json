            "\u00a0This course greatly improved my problem solving skills. ",
            "\u00a0While I already knew how to find basic derivatives, through this course I went much further in depth in this area and now understand not only how they are used, but how they are used in unfamiliar situations. ",
            "\u00a0The course covered limits, derivative calculus, and started on integration. The material was discussed in greater depth than in most previous math classes I have taken. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: There are many peer tutors and office hours so help is there for those who seek it. \r\n\r\nWeakness: This class moves far too quickly for someone who hasn't taken Calc before. Furthermore, very few practice problems are done in class. As a result, one is expected to learn the content from usually confusing and quick explanations. ",
            "\u00a0WebAssign questions are sometimes a bit unclear (not a huge deal though because you only lose a tenth of a point for incorrect answers.) I also believe that far too much weight is placed on the final. ",
            "\u00a0I do not think this course was very well organized. The lessons taught in class were not in-depth enough to help with the problem sets, let alone the examinations. After a few weeks of this class, I decided to switch majors due to the dread I had going to class and doing problem sets. I absolutely hate math after taking this course. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that the teaching could have been more hands-on and interactive. ",
            "\u00a0It would be helpful if we focused more time in class on going over problem set questions we had trouble with. ",
            "\u00a0It is nice that this course has a variety of \"extra-help\" options available to students, such as office hours, peer tutors, and extra review sessions. However, I did not like the way in which the course was taught as a flipped classroom. I did not find it beneficial in any way to be \"tested\" (via WebAssign homework assignments) on material we had not yet learned. It did not help to grasp the material any better and ended up just producing unnecessary stress about WebAssign grades. ",
            "\u00a0They say you can take this course without ever taking calculus before, but I find this hard to believe. A lot of things that are crucial to calculus are brushed over but expected for you to have mastered in order to perform well in the rest of class. ",
            "\u00a0I felt as though I understood the concepts, but when put into application such as in the practice midterms and finals, it became much more difficult than the applications we discussed in class. "
