            "\u00a0I learned various topics such as kinetic isotope effects, techniques to measure kinetics, MS. NMR and allostery, ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about various techniques for evaluating enzyme rates. ",
            "\u00a0I was able to gain an understanding of one could study how enzymes function through physical techniques. ",
            "\u00a0Deeper understanding of protein catalysis, NMR, various techniques for studying proteins ",
            "\u00a0I gained better writing precise writing skills that are related to reviewing and understanding research as well as grant proposals. I developed a new way of thinking about enzymes from a biochemical and kinetics perspective. Learned how to present data and background on important literature. Learned basic experiments done and history of enzyme rates/mechanisms. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about techniques previously unfamiliar to me used to analyze protein dynamics. I feel more comfortable with topics such like kinetics and thermodynamics in enzymatic cycles. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about the nitty gritty of enzymes. I'll confess, I didn't retain most of the math we used, but I did learn good conceptual stuff. ",

            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the way it was structured ",
            "\u00a0The speed at which the course was taught was a little quick. Sometimes, it was difficult to understand how equations were derived. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were the assigned readings that helped understand the lectures, allowing students to display their knowledge in unique ways other than normal exams, and lectures were very interesting and engaging. I think the weaknesses were sometimes not having enough smaller assignments or ways to test our skills prior to big exams, but that is personal preference. The course could be improved by posting lectures more often and having other assignments or drafts of the final paper due to make sure we are on right track with our learning. ",
            "\u00a0This class had a perfect level of engagement for grad students. I wouldn't change a thing. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting material, liked the student presentations, exams were not traditional but still allowed us to demonstrate our understanding of key concepts.\r\nI think I would have enjoyed some practice problems that let us get our hands dirty with some of the math addressed in this course. ",
            "\u00a0One of the strengths of the course was the amount of literature reading.  I would have appreciated more literature discussion as a class.   Even in graduate courses, it takes an effort to break the ice about how much you actually understood from the various papers.   I know some other students also struggled with trying to figure out what a 'good' question might be, so that held back some participation. "

            "\u00a0Yes, I think if you are interested in enzymatic research or anything in biochemistry this would be a good course to take. It provided novel information that I saw for the first time in this class but offered me a new way of thinking that I can take to my own research. Highlighted important techniques and history. A focus was put on literature, data analysis, and writing/thinking critcally, challenges in different ways than most classes. ",
