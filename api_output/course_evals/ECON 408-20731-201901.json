There were only 2/3 homework assignments over the semester and a final group project (presentation and paper) at the end of the semester. \r\n\r\nThe only thing to take note of is that since it's a seminar that only meets once a week, sometimes it feels like class goes on forever.

            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting final project and problem sets, though would be more interesting if there were more problem sets over the course of the semester (perhaps more shorter ones instead of two longer ones). Prof Maggi is very interesting\r\nWeaknesses: a lot of overlap with Econ 184 (international econ) "
