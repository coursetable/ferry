            "\u00a0I got a solid grasp on basic conversational French, and overall just got much more comfortable speaking and understanding. I'd say my biggest improvement was in listening comprehension. ",
            "\u00a0This class did an excellent job of balancing speaking, listening, writing, and reading skills. I felt my grammar knowledge vastly improved, as we covered many verb tenses and conjugations thoroughly. Being immersed in French class for 50 minutes a day, I became much more confident in my speaking. ",
            "\u00a0Before taking this course, I have only learnt French grammar. The course really helped me improve my speaking, listening, and writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0My fluency improved. ",
            "\u00a0My French has been significantly improved in this class. ",
            "\u00a0I am a much better and stronger and more confident speaker. ",
            "\u00a0I learned much more new vocabulary and verb tenses ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read, write, and speak French more effectively. ",
            "\u00a0I learned an abundance of new vocabulary, improved my grammatical skills in french (and consequently in English), grew confidence speaking in french, and became better at improvisational conversations. "

            "\u00a0This course is a good way to improve your French, and French in Action is a pretty entertaining way to do it. However, French in Action is honestly really hard to follow when you don't speak French (which is maybe the point?) but to really get anything out of the videos/method you have to put in hours of work every night, which I didn't have the capacity for always. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course did a good job of building a foundation of French grammar and vocabulary, and the French in Action discussions were engaging and covered a wide variety of topics. I think we could have done more work with reading French, instead of just watching/listening. ",
            "\u00a0I really like how the professor asks us questions to get us speaking. The French in Action storyline and the compositions are particularly fun ways to practice listening and writing.\r\nHowever, I think that some of the exercises in the workbook are very long and unnecessary. It would be better if the professor told us which particular exercises to focus on. ",
            "\u00a0French in Action is a very hands on way of learning french but is also very time consuming. ",
            "\u00a0This course does a good job at teaching grammar, but could focus a bit more on vocabulary. I feel that I did not learn that much new vocabulary from this course. ",
            "\u00a0The class was great! I can't think of a thing that needs to be improved. ",
            "\u00a0it was a very good class i really wouldn't change anythings ",
            "\u00a0The professor was excellent, but I felt we covered too much material in not enough time. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of this course is the constantly high level of participation/interaction between the students and teacher and between students.  We had several group oral projects and often had mini versions during class.  Through these projects and through engaging in class, we had a lot of chances to use french in a creative way.\r\n\r\nI think that using French in Action is not the best way the class could have been taught, though.  I think that the exercises and vocabulary were useful, but I feel like we didn't have enough time to explore real french texts/movies/etc. "

            "\u00a0Mme Skorupa is a ray of sunshine! Take the course for her, if nothing else. She will make you love French and really work with you at the level you're at. She is just such a kind human being, I can't praise her class enough. It was a wonderful way to start my day, even if the work was sometimes a slog. The French Dept at Yale is famous for a reason! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to another student because my French improved greatly over the semester. While a good amount of work every night, I thought it was broken down into manageable pieces and I never felt too overwhelmed by the course. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The professor is so nice and helpful, and although there are a lot of homework and assignments, they are pretty fun to do. ",
            "\u00a0If the student learns well through emersion into the language (in this case, the French in Action video) rather than a traditional learning experience, this would be a good fit for them. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great language class and Mme Skorupa is absolutely fabulous. I would recommend it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes best way to learn french! very intense but very good! ",
            "\u00a0If they want to improve in French very quickly, I would recommend this class, but warn them about the workload and commitment. However, this class is 1.5 credits for a reason. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the professor was very good and I learned a lot. ",
            "\u00a0If you're taking french, I would recommend this course because I felt like I greatly improved my french skills in many different areas and I thought that my professor was really good at teaching and engaging us throughout the semester. "
