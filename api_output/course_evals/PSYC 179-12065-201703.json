You learn about a lot of mistakes people make every day due to certain reasoning fallacies and then you see them more and more in your own life but that allows you to fix them. So essentially if you take this course its kind of like getting a cheat sheet to your mind. I have definitely applied strategies I have learned in this class outside the classroom. ",

With examples of studies presented well for each phenomena, students were able to know well the course material.

I certainly got a broad overview of different aspects of human (and a little bit of animal) cognition, many of our consistent irrationalities, and models of what normative thought should be. The structure of exams also forces you to synthesize information into concise bits. I think I took away a lot of ideas that can help me in other courses as well. ",

The class gave me tools to recognize why I or someone I know made a decision or assumed a certain opinion - and how to investigate whether or not that choice was rational or reasonable. I really appreciated how our thinking processes were presented in terms of normative and descriptive terms, allowing room for\u00a0irrational behavior to still make sense. This class is so applicable to real life and I was always talking about it to my friends. ",

This was the first psychology class I've taken at Yale, and it was truly incredible. I really feel like I learned a lot, not only about different heuristics people use when making judgments (as taught by the course), but about how psychology works and how research is conducted. The final paper, a research proposal, helped me get a sense of the complexities of how research is conducted. "

The quizzes at first were a bit nerve-wracking, but I think students got more accustomed to them as the semester went on. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures are GREAT!! Always engaging, super interesting and lively. Weakness are maybe that review guides didn't always map onto the tests 100%, but not a major issue! ",
            "\u00a0The course places a heavy emphasis on a large number of studies conducted that illustrate the various heuristics that we covered, and the exams consist in large part of regurgitating these studies onto the paper. However, that being said, the material was very interesting and the guest lectures were mostly engaging, and Professor Ahn is hilarious. ",

The review guides we got before each test were very helpful. It was nice to know what topics would be covered and not having the fear that I would forget something while studying. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, this course was incredibly solid in terms of the way it was taught. The quizzes were somewhat annoying at times, but in the end they only did help me, so I can't really complain. One thing that was frustrating though is how they were structured -- I saw multiple people either start early and use the lecture slides to cheat or continue doing it after they left and asking others for answer. I can't really think of any other weaknesses. ",

            "\u00a0It was a great class. I honestly don't think I would change much. Maybe assign the essay during the semester instead of at the end since it isn't worth very much? It could be used as a way to explore the topics that were covered (but I think having it at the end of the course its fine as well. ) ",
            "\u00a0The course was well designed to make sure we remembered concepts after each classes, but it was difficult to access the instructor and TFs, because office hours only occurred before an exam. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: There are weekly quizzes that make sure students have been attending their lectures attentively as well as 3 midterms which has been able to reduce the stress of student in the final week. Another thing is how course was well organized and contains much content supported with surplus example that have enabled students to understand it fully. ",

            "\u00a0This course was almost perfect. I absolutely LOVED professor Ahn, and I think the course topics were fantastic. Honestly, I think less guest lecturers would be better--even though some of them were really good, none were really as good as Professor Ahn. Additionally, I think the final paper was a good weight, along with the tests. I really loved this course and looked forward to going every Tuesday and Thursday. ",

The lectures are engaging and course materials were conveyed in a very clear and interesting way. It would be great if the course could allow even more room for thinking, such as practically applying the concepts into our real lives. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Very clearly laid out with three non-cumulative tests, quizzes at the end of every class, and a final paper. We were always given a review sheet before the test that detailed exactly what would be on the test. Professor Ahn is an amazing, funny, and riveting lecturer who does her best to help her students understand the material and truly learn. The grading is very fair, help is always available, and Professor Ahn really wants to help her students succeed. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: A lot of material was covered to the point that it was difficult to study for the tests at times even though they were non-cumulative. However, it was still manageable, and we were always given a review sheet of the topics that will be on the test. ",
            "\u00a0If you pay attention in class and study the study guides you can do well. Professor Ahn is amazing and very charismatic. The test are a bit long and for people who are even slightly slower it can be tough to finish on time. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Fantastic Professor if prof. Ahn is teaching it. Really well set up to force you to learn material. A lot of fascinating topics. Great guest lecturers. Great access to Professor Ahn. \r\nWeaknesses: I think it would have been nice to have some more connections from lecture to lecture sometimes. Obviously they were there in some capacity, but it often felt like every time we started a new topic we just left the old one completely behind. Also I think the paper was a little strangeit was worth so little it slightly deincentivized workin hard on it, and it kinda came out of nowhere. ",
            "\u00a0As a lecture class, Thinking excelled mostly due to its lecturer. Professor Ahn, the DUS of Psychology, prepared an insane amount of time for each class - and it showed. She made complicated concepts accessible to a wide range of students by making the information relatable and fun - there were many great videos, graphs, clip-art, sound effects that always kept the class laughing. Prof. Ahn is brash and bold, and she knows her stuff. \r\n\r\nId say the courses biggest weakness is the exam/grading structure: 3 huge exams worth 75% of your grade, 1 final paper (7%), and 18 low-stress mini quizzes (18%) - one at the end of each class. Putting so much weight on the 3 midterms was very stressful, as each had way too many questions to answer in the allotted time. I saw many people struggle to finish and I always felt like I didnt have time to even think through something before having to spit it out on the page. I knew this going in and took it Credit/D, which worked very well in my favor. The material is important and useful, and I appreciated being able to sit back and soak it up rather than writing every single tidbit so I could do well on the exams. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Ahn was amazing.  The lectures were extremely interesting, the quizzes after class were fair, and the final paper assignment was interesting and manageable.  The biggest strength of this class was probably the lecture quality, each lecture was clear, informative and engaging.  It was also really helpful to have all of the lectures recorded.  One weakness of the course was probably that there were no mandatory readings.  The workload of this course was pretty low, and one or two mandatory readings a week, not much, may have helped us go deeper into some of the material.  I know that she assigned optional readings, but as students, when we're trying to balance the workload of many classes, often the optional stuff gets ignored.  One other weakness of the course, was that the exams were so long, that I felt that it encouraged a lot of memorizing of answers.  We were given the exam questions in advance, but we had to write so quickly during the exam that we basically just memorized stuff in advance, which didn't feel like it contributed much to my learning. ",
            "\u00a0Incredibly engaging, real world implications, best professor ever ",
            "\u00a0This course was, in a word, perfect. It was excellently structured, creatively designed, and meticulously prepared. Professor Ahn really cares about making each joke land (and she's really funny, so it worked) and about making sure students really learn. To that end, there is a quiz at the end of every class to make sure students understood the material. I thought this would be annoying, but it turned out to actually be very helpful in figuring out what to focus on studying in the future. It also increased memory retention for the class.\r\n\r\nThe syllabus is also very forgiving. Even though the tests are worth 25% of your final grade each, a review sheet was provided beforehand which was absolutely essential in terms of preparing for the test. If you studied the review sheet, it was very easy to do well on the test.\r\n\r\nWhat's more, Professor AHn invites many guest speakers, who give lectures on their fields of study. It's truly incredible to see how many different fields of psychology there are, and how profoundly exciting they can be to the people involved in their research.\r\n\r\nI can't really think of any weaknesses of this course. It was a deeply inspiring and educational class to take, and I couldn't be happier that I took it. "

You don't have to be particularly interested in psychology to find this interesting, it appeals to a lot of different areas. There is also no hw assigned so it's not a lot of work, but you still learn a ton. I think I learned much more in this class than average even though it was less than average work. It would make a good fifth class. ",

The exams were easy to prepare for because she told you in advance everything you needed to know, your only job was to learn it. There was no ambiguity to how we would be graded in exams or the paper. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, Professor Ahn is so funny and the material is very interesting! ",
            "\u00a0Definitely recommend!! Was a good social science credit that wasn't too hard but taught me a lot. Prof. Ahn is an engaging lecturer, and I always enjoyed going to class.  If you go to class and study for a couple hours before each of the three exams, you'll do great.  No required readings or problem sets, just a short online quiz at the end of each lecture.  Prof. Ahn and the TFs made themselves quite available for questions and personal interactions., so I always felt like they really cared for the students. Overall, low workload, fun to take, and high payoff in terms of my new understanding of how people think. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this course. As a non-major, I got introduced into psych through this class. Prof. Ahn presents the material in such as interesting, yet understandable way. This class really got me interested in behavioural sciences! ",
            "\u00a0Not a lot of work, BUT a lot of studying. The first 1/3 (i.e. all material before the first midterm) is tough, but after the that the class gets better (you are more used to the exams and the material is much more engaging). Prof. Ahn is great, and she is definitely a professor you should take a class with. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Amazing class. Super fun. What I imagined college classes to be like.\r\nLearned some things that will stay with me all my life and that I can now  bring up in conversations to sound smart and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0yes ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to everyone. ",
            "\u00a0I cannot express how much I would recommend this course. It was possibly the best course I've ever taken in my life, as Professor Ahn was so funny and intellectual and was always there for her students. She was fantastic and the course was fantastic. I can't recommend it enough. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, most interesting class of my semester. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course because the content is very interesting and the workload is presented in such a way that it isn't overwhelming, but still gives students sufficient practice with the content. Daily quizzes after lecture instead of homework really helped lessen stress in general, and having study guides for tests were amazing. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anybody interested in psychology/cognitive science. It is similar to Intro Cogsci in that it is sort of a survey course of many topics in cognitive science. Professor Ahn is a great teacher and her lectures are always fun and interesting. There is no reading for the course which is great, but the workload is still fairly high with 3 exams and a final paper. That said, the exams are pretty fair, and if you use the review sheets and start studying ahead of time you should be fine. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course! You'll get exposure to many interesting topics in psychology, and you'll walk away from each lecture really feeling like you learned a lot. Professor Ahn really cares about her students and takes time to learn as many names as possible, and she finds many ways to make each class fun. The class is organized and very low-stress, and I think this class provides a fabulous way to dabble in psychology if it's not something you plan to major in. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! All the concept chosen by Professor Ahn connects closely to our daily lives, and if you are new to psychology, this is definitely a course that includes a lot of interesting theories and experiments in psychology! ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would recommend this course to another student! You definitely have to keep with the material and study ahead of time, but Professor Ahn really tries to make it as easy as possible to study and learn the material, and she is simply just a wonderful lecturer and person overall! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. The material is interesting, the professor is great, but you do have to go to class and pay attention before you study for the exams. ",
            "\u00a0This is undoubtedly one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. Professor Ahn is utterly fantastic, and probably the first professor I have genuinely gotten to know well even though this was a lecture course! It has almost no day to day work so you dont have to sacrifice time from your schedule for it (although you do have to go to absolutely every lecture since theres a quiz, but lecture is so enjoyable you will want to go.), but you will nevertheless learn a ton. Professor Ahn has a dog she brings to class sometimes so theres that bonus. Shes also very easy to get to know and genuinely interested in geting to know everyone in the class. Exams are straightforward and the grading is as generous as it gets. If youve ever vaguely wondered about why you make dumb decisions or if something you thought makes sense, take this class. This class was legitimately FUN to attend (I am not a psych person). I actually looked forward to lecture as I always left feeling great, like I was learning cool stuff and I had a professor who cared about me, which did wonders for me on days when other classes (cough cough MATH 120) were making me question every last person who ever claimed college is enjoyable and Yale has good teaching. So yeah TAKE THIS CLASS! ",
            "\u00a0Definitely, though I doubt itll be taught again soon. If DUS Ahn teaches ANYTHING in the next few years, TAKE THAT CLASS. Consider taking it Cr/D depending on the grading structure, but please take it. She makes so much information accessible to different types of people and got our class really pumped about psychology. You may even get a visit from her lovely dog! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student.  The material was extremely interesting, and extremely relevant to our daily lives as it gave me a lot of insight into all of the biases that happen when we process information and try to make decisions.  Professor Ahn is a very good lecturer.  Her lectures are clear, interesting, and funny.  She also cares deeply about her students and is constantly trying to get feedback on how things went and whether we were understanding concepts.  The workload of this class was also on the low side, which was nice given that I took it senior fall, and needed to focus on the senior requirement for my major.  Would definitely recommend if you're looking for an interesting class, that's useful to you later in life, and that has a manageable workload. ",
            "\u00a0YES!! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely!!! I would recommend this course to anyone who has any burgeoning interest in psychology, or simply wants to expand their knowledge of the field. But to be honest, I don't know if I would recommend it if it were taught by anyone other than Professor Ahn, who is easily one of the most engaging, adept teachers I've ever had the fortune of learning from. ",
