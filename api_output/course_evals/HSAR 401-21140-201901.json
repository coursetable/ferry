            "\u00a0I learned a lot in this class about how to approach art from a theoretical perspective rather than a physical or historical perspective, which is very different from all the other art history classes available. Because of this class I feel much more comfortable as an art historian in writing and speaking. I think that this class allows for you to develop your own voice while relying on the iconic voices of art history to help you. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to critically analyze texts and how to apply them in critical discussions of art. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are the small class size, the fact that almost all students are art history majors, and the combination of having both a professor and a TA is very very helpful. \r\nI think that there is so much material to go through each class and during the semester, which can be really tough and it feels like we are just dipping our toes into the material. Obviously, this is still a survey course of sorts so that is expected. ",
            "\u00a0I wish that we spend more time making sure we all understood the readings rather than just jumping into discussions about whatever artwork we were shown that day. Especially with dense, theoretical, and intellectual papers, I find it hard to comment/speak in section if I am unsure about the premise of the work. I would prefer if we were told the steps we should take in interpreting work, and how we should deal with problematic works (i.e. \"Africa has no history\"), rather than just being told we ~should~ deal with them. ",
            "\u00a0This course with Prof. Suthor should have had more structure and context do the readings. I would have benefitted from a 10/15 min introduction in a lecture style at the beginning of class on the readings. I also think the requirements and guidelines for presentations and essays were extremely unclear. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of the course is the syllabus. The readings were really important and very well-chosen. Another strength was being in the gallery. Every class was in the gallery, and it was great to connect the readings to an actual work that we could examine. "

        [
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course. You read and think about a lot of other peoples' work, but I think this course ultimately gives you the tools to write and think about art for yourself in a really powerful and freeing way. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to a non-art history major. Without past exposure and classes one can easily get lost in the rhetoric, intellectual language, and dense theories of some of the readings (which I often did). ",
            "\u00a0It's a requirement for History of Art. I would recommend it to people of any major depending on the Professor that teaches. I would not recommend to take it with Professor Suthor, she did not establish a clear structure for classes or expectations for the assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It is very important information for any Art History student. Writing the papers was really helpful, and I enjoyed connecting readings to a work in the gallery. There was a lot of flexibility in choosing your presentation and essay topics. "
