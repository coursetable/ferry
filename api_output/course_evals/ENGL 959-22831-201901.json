            "\u00a0One sign that this class was either extremely successful or temporarily disorienting  is the hesitation I now feel handling the concepts \"knowledge,\" \"skill,\" and \"insight.\" At their best, the exercises in relational thinking that we conducted explored not so much a body of transmissible knowledge (call it \"relational philosophy\") as a way of thinking about what knowledge does, how it gets made, who it affects, what sorts of collisions and comparisons produce it, and so on. Does this kind of relational thinking count as a skill? Maybe, and if so, it would be something like the skill of poetic thinking (thinking as making, thinking that aspires to make something happen). Somehow this feels hard to square with the idea of \"insight.\" Is vision the best metaphor for this kind of thinking? Does it involve penetrating or seeing into the core of something? Probably not. But then again, neither does it involve blindness. "

            "\u00a0This was in many ways an unusual class, so I want to answer this prompt carefully. I want wholeheartedly to affirm the class as an experiment, while at the same time expressing some reservations and ambivalences about the results of that experiment. Let me say all the good stuff upfront. This class allowed and encouraged everyone to take intellectual risks, which is no small achievement. It got us  to think hard about the meaning of philosophy and about the relationship between philosophy as a practice and philosophy as a discipline. And it got us to think hard about what counts as philosophy, what counts as knowledge, what counts as a meaningful (rather than an arbitrary) relation, and so on. \r\n\r\nMoreover, this class had a great syllabus, full of stand-alone bangers and suggestively counter-intuitive comparisons. (For what it's worth, I particularly enjoyed our discussions of Marx, Glissant, and Haraway, although I never figured out the appeal of Barad.) Much to Noreen's credit, the syllabus was creative and eclectic, and the use of unlikely pairings allowed us to think intelligently and probingly about questions that, for whatever reason, routinely go unasked of certain canonical philosophers. For instance, it's very easy -- in fact, it's probably the norm -- to attend a class on Heidegger and never talk about gender. Read alongside Haraway, Heidegger's philosophy begged to be interrogated along these lines, and gender became an unavoidable area of inquiry and interest. This was great. It let us read Heidegger (and others) against the grain, and it generated interesting new disagreements. \r\n\r\nHaving mentioned all these virtues, let me note a few reasons for my ambivalence. I mention them here just in case Noreen decides to offer this class again (and I hope she will!). As I said above, I thought the decision to organize each session around a particular pairing allowed us to make surprising new connections. Yet it also inhibited us, at times, from arriving at a shared understanding of the texts being related. In other words, we sometimes started thinking about the relation between two texts that we hadn't yet grasped on their own, and as a result we found ourselves swimming in a sea of undefined concepts rather than floating on a raft of clearly arranged ideas. Perhaps only neurotics seek clear arrangements of this kind. But who can quell the fear of drowning?\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the unusual principle of organization that structured this class ruled out the possibility that our readings would follow a narrative arc. Of course, such a narrative isn't always necessary. And since this wasn't a course in the history of philosophy, there was no reason to expect one. But sometimes a background narrative was hinted at, but left untouched. For instance, in the first class Noreen began to sketch a historical argument about the emergence of what we now call \"theory\" sometime in the early 19th century. There was  some implication in that opening monologue that we would explore how theory and philosophy relate to each other, and where \"theory\" came from. But we never really pursued that line of thought. And neither \"theory\" nor \"relational thinking\" was ever much historicized. \r\n\r\nThat may not be a bad thing at all. In fact, it may be a very good thing, especially to the extent that it encouraged creative new readings of texts from many different periods. But I did wonder whether it explained why some of our own projects at the end of the course were motivated by seemingly Platonic lines of questioning, rather than by, say, more interactive lines of questioning. The questions we ended up asking were often of this order: \"What is emptiness?\" \"What is identity?\" \"What is a relation?\" \"What is the secular? What is a world?\" Not of this order: \"how is 'emptiness' constituted by X discourse?\" \"Under what conditions is the assertion of an identity politically productive?\" \"How does the discourse of secularism function in this or that context?\" "
