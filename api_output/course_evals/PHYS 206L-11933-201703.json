            "\u00a0Through this course, I developed my knowledge of error analysis, report writing, and knowledge of so many various physical phenomena through the labs my partner and I did. We did the transistor lab, superconductivity lab, accelerator labs, and from each one, I felt I learned something tangible. ",

            "\u00a0In lab you replicate a lot of nobel-prize winnings experiments in a condensed setting. It's a lot of fun  though a lot of work writing up lab reports. Definitely get ready for some late night before's. 205 may have been a bore, but 206 is awesome. ",
            "\u00a0Very broad ranging, learns a little about lots of different physics topics. Also got much better at experimental physics in general ",
            "\u00a0I got a lot better at LaTeX, but that was pretty much it. It's an introductory lab. Not a lot of fun, but a necessary evil. ",
            "\u00a0This class did a good job of developing insight into experimental design for different phenomena in physics. I developed my ability to think through how the quantities were measured and how to best report the data that I had collected. ",

            "\u00a0206 is much more independently driven than 205, which is a huge plus. You and your partner get to pick the labs you do, you aren't graded on your lab notebook; the sole metric by which you are graded in this class is the lab report, which is pretty nice. However, some of the labs offered in 206 are out of date, unclear, and just too long. I know of people in this class who were unable to finish the lab in the allotted time, and had to return to the lab the following week to finish the work. The workload is different for everyone across the board. Many of the labs are longer and simply more work than other labs, which steers people away from the harder investigations. There are even some labs in this class that haven't been done before in recent years. Thankfully, the lab instructors are making active efforts to add more labs, rewrite the older labs, and so on. Plus, 206 takes place in the new SCL lab, so the class is really improving constantly, but there's still some work to go. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: experiments are really interesting and informative, and the lack of quizzes/exams/busy work enables you to really take time and dive into the labs.  Weaknesses: grading is sometimes inconsistent and the expectations can be unclear, also it should be a full credit based on the time it takes. ",
            "\u00a0This course is honestly as fun as one can expect any lab class to be! Though the lab reports were a lot of work I've emerged with a better understanding of the kind of equipment and techniques used by real physicists, and got to witness some pretty awesome phenomena! ",
            "\u00a0At the beginning of the course, I wish we had slightly more of an introduction to the lab so we could know how to write lab reports and correctly take data, since sometimes it is not very clear. Though i guess that's the point... ",
            "\u00a0Some pre-labs are written in a confusing way, and some of them aren't updated so we are told changes to the lab when we get there. The experiments are really cool, I liked that we could pick our own labs ",
            "\u00a0The lab handouts really need to be edited before this course is taught again. There are a lot of errors interspersed throughout the handouts and the nuclear reactions handout in particular is practically unreadable, with glaring equation errors and references to non-existent equations. ",
            "\u00a0The largest strength of the class is in the design, with the ability to choose the most interesting experiments from a larger list. This meant that I did not have to spend as much time doing experiments that I was not interested in at all. However, this meant that more independence was needed to perform the experiments. The biggest weakness of the class was that the experimental guides didn't always do a good job of highlight areas that you should pay attention to during an experiment, relying more on the independent spirit of the class. This was usually okay during the lab as any questions could be answered by the professors, who were very knowledgeable about all the experiments. The only difficulty lay in the write-up, which would sometimes require data that was not marked as needing to be written down. The experimental guides could have done a slightly better job highlighting these points, although with enough preparation this was not usually an issue. ",
            "\u00a0I dont feel like this course really had any progressionmy ability to complete labs and write lab reports was essentially constant. The lab reports that I got back had minimal feedback, making it hard to know where my scientific writing needed most improvement. Considering that I did not do very well on some of my lab reports, this was somewhat concerning. ",
            "\u00a0This class was very focused on the lab reports, but mostly on things that were not as interesting, i.e. formatting and not making egregious mistakes. The reports themselves were also very long and it was difficult to have to write them every week along with my class schedule. I would like this course to have greater focus in the lab portion rather than the writing portion. ",
            "\u00a0I found the course to be very strong.  The experiments were very interesting and students were given a level of autonomy that made it very easy to engage with the material.  The only thing that could be improved is that some of the newer experiment guides are very difficult to understand and full of information that did not seem very relevant to what we were doing in the actual experiment. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed being able to select which labs I completed, and I believe everyone was able to do each of the labs they selected. As for the labs themselves, I felt that for the most part they were clear and easy to understand. When I was confused or stuck, help was readily available. Apart from fixing small errors in experiment guides that were occasionally confusing, I can think of no improvements. "

        [
            "\u00a0If you have to take it, yes, but make sure to carefully consider which labs you would take! Before the first lab tour, sit down and look through all the lab handouts and see which you prefer. I absolutely recommend the superconductivity lab wholeheartedly; it's super fun, mindbogglingly cool, and you get to investigate cool electromagnetic effects of superconductivity. ",
            "\u00a0A solid course, I'd recommend it.  It takes a decent amount of time/effort (spent more time on it than any of my full-credit classes this semester), but the experiments are really interesting and there's no busy work or annoying assignments like 205L.  Your experience is pretty much completely dependent on what labs you do, so here's my take on them.  QM: cool experiment, pretty straightforward, would recommend.  DL: might recommend, the experiment is a little convoluted and there's little that's new if you've worked with integrated circuits before, but you don't actually take any data so it's easy to do well on the report.  XD: cool and useful, especially if you're into materials science, but the data analysis takes forever and the utility of what you learn probably isn't worth slogging through the number crunching.  ED: would definitely recommend, probably my favorite one, you use a 50 year old cathode ray tube to literally see the spacing between aluminum atoms, writeup takes some time but the concepts are straightforwards.  SC: would also definitely recommend, you make things levitate, writeup is straightforward.  SS: would not recommend, this one is a waste of time, the technique you use is so bad that you'll occasionally get bigger uncertainties than your measured quantities themselves and you'll probably bomb the report because your analysis will be useless against this nightmarish data.  AR: would recommend, it will make the way you think about waves much more intuitive.  AI: would definitely recommend, aligning lasers is super frustrating but once you power through it, interferometry is a really cool and versatile technique.  RS:  absolutely, you can't let yourself take this class without doing one of the accelerator labs and this one is straightforward. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a requirement for most of the physics-related majors, so yes, take it! The labs are quite fun - you'll get to replicate some of the really seminal results from the 1900s and use very high-tech equipment like a particle accelerator, though your results may not be super accurate. ",
            "\u00a0Yep, 206L is a fantastic lab course. Odds are you need to take it for your major, but regardless it is fantastic, especially in comparison to 205L. ",
            "\u00a0Fun physics lab, especially if u like experiments ",
            "\u00a0There are very few people who will take this course fo fun. However, PHYS206L, while mandatory, is not bad and does provide a good introduction for a number of interesting topics, including nuclear reactions, X-ray diffractions, Bragg-scattering, and interferometry. The write-ups are pretty brutal, but if you begin data analysis right after (or during) the experiment, it's not terrible. I also highly recommend learning at least a little bit of LaTeX before starting the course. It will make your life much easier. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to another student. The class is structured in such a way that students can pick from a list the set of experiments that they would like to do. The preparation for each experiment is usually on the lighter side, and it is often beneficial for a student to prepare for a while beforehand in order to have a good idea of what data to collect and what experiments to run. The workload was pretty reasonable as the only thing that was graded from the class were weekly lab reports. The biggest weakness of the class is that because there are so many experiments and not every group does the same set, sometimes experiments can be hit or miss, with some having better support than others. ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend this course if it is requiredyou dont learn much outside of doing the labs. ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend this course to physics majors. It is a lot of time commitment for a non-major to consider taking this lab, especially if its only a half credit. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to any student interested in gaining a deeper understanding of Physics and research. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student as long as they had an interest in physics. I think this class can be worthwhile to non-physics majors, but it is certainly most rewarding to students who are required to take the course. "
