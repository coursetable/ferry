            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the design process; an effective tool for any discipline: whether one is an engineer, architect or artist. \r\n\r\nOut of the many canonical diagrams that Joe showed us, I found the desirable, feasible, viable one to be the most useful. I will definitely be using it in the future when deciding on the worth of my side projects.\r\n\r\nI learned how to better work in teams. The post-it sessions were the best opportunity to brainstorm absurd ideas that got laughs and kept things relaxed. ",
            "\u00a0The interesting thing about this class is it focuses on real-world problems and asks you to solve them. You spend time researching and understanding the client to determine their needs, and from there you identify areas of improvement. Because of its structure, it teachers you the very important skill of keeping the user/client in mind when trying to solve problems. ",
            "\u00a0Where do I even start?? As a mechanical engineering major, I havent taken a single hands on class until this one. What you learn is a little project dependent. In the beginning of the semester everyone did the same thing, so we all go really well versed on the ins and outs of the Peabody Museum. My project was building heavy, so I learned how to use several of the machine and tools in the CEID. Throughout the course, we learned about the design process and working with clients. ",
            "\u00a0You will learn a great deal about problem solving, thinking on your feet, adapting to an ever-changing assignment, and working with your teammates through some high intensity situations. ",
            "\u00a0I took this course as my senior design requirement for Mechanical Engineering and I am so glad I did. It definitely puts engineering and related fields into perspective since you directly work with the clients and get feedback from them. ",
            "\u00a0Learning how to carry a project from start to finish. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a ton about the Peabody museum and some basic principles of design thinking. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a huge amount of background knowledge about the workings of the Peabody, as well as significant concrete experience with applied circuitry, surface-mount soldering, and high quality 3-D prints. ",
            "\u00a0How to imagine a design process, focus ideas, and generate real-world offerings. ",
            "\u00a0This course afforded me a much greater understanding of the workings of the Yale Peabody Museum and the working of museums in general. I learned the basics of coding, design, and other useful skills. This course was much more skill-based than other Yale College courses. We did not, however, spend the whole semester working on a single project.  The course was broken up into a research phase and a building phase. The actual project work comprised the last 4 weeks of class. ",
            "\u00a0Making Spaces is a project-based course focused on rethinking a \"space,\" this semester being the Peabody Museum. This class allowed for a hands-on real-world, real-client working experience and one involving working alongside students from a wide variety of disciplines. "
        ],

            "\u00a0The actual project work is in the latter third of the course - so we were pressed for time. \r\n\r\nThe staff doesn't actually teach the tools and technologies you need to build out a project - you need to teach yourself (however, Ashlyn and Kristoffer were always happy to introduce us to the tools in the CEID).  \r\n\r\nWere it not for this class, I wouldn't have rushed to teach myself some newer technologies that I've been meaning to for a while. So I'm actually happy that it's not prescriptive and doesn't hand-hold.\r\n\r\nThis class is more about breathing life into ideas, and it gives you a great canvas - this year it was the Peabody Museum. We took a dozen field trips and familiarized ourselves with its inner workings. And then we had (almost) free-reign to build out the most promising ideas that we liked.\r\n\r\nGrading is fairly ambiguous. We weren't graded on set milestones (except for the paper + presentation early in the semester). A class like this doesn't believe in grades - so hopefully we all get automatic As instead? ",
            "\u00a0I don't have much to say on this front, as it is a great class. My only suggestions is maybe less field trips because ultimately we had very little time to focus on project and ideation. ",
            "\u00a0Its so great! It would be nice to have the workload more distributed over the semester, but they way things worked out it definitely made more sense to have a heavy last couple of week. Nothing really needs to be improved about the class. ",
            "\u00a0This class is one of the \"type 2 fun\" (for anyone who did FOOT). You will probably be driven almost crazy by it at some points, but when you are finally done and can look back on your work, you will be SO proud of what you accomplished. This is a HIGH HIGH HIGH workload - especially in the last weeks of the semester, but it is all worth it in the end. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a lot of time commitment but in the end, everything is worth it. I haven't felt this type of satisfaction from any other work I produced for other classes. It was incredible to be able to build something that actually worked! ",
            "\u00a0The best project-based course I have ever taken. It would be nice if we have one more week to work on our project. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that this course did a great job of exposing me to the work of the Peabody and serving as an introduction to design thinking. I also had a ton of fun working on the final project. \r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the course, I was under the impression that I was going to spend more time making things throughout the semester. I was looking forward to an iterative design process that was hands on. Our first assignment seemed to be in alignment with this. In reality, we spent most of the first couple of months visiting the Peabody and occasionally talking about principles of good design. Although both of these steps were important in the design process, I did not expect this to be the course's main focus.\r\n\r\nI do not intend to say that this made it a negative experience, but rather, that it was not what I had originally expected. ",
            "\u00a0This was a formative experience and one of the classes where I felt the power of the course being taught at Yale, with so many resources given to us. The extremely in-depth series of guest lectures and field trips were both the course's biggest strength and biggest weakness. They provided insider information about the Peabody and the actual problems and areas for improvement, giving the design process real weight. On the other hand, this visits stretched well past midterm, giving us an unnecessarily tight window to work on the final projects. ",
            "\u00a0This course has little academic underpinning. Joe's knowledge is invaluable, but only one class day was spent justifying the nature of our process. Often times, we were asked simply to trust Joe. In theory, we should be willing to do this, but in practice, it's likely that a bit of time spent researching and understanding good process would be valuable. Believing in a process that was not established and understood by us students was difficult. The CEID is composed of incredible resources, but so is Yale. If a team is doing a data science project to collect visitor impressions, they ought to plan how best to collect information that isn't biased and that will be useful to the entire class. Further, resources could be provided to connect that team with faculty or resources who can enable more insightful computation. I wish we had been challenged not just to produce impressive amounts of work but also to challenge our technical understanding of the work's value and method of evaluation. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- The course develops a strong sense of ownership in one's work. The course allows for the development of project and final product which makes it fun to work on. The class was never boring and it never felt like school work. I could envision performing work in a similar way if I was employed in a similar field.  This was a great strength to the class.\r\nWeaknesses- There was a clear effort to communicate the logistics and theory of design, much of this was repetitive and could be learned the first time. Poor use of in-class time would drive project meetings to be scheduled after class. These meetings were highly mandatory but often would result in scheduling conflicts.  There was definite overuse of the word awesome. The course staff, especially Joe, were eager to praise the work done, but not everything is \"awesome\" and sometimes the praise rings false. I found it more useful when the staff provided clear feedback about what is a good development and what is not. Feedback like that makes it easier to see which ideas to develop further.\r\nThe course would be very much improved by a good schedule and a clearer sense of assignments. It was often unclear how much work should be put into these open-ended projects. A series of small achievable goals might help. A predetermined schedule of out of class meetings would reduce the stress of scheduling things in the last week of class/during reading week. ",
            "\u00a0You will learn that you can do more than you thought and in less time than expected. You get to see super cool behind the scenes going ons of the Peabody museum including touring the collections and learning about exhibit designs. You also get to interact with the CEID equipment and staff and have a lot of fun learning new skills. The main flaw of the class is that you spend a bunch of time brainstorming project ideas and do not get final approval until the very last weeks so the class becomes a crunch at the end and you do not have time for other classes or activities. I was prepared for the work but I think much of stress could be alleviated if projects had been approved even a week or two sooner. ",
            "\u00a0This course was fun, exciting, engaging, and I learned a lot. The best parts of Making Spaces include the amazing field trips, incredible teaching staff, and the opportunity to work on real-world projects that may be different from work in another other class with classmates from various other disciplines. The one downside was the enormous workload (which can be expected for such interesting projects), and the (sometimes unrealistic) expectation from the professor to turn out top quality work in very short amounts of time. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes, take it if you get in! STEM courses can be a chore at Yale, but here is one of those rare exceptions, and Joe's great. ",
            "\u00a0100% take it if you get in, especially if it counts towards a senior requirement. The class is engaging and fun, and while it does have peaks where you have a decent amount of work, it was never overwhelming or any different than any other class at Yale. Your team ultimately defines what the experience is like for you--whether you will be machining for hours on end or coding or whatever else you may be doing--but you get to have input on which teams interest you the most. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Please dont go through yale engineering without taking a more hands-on, practical class - preferably with Professor Zinter! Its such a valuable learning experience and also just a fun time. ",
            "\u00a0This class will teach you more about yourself, teamwork, perseverance and problem solving than basically anything you could do on campus. Take it if you're ready for the challenge. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who is ready to challenge themselves. It is definitely not an easy class and will take a lot of time. It will all be worth it though in the end, but be prepared. ",
            "\u00a0I would strongly recommend this course, if you are willing to commit enormous time and effort to it - trust me, it's totally worth it. ",
            "\u00a0If you would like to get a better understanding of the design thinking process, definetly take this course. The teaching staff is extremely dedicated and their energy is infectious. It's also quite a unique opportunity to interact with adults that are thinking about real word design issues that might otherwise be challenging to get exposure to. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Though I didn't always agree with how Joe teaches the course, he is the most passionate and hardworking professor you will ever have. The truly ridiculous amount of work you will do in this class is because you will care so deeply about the project you come to select that seeing the final product work will be a highlight of your Yale experience. The resources available are second to none, with the materials for my two-person project coming to over $1000 and still not going over the class budget. It is hard to get in, with a pretty in-depth application, but if you get in, the group is passionate and will put in the time to make the professional-level work that is expected by the final presentations. Do not take this if the prospect of spending over 150 hours on a project is too daunting, but for me it was extremely rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Working on projects could sometimes be frustrating because the goal was so open ended, but I learned a lot and really enjoyed the class! ",
            "\u00a0YES! This course is awesome, and you'll sometimes feel overwhelmed but the experience is so worth it. ",
            "\u00a0This course is an excellent exploration into the process of design and collaborative work. The work (for the most part) feels valuable and worthwhile. The course is rather fluid in its structure and will certainly vary from year to year. I took it on a whim and I'm glad I did. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class if you're very interested in museums, want to take a class at the CEID or can do it for a senior project. If you're on the fence then you probably won't be as engaged and will not enjoy it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course (and probably any other course taught by Joe Zinter) to everyone, because it is truly an experience that cannot be found in other Yale courses. However, I should add a warning that this course has a pretty large workload, so it should be taken with fewer or lighter other courses. "
