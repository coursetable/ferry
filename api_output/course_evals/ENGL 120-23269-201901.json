            "\u00a0Learned how to write a captivating personal essay through carefully picked detail and original and surprising content. ",

            "\u00a0I learned how to write an essay using tools gathered through evaluating the class readings. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a really good contrast to other courses in its focus on more creative writing -- I was able to improve my ability to structure my writing and use meaningful analogies. I believe this course is helpful for any student in learning how to write effectively, although it is a significant time commitment with essays due every week. ",
            "\u00a0I learned different aspects and techniques of writing in different topics - writing about a personal experience, writing about a person, writing about a place, etc. ",

            "\u00a0I think the sheer volume and diversity of the essays was fascinating. But I do hope that more diverse political viewpoints can be added into the course material;making fun of Trump is fun and all, but it's kind of a waste of class time if we spend half of it making snide comments and not actually learning. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: essays read are modern and relevant to our time. They are engaging and are rarely boring. ",
            "\u00a0A weakness is that there are ten total drafts to turn in plus blog posts for every class, so it is quick turn around, and often there isn't adequate time to make quality work. A strength is that the readings are incredibly interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed this course and got very good feedback on my essays. The readings we did were interesting for the most part too, and the workshopping of our class essays was really helpful. However, I never really found out how to get a straight \"A\" on a paper, and felt the grading could be a little too subjective -- I didn't know exactly what the professor was looking for in a paper. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: this course by Professor Stuart reviews some of the most interesting, fascinating, and amazing essays I have ever read in my life, which helped me improve my writing but most importantly discover new ways of writing about people, places, and cultures. It provided me with some general and very helpful tips in non-fiction writing, namely the importance of drafts, the role of audience and voice, and the ABCDE structure. These pieces of advice demystified many notions about creative writing, which I had previously held, and gave me the confidence to write and being not ashamed of my voice. This course also showed me how the essays about seemingly neutral topics might have a very powerful message and taught me the general approaches to achieve this effect. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The first flaw of this course taught by Professor Stuart is that it often wasn't very effective in its central goal of articulating, analyzing, and then implementing the approaches and techniques from the exemplary essays we read. During the \"articulating\" and \"analyzing\" stage, this, to my mind, was the consequence of the ways in which class discussions were conducted. As a hundred level course, it is, in my understanding, designed and taken by many students, including me, who don't have significant experience in non-fiction writing and for whom this course serves as a gateway to creative non-fiction writing. Blogging was the central part of our class discussions, the way of identifying and analyzing the new techniques. When I was asked to blog about the essays, I often had no clue what I should write about. As a result, I usually opted for the aspects that I had previously known, which limited my overall learning. Similarly, I felt that the content of my classmates' blogs sometimes contributed little to the learning of the new techniques. I agree that discovering new techniques by ourselves and learning from the classmates' perspectives was occasionally helpful, but I wish we could enter blogging and reading of the essays with a set of specific questions and points of attention (there were some, but they were really ambiguous and helped little), which would help us identify and analyze the techniques and approaches Professor Stuart wanted us to show in those essays. Also, even when some new aspects were brought up, we didn't take time to explain how they were achieved and what effect they had - we quickly jumped to another student and his/her observations. If there are 2 or more essays that share the same technique or approach, I wish that Professor Stuart first explained us this technique in the context of one of the essay and only then asked us to show and analyze that technique in another essay by ourselves. That would be much more productive and conducive to learning.   \r\nI, unfortunately, think that the implementation part was almost absent in this course, at least in my case. It has never been stated that we have to implement any of the approaches we discussed, nor I have ever received any suggestion in my feedback, which would prompt me to implement something from the essays we read. Unfortunately, looking back on my essays, I notice my tendency of using the same, general approaches such as ABCDE structure, framing device, long/short sentences, and emphasis on the last sentence in a paragraph. There has been so much more which I wish I have learned and implemented but couldn't do so due to the lack of appropriate feedback and the issues in the learning stage. It might be much more productive to have many little, ungraded assignments, which would target specific techniques. It might be also much more productive to focus on fewer essays, take more time analyzing specific techniques, and make students master those in their essays. I think it would make much more sense for this class as an introductory writing course, in which I expected to learn a lot of fundamental methods and polish them through continuous and intensive practice.

            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Prof Stuart is amazing, the essays she has chosen for readings are incredibly enjoyable and her feedback is super helpful when writing your own. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you have the time, the course is super interesting and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course was enjoyable and useful in improving more creative writing. However would not recommend for people who don't like writing creatively. ",
            "\u00a0It depends on a student, but more so on the instuctor's ability to address the course's weaknesses as well as the following problem -- the lack of any communication about the expectations from the students' works. It has been unclear from the very beginning what is expected from my essay: Should it demonstrate the techniques we discussed during the class? Is it about the effectiveness of my public point? Or is perphaps about how unique and detailed my public point is? I suppose it is about all of these aspects, but I wish they were clearly outlined and divided into different levels, so that students could see where they stand, why they got the grade they got, and what aspects should be improved. In the lack of any defined expectations, it was frustrating receiving feedback and grades that told me nothing about my progress and the areas for my improvement. On top of that, I have consistently received the similar grades regardless of how much effort I put into my writting, indicating the absence of any improvement, which was very frustrating, but honestly expected in such absence of expectations.
