            "\u00a0I learned that there are far more conspiracy theories than I could have ever imagined, and was surprised by the popularity of some of these theories ",
            "\u00a0Learned about a bunch of different conspiracy theories and how they influence ideas in society ",
            "\u00a0I learned about many different conspiracy theories, how they came about, what kinds of people believe in them, and how these theories affect the world. I also learned about whether and how to engage and form connections with people who hold fringe beliefs. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to spot and evaluate conspiratorial thinking and how such thinking influences our daily lives and interactions. I learned the reasons for such thinking and how to combat it. I also learned how to better understand and navigate the current media landscape. "

            "\u00a0Strength: use of the projector to show videos; field trip to the Met\r\nWeaknesses: in a class of 5 people, it sometimes felt difficult to engage with the material when we all shared the exact same point of view ",
            "\u00a0Interesting material, but there were 100-200 pages of reading each week that honestly did not come up in discussion often. The meeting time needed more structure, but the biggest problem was that there was no substance planned for the course beyond the readings. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: well-curated syllabus of captivatingly bizarre conspiracy theories and a wide array of both academic and popular writings about them. Interesting class discussions that were fairly student-led and allowed us to discuss whatever we found most interesting about our assigned readings. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes, the class discussions felt a little bit too free-flowing -- I'm glad that we got to discuss whatever areas of the readings the students felt most drawn to, but I do think that I would've gotten more out of the class if the discussions were a bit more structured and came to slightly more contained conclusions. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course had a great selection of topics and diversity of readings. However, towards the end of the course, it started to feel like we were retreading the same ground in terms of the reasons for conspiratorial thinking, since a lot of conspiracies have similar belief structure and root causes. I'm not sure what could be done to improve this though. "

            "\u00a0No, while the title sounds interesting and it's cool to learn about conspiracy theories through the readings, the 2-hour class discussion every week usually stagnated because there isn't always another layer that takes 2 hours to unpack. It might have been interesting to look at this topic through a psychological lens, but discussions were not oriented from any particular perspective and no one really had any enlightening points to bring to the table. While I learned a lot about conspiracy theories through readings, I didn't really gain any deeper knowledge through the class meetings, which were mostly unstructured, something that doesn't work very well when you only have 5 people in a discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially if you are interested in who/what lies at the fringes of society and will have a lot to say/discuss about a variety of conspiracy theory groups. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student interested in topics like conspiratorial thinking, \"fake news\", and internet cultures. They will develop a more critical understanding of these topics and how different modes of thinking around them arise. After taking this course, they will be better able to navigate the current media landscape with a critical mindset. "
