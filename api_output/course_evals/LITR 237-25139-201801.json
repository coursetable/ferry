            "\u00a0Grasp on music theory, German European and Christian intellectual history, and great/difficult philosophical literature ",
            "\u00a0This class allows you to become intimately familiar with the novel Dr. Faustus, and thus a number of related topics  some music theory, german philosophy, faust tradition, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about Thomas Mann, Germany history and culture. Close reading of a text with analysis and discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Learned to write regularly, read closely with an eye for constant external and internal references, my understanding of ideas concerning language, music, religion, German thinkers/history was expanded. Good book, but very dense and difficult to enter into. However, discussions were really FANTASTIC, in large part because of the work Professor Hagens did in setting them up. ",
            "\u00a0this class is singlehandedly the best i have taken at yale. reading one text in depth was an amazing experience that we often don't get at yale-- in most classes this book would be read in 2 or 3 weeks, but having the time to really take time with the text helped tremendously. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Excellent material, and what the class needs for future iterations is a schedule that better targets which chapters to cover during which discussions and whether a certain chapter set is too ambitious, since there were some days when we skipped several chapters due to time constraints. This is entirely understandable because the novel is so large and because this was the first time that the course was taught. ",
            "\u00a0It was great, very student driven which was successful because of the initiative of the students, but Prof Hagen was a very trusty guide as well. ",
            "\u00a0there aren't many weaknesses. it's a tough book and professor hagens definitely demands quite a bit of work and engagement-- but that is what makes the course so rewarding! "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0A very good course. Professor Hagens is one of the kindest and most supportive instructors I have worked with. The novel and all the secondary material is compelling and interesting and you will cover a lot of ground--even if you, like me, have done little reading related to Mann, Martin Luther, music theory, or German Intellectual History. Because it was the course's first year, it has some ground to cover to become more structured, but in it's current form the class was still excellent. ",
            "\u00a0Id recommend this class if youre pretty certain you like the book  it can get a little tedious by the end if you dont love Mann. Professor Hagens is very attuned to his students needs, and open to changing the way parts of the course work depending on what students are getting out of it. ",
            "\u00a0Great class one of Thomas Mann's greatest books. You spend the entire semester reading Doctor Faustus so you really immerse yourself in the novel. Besides the book there is a lot of supplementary reading that is often illuminating in building an understanding of the novel. ",
            "\u00a0I'm not sure if this class will ever be offered again, but if so you should definitely take it. The class goes wayyy beyond Doctor Faustus itself and makes you think about topics like the function of art in the modern world, Nietzsche's philosophy, the national character of German, etc. There are a lot of small assignments constantly (short responses, etc.) which is actually great because you know how you're doing at all times. Also I'd never read a single book over the course of a semester before and doing so makes you attached to the novel in a way that's very hard to achieve when you're reading things quickly week after week. ",
            "\u00a0yes. i could not recommend this course more highly. "
