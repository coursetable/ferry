            "\u00a0This lab was very important for learning practical skills involved with meteorology and environmental surveys, especially because we got hands on experience with high-grade equipment. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about certain aspects of what climatologists and meteorologists do, which was interesting, and how to infer information from these activities. I also reacquainted myself with Excel, whether that's a good thing or not. I learned how to cram many hours of Excel and other lab work into a very short amount of time. ",
            "\u00a0How to take atmospheric measurements, so some basic statistical analysis, and MICROSOFT EXCEL. ",
            "\u00a0Got to learn about how atmospheric measurement is taken. And how to make graphs in Excel. Lots and lots and lots and lots of graphs in Excel. And then a few more. ",
            "\u00a0I learned basic things about the gathering, analyzing and presenting scientific data. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to use a variety of instruments and to carefully analyze the data we got from them. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to measure many atmospheric variables and understood how all measuring devices worked. I learned about how the atmosphere is measured and recorded and how to read skew-t diagrams. ",
            "\u00a0This lab course is not great. It sucks that it is required for the course because the lecture course is great, but the lab is not very interesting and is kind of a drag. As far as labs go, it is definitely not the worst one I've taken at Yale. It's only a two hour session once a week and there are only 5 lab reports during the course of the term. But they were super demanding and mostly oriented around data analysis and Excel graphing, which I didn't care for because I don't want to be a research scientist. The final exam was extremely difficult, and came out of the blue because the rest of the class wasn't super hard. ",
            "\u00a0Lots of unnecessary stuff. This lab should be optional. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to use various instruments used to make measurements of air pressure, humidity, wind speed and direction, and more. We learned analytical skills and some excel techniques. We also went over the science of some of the concepts taught in the lecture part of the course. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: some pretty interesting experiments\r\nWeaknesses: too much focus on Excel, students were kind of blindsided by the final ",
            "\u00a0This course shouldn't be required in conjunction with the EVST201/G&G140 class, but it did expose us to different aspects of meteorology. It could be vastly improved by shortening the lab period in which we meet every week. A strength was the breakup of labs, though, as we did the lab one week, discussed it the next week, and handed it in the following week. ",
            "\u00a0This course should not be required as an accompaniment to G&G 140.  It felt disjointed, disorganized, and surface-level.  As a survey course, G&G 140 didn't lend itself to any kind of meaningful lab work. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the field trip and getting to play with the measurement toys. Fun to know how they actually get the data we're talking about in class. I do feel like some of it complemented the class well and I do understand why the lab needs to be taken with the class, even if I didn't love it.\r\n\r\nThere was too much busywork, though not as much as some labs at Yale. The fourth lab was largely a waste of time. We did learn a few concepts from it, but there was no need to have to repeat all of the graphing so many times--just have us do each technique once and call it good. Also it used a ton of paper to turn in that report which was a bit unfortunate. ",
            "\u00a0the strength of this course is that it has a clear progression week to week and it is engaging for most weeks. This course might be improved by more comprehensive lab work during the meeting times, leaving the lab reports to outside of class. ",
            "\u00a0The class was very long but it was interesting and we were given a lot of time to ask questions and explore the materials given to us. We did some interesting experiments and I would have liked to spend more time doing hands-on work like that than sitting in the lab. ",
            "\u00a0I just didn't enjoy the lab. It wasn't that difficult, but I didn't find the lab reports engaging. Each one covered SO much content and it was hard to keep up. They were demanding lab reports (each around 10 pages) and required very precise data analysis and graphs. I didn't feel like, given the amount of time I spent working on the lab reports, that I got an equal amount out of the lab class. The lectures on their own would have been enough for me. Not sure how the course could be improved, except for just easing up on how much content is covered in each lab report. ",
            "\u00a0This course should be optional. There wasn't very much meaningful overlap with the lecture course. Also, grading was too harsh. One medium mistake on a presentation doesn't warrant a B. ",
            "\u00a0The lab could have been completed in a shorter timescale, the teaching fellow took too long wasting time during the lab as we had ample time waiting for it to be set up. ",
            "\u00a0It is cool to get real world experience of the material we learn in the lecture part of this course. Several of the labs are pretty interesting, especially the ones that involve actually going outside, learning how to use different instruments, and making measurements. The last presentation felt relatively pointless, although the report that we had to read to make the presentation was interesting. The course also felt pretty slow at times, though it was nice to have time to ask questions. "

            "\u00a0You don't have a choice, but if you have a good TF it isn't too bad. ",
            "\u00a0No. It was often a tedious lab, but if you're really interested in the topic or meteorology, go for it. ",
            "\u00a0You have to take it if you're taking G&G 140.  Otherwise, I wouldn't have.  G&G 140 is a great class, but it's also a survey course that doesn't lend itself to any kind of meaningful lab work. ",
            "\u00a0I didn't hate this lab as much as some other reviews. I think it's a lot about your attitude and if you see it as a chance to get away from all of the snakes of Yale and just get to take measurements and go outside some, you might not hate it either. \r\n\r\nDefinitely get Yana for a TF if you can and she's still there! She was very nice, caring, and made it as pleasant as possible.\r\n\r\nGoing to the lab was actually kind of fun, my TF (Yana) was wonderful and made it as good as she possibly could, and it was nice to get out and measure the stuff with the rivers--rejuvenating to get off campus even for just a couple hours.\r\n\r\nI wish some of the busywork would be eliminated, especially because Lab 4 sucked; I wish we could've gathered at least some of our own data for that instead of just making graphs in excel. And then made fewer graphs since repeating the process four times of clicking through, changing the colors, etc, wasn't really helping me learn at all. But still, it didn't take THAT long. I'd say I spent two hours on each of the first two reports, four on the third, and five on the fourth. And preparing the presentation was kind of fun and interesting actually, plus didn't take very long.\r\n\r\nThe exam was pretty easy if you'd been paying attention and taking notes. Make sure to remember the working principle of each of the pieces of equipment. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to anyone going into the physical or earth sciences and to anyone looking for more lab experience. Some of the skills are immediately applicable when doing research work outside of coursework. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's a requirement for Atmospheres, Oceans, and Environmental Change. It allowed us to experience for ourselves some of the environmental phenomena and instruments that we learned about in lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Again, the lab is required so it doesn't really matter. If the requirements ever changed, I would only recommend the lab to people who are interested in data analysis, field science, or research. The lab where we go visit different sites on the Q River was good, and helped me understand how to use research equipment. But overall the idea of receiving data sets and having to do a bunch of analysis on them does not appeal to me, as I don't intend to go into a research career. ",
            "\u00a0No, but the EVST science class choices don't give you much of an option. ",
            "\u00a0I would not reccomend this lab to another student because it takes up a large amount of time to complete the lab reports for just a half credit class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course because the lecture course that goes with it is awesome. The lab can be cool too, you get to go outside a lot and make measurements and get real world experience of things you learn in the lecture, but mostly it feels like an extra part of the lecture course.
