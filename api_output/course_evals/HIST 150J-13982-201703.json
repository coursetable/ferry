            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the nuances of disparities in health and health care, such as race, socioeconomic status, gender and geographic location. I learned about particular historical movements and the hidden elements that make them more complex than they seem to be. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me to evaluate the current health care system through a number of different lenses including evolutionary, gender, racial and socioeconomic lenses. It taught me to really question and understand who is deserving of healthcare and what makes that person deserving. This class also gave me a good foundation for archival research which will be very necessary for later research and senior projects. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a foundation in the history of healthcare for marginalized groups in America ",
            "\u00a0I analyzed the history of healtch care provision for the urban poor. This course tackled a wide range of topics from federal anti-poverty policy, the intersections of feminism and health, community health centers, academic hospital dynamics, and more. I learned how to formulate historical arguments and how to access and incorporate primary sources. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the history of healthcare in the united states. I also gained a lot of analytical reading and writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0I had some background knowledge going into this course, but I feel like a lot of the ideas I had were either expanded upon or challenged after taking this course. ",
            "\u00a0This class was incredibly interesting. I felt that I learned to read historic texts more critically and became better at working to understand opinions different from my own. "

            "\u00a0Though the readings for this course were great, the class itself was sometimes a little unstructured. There were often silences when conversation lagged or no one knew the answer to a particular question. However, this may have been a function of the time of day (9:25 a.m. to 11:15 a.m.). ",
            "\u00a0This class did a really good job at looking at different groups and their interactions with the healthcare system throughout history. This was really good at helping me understand how different factors of identity could impact one's access to care, but since it was only semi-chronological it became difficult to place different events in relation to others. That being said, we also kept a running timeline of all events discussed in each week, which really helped counter that. Overall, I think Professor Abedin was able to facilitate good discussion and really focus on different groups in different spaces while keeping touch with the order of each event. ",
            "\u00a0A great syllabus and healthy seminar environment! ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course was its solid reading list that helped us make connections between the past and present. The class timeline was also a great way to place the events mentioned in perspective. Discussion flowed well. One improvement would be to have example papers that would help students understand what is expected from them from the assignments. I would also consider perhaps incorporating a comparative element so students can see how health care systems differ by country. ",
            "\u00a0The readings for this class were excellent. They provided diverse perspectives on the opportunities and limitations of different systems of healthcare for the urban poor, and how those interventions changed over time. The final paper provided a great opportunity to apply insights from class discussions to our own research interests.\r\n\r\nI wished that class discussions were led at a slightly higher level; sometimes, it felt like they stayed at a surface level. I think this could be improved if the professor asked follow-up questions of people to challenge their thinking, or pointed people to specific passages in the texts and asked questions about those passages when discussions started to become too general. ",
            "\u00a0This class was really great because it was organized chronologically which made the confusing history of healthcare easier to learn about. ",
            "\u00a0An early morning section is always rough, but over time I feel like people were more engaged as the time went on. As much as I enjoyed this course, I also feel like some weeks where it was harder to go beyond/understand the \"obvious\" conclusion. \r\nI liked the idea of the weekly questions, but I wonder if it might be more engaging if one/two student per week had to come up with major guiding questions instead of doing the timeline. The timeline was most helpful for me when I had to add to the timeline, but I honestly never referred back to it besides that moment. ",
            "\u00a0The class did a great job having us read a great deal of works from a variety of sources. I do wish we had read a few more primary sources. I also wish we couldve discussed other mediums of media such as movies or videos. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It not only taught me about the recent history of health care in America, but it made me rethink my role in the system given my race, class and gender. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to any Yale Student interested in race and gender relationships and/or any aspect of the healthcare system. We looked at the development of the modern healthcare system from the side of the medical profession, policy side and insurance perspective, and then applied it to different groups and how they were treated throughout the last 2 centuries. Thus, I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in any of these topics, or would like to learn more about them. Lecture is pretty concentrated in these areas so if they do not interest you, it might not be the class for you. If you are, I think you would really enjoy this class. ",
            "\u00a0Ye! Take it if you get in ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This course takes a historical approach to healthcare. Expect to rely heavily on primary sources for your papers. This course really helped me put the issues of health care into perspective! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course provides a valuable critical perspective on how the patchwork system of healthcare for the urban poor has developed over time. I especially appreciatef learning about radical alternatives that emerged in the late 20th century, led by groups such as the Black Panther Party. ",
            "\u00a0YES!! This class is very interesting and it covers a lot of interesting topics! Take it if you want to learn more about the history of the US! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. I think that the content is important for anyone (regardless of interest or major) to learn. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This class was excellent. Professor Abedin does an incredible job of engaging her students and making sure we are well-informed. The class does a real deal for those who hope to understand history better. "
