            "\u00a0I greatly increased my knowledge of french literature and culture, and I also sharpened my writing and oral skills. ",
            "\u00a0I found the small class environment conducive to learning and to language practice. Professor Thibaud made class time fun and feel casual and relaxed. I really appreciated that we read stories in the French language from around the world, and felt very proud of myself after finishing two full French novels by the end of the semester. I made friends in the class and enjoyed coming to class each morning. "

            "\u00a0In the future, I'd suggest that quizzes be announced with a bit more prior notice, and that we practice listening and speaking skills more in class time and in homework to prepare for tests. "
