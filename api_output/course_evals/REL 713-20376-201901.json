            "\u00a0Christopher is to be commended for clarity, ease of contact, kindness, knowledge of the material, and his enthusiasm for teaching and the transmittal of knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n-great pedagogical method \r\n-thorough \r\n-filled in for gaps the lecture did not cover \r\n-fair ",
            "\u00a0Christopher is a solid instructor, particularly given the difficulties we encountered in this course over the course of the semester.  I think he handled the situation gracefully:  when we pushed back about Beowulf, he stood firm (we still shouldn't have read Beowulf, but I'm glad he held his ground); his written comments on my work were helpful; he was very good at explaining issues and chronologies in class.  (The session in which he gave us a timeline for each of the various regions in Europe was particularly helpful.)\r\n\r\nIf I had to give Christopher any suggestions re: pedagogy, I would suggest he ask fewer leading questions with obvious answers (e.g., \"Who's at the top of the great chain of being?\" \"God!\") as an attempt to start discussion.  If students don't want to speak up in sections, that's their problem, and their learning will suffer for it.  On the other hand, sessions when Christopher opened discussion with complex/nuanced questions seemed to work better.  Also, Christopher is very smart and knows his stuff--adopting an air of confidence and power would go a long way. ",
            "\u00a0Christopher did a great job at teaching us the material that we were not being taught in lecture. He filled in the gaps from the textbook we read and the supplemental lectures. ",
            "\u00a0Michelle was organized, communicated clearly, was an encouraging presence in the classroom, and gave helpful feedback on essays. I think that our section could have spent more time on particular questionsdiscussion facilitation is always a balance, but perhaps Michelle relied overly on student questions? "

            "\u00a0Christopher is an excellent teaching fellow. His comments on student writing were thoughtful and it is obvious he is enthusiastic about medieval theology/history. I consider myself lucky to have had him as a TF for the whole year. The discussions he led in section were interesting, and always combined the primary text with the historical context.\r\nAs Christoper continues as a TF, I would encourage him to always find the time to leave a few comments on student writing. Often its the only feedback we have to improve! "
