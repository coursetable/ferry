            "\u00a0This class honed my skills on reading sources and evaluating and formulating my own opinion on them. This course helped my writing skills the most out of any class at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a complete overview of the history of US foreign relations since 1898. This class gave me confidence in knowing I have have a strong foundation in understanding the international crises our country is experiencing today. I also learned how to examine history on a basis of regions, periods, and/or ideologies. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very interesting and engaging intellectually. I learned a lot about the history of the foreign policy of the US and learned skills in argumentation. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to make educated arguments about history and the future of history.  I learned to understand the contexts in which the US makes its foreign policy decisions. ",
            "\u00a0This was my first humanities course and my only one during my first semester, so it was my introduction to managing a weekly reading load and learning how to write solid reading responses. In terms of the material itself, I learned a lot about the changing nature of US motives and consequent actions in different parts of the world (Eastt Asia, the Middle East, Latin America, and Europe), and the final focused a lot on how to use the entire course's material to evaluate how and why history changes over time. A solid introduction to the relatively recent history of American foreign policy, and definitely with the opportunity to see how that history is manifesting today. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided a broad but detailed overview of the entirety of America's foreign policy history. I learned a great deal about the strategies and ideologies that have shaped America's foreign policy, and how policies changed over time and place. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about a number of topics in US foreign policy. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a deeper understanding of US history as well as current events ",
            "\u00a0Through this course, I was able to establish a critical understanding of the most pressuring issues facing U.S. policymakers today and the events that led up to them. I also increased by ability to analyze and discuss primary source documents and developed a good foundation for future history courses. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a really interesting view of US foreign policy, and was given some larger analytical tools to view US policy from a larger perspective. ",
            "\u00a0I feel that this course was an excellent introduction to the business of writing about foreign policy. The early course is really a straight history class, and the engagement with primary sources is really valuable. Coming at the class as a History major, I feel I developed most in the second half of the course, where we read and engaged with a lot of policy wonks' views on US foreign policy. I really enjoyed the 5 page paper. ",
            "\u00a0I was given a deep understand of The United states and her interests. I now feel that I can confidently asses foreign policy decisions made in the present with a newfound historical context. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a tremendous amount by taking this course. Going into the course, I had studied American history on many occasions, both in high school and at Yale (I'm a senior). Nonetheless, I found myself learning about many events and individuals that I was unfamiliar from 20th century American history. In addition to the raw facts that I learned, I also found in incredibly impressive and useful how Professor Fertik managed to organize, structure, and present enormous amounts of information. He was able to effectively provide conceptual frameworks for gargantuan amounts of information, much of which I was already familiar with. What is more, when he presented information itself he did not get bogged down in details and somehow almost always managed to strike a very impressive balance between including the key facts but also including important details. ",
            "\u00a0In terms of skills, this course gives you practice reading and analyzing both primary and secondary sources. It also aims to make you think critically about historical connections across different contexts (regions, periods, ideologies, etc). And in regards to knowledge and insights, this course first covers the history of American foreign policy history since 1898 with a particular focus on the Cold War, and then goes over American foreign policy towards specific regions.

            "\u00a0I absolutely loved the class readings! They were engaging and very beneficial. The only thing that could be changed is organizing the slides a little bit more so that they are not as verbose. It was hard to take notes in class. ",
            "\u00a0The breadth of this course was mostly a strength but may be looked at by some as a weakness. I personally liked how much information was covered and felt that the structure of doing an overview for half the semester before delving into the details of each region for the second half was very effective. I also thought a strength was the focus on historical explanations for current events. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nThis class is very interesting and the format with discussion sections is very helpful.\r\nDiscussion sections were incredible interestin\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nThe final would have been better suited if it were a final paper. The format of the final did not truly test understanding or knowledge, in my opinion.\r\nThe class might have attempted to cover more history than possible in a single semester. ",
            "\u00a0The course could be improved by slowing down and trimming some of the peripheral information.  The class's main strength was in its study of history by region and arguments about dealing with regions differently from one another. ",
            "\u00a0The regional focuses were helpful for really zeroing in on US policy in one region at different time points. It would have been helpful if as a class we had done more to compare US policy in these different regions at the same times. An issue sort of inherent to the material of the class itself was that sometimes the sheer volume of info meant lecture was rushed or that we learned some material in really broad brushstrokes. \r\n\r\nSomething to note was the volume of information on the final was initially really challenging - I didn't even know how to approach it at first, and I'd done fine throughout the course. I spent more time studying/figuring out how to study for this course's final than on my other two combined. It ended up turning out fine but it was definitely very stressful. ",
            "\u00a0The course provides a great overview of American history, but sometimes it really gets too involved in small details. This slows the class down and makes it hard to differentiate between what's important and what isn't. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Fertik did a good job of explaining the material.\r\nWeakness: There was no \"thesis\" for this course, the material was mostly ad hoc. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this class are that it is incredibly comprehensive, the small size enables close relationships and comfort with the professor and TA, and the style of first doing a brief overview and then regional focus was very helpful\r\nThe preparation for the midterm and final was very very helpful and fair.\r\nAlso, not being allowed to type notes was great and I really liked that\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - there is too much information covered per class (or it's a good amount if there were to be time given in the next class to cover questions or a brief summary of the previous course)\r\nFor better organization conducive to students retaining or understanding class information, there should maybe be less words on each slide and more time per lecture\r\n\r\nWith regard to readings, it would be interesting to assign more books like Bacevich's. Most of the readings were really good (if not a little long), however, at times the readings did not match up with what we talked about at lecture and that was a little confusing for the reading responses ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed how the course was able to cover such an extensive amount of history in the time span allotted. I also appreciated the fact that the course was separated into regions and then came together to relate regional issues in a global context. In the course, I would have liked to learn more about sub-Sahara Africa. ",
            "\u00a0This course was awesome. Very well taught, and even better organized. Professor Fertik was excellent at communicating material effectively a large and varied body of information in an engaging way. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Fertik's knowledge is really extensive, especially when it comes to the economic history behind US policy decisions. This was very useful to me as it's not my specialty but gave me a new perspective on conflicts I thought I understood fully. Prof Fertik's slides are maybe the busiest at Yale, but you will love him for them when it comes to study for the midterm and final. Really clear lecture style.\r\n\r\nI think I would have enjoyed moving on to the \"policy wonk\" section a little earlier - there was a lot of basic history exposition in the class early. I understand that a lot of freshman take the class so it ought to be a balance.\r\n\r\nKelly was an excellent TF. Really great section - by the end of the semester we had a fantastic class discussion dynamic going on. ",
            "\u00a0The class was overall very strong in its teaching, topics, and format. It could possibly be improved by assigning more engaging reading, but overall it wasn't a massive issue. ",
            "\u00a0This course is defined by its strengths. First, as mentioned above, it comprehensively yet concisely presents an enormous amount of information about American foreign policy history, losing neither the forest nor the trees. It is truly astounding how successfully Professor Fertik struck this balance. Second, the structure of the course itself is a strength - it was useful that Professor Fertik first started with a two-week run through of the historical period in question, then spent several units on specific regions. Third, the reading regimen of the course was definitely a strength - it was wise for Professor Fertik to start with our reading a general history of American foreign policy to provide strong foundations for the rest of the course, and then move on to more specific readings each week. The amount of reading was also very reasonable, and the readings were very compelling and engaging. Only a few readings felt unnecessary: the two main ones that come to mind are the reading about Brazil's efforts during the Cold War in Latin America and the reading about the Green Revolution. I would recommend scrapping those for the future. Fourth, I think the amount and size of assignments - two short papers, a midterm, and a final, was reasonable. I think the only major weakness of the course was the final exam - I think that the final exam's questions was unnecessarily broad. I understand how in a way that makes them easier since there is so much that one could talk about, but at the same time their size made them incredibly daunting and overwhelming, and made it harder to come up with an argument that addressed the (many) parts of each question. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were 1) that I found the material fascinating, 2) the primary source readings, 3) the writing assignments (including the weekly responses) are really useful for learning how to think and write about primary and secondary sources. One weakness was that Professor Fertik predominately presents one side of history in lecture and also in a majority of the readings he chose. He is very critical of American foreign policymakers, which helped me gain a new perspective of a period of history I have studied before, but I would have really appreciated if he had been more unbiased in his presentation or provided readings that challenged his opinion, so that we could form our own opinions. Secondly, the final exam asked us to draw connections in American foreign policy across different contexts, but I did not feel that the prior assignments had well prepared us to think about history in that way. "

            "\u00a0I would most definitely recommend this course to anyone looking to learn more about US foreign policy. It was fascinating and I loved all of the assignments! ",
            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY TAKE THIS COURSE. As a physics major, this was my first history class since high school and a fantastic introduction to US modern history as well as a foundation for future learning about current international crises. The readings were interesting and also covered in class to hit home the point. Lecture was like listening to a story as Professor Fertik speaks so eloquently and knowledgeably. Section was also a fun time to debate things we had read about and added to my understanding of the course. The essays were also (dare I say) interesting to write and allowed me to explore areas I wasn't confident in before. I got consistent feedback that helped me improve throughout the semester. I cannot speak highly enough of this class -- it strikes the perfect balance between  history, global affairs, and political science. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class. It is a great class that teaches history that can then be applied to current events. The class is great for people who are pursuing history majors and those who are not. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because the information is super interesting and relevant.  Section discussions are engaging and worthwhile. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student who wants a broad introduction to US foreign policy since the beginning of the US's rise as an international power. To the first-years and sophomores out there note that some of the upperlcass students will probably know more background knowledge about some of the material than you do, but you can still succeed just fine. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend US Policy Crises. The course is a great beginning course for understanding American foreign policy, and Professor Fertik does a great job of explaining the events that have shaped the policies that America employed. Every region and time period is explored in great detail, and I feel that there was little that the class failed to cover. ",
            "\u00a0This course was interesting and illuminating. It was a HIGH workload with two papers, two exams, and weekly GRADED reading responses, and section participation. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I did not have much knowledge of US foreign affairs and wanted a course that would teach me the history as well as current events in a way that I can now understand the news within a historical and current context. Also, I loved the professor and TA as well as the fact that we were not able to type notes ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student if they were looking for a place to start in trying to understand the basics of contemporary U.S. foreign policy issues. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course. Ted is a rockstar, such a good professor, very eloquent, approachable, and he was incredible at making the material interesting and engaging. The essays and exams were fair and reasonable. ",
            "\u00a0An absolutely solid choice for a history class. I learned a lot more than I expected, and really enjoyed the teaching styles of both Prof Fertik and Kelly the TA. A reading response each week, a midterm, a final, a short paper. It's really not a hard workload and the class is fun. Take it. ",
            "\u00a0This course is life changing. Everyone should take it to see what the US really is. our handling of crisis, as I now have learned, illustrates the many points of tension in defining what the US really is, and I feel that this class gives its students the knowledge to advocate for a position on the nature of the US as a whole. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. One learns an enormous amount of fascinating and important information and learns to think about how history affects the events and informs the debates of the present. For any student of American history this course is a must-take. Perhaps my only caution would be for someone with absolutely no exposure to American or world history, this could be a very daunting course in terms the amount of information - in the case of this individual, entirely new information - one is expected to learn. It is a difficult course is someone doesn't already have some basic knowledge of American history. However, given that 90% of Yalies are Americans and even those who are international have hopefully had some exposure to American history, this shouldn't be too much of an issue. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! It's a challenging course but if you're interested in American foreign poilcy, it's definitely worth it. This was the first time the course was taught and it was very good, but there are a few things to fix, so I think the subsequent courses will be even better. This course challenges you to think critically about history, specifically the means, ends, and themes of American foreign policy. It helps you makes sense of seemingly senseless wars in American history and better understand inconsistencies in American foreign policy over time. "
