I also understood why some themes are so central to the American consciousness and how they emerged. Furthermore, to just get a better general grasp of how America's landscape mentally changes over time is an extraordinary thing to now possess. ",

            "\u00a0Through this class, I learned how to analyze a variety of types of texts in the context of how they relate to and influence American society and history. Class discussions and lectures progressed chronologically, focusing on the preoccupations and values of the American people at various times since Reconstruction. The papers encouraged us to make cross-text connections and examine how various authors think about America and what it represents. ",

            "\u00a0Wonderful class! Professors Kronman and Bromwich have a deep, sometime eclectic knowledge & interest in the material. Professor Kronman's lectures in particular engaged with historical material we all vaguely know, but left with both factual and analytical understanding. The readings were, for the most part, reasonable and interesting. Bromwich's love of Henry James is a bit much in the beginning, but the course really hits its stride with the Cold War. Definitely more reading in the beginning of the class than the end. They're hard graders, but it's a seminar worth taking. ",
            "\u00a0A vast swath of informationnames, events, titleswashed over me. It's really enjoyable, but I wouldn't say that I gained any sort of understanding of the \"American Imagination.\" Details were more tangible than theme. There are only two written assignments, so I don't feel as if my essay-writing ability grew significantly either. ",

Considering I didn't even know there was and \"American Imagination\" before taking this course, I'd say I learned quite a lot. After taking the class, I can confidently say that I have a better understanding of what it means to be an American.

            "\u00a0Sometimes the dual lectures were a bit disjointed, and the readings definitely varied in how interesting they were. There were also quite a few people in each seminar meeting (roughly 18) which made participation somewhat of a challenge, especially since it counts for 40% of the grade. ",
            "\u00a0I think the strengths were the readings and the alternating lectures. I loved the variety we got in having two professors, and I particularly loved how fiction was incorporated -  my favorite readings were House of Mirth, In Our Time, and Cane. ",
            "\u00a0The weaknesses are a lack of non-white voices. The course right now is about the white American imagination and that's not to say that's wrong but there's definitely other American imaginations to explore. ",
            "\u00a0too many readings, a little all over the place ",
            "\u00a0So many strengths that I won't even begin to name them. Only thing I would ask is that in the future, try and relate every week's readings back to the progression of the American Imagination. Both Professors do that, but it usually comes in the form of subtle sentences during their lectures, which is easy to miss if you aren't paying very careful attention. ",
            "\u00a0Professors Bromwich and Kronman are brilliant professors who both consistently delivered insightful lectures that had the quality of prepared speeches. The dedication of the professors to this class and the extremely interesting and varied reading list are key strengths of the course. Seminar was also wonderful, but it did sometimes feel that we got a bit off-topic, and we rarely had time to discuss more than a tiny fraction of the reading. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a bit history heavy and a bit light on American political philosophy, compared to its first semester counterpart. That said, the course selections were generally brilliant. ",
            "\u00a0I think that sometimes the course became to english / literarily oriented rather than political thought. Wish it was more grounded and contextualized ",
            "\u00a0The reading workload isn't consistent week to week, especially in the beginning. The week on poetry was a struggle...most of the class didn't have the background for it, and the discussion and lecture went over my, and I suspect others, head. ",
            "\u00a0While the readings were consistently interesting, there were too many to reasonably be completed each week. Perhaps more readings could be put under \"optional readings\" and then students could read them if they chose a relevant essay topic.\r\n\r\nLectures were consistently good, although I think they could assume slightly more knowledge of American History than they did. ",
            "\u00a0Fascinating breadth of material. Hard to walk away with anything tangible. Professors are incredibly knowledgable, but often were speaking over my head. Seminar was not conducive to learning (in part because of size), but felt as if we were just making sure we participated in the class to get credit. ",
            "\u00a0However difficult it may be for the instructors, the readings should be reduced because they weren't realistically achievable alongside the workload of other courses. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are in the superb lectures and excellent choices of reading and watching materials. Some improvements might be made to section: they felt a bit large and impersonal, and there was the sense that many had not fully engaged with the material prior to section. Perhaps offering more guidance to the works that would focused on in section would be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I took both semesters of the year long course, and there were some improvements and drawbacks from the first semester. I loved how both Professors would give lectures (a long main lecture followed by a short response) every week, but I wish they had maintained the trading of Professors after midterm like in the first semester. While I appreciated the chance to get close to one (absolutely excellent) Professor, I enjoyed getting a mix of teaching styles in the weekly seminar. Perhaps, completely adopting the DS style, one lecture and two seminar method would be a compromise? There are enough readings per week to justify multiple seminar discussions. ",
            "\u00a0This course was fantastic. I'm shocked that this was the first iteration of the course. Professors Bromwich and Kronman have crafted an experience that will stand as one of the highlights of my Yale career. The lectures were engaging and I always left section meetings hungry for more. The reading list was also extraordinary. \r\n\r\nOne recommendation I would make is planning a more consistent lecture schedule. Kronman's and Bromwich's styles complimented each other brilliantly; Kronman provided an excellent historical primer while Bromwich always dove deeper into the literature. The lectures were at their strongest when both professors shared time equally. In instances where one professor would dominate, the lesson always felt somewhat lopsided. I would recommend either sharing the time equally or alternating week-by-week between the professors. \r\n\r\nI would also add that the \"give and take\" question and answer sections that ended each lecture didn't feel particularly helpful. Time always felt pressed and I didn't feel as though the lecture format lent itself to effective Q&A. I would have preferred longer lectures with perhaps more time for Q&A during section meetings.\r\n\r\nAlso, the reading list was ambitious to say the least. At times, the vastness of the assignments made it challenging to really dive into the readings. I appreciated when Professors Kronman and Bromwich would send out notes specifying which readings to focus on. I would recommend perhaps narrowing the required readings and expanding the background readings section. ",
            "\u00a0This course has tremendous potential. It has good professors, an interesting topic, and it combines different disciplines in a way that few other courses attempt to. I think, however, that it still has a ways to go to fulfill its potential. I have a few structural suggestions:\r\n\r\n1. The readings, as currently assigned, are just too much. First, the weekly readings are far too long to the point where most people just stopped even attempting to do any. It surpasses any other history seminar I've taken. There are weeks where the professors assigned almost four hundred pages to read, or assigned several hundred on top of watching four hours of movies. But second, and more importantly, we don't even discuss most readings! After spending ten hours preparing for the seminar, we'll only actually discuss about 1/3 of the stuff that was assigned. I think the professors realized this by the end of the course, as they would tell us which readings to \"focus\" on. This relates to my second point.\r\n\r\n2. The seminars are just too short. I enjoyed the lecture and think it should remain at the same duration. But 75 minutes is just not enough time for any seminar, especially when there are so many different readings to discuss. The course is so broad, and themes so deep, that it really should be a more traditional 110 minute seminar. I don't know how course scheduling logistics work, especially for courses that contain a lecture and seminar component, but maybe the revered and valued professors can convince Yale to change this.\r\n\r\nA potential solution: I know the professors are considering attempting to institutionalize this course, or a course similar to it. I think that's a good idea. I think they should consider, however, doing so in a way that makes the course 2 credits each semester for a total of 4 credits. So it would be like 2/3 of DS. I'm not sure if Yale will allow this, but given its incredible scope it's quite honestly impossible to give adequate attention to any of the topics in its current format. This would also make the reading load much more appropriate, although to be completely honest I think they could still trim some weeks, as we rarely even got to discuss even just half of what we read. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the diversity of texts but thought the reading load was too large most weeks. When professors assign a near-impossible amount of reading, I end up doing less of it than I would have otherwise because I feel like I won't be able to make a dent. ",
            "\u00a0The course drew strength from the wide range of texts called upon in the study of the American imagination. The Monday lectures--taught in alternation by Professor Kronman and Professor Bromwich--were rich in analysis of the weekly material. The lecture style made for an incredibly engaging class experience, as the lecture content was not split up and pasted onto powerpoint slides, but rather, narrated like a story (professors read aloud pieces of writing that they wrote prior to class). I loved the interplay between the two professors in their lecturesthey werent shy in recognizing where their beliefs converged or diverged. The Wednesday seminars provided an opportunity to connect with the material on a deeper and more personal level. \r\n\r\nThe course could be improved by reducing the number of texts assigned per week. The sheer volume/content that the professors AND students were expected to cover and process in one week often made the lectures and overall experience seem somewhat scattered. If a student managed to do all readings but ONE, they could still easily find themselves feeling grossly unprepared during seminar, as the one-hour-15 minute meeting sometimes only covered ONE of the numerous assigned readings. This was frustrating. ",
            "\u00a0The class was amazing but I felt like the readings near the end of the course were the more exciting ones. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Take whatever chance you can to take a course with Bromwich. He is the only professor with whom I've taken a class at Yale that I truly admire and that I would call unqualifiedly heroic. Yes, he will seem strange and a bit abrasive at first, but he is highly intelligent and guided by the truth. The day will come in every sensitive Yale undergraduate's career when you realize Yale is no different from the real world, that many here are guided by motives just as sordid as those found anywhere else. Bromwich is the only professor I have had that really stands up for something and does not allow himself to be sucked into entropy. ",

            "\u00a0This course was easily the best humanities class I have taken at Yale. The readings are relatively lengthy, but because the reading list includes a vast diversity of types of writing, from fiction to social criticism, to poetry, to court cases, it felt like a bit less. The topic was fascinating to me, but Professors Kronman and Bromwich really carry the class. They are both spectacular lecturers, and having a chance to engage with them in seminar was a great opportunity. ",

            "\u00a0This is a truly exceptional course taught by exceptional professors. I could not recommend the American Imagination more highly to any Yale student, regardless of your academic interests. You will take a unique, incisive look at 20th-century American history, culture, literature, philosophy, and politics that can only be offered through such an interdisciplinary course taught by such gifted professors. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, for the lectures alone. They're entertaining on top of being informative. But know going in that the seminar is far from ideal. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - I think it is both an excellent academic course and an excellent foundation for understanding the current America we live in. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course, but only if they are willing to engage in quite a lot of reading outside of class. The lectures by themselves, though really remarkable, are not enough, and often do not cover all the interesting topics that the readings hit. After taking this class, I have a stronger sense of themes that have appeared through the course of twentieth century American history, and this understanding animates an examination of the American history we are living through now. The course really engages the question, \"what has it meant to be American?\" ",
            "\u00a0I would completely recommend this course to another student. I think it should be a civic requirement of every American to read the texts that were selected in this class (even if most, if not all of the texts were absent from my high school experience). The class serves as a first-rate canonical survey, rivaling the likes of DS and recalling a type of Humanities education that is difficult to find at Yale today. ",
            "\u00a0Kronman is amazing! So brilliant, interesting, and dynamic. A must have professor in your time at Yale who will analyze every approach to every topic. The organization of the class with alternating Monday lectures and a set Wednesday discussion was also original and effective ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student. This class provided me the opportunity to study with two of the best minds at Yale. Beyond the excellent professors, the course also introduced me to an incredible reading list filled with works that I wouldn't have otherwise known to read. Most importantly, this course allowed me to learn about the American identity and heritage. This course has been fundamental to my own understanding of what it means to be an American. You can't go wrong with this class. ",
            "\u00a0Fantastic readings - take it!! ",
            "\u00a0I would, just because I think the topic is both important and fascinating, but I would also warn them that the course is still young. It's learning, growing, and finding out what kind of course it will be when it grows up. The professors are all incredibly intelligent and accomplished, too, and it's a privilege to be able to learn from them, especially in a seminar setting. ",
            "\u00a0I would - you read some of the best writing and thinking produced by Americans. But you need to be prepared for a sometimes-overwhelming reading load. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students that 1) have a definite interest in the material and 2) have the time and desire to throw themselves at the course. \r\n\r\nIf you take this course, be ready to fully buy in. You will be frustrated at times when it seems like your work doesnt pay off (i.e. when you spend hours doing the readings but the seminar covers the sole reading you werent able to get to); but, despite the occasional frustrations with the unreasonable expectations/work load, the course is definitely worth taking. Professor Kronman and Professor Bromwich are brilliant and no Yale student should forego the opportunity to take a class with either of them. ",
