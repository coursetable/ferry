            "\u00a0I studied physics before, but I am extremely glad that I took this course because I learned a lot. An important skill that I learned was the art of estimation. From school and Olympiads, I was accustomed to using exact values and stressing over negligible factors. However, estimation skills are the link between theory and real-life applications. Also, there were materials that I was unfamiliar with, such as climate change. Of course, I knew of climate change, but I did not know some of the details taught in this course. ",

        [
            "\u00a0As I mentioned above, the connection between theory and practical physics is the strength of this course. The fact that the course was divided up into tabs in Canvas made it very helpful for me to learn (organization always helps!).\r\nI wish, however, that the course was longer. This is not an inherent issue of the course or the instructor, but this is a problem with scheduling. Despite the accelerated course, the lack of time forced us to skip some materials, such as rotational dynamics. I wish courses ran forever! ",
            "\u00a0I thought this course was very well-organized in terms of the availability of profs/TA's to answer students' questions and facilitate learning. The only weakness I can think of was that there are a lot of lecture videos, but I'm not sure that can be avoided. "

            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to both introductory and intermediate students of physics. Advanced students may find most of the material easy, but the \"movie\" part of this course would likely be novel to them. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course! It's engaging and not too time-consuming. You can complete the course alongside other summer activities. "
