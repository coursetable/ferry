            "\u00a0How does cultural product relates to gender and race, and further, politics. This class provided me a lot information that I have never though of before.\r\nI learned to analyze a cultural thing and study deep into it, to see how it connects with the world. ",
            "\u00a0How to analyze popular culture with its history background and other factors. ",
            "\u00a0By taking this course, I both learned the necessary steps and terminology required in an American Studies class, including how to evaluate and criticize pieces of media history. Besides that the focus itself on Asian Americans provided new definitions, perspectives, and explanations for materials we see in popular culture everyday. ",
            "\u00a0The knowledge about culture studies and Asian American studies. The skills about reading academic materials and writing formal papers. The class also developed the interest on Asian studies strongly. ",
            "\u00a0I'm new to the concept and disciplines of American studies, and this course definitely helped me familiarize with that. Also I got to learn a lot about the issues and struggles of Asian Americans and how to perceive these problems critically. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to interpret such a variety of texts on a variety of issues from orientalism to hypersexualization. Integrating popular culture objects that were so familiar such as Fresh off the Boat was so meaningful and I learned to realize that many objects in my everyday life had such an impact on my thinking. I learned to think more critically of the objects I consumed and produced in my daily life. I became more aware of my Asian American identity in such a variety of ways that have changed me for the better. \r\n\r\nThe course material was engaging and so interesting. I learned how to read scholarly material with a more critical eye. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the brief history and core ideas about Asian American Popular Culture and the approach of cultural analysis. We discussed race and gender in class, which illuminated me a lot. After this course, I learned to think about the construction and expression of culture. There is a coding and decoding process when people try to shape or understand certain culture texts. I also practiced how to apply the knowledge we learn on class by writing blog entries. Najwa gave us careful feedback to help us make improvements. I appreciate this course very much! "

            "\u00a0this course is interesting yet challenging. Maybe a smaller class size may make the discussion more efficient. ",
            "\u00a0I like the class form but I can't handle the assigned readings which seem to be too much and too hard for me ",
            "\u00a0I really like the discussion part in every class. It is really helpful to understand some complex items and I really enjoy the process of sharing. \r\nThe arrangement of the class is quite scientific as well - the time distribution of lecture and discussion is excellent!\r\nThe creative forms of assignments are exciting. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The content is really rich. And the amount of assignment is proper.\r\nWeaknesses: I feel kind of hard, because I had no basics in such area before. It is fun to learn such lot things, but I hope the professor can explain some basic concepts and how they connect, though it might be already known by others. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include a wide and diverse range of cultural objects to explore and learn about. \r\nWeaknesses include not enough time to go in depth with each object, with only enough discussion to understand the concept overall. ",

            "\u00a0I believe the strength of the course was the seminar style that allowed me to greatly participate in class discussions and learn so much from my peers. The discussion based classes allowed me to delve deeper and truly understand the concepts at hand. My developed critical eye was truly showcased in my participation in class discussions and I believe it helped me understand the concepts throughly. \r\n\r\nI would say one of the weaknesses is that the class discussions could have been slightly more facilitated. Many of our discussions were engaging but sometimes, the class would become quiet. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Interesting reading materials, lots of discussions in class, many different popular culture texts, careful feedback for Najwa.\r\nCould be improved: The class discussion could be more lively; there could be more explanations about the reading material by the professor.

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course because of its importance in the world. I learned so much about my Asian American identity and without the class, I wouldn't have learned such things. This is so important as Asian Americans are such an integral aspect of the American identity that it would be silly not to educate yourself about it. \r\n\r\nProfessor Mayer did an exceptional job at teaching and facilitating the course. ",
