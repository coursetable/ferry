            "\u00a0I have learned so much from this class! I was initially scared of economics, but I ended up truly taking so much away. It was a fantastic overview of relevant topics! ",
            "\u00a0I significantly improved my understanding of comparative political economy. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think critically about the relationship between economic resources, political incentives, and distribution, and interests. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about transaction costs. And how they explain a lot of politics. That was useful. ",
            "\u00a0I built an analytical framework for looking at academic political economy arguments. Ranging from materlialism, institutionalism, culture and values ",
            "\u00a0An understanding of how economics might impact politics, in a variety of ways. ",
            "\u00a0I gained an overview of the field, in terms of both canonical and more contemporary works. \r\nI also learnt about the models and tools that are commonly used in political economy. ",
            "\u00a0Essential oversight of core CPE concepts. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Too many strengths to list; if you are a political science major, you should really try to take this class! The only weakness I can even draw up is just that the lack of discussion questions in the beginning made reading responses really difficult. Then, she promptly fixed that after we let her know. Other than that, this was fantastic! ",
            "\u00a0The combination of weekly reading assignments and short response papers was perfect. The class discussions were extremely rich. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a great review of the basics of political economy, with excellent opportunities to apply it to substantive issues. ",
            "\u00a0N/a. Great class. ",
            "\u00a0Strenghts: an amazing syllabus by an amazing professor. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Frances' attitude and leadership of the class; diversity of thoughts/backgrounds of the students; variety of readings; weekly SHORT papers w/ a manageable final paper\r\nWeakness: Not as much discussion on research designs as could have been (though presumably that's on purpose, and the class is supposed to be about theory) ",
            "\u00a0The course is very well taught, and Professor Rosenbluth was very quick to implement midterm feedback. \r\nProfessor Rosenbluth ensures that all students understand the material, and through the seminars she links together a wide variety of materials in a comprehensive and coherent manner. ",
            "\u00a0Could potentially be useful to read some more modern CPE papers to understand what the field is heading towards (besides the Acemoglu and Iversen pieces at the end). "

            "\u00a0Absolutely. Frances is an excellent instructor and the course has helped me sharpen my thinking in other areas. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I just feel like it offers a really good framework for understanding a lot of political problems and outcomes. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the class and the topics, but I would recommended it to people interested in exploring PhDs or that are into political science/economy ",
            "\u00a0100%. Especially any political scientist -- economic forces seem so key to understanding most aspects of politics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The course covers a lot of ground pretty quickly, but the reading responses help digest the material, the final paper is not much work so you don't have to worry about that much, and Prof. Rosenbluth is an excellent teacher. ",
            "\u00a0Frances is a phenomenal teacher and the course is very well-organized with a great reading list. Good for anyone even tangentially interested in political economy. "
