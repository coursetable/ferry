            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nThe knowledge of accounting and valuation I learned from this class is really helpful, since accounting is the basic knowledge in business world, and design of the class is problems oriented, before the class, the students were required to reading the textbooks about the chapter the class would talk about, and also finish the homework in advance, which helped students to find out their difficulties of understanding some specific points, and took the questions to enter into the class. This way strongly consolidate the efficiency of learning.\r\nWeakness:\r\nHomework was a little bit heavy. ",
            "\u00a0Good course, but very difficult. The class is definitely geared toward students who have a background in accounting, and should probably not be labeled as an intro class. Alternatively, students who have a strong background in accounting should not be allowed to take this class. Class sessions are highly dominated by the students who already know what they are doing, and the class is driven very fast because of that. There are not really any class-provided mechanisms to help the slower students keep up, which would not normally be a problem except this class is supposedly designed for students who have no background in finance: as stated on the syllabus, this class \"helps you acquire basic accounting and finance knowledge\" and \"has been specifically designed to provide the requisite fundamentals of accounting and valuation.\" I took this class having never taken a single finance-related class in my undergrad and was sorely disappointed that I was miles behind other students, with no option for an easier class. I struggled to stay afloat during this class and did not feel comfortable asking the basic questions I had. ",
            "\u00a0The course is useful but presumes knowledge of some business, finance, and accounting principles, which most students in the class lack.  It could be improved with some pre-course or extra materials to help students new to the field catch up.  The book is horrendous and outdated. ",
            "\u00a0Helped me address weakness in business accounting, very useful ",
            "\u00a0-Strengths: Valuable information, quick feedback from the TAs. \r\n-Weaknesses: Ineffective/too many powerpoint slides, lack of group work during class time (which would help students to check their comprehension), format of homeworks. ",
            "\u00a0Although the material was difficult, I thoroughly enjoyed taking this course because of the content and the way it was presenting. It was a challenging and rewarding experience. ",

            "\u00a0While Professor Garstka is clearly an excellent professor (engaging, knowledgable, personable), his teaching style (probably common to other professors in SOM) is somewhat intimidating and I did not feel comfortable asking the questions I had in class. To be fair, I did not really feel comfortable asking the TAs or other students either. However, he was very committed to having every student pass the course, which I really appreciated. I took the midterm twice in order to get a higher grade, and it also helped me understand the material better. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Clearly cares about his students, available by email\r\n\r\nRecommendations: \r\n-Offer scheduled office hours \r\n-Check comprehension of key concepts during class time (thumbs up, thumbs down, etc.)\r\n-Create learning groups (groups of 3-4 students that are expected to meet once a week outside of class and reinforce concepts)\r\n-Reduce the number of powerpoint slides in each presentation ",
            "\u00a0Professor Garstka was a fantastic instructor - wry, witty, and knowledgeable. He presented the course material in a (fairly) accessible way and did a great job of providing contextual information and analyses that clarified the material. ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Garstka was consistently willing to meet with me outside of normal class time to review difficult concepts and offer guidance in the course. "

If you want to step into the business world after graduation, I strongly recommend you participate in Professor Stanley's class, to follow him and finish the homework every time intelligently. I can guarantee that you will have a big harvest from Stanley's class. ",

While participation in this course requires a fair amount of time and effort, you will be rewarded with an increased understanding of fundamental accounting and finance concepts. "
