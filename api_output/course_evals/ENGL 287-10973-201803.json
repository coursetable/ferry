            "\u00a0I learned about current discourse surrounding the future and read various notable sci-fi works that led to engaging discussion during class. ",
            "\u00a0We learned a lot about the concept of futurity/temporality and how different topics tie into ithuman psychology, sci-fi, magic tricks, quantum mechanics. We also learnedthrough practice rather than through lessonshow to integrate sources together and how to look for common threads. ",
            "\u00a0This class provides you with a survey of texts concerning time and the future - super cool stuff. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to critically analyze literature and glean information from different sources for our final projects. I also learned how to use online tools to analyze and display information. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a (sometimes frustratingly) broad survey of futurity in American literature. The syllabus draws on a diverse array of \"future worlds,\" as imagined by authors, corporations, gurus, and so on. Many of these texts are fascinating on their own but class discussion often felt rushed and disorganized. Take this class if you're generally interested in the topic and are looking for a class with relatively easy/few assignments -- but don't expect an in-depth reading of the texts. ",
            "\u00a0Literary analysis. ",
            "\u00a0I read various texts in science fiction relating to time and futurity. I analyzed different and conflicting world views of time such as determinism and quantum mechanics and explored ideas in parallel universes and how these concepts tell the story of humankind and its desires and hopes. I learned to be critical and to subvert my current views of time to suppose eye-opening ideas about our world. "

            "\u00a0It would be better if we were given more time to discuss texts in class, although it was equally as interesting listening to John talk about interesting concepts in the beginning half of class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Very interesting topics!! I definitely learned a lot and could pull in my knowledge from other classes despite being pre-med.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: A lot of the skills were not explicitly taught which made it a bit hard to understand what exactly Professor Williams wanted from the projects. Even though we receive detailed feedback, I still don't know any of the grades for my assignments which makes it a little stressful. ",
            "\u00a0Course is very free flowing with not much work, but could be a negative cause students may become less engaged. ",
            "\u00a0The texts were all very engaging and built on each other well. We explore a wealth of texts in the genre on time and futurity. I really liked how the class was structured. The readings built our foundation of knowledge that led us to explore what peaked our interests the most in our final project. We had total free reign over the subject and style of our final project, and we were encouraged to bring in other disciplines to support our analyses. For example, since I am a Statistics and Data Science/Computer Science major, I created a simulation as part of my project. Professor Williams was a major strength of the course. He has so much knowledge about time and futurity in literature. You can tell he loves this subject. He has read and watched down every rabbit hole and even travels to explore and meet other scholars in the field. He is an amazing professor and made class engaging and fun each day. I looked forward to the class each day. Professor Williams has a fountain of ideas and examples to share, which truly enriched the class. No weaknesses to report! ",

            "\u00a0Yes, because the texts are interesting to read and it makes you more aware of the value of time. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are looking for an interesting yet low workload class! A very nice laidback class in terms of reading and discussions. Try not to procrastinate on the three assignments since they are quite large assignments (Project proposal; 8 sources to annotate with a 350-word summary and 350-word analysis for each one; Final project ~10 pages or with integrated digital component). \r\n\r\nNo if you are looking for a class that teaches you technical skills related to writing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This has easily been one of the best courses I have taken at Yale (and I'm not even an English major). Professor Williams is a super fun guy who is truly passionate about the material. It is clear he picked each text with care, and each one is perfect for a discussion. It's a class I could look forward to every week, and participation feels effortless because the topics are so mind-blowingly cool. If you like sci-fi at all, take this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the course was really enjoyable. The literature and films on the syllabus were engaging while still connecting with the overarching themes of the course. The TA was also helpful and gave actionable feedback for the assignments and final project. If you're curious about our relationship with time and the future, and want to investigate this through works of science fiction, documentaries, and other sources, you should take this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because the course is a great survey of intellectually stimulating literar material within the realm of futureology. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend taking this course with Professor Williams! ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this course if you have the chance! I'm a science major who generally avoids anything outside of my major but LOVED this class. Prof. Williams is a treasure trove of knowledge and genuinely listens and responds to students in class. An hour and a half flies by in Lit and the Future. "
