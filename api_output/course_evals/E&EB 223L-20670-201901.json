            "\u00a0Best lab I have ever taken!!! ",
            "\u00a0I learned valuable laboratory skills, such as microscopy, dissection, observational skills, and how to keep a lab notebook. I gained insights into the vast and  beautiful diversity of life and the functional traits that lead to such diversity. ",

            "\u00a0This class was an awesome survey of many of the different disciplines of biological study, a great option for an underclassman looking to find a preferred area of research, or an upperclassman who wants to pull together a lot of the biological concepts they have learned ",

            "\u00a0The teaching staff were very enthusiastic about learning and about the course material, which proved to be infectious! However, the assignments and projects felt a little disorganized and the expectations on assignments were not always clear. ",
            "\u00a0Great course ",
            "\u00a0Overall this was a really good course. It was fun and engaging and the TAs and professor really cared. It was also a very supportive environment, and everyone was really enthusiastic about the material. I genuinely enjoyed it and learned a lot and I'm really glad I took the class. However, some of the assignments felt like busy work, and the time it took to complete sections of the lab reports often didn't correspond to the points they were worth. The instructions in general were also often a bit vague, and it's a small thing but having the files for the class more organized on canvas would've been helpful. Also because of the large amount of topics covered, the TAs didn't always understand everything fully and weren't able to answer questions. However, overall it was a really supportive, interesting, and collaborative class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Marta, the TAs, the class, everything is amazing. The fruit feast? phenomenal. The level of care for the students? Outstanding.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish that we had more field trips! I love them so much! ",

            "\u00a0All strengths, this class was fantastic, really engaging experiments, a reasonable amount of work expected, lots of support from teaching staff and professor Wells. All around great class :) ",
            "\u00a0Fantastic lab. Both very interesting, educational, and enjoyable. A productive learning environment that was both supportive, and encouraged students to take risks and learn by experience. ",
            "\u00a0This class was amazing. Every lab was very hands on, so I felt like I was actually learning. Also, Professor Wells and the TAs were very helpful. It is a very nice experience when you can tell that the professor actually enjoys the material. The only thing that I would change about the class is the organization. The why that the files for the class were uploaded was disorganized. ",

            "\u00a0TAKE THIS CLASS!!! Marta is AMAZING and the class is fun and interesting. You do really cool things every lab, like look at animal skulls, romp around in a stream, or eat a ton of really cool fruit. The lab reports are a little tedious but you only have to write like four full reports all semester. The quizzes are also pretty easy so the overall workload is not high. It's a really fun lab and makes me wish that every lab at Yale could be like this one. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! This was probably one of the best classes I will ever have taken at Yale. Marta is a wonderful soul who pours her heart into teaching this material to students. The labs are amazing hands-on experiences, and the field ecology trips are a rare opportunity to get outside of the classroom for a Yale class. All of the labs and projects were high-yield and very informative, and were greatly augmented by the specimen analysis that happens every week. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would. The professor is really kind and the material is interesting. It's also one of the few classes I've taken where I got really hands on experience, and actually felt like I was learning relevant things. ",

            "\u00a0For anyone looking for a fun, engaging, stimulating, and FUN (yes I said it twice!!!) biology lab, one must take this course. You learn so much and the labs catered towards not only teaching you, but making sure you are enjoying what you are learning as well. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! Professor Wells is amazing and very fun to work with. The dissections were very interesting and I learned things that I would not have in other classes ",
            "\u00a0I would highly, highly recommend this course. Professor Wells is such a kind, wonderful person to be around, it's nice to have a class that you can look forward to each week! The final project is really fun, I enjoyed writing a lot of blog posts for the class (you don't have to if you don't want to!) and I didn't feel like the quizzes had any sneaky questions designed to sink you. The course is really fair and enjoyable. ",

            "\u00a0Yes! If you're okay with getting your hands dirty (well not literally, you can wear gloves) this is a really fun lab! You'll get to experience a little bit of most of the EEB lab courses at Yale but in one class. There's a bit of work but nothing terrible, and it was fun to do the final project. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. It was not too much work but a lot of fun. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Do it! ",
