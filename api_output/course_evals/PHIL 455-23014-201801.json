            "\u00a0How to argue about normative ethics, writing a good essay, subtleties of different moral positions. ",
            "\u00a0More rigorous philosophical thought, better understanding of certain aspects of morality ",
            "\u00a0Not a ton, but that's probably my fault for not putting in a lot of effort and never going to office hours. This isn't a necessary outcome of credit d'ing it, it's just how i chose to do it. ",
            "\u00a0What normative ethics is and some of the leading theories in it. ",
            "\u00a0This seminar totally changed the way I thought about ethics. ",
            "\u00a0Normative Ethics helped train students in the methods of doing moral philosophy. This class did not, in any way, settle ethical disputes or help students arrive at an ultimate set of moral principles. Even though Normative Ethics is listed as Shelly's more advanced seminar, it still felt like an introduction to serious moral philosophy. This was okay, however. Through class discussions and readings, we gained a helpful understanding of common moral factoral views such as deontology and consequentialism as well as \"foundational\" positions such as reflection theory, contractarianism, and universalizability. So, in terms of content, Normative Ethics did a good job of imparting students with a working understanding of the important debates in moral philosophy. What was more important, however, was the training in our thinking and reasoning that followed from our class discussions and paper comments. Class discussions were spirited and filled with intelligent comments from capable students. Being surrounded by an extremely intelligent instructor in Shelly as well as capable peers helped to make for a stimulating learning experience. ",
            "\u00a0While this isnt a class on applied ethics, and probably will only have direct influence on the thoughts and actions of those who are already inclined to be moved by moral philosophy, I am confident in saying that few classes will contribute as much as this one to your ability to build and evaluate robust arguments. Pretty sure the IQ of every student just gained a point or two over the semester. In this class, you learn to *do* moral philosophy. The emphasis is on ideas, as opposed to on particular canonical works or authors. In your essays, you get no bonus points for referencing Kant or for providing a new combination of quotes from five different primary sources to make some post-hoc justification of your thesis. Instead, you learn how to build an argument from initial premises and how to use thought experiments to examine and support arguments. ",
            "\u00a0I learned what Normative Ethics is and how it is different from metaethics and applied ethics. I learned what makes a good philosophy paper and and how to better think, speak, and write about ethical considerations. ",
            "\u00a0I became familiar with the variety of ethical beliefs, exercised my ability to evaluate these beliefs, and developed my particular view on normative ethics. "

            "\u00a0Very lively discussion during class with people of diverse moral perspectives. Some topics were more interesting than others. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes disappointing that the loudest members of the class dictate what gets discussed, leaving many worthy topics untouched. ",
            "\u00a0Waaaay too much time is spent on things that two or three people care about. Those two or three people will keep responding to each other while everyone else wishes we could talk about something else. Usually people are too timid/socially-well-adjusted to interrupt and say \"hey can we talk about anything else?\" but i did it one time when it got really bad and it was definitely worth it. most people probably also care about their grade so they're unwilling to seem wildly uncharitable and or obnoxious, so the burden of preventing long meaningless tangents is really on the credit d people. it could be improved if shelly jumped in more and (possibly unpopular opinion incoming) shut down students way more quickly. by asking people questions he gives them a way out; i think it would be a better use of everyone's time if he just straight-up argued against students' positions. this would probably decrease the amount of on the spot philosophy/critical thinking that would happen in class, but im ok with that, since there's still the papers and office hours, which i think are a much better space for that anyway.\r\nstrength is that shelly is a lot of fun and SUPER invested in your learning, which is so rare, and if you have a good group of students then the class can be exciting and fun when it's not dragging on about something you don't care about ",
            "\u00a0Participation was graded in a somewhat iffy way that seemed to rely a lot on quantity of participation in seminars, though Shelly did do his best to get others to participate. Discussions were great some days, weird some others--overall pretty fun though. Some people here have some pretty interesting ethics... readings are informative, and supplementary readings are pretty cool too. ",
            "\u00a0The course is excellent, and Shelly Kagan somehow surpasses even his reputation. It is definitely the ultimate embodiment of a seminar spirit. The direction of each seminar is really based on the dictates of the students' interests, and the tone of the class depends very strongly on who you have in the class. I was fortunate to have a class packed with very smart and very funny people, but that may outcome may not be reproduced every year. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, this was an excellent and challenging course. The main strength of this course was the organic feel to the seminar, which was enabled by Shelly's expert guidance. Even though the course had almost 20 students, it felt like a small class with a natural flow of participation. In general, this made for a fun but stimulating seminar feel. In terms of content, Normative Ethics does an excellent job of acquainting students with important concepts in moral philosophy. The greatest strength of the course, however, came in its training of students in how to do basic philosophy. Shelly's paper prompts are straightforward but daunting: pick a topic and do a bit of philosophy on your own. Learning to write papers of this style and learning to stay engaged in a fast-paced seminar take some time. However, this course -- between its smart students and challenging papers -- did wonders in improving my level of thinking and ability to make clear arguments. ",
            "\u00a0This is a fantastic class. Shelly is a wonderful teacher, and you will learn so much if you are genuinely interested in moral philosophy. In this review, I could elaborate on points that already have been made in past years evaluations. For instance, how Shelly will write 2200 words of critique of your 2000-word essay. (Other professors, take note! It's hard not to be very intrinsically motivated to put effort into an essay when you expect that kind of critique. Even the students taking the class credit/d cared a lot.) Or how he will facilitate discussions between students instead of lecturing, only adding his comments in order to clarify a point or guide the direction of the conversation. Or how he willingly stays around for hours after class to discuss ideas with students, even though he undoubtedly has had that exact conversation many times before. Instead, however, I will mention another unique aspect of this class: it was so *fun*. Using thought experiments to evaluate arguments makes for some occasionally hilarious examples, ensuring that I genuinely looked forward to going to this class, every single week. Somehow, Shelly brings the best out of the students in the seminar, and its a joy to hear their brilliant handling of complex ideas. Pretty sure the IQ of every student just gained a point or two over the semester. While this isnt a class on applied ethics, and probably will only have direct influence on the thoughts and actions of those who are already inclined to be moved by moral philosophy, I am confident in saying that few classes will contribute as much as this one to your ability to build and evaluate robust arguments.

Instead, you learn how to build an argument from initial premises and how to use thought experiments to examine and support arguments. ",
            "\u00a0The course is great. The class discussion format with no hand raising is great. It never got disorganized because Shelly was great at leading and organizing discussion. ",
            "\u00a0The readings were comprehensive and manageable. The seminar setting contributed to great conversation. The papers were flexible and provided an opportunity to understand a topic more deeply.\r\n\r\nDiscussion topics during class were incredibly flexible, perhaps sometimes to the extent that challenging topics in the readings would not be addressed.\r\n\r\nWriting papers may have encouraged students to adopt ethical views that are more apparently logically coherent. Upon reflection, I may have argued for views that were easier to grasp and defend, but perhaps were not my actual beliefs. "

            "\u00a0Yes, it's intellectually engaging but not much work. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but, don't expect to be able to talk about the topics you think are important. What happens in discussion is very much a product of who is in the class, and while at many times that is a good thing, it can also be very frustrating when a few louder, more forceful members of the class are stuck on a particular topic which isn't of particular interest to the majority who then spend much of the class praying it will end. For all the hype about Shelly being a wicked grader, I found his assessments to be very fair, and he gives you ample time to meet with him and discuss your topics. The comments he provides on papers are also incredibly detailed, so it is certainly worth putting the effort into the papers, and if you do not do as well as you had hoped, it will be clearly explained why and he will certainly help you improve your work. Honestly, the best thing I can say for this class is that the intensive critiques he offers of the papers and the conversations you can have in meeting with him to discuss them made this class the one that has most improved my writing, because I know that I cannot blow it off until the last minute and do well, and also know that there are plenty of ways for me to make sure it is not horrendous. ",
            "\u00a0i would recommend this course to you a lot if you have standard bourgeois views about morality, not because i think these views are less defensible (tho surprise i totally think that), but because you'll be interested in a lot more of the conversations that occur. if you have weird fringe views on moral philosophy, then there probably won't be as much in it for you since you might not care about the discussion as often, and you'll probably serve as That Person that other students tell their suitemates has really stupid views. of course, that could be totally wrong and just my experience. or, if you are that fringe person who goes to the first few classes and thinks man there are some really hard questions that poke holes in my philosophy but these questions about whether moral dilemmas can exist are not those questions, then just go for it and ask to talk about something totally different. people will probably thank you for it, but more importantly, you'll get a lot more out of the class. unrelated: surprisingly, almost everyone behaves themselves in the interrupt-at-any-time format; you might have one aggressive dude who will just refuse not to talk sometimes, but i honestly did not think it was a problem. shelly also cuts people off who talk too much to call on other people who haven't spoken a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, would recommend, it's very interesting material that people really don't think too much about because they go, \"Oh, ethics? C'mon, who needs a class on that,\" but you really do learn a lot about how ethicists engage with the topic and their subject material that really helps you think about ethical problems. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend. This class will improve your speaking and it will help you deconstruct arguments. That being said, take it Cr/D because Professor Kagan is quite ruthless when it comes to grading. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! 100% take this class. Shelly Kagan is amazing, kind, very attentive, SUPER funny, and electrifyingly smart. He will take apart every single idea that you have and it will be a great learning experience. ",
            "\u00a0This class was one of the highlights of my Yale academic experience. I have never had more engaging seminar discussions, or more careful and considered feedback on my work. Although I was (and still am) skeptical of the subject itself, I would highly recommend this course to anyone broadly interested in thinking about moral philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely would recommend this course. Taking a seminar with Shelly Kagan is a once in a lifetime privilege. His thinking is exceptionally sharp and, most importantly, he is so willing to share his thinking with students. This course is more about elevating your reasoning and argumentation abilities than settling your moral principles forever. To those ends, this course is extremely successful. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in developing his or her own ethical views. "
