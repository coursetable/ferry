            "\u00a0I improved my writing (creative and argumentative), and learned more concrete ways to express my opinions. Nothing said in class is not challenged by someone else, so you really have to back up your thoughts. Wonderful class. ",
            "\u00a0This class was one of the most thought-provoking, intellectually stimulating classes that I have ever had the privilege of taking.  Every week, through the assigned readings and class discussions, I learned to challenge my way of thinking about capitalism, society, and government.  More concretely, because we had to write an essay a week, I learned how to be efficient in my writing and how to write a convincing, original, interesting piece of work every week.  My reading speed got faster as well. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to write effectively. The course prompted me to challenge my own opinions and assumptions about the world. This course taught me to think more flexibly and critically. Through the course, I truly came to appreciate what a 'liberal arts education' means. It means engaging with viewpoints across the spectrum of opinion, viewing the evidence presented, and forming your own thoughts accordingly. I gained a far deeper understanding of the sociopolitical and cultural implications of capitalism. The course set the stage in classical capitalist literature (Smith, Smiles, Alger, etc.) and then moved into the modern era, culminating in an examination of capitalism in modern Asia. It was excellently planned. One of my favorite courses at Yale! ",
            "\u00a0I honed my ability to condense information and craft a punchy argument in few words. ",
            "\u00a0Writing, close reading ",
            "\u00a0Over the course of the semester, I came to question my own beliefs. I developed more thoughtful opinions on the meaning of success and morality in a capitalist system. I also gained a better understand of why I hold certain beliefs (i.e., what my own beliefs are rooted in). I also learned a lot from the other people in the class - from their experiences/insights, which came out in their essays. ",
            "\u00a0This course has been the best seminar I've ever taken at Yale. We read books that are often quoted but never read (i.e. Marx, Smith, Rand) and also explored capitalism through novels (starting from Horatio Alger, then to modern-day Asia). Tom Easton also happens to be the finance editor at the Economist, is whip-smart, and is basically a walking encyclopedia, but also the best professor I've had at Yale, despite not being an actual Yale professor. He is incredibly adept at assessing each student's strengths and weaknesses, and allows you to take risks. He even comes up to Yale on weekends to meet with you on your papers, and brings snacks to every class! This course perfectly marries creative writing, economic theory, literature, current events, and the seminar/liberal arts experience. I learned how to write a series of short 700 word essays, understand the real-life (but fictional) stories behind economics, critique my classmates' writing, and have had many thoughtful conversations about the most random things with Tom. If he ever decides to teach this seminar again, it would be an incredible learning experience for any Yale student. ",
            "\u00a0Writing, literary analysis, argumentative analysis, oral argumentation ",
            "\u00a0I read interesting works on broad economic, political, and social ideas. I learned to write creatively and clearly. ",
            "\u00a0I would like to emphasize that this has been *the best* class I have taken at Yale, thus far. \r\n\r\nIn the Literature of Capitalism, you trace the development of capitalism from late 1800s America (rags to riches/pull yourself up by the bootstraps) to modern day China. I had the tremendous opportunity to read many of the thinkers whose theories shaped society as we know it, today (like Smith, Marx, Coase, Hayeck) and others who commented on the state of society through stories (Rand, Hamid, Shen)\r\n\r\nThrough these readings, this course forces you to consider: what is capitalism? Why does it exist?  Then, as capitalism progresses, the course progresses as well and you consider how society should be organized and whether there is a place for morality in a capitalist society. \r\n\r\nIn addition to learning and thinking about a number of new topics, this class has made me a better thinker and a better writer. Through the weekly essays, and Mr. Easton's feedback, I began to develop a voice in my writing. I also became a more thoughtful listener. \r\n\r\nThis is the best class I have taken at Yale and hope Mr. Easton will have the opportunity to teach it again. "

            "\u00a0The syllabus was perfect - a great blend of fiction and theory. The class was structured very well. I never felt like the 2 hours dragged on. Every minute was engaging and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Easily the biggest strength of this course was the professor.  Professor Easton is incredibly knowledgeable, and it seems as though he has read every book ever written.  He has such developed and well-thought out opinions on so many issues, and was willing to challenge every student on their points of view.  Coming to class each week was a highlight because I so enjoyed listening to him speak and interact with the class. \r\n\r\nThe only weakness that comes to mind (and I would hardly even consider it a weakness) would be the volume of essays we had to write.  We had to write one (short) paper a week, which was a lot of work.  That being said, I thought that this was vital to the success of the class, and I am not sure that the class would work as well any other way.  Reading essays from students each week was a great part of the class. ",
            "\u00a0The course's strengths are in its rigorous syllabus and engaging discussions. The books explore capitalism at a deep level. The course attempts to understand the social effects of capitalism and the cultural shifts capitalist societies undergo through revolution and liberalization. The morality and ethics of the capitalist system was a constant theme examined throughout the course readings. This isn't just an economics course (though the economic understanding imparted will underpin the other aspects of discussion). The literature we read encompasses every aspect of society. To understand capitalism properly, you need to understand the human perspectives in the capitalist world. The literature, accordingly, often explore the universal case through a particular one, following along a protagonist who is illustrative of the larger point. (And each book we read had different arguments and made differnt contributions to the class discussion: this made comparative analysis all the more interesting.) We used metaphor to better analyze what capitalism is, how it arises and its various sociological and economic impacts. I loved this class. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Easton stands out as a great facilitator of discussion. He knows exactly when he needs to speak up and change the course and when to let it go on, and I always felt like all the time spent in the class was valuable and interesting. The work demand is just about right and I really couldn't point out any significant flaws in the course. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: great readings throughout the course\r\nweaknesses: it would have been better if everyone's essays were put in a dropbox ",
            "\u00a0The best part of this course was reading aloud essays - I learned so much from my classmates, and really enjoyed hearing what they'd written. I wish we had spent more time talking about people's ideas. We often rushed through the essay portion of the class, and did not get the chance to discuss them in more depth. I think our discussions of the books should have centered upon the essays more. The first part of the class was a bit too much like a game of trivia, and I learned a lot of fun facts, but did not get much else out of it. ",
            "\u00a0Not much more to add - only variable is that the seminar experience is highly dependent on the other students in the seminar, so maybe a better way to select more active participants? ",
            "\u00a0This was an amazing class!!!! ",
            "\u00a0Professor Easton is this class's greatest asset. He's one of the most knowledgeable you will ever meet - He seems to know everything. Just wish we could've stayed on track and discussed the readings in more depth instead of reading papers aloud in class. ",
            "\u00a0This course's strength's begin with a fascinating syllabus. Each book that we read presented a different perspective and allowed us to deepen our understanding of the development of capitalism in a different way. I particularly enjoyed the books at the end of the syllabus (How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia, White Tiger and A Tiger's Heart). \r\n\r\nI really enjoyed the structure of the class, how we began with a class discussion and then went into a read-out-loud of out papers. \r\n\r\nI also really appreciate Mr. Easton's efforts to help me improve and develop my writing. He was thoughtful in his feedback, and wanted to see us become the best writers we could be. \r\n\r\nDuring some of our \"beginning of class\" discussions, I would have appreciated tying the discussion  more closely to the reading. For example, during the week of White Tiger, we discussed taxes and marriage. Although these concepts came-up in the reading, I didn't see them as central themes in the book and therefore didn't fully understand the entire point of our class discussion. \r\n\r\nI wish we had a bit more time after each of the papers to internalize the subject matter and ask questions/discuss the papers. Sometimes, I felt as though we jumped from paper to paper so fast that I didn't have time to fully appreciate the ideas. "

            "\u00a0Take it. Best course I've taken at Yale. Professor Easton is a legend!!! ",
            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY! This class will allow you to explore different sides of the capitalist/communist/fascist debate and improve your writing tremendously. Professor Easton is wonderful and really cares about each one of his students. This is by far one of the best classes at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I cannot recommend this class highly enough.  Although the title is \"Literature of Capitalism\", what I found to be a more apt title is \"Literature of the Human Spirit\".  So many more questions than just those concerning capitalism were continuously raised in this class--questions about society, government, morality, good, evil, and free will, among others.  In no other class have I been motivated to think as critically about works of literature, or about my own points of view than in Professor Easton's class.  Professor Easton is a world class scholar whose intelligence, poise, clarity of expression, and rigor will impress you every single week.  I cannot say enough good things about this class.  Take this class if you want to be seriously challenged and come away a changed person. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I certainly recommend this course to another student. Caveat emptor: only take the course if you are truly interested in engaging with the ideas of capitalism and understanding the fabric of the capitalist society from all sorts of perspectives, through literature. The reading is plentiful and necessary for the course. Reading the syllabus and encountering these ideas makes you a better person, but that takes a decent amount of work. I believe that anyone with an interest in social science, history, literature, etc. can find this course illuminating and engaging, but they have to be prepared to read and write at a high level. Be ready for your writing to be challenged and critiqued (always in a friendly and warm way): this process makes you a better writer. The course and the professor were very open, accessible and friendly at all times. But the intellectual standards were high. And I loved that about the course. ",
            "\u00a0The Literature of Capitalism was an excellent course, and if offered again I would certainly recommend it. If you expect it to be semester-long course in being a free market apologist, you're about half right. Most of the readings are geared toward learning about capitalism's good side, as one might expect, but especially since most discussion is facilitated via students reading their own papers (which you write each week, ~700 words) aloud, generally speaking each book is dissected and viewed from a number of different perspectives, both economic and literary. If you enjoy reading and writing in a creative style, this class would be a must-take--Easton encourages creative takes on essay-writing (e.g. writing an obituary page for the characters), and the books--especially near the semester's end--are wonderful reads. Last but not least, the professor, Thomas Easton, is very intelligent (Google him!) and worth talking to, but best of all he makes himself available quite often for extended one-on-one feedback sessions on your essays. This class will certainly improve your writing and reading skills greatly. ",
            "\u00a0Please take it. ",
            "\u00a0I recommend this course with certain reservations. For a liberal-minded student, this course was frustrating at times - the syllabus is biased (generally very pro-capitalist), and it is sometimes difficult to challenge to speak out and challenge the instructor, as he is very well informed and confident in his opinions. That being said, this was one of the most intellectually stimulating classes I've taken. I recommend it to anyone who is committed to questioning their own beliefs and gaining a deeper understanding of capitalism from a variety of lenses. I thoroughly enjoyed (most of) the books we read, and feel that I've developed as a writer/thinker. ",
            "\u00a0Aaaaa\r\n\r\nThis is a class about capitalism, but not really. If you've ever thought about what it means to achieve success and at what cost it comes at, take this class. There are substantial readings (almost a book a week) and a 600-ish word essay each week. But the readings are more than worth it (a mix of canonical works & novels), and putting effort into the essays (which are pretty open-ended) will greatly improve your writing. \r\n\r\nTom is whip-smart, an editor at The Economist (keep this in mind when writing your essays), incredibly open-minded and approachable, and will see right through you (in the best way). Also, he brings snacks from gheav every week to class, and will make an effort to meet with you throughout the semester. If you have any interest at all in writing, reading great books, economic theory, literature, current events, or philosophy, you won't be disappointed in this class. ",
            "\u00a0Without reservation! Take this class ",
            "\u00a0Yes you should. You'll gain a broad understanding of economic and social ideas. The readings are canonical and get very interesting toward the end. Professor Easton is super knowledgeable and enthusiastic about teaching and brought snacks to EVERY SINGLE CLASS. It's one of the few rare classes at Yale where you get to be super creative with your writing, which is so valuable. I hope Professor Easton will get to teach the class again in the future. ",
            "\u00a0This is the best class that I have taken at YaleI think ANYONE would benefit and enjoy this class. \r\n\r\nIn the Literature of Capitalism, you trace the development of capitalism from late 1800s America (rags to riches/pull yourself up by the bootstraps) to modern day China.
