            "\u00a0This course provided me with a survey of some of the most influential cases of insurgency and counterinsurgency, in addition to an understanding of how practitioners and social scientists alike have perceived and analyzed these cases. ",
            "\u00a0The historical bases of insurgency and counterinsurgency operations, along with case studies and modern day examples. ",
            "\u00a0The course material gives you a fantastic base for knowing and talking about cases of insurgency and COIN, but moreover really gives a fantastic briefing on theories of war, military politics, questions about war and intervention in general. I went in knowing almost nothing about anything about war, and came out being able to converse intelligently and form coherent, supported opinions on such divisive issues such as America's involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Seriously, it's a great course, and if you want to understand foreign policy through the angle of the small wars (that add up to big turning points), then definitely do it! ",
            "\u00a0This course expanded my knowledge on the subject of Insurgency and Counterinsurgency through the intense readings and the discussions of Prof Wilson. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely learned a ton about different terminology in the class. Also learned about conflicts I never knew existed, such as the Malayan Emergency and the Mau Mau uprising. The class helped form my opinions on insurgencies and war in general, and the readings made me think of concepts I had never thought about before. "

            "\u00a0This course was really great in terms of providing its students with a survey of some of the major cases of civil conflict and how it has influenced COIN tactics and policy surrounding them.  Students thinking of taking this class should be warned that the reading load is denser than that in the the average Yale college seminar, though.  The \"commonplace bookings\" (essentially reading responses on each session's readings) were a really great place for students with an interest in a particular case of counterinsurgency to explore that case and connect it to what we were discussing in class. ",
            "\u00a0The course is structured well with good readings, however, the readings may get too intense at times. ",
            "\u00a0This course was absolutely fantastic. A refreshing opportunity to have forthright and open discussions about the implications of and basis for U.S. security and defense policy in the context of counterinsurgency. "

            "\u00a0Overall, I would definitely recommend this course to another student if they had an interest in insurgency and COIN. ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested in getting into the psychology of the insurgent and techniques of how to (and how the U.S. is failing to) counter the insurgents, I would strongly advise you to take this class ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to any student even remotely interested in insurgencies, or contemporary U.S. defense policy as a whole. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I've already recommended it to several classmates who've expressed interest in the subject. "
