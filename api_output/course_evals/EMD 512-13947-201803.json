            "\u00a0Strength - examinations were fair.\r\nWeakness - not very accessible to a student that hadn't taken immunology before and has a weaker background in science. I had to work VERY HARD to catch up even after the first lecture to try to grasp the concepts that were \"review\" to other students. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this class. I appreciated that Dr. Krause explicitly put all the information that we were expected to learn on his slides. I thought that the group presentations, as well as guest lectures, helped to broaden our understanding of immunology epidemiology. However, I think one group presentation would be sufficient. ",
            "\u00a0This course was excellent! By far my favorite course all semester. The subject is fascinating, the workload is reasonable, and the exams are fair. You couldn't find a better immuno course. ",
            "\u00a0I think that it would be helpful to integrate the lectures that were given after the final throughout the course instead of having all of the basic immunology lectures first with the public health lectures at the end. ",
            "\u00a0A standard immunology course. Not a huge public health focus but integral if you want to do biological/bench science. ",
            "\u00a0The course was a good basic overview of immunology. Having never taken a formal immunology course before, I found it to be very helpful in my understanding. Lectures at times could be dry but the information was very important. It definitely felt more like a biology class. ",
            "\u00a0The slides for this course are extremely thorough and detailed, which is very helpful for studying...but also very helpful if you don't want to go to class. The instructor reads directly off them, so there's no real need to go to class unless you're presenting. Still, you still learn the material, whether you do it in class or at home. The exams are challenging but fair, and the presentations are a low pressure way of applying what we've been learning along with some presentation practice. ",
            "\u00a0Great overview of the immune system. For EMD people, the class really helps to make sense of infectious disease progression or pathogen mechanisms of action. I feel like a blanket has been lifted from my eyes now that I understand the basics of the immune system. ",
            "\u00a0Good class, Professor Krause was great! ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed this course.  It was a great introduction to immunology, and I appreciated the biological focus of it. ",
            "\u00a0STRENGTHS\r\n-- The group presentations were a good way to engage with classmates and with the material, and master a specific topic.\r\n-- The final paper allowed me to delve into a topic and learn more about how the immune system works on my own time. In order to explain something, I needed to use my brain and understand it. \r\n-- The PowerPoints were thorough. The course materials were well-organized, each unit with its outline and handouts.\r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES\r\n-- Class periods should include activities where students discuss questions together. The TA or Learning and Teaching Center can give inspiration on translating immunology into group activities.\r\n-- There were 2 midterms, 2 presentations, 1 paper. 1 of the midterms could be replaced by 1 or 2 homework assignments. This would have given a chance to shine to those of us who have no background in biology and are starting from 0 at memorizing these concepts. Student understanding builds up incrementally over time, not in one heroic push. So student work should be evaluated incrementally, with a few more small assignments. \r\n-- Few buy textbooks on a grad student budget; consider using online materials from the Yale library, or scanning relevant readings and uploading to Canvas.\r\n-- The most helpful way to organize course readings on Canvas is in a File, which can be downloaded in its entirety, and then easily accessed when offline or facing slow internet access. Modules and links to external websites are difficult to navigate. It is easier to download all the files for each class in one go, and that is best done when they are all included in a folder in Files. \r\n-- As an example to emulate, Physiology for Epidemiologists consistently connected physiology concepts to epidemiology. Immunology would have benefited from talking more about epidemiological implications of these physical processes. This would be helpful for those who will not continue studying immunology but want to understand its relevance. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n-professor organized lectures according to book chapters, which was helpful to track along with the textbook\r\n-The exams covered important concepts\r\n-discussion group presentations were adequate for exploring topics in immunology \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-having one lecture be an overview and the next lecture details of the effector mechanisms made understanding some of the concepts difficult-- it was difficult to visualize how the components of the immune system worked together\r\n-timing was an issue: some discussions went over class time \r\n\r\n\r\nA difficult part of learning immunology was figuring out how everything worked out overall-- it may have been better to not separate out the details of the effector mechanisms and instead just show how everything occurs more sequentially ",

            "\u00a0Dr. Krause is awesome! Although at times lectures could be a tad dry (in my past experience, kind of just the nature of immunology), he did his best to make them fun and always had fun little jokes or stories that he inserted into lecture. He is a very approachable professor who wants everyone to succeed. Would highly recommend him as a professor. ",
            "\u00a0Peter is great! Honestly really enjoyed his teaching style. He puts a lot of effort into answering student questions and wants to make sure everyone learns the material. He is just overall a very positive individual and a great prof. ",
            "\u00a0Very knowledgeable and approachable. Needs to improve lectures so that it's not just text that he is reading off of. ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Krause was very helpful and friendly. One possible improvement is to make the slides less wordy. He often went fast, which at times could make it difficult to take notes. He was very knowledgeable on the topic and could answer most questions. ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Krause is a good instructor, who very much knows his stuff, and makes sure to find out if he doesn't. His slides are extremely thorough, which is very helpful, but in class he generally reads directly off them, which can make actually attending lecture not strictly necessary. I don't consider this a bad thing, however, as the material still gets learned. He is very available for questions, very friendly, and pleasant. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Very chill and likeable professor. Always encouraged questions in class. \r\nWeaknesses: Could rely less on reading from the slides. It made some classes very dull to just have information read from the presentation ",
            "\u00a0A great professor! ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Krause is a great instructor.  He was helpful with questions during class, and I appreciated that he acknowledged when he was outside of his area of expertise.  Lecture slides were dense and difficult to follow at times. ",
            "\u00a0STRENGTHS\r\n-- The professor is very organized, and repeats important points enough to emphasize them to the listeners. The lectures were concise and to the point.\r\n-- The professor is friendly and encouraging. The professor was a pleasant audience to have when we gave presentations to the class; he was supportive and asked questions to get us thinking. He responded promptly to emails. \r\n-- The professor is very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about immunology.\r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES\r\n-- The professor often spoke too fast for me to follow, rarely pausing for questions. It would be helpful if the professor would pause to gauge whether students are understanding the material. Ask a simple but important question, like Can anyone recap the difference between innate and adaptive immunity? or Are there any questions on innate immunity? or Does anyone remember where t cells mature? Then wait for students to raise hands (count to 15 silently while students think, then repeat or rephrase the question if there are no takers). This will require students to retrieve the information, engage with the material, summarize what they have learned, and give the professor real-time feedback about the effectiveness of his words at conveying the information. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed having Professor Krause as an instructor. He was always very positive and engaged with material, and he seems to really care for his students. I really appreciated his good humor and kindness. ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Krause did well as an instructor overall. He made sure to make the class aware the he was available to answer questions and he welcomed questions during lecture. He did forget to make time for presentations some days, but he seemed to try to work on that throughout the semester. He also tended to read off the slides. He could further improve on this by just describing and explaining the figures, because he did well to explain everything and it seemed like a reiteration of the previous slides anyways. Overall, good job. ",

            "\u00a0Love the course, love Peter. Take this course if you can. It's worth the money (and debt) we are all paying. ",
            "\u00a0Good introduction to immunology ",
            "\u00a0The class provided an good background of immunology topics important for understanding infectious disease. The material is not particularly challenging but there often is a lot to memorize. it is very helpful for those without any background in this field bu may be redundant for those who already have a strong biology background. ",
            "\u00a0A straightforward, clear course that covers a broad breadth of immunology but starts from a very beginner place. The slides contain all the information and are generally read verbatim in lecture, so going to class isn't always necessary. You will need to study for the exams - immunology is a complicated, memorization-based subject. ",
            "\u00a0Great overview of the immune system. For EMD people, the class really helps to make sense of infectious disease progression or pathogen mechanisms of action. Definitely wish this class was recommended earlier in the EMD core class cycle since it helps clarify information from other classes. ",
            "\u00a0This course introduces the topic of immunology, and focuses on important immunological topics for infectious disease epidemiology.  It is helpful to have a background in human biology, but this is not necessary (although the course will require more effort from those without a biology background). ",
            "\u00a0This course is best for someone with a background in biology, since much of it is memorization and the terminology will be challenging for someone without prior familiarity. The course had a minimal epidemiology component. The course was a very helpful introductory look at immunology. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it because the subject is so fascinating and important. ",
            "\u00a0The course went over the main concepts of immunology relevant for epidemiology and public health, and the concept of immunoepidemiology. While the course was generally easy to follow along and understand the concepts, there were sections that were difficult to understand, including how all the components interact with each other overall. The presentations from guest lectures and the group presentations helped the class explore concepts relevant to immunoepidemiology, and I felt they were a great way to explore the concepts in class and its application to public health work. I would recommend this course to a fellow student. ",
            "\u00a0For non-EMD students its a lot science but really interesting. "
