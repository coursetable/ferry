            "\u00a0Learned a large amount about French from basic grammar to several different tenses. ",
            "\u00a0Introductory French in terms of language but also culture ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to speak and read some French, pretty self explanatory. ",
            "\u00a0An amazing course! I've taken L3 and L4 Spanish at Yale, and L1 French quite possibly covered more material and developed my language skills faster/better than I expected, thanks to Mme. DeVos. ",
            "\u00a0I went from no french knowledge to learning a great amount of french in a short time. Considering it being only one semester so far, I can read and write a remarkable amount, although have some trouble understanding speech and I need to work on speaking it myself. ",
            "\u00a0This course I learned the basic skills needed to speak elementary French. I learned also about how to relate to other cultures and languages. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a good working knowledge of the very basics of French. I came in knowing absolutely nothing and now can conjugate many verbs in the present tense as well as use two past tenses (not perfectly of course but surprisingly well given only a few months of instruction). I was also shocked to find that I can now write a composition of a few hundred words fully in French on the spot. The immersive learning style of the class is also very good, such that I've noticed I can now pick up a lot of words when just listening to a random French program or speaker. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a great amount of confidence in my ability to speak, read, and hear French throughout my term in French 110. "

        [
            "\u00a0I came into this course with three years of high school French. I tested into L1 because I could not speak/hear it, I could only do some very, very basic reading and writing. This course is fast paced and immersive. I found it a good pace and very engaging for someone like me who had previous French knowledge, but the people I knew in the course who were new to the language had a harder time and had to put in at least twice the work that I had to. ",
            "\u00a0Fast pace and workload can be hard to keep up with but since the language itself isnt too hard, it evens out. Maybe have a list every week of important vocabulary so we can have a constantly growing list instead of one giant one at the end. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Well organized and facilitated learning VERY well. Mme. DeVos is such a great teacher and I don't think I would've enjoyed this course or learned so much without her (having shopped L1 French in the past with other professors and not have such a good impression). \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: N/A. This course was great. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: learn a lot in short amount of time. Well structured. Weaknesses: Not sure how helpful the videos are. Very intense and fast, can be overwhelming. ",
            "\u00a0The course was instructive and fun. I love how the videos are able to give us a glimpse of real French culture. A strength of the course is that the students are totally surrounded by the language. A weakness of the course was the monotony of the assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Madame DeVos is a true gem, a view that the entirety of the class shared. Her dedication to her students and the course, the amount of attention she paid to the content of each class and to answering our questions, her enthusiasm for the subject, and her openness and availability to answering questions and concerns were unparalleled. I was initially worried about the immersive style of the class--and somewhat overwhelmed--but Madame DeVos pulled it off so effectively and competently that I wished I had learned all languages this way. It was clear not only that she is completely fluent and proficient in the language, but that she is excellently trained and puts great effort in how to teach language This cannot be said of most professors at Yale--that they are not only content experts but experts at conveying the content. I almost always understood everything she said in class, even though it was nearly entirely in French and I did not even know the most basic words in French before August.\r\nI have been in various language classes throughout my life, having studied four others besides French, and by far this was the most well-organized, natural, and effective style of instruction I have yet seen. \r\nThe only potential disadvantage or criticism that I can make of the class is that the workload is quite heavy. It's not impossible, but French really does have to become one of your priority courses in order for you to do well in the class. During finals, I probably spent as much time on French as I did on my thesis! The payoff is good--I think we all learned a great deal--but not everyone may want to commit so much time to the class, and yet still want to be able to gain some French skills. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of the course is the quality of the instructors. Madame DeVos was an incredible instructor, and is the greatest asset to this course. The textbook, workbook, and online materials were all concise and helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The structure of the class which involves all participants and the intensive usage of words and topics learned is an excellent way to actively gain confidence in the topics learned, \r\nIt would be helpful to actually read more texts during the lesson, practicing reading out loud and experimenting with texts more complex than written conversations. A more intensiv attention to grammar topics will be helpful as well. "

            "\u00a0Yes! ",

            "\u00a0Yes, definitely. The course was great, but Madame DeVos made the course fantastic. To everyone, I would recommend a course instructed by Madame DeVos. ",
