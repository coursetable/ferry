            "\u00a0This course provided a strong survey into current challenges within the American Intelligence Community. Through the course's memorandum and paper, I was able to engage with the academic and practical debates in the field. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to analyze intelligence failures and look at how we should approach intelligence in different ways. ",
            "\u00a0The class reached into the arena's of politics, law, intelligence etc. which gave me greater insight into the way the US government works. ",
            "\u00a0This was unlike most other courses I've taken at Yale, in that analysis was encouraged over blind memorization of facts. I learned how to look at the history of US foreign policy from the standpoint of intelligence. We learned about the operations, structure, and tools of the intelligence community, and looked at a number of case studies. There was an exploration of the IC's relationship to the policy community, the public, other intelligence forces, etc. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about different issues related to the history and present nature of Intelligence in an American and international context. For some events, like Pearl Harbor, I relearned the history from the context of intelligence, but for other events and happenings, I learned about completely new information as well as its relevance to American intelligence priorities. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a great way to develop a very comprehensive understanding of the Intelligence Community in the US. Not only did we come to understand how agencies work, but also the major challenges they have confronted from the beginning of the IC to 9/11 to the Iraq WMD debacle to the future. Great course, highly recommend. ",
            "\u00a0The course was structured as a mix of themes (intelligence failures, intelligence reform in the context of the 9/11, WMD and CIA Detention Program Commissions, etc.) and case studies (Apple v. FBI, the hunt for UBL, etc.). This balance provided a broad, yet sufficiently in-depth presentation of the \"headliner\" issues in the intelligence community. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a much deeper understanding about the American Intelligence Community and the role that intelligence plays in national security and global affairs. By discussing many of the previous intelligence failures of the past and by understanding how the IC is set up today, we were able to look at current intelligence concerns and think about the best way to approach them. ",
            "\u00a0I gained both a robust historical-theoretical understanding of intelligence operations generally and a more specific knowledge of the recent American context. ",
            "\u00a0I was able to understand the Intelligence Community much better and practiced writing an intelligence memo. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think about intelligence. "

            "\u00a0I thought the course was well organized and that Professor Wittenstein made the lectures enjoyable and informative. Sections in the beginning could have been a bit more organized, but overall a strong course. ",
            "\u00a0This class is great! Section is engaging, and classes are interesting. \r\n\r\nMy only suggestion is to have more open discussion in lecture, since it wasn't a very big class. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the material was very interesting. However, readings were often summarized during lectures, which minimized time for discussion beyond the readings. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very well taught and organized. The lectures were clear, easy to follow, the readings were always relevant. No real weaknesses in my opinion, fantastic class ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are that Professor Wittenstein is a great lecturer, and I learned a lot from his interactive presentations. I especially enjoyed being able to talk about my thoughts on certain subjects in lecture, as Professor Wittenstein often asked for different points of views on topics throughout the class.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness, I think, is that some readings assigned were too long and intense. I didn't have a hard time with the class even when I missed some readings, but I regret having had to miss those readings in the first place. In my opinion, the readings were just too long to have completed practically. ",
            "\u00a0Can't think of any weaknesses. Possibly my favorite course at Yale with a great balance between work and learning. ",
            "\u00a0There was way too much reading, especially at the beginning of the course. ",
            "\u00a0The course did an excellent job of presenting timely, relevant material while also providing sufficient context. Classes in the foreign policy/national security field often lack one or the other. \r\n\r\nWould recommend that sections be conducted in a more seminar-like format. They often became mini-lectures given by the student presenting his/her memo for the week, with little to no time for discussion. \r\n\r\nAlso would like to recommend that there be no recap of the previous week's material at the beginning of each class. This took up lots of time, and became rather tedious. ",
            "\u00a0The whole class was great! Professor Wittenstein is highly knowledgeable and passionate about this field and it truly comes through in his lectures. No negatives - highly positive and enjoyable experience! ",
            "\u00a0This class was meant to be a seminar and wasnt well suited for the lecture room we were in. It seemed to change Prof. Wittensteins teaching dynamic for the worse. ",
            "\u00a0Get section to review the reading material and course content more. Lecture slides could be more informative if possible, and lecture should be less interactive to avoid being sidetracked by student questions. ",
            "\u00a0Wittenstein designs the course well. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely. This was a strong introduction to the current structure, reforms, and history of the Intelligence Community as well as a survey of current challenges facing the IC going forward. Professor Wittenstein made lectures enjoyable, informative, and engaging. This was the first time it was offered as a lecture, but don't let it being a lecture rather than seminar turn you away- the course remained engaging and quite interesting. One of the best in my Yale career! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I really enjoyed completing the assignments, they felt very relevant to real life, and you learn a lot. The class is engaging, section is great, and the workload is manageable. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class - you gain an understanding of the intelligence community and are taught by someone who used to work as part of it - not your everyday IR or political science class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes -- you'll learn to think about government and history from a new perspective, which is that of the Intelligence Community. It is a very fascinating study, and makes you think about American priorities as a nation differently in the context of security. It is fun and interactive and definitely enjoyable! ",
            "\u00a0In a heartbeat. Great course. So relevant and not a crazy workload. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to learn about the intelligence community, there is no better class at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0TAKE THIS CLASS! What a great introduction into the intelligence community while also being super engaging and interesting. Professor Wittenstein is truly a wonderful lecturer and super knowledgeable and passionate about these topics as he worked in this field for many years. There is quite a bit of reading required for section but the open-note midterm and either final paper or take home final exam was truly meant for engagement with the material instead of a regurgitation of material. One of the best classes I have taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0This is a very cool survey course that I would recommend. ",
            "\u00a0It covers the material well and remains very interesting throughout. ",

            "\u00a0It is a great course for learning about the intelligence field, the professor is very knowledgeable and the content of the course is very well organized. The work is not too hard at all. ",
