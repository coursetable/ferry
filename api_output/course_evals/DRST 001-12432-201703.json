            "\u00a0Directed Studies Literature helped me develop my skills in close reading texts and analyzing broader trends in larger works. I grew in my ability to write and communicate my ideas about literary works, as well as identify important passages as I read. Overall, the course helped me grow a lot in reading and writing. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the valuable skills of literary analysis and close reading. Throughout the essays it was very well taught and I learned many techniques ",
            "\u00a0I developed the skill to recognize important passages in otherwise dense pieces of literature. ",
            "\u00a0Western Canon ",
            "\u00a0To write precisely and accurately; to engage in close reading. ",
            "\u00a0I had not studied literature in two years, and never books this old, and so I learned to read these high-quality texts with a critical eye, being harsh in what I select to focus on, as in the DS syllabus, there are far more great ideas than there are time to discuss fully, so you learn to pick the best ones. \r\nI did not really appreciate what the point of doing latin was before this course, but to be able to read some of these books in their original language must be even better than reading them in translation. \r\nThis is probably the largest reading load by pages (although it obviously takes a lot longer to read a page in Phil), and so you learn to skim well. ",
            "\u00a0I developed my skills in close reading short passages. Knowledge about several techniques in classical literature was also gained, along with a working knowledge of the texts studied. "

            "\u00a0At times this class felt a little disorganized in discussion - not because of lack of planning, but at sometimes the discussion would be gaining momentum and then the moderator would switch to a different topic all of a sudden that we had not been thinking about. ",
            "\u00a0Directed Studies in general is great at being a collaborative effort to understand and interpret works of the Western Canon. In Literature specifically, I felt that I always left class with a deeper understanding than I had arrived with. In terms of improvement, the course in general could take more time to analyze the context in which the works were written - beyond just the life of the author. ",
            "\u00a0There isn't much room for depth of discussion due to the extreme breadth of the course. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the correlation between texts in this class and what we were learning in other DS classes. It provided another view of ancient culture, especially in a religious context. ",
            "\u00a0Lots of reading! ",
            "\u00a0The main strength of the course was the interdisciplinary nature of its content, which made it easy for me personally to see links to other DS classes. The rigorous syllabus, too, pushed me through honing my reading and writing skills. The weakness was that I felt my professor was not very engaging and did not facilitate discussions as well as I hoped. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly, the 9am start was a struggle but its easier than a large lecture to stay awake because you do get more engaged talking to each other and the lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0Could manage time for certain readings better. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength is definitely the expanse of works that are read which are enlightening. The discussion-based approach is also a strength.\r\nI think the course could be improved if student-involvement is better centralised, rather than the instructor dictating the flow of the class each meeting.

            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student. In terms of writing improvement and reading improvement, Directed Studies is a tremendous resource that Yale offers. In addition, the literature syllabus in particular is full of really engaging texts. ",
            "\u00a0Probably not. It is too ambitious and tries to cover too much too quickly ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It was a very interesting course and very worth it to read three hours every week. ",
            "\u00a0Depends on the student. If youre interested in the humanities/social sciences, yes. ",
            "\u00a0These are books that are good to read, not so you get the references, but because they are enjoyable. You may not like all of them, but there will likely be a few you love. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend Directed Studies because it is an extremely valuable and unique experience within the Yale ecosystem. The Literature section in particular is very enlightening. "
