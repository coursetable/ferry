            "\u00a0amazing syllabus that definitely expanded my worldview. ",
            "\u00a0Please take this class regardless of your major.  I have been interested in critical theory and radical thought for a few years at this point, and Intro to Third World Studies was the first class where I was able to learn what these were in legible terms.  In fact, that was one of the course's most important functions.    It managed to make theories that carry great ideological weight, which would otherwise be slopped in front of students in High Theoretical English, linguistically and conceptually accessible.  I also managed to acquire a wider vocabulary for depicting a wider and more varied view of oppression and exploitation (Hint: These concepts are more universally-encompassing than you think).  Again, please take this class! ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to analyze different political and social theories. I also drew many connections between my position as a double minority in the United States and the struggle of peoples in the Third World. ",
            "\u00a0I only had a vague idea about what Third World Studies was before this class, and Professor Okihiro (who is INCREDIBLE) really helped me gain a nuanced understanding of it. Through taking TWS, I was also able to refine my own politics and engage with so many interesting readings. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how every single system we have in the world is corrupt. Seriously. Everything is a part of the capitalist machine and it's basically impossible to get out. Good luck. ",
            "\u00a0I read a wide swath of radical intellectuals, including Fanon, Freire, Mandela, Du Bois, Said, Csaire, Trask, Crenshaw, Lorde, Spivak, Butler, the Combahee River Collective, and others. I feel like I have learned about both the great potential of radical intellectualism as well as its many shortcomings, which is very useful as I continue to debate to what extent I will live my life in the academy. ",
            "\u00a0The ability to apprehend structures of power and locate oneself in this really messed-up world! The ability to understand why things are the way they are. ",
            "\u00a0you learn lots in constructing and dissecting a critical and theoretical framework by which to examine imperialism, colonialism, capitalism, race, resistance, gender, sexuality, etc., which was eye-opening. for me, learning about the field of critical theory actually shifted my worldview and how I approach a lot of topics and issues ",
            "\u00a0I learnt an alternative history of the US, which focuses on the sources of oppression. I also learnt how to apply the theories we learnt in order to critically reflect on current societies and social organizations. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a more complex understanding of oppression--especially as oppressions around the globe can be linked to one another. ",
            "\u00a0A different way to think about the world. The legacies of colonialism and imperialism, how our identities are fashioned by our race/gender/sex/class/nationality, etc. It's really hard to explain the things I learnt from this class but it has honestly changed my perspective on a lot of things and also the way I am approaching my own discipline (which is not even remotely related to ER&M, I'm an Environmental Studies major). ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about intellectual history, and how to put post-colonial theorists in conversation with each other. This course uses a LOT of theory, but it never felt inaccessible or overly abstract. Additionally, the readings gave me new insight into the discourse that has allowed the United States to progress the way in which it has. I learned how to ground theory in real-life experience as well, which is very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0A very important class in conceptualizing yourself within the social formation of the world. Basically an introduction to critical theory. ",
            "\u00a0The class readings were fantastic. I had never been exposed to Third World Studies or power studies in general and found the material to be extremely fascinating, pertinent, and something that all Yale students should learn about. ",
            "\u00a0an overview of the theory necessary to understand social formation and the relations of power as they relate to the third world ",

            "\u00a0A good introduction to critical theory ",
            "\u00a0I learned to critique what I am learning and not take it for granted. I learned more about what the \"third world\"even means and why its relevant to myself as a student of color at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided me a general overview of the field of Third World Studies (as opposed to Ethnic Studies). We read a lot of texts that have been important to the field and developed an idea of its history. This included texts on colonialism, imperialism, Orientalism, intersectional feminism, intersectional anti-racism, etc. We also discussed some different theory; i.e. World Systems Theory, theory of race as social formation, etc. Basically a crash course on many thinkers/texts related to progressive movements aimed at achieving greater liberation for various groups.

            "\u00a0strengths- syllabus. material. okihiro knows a ton.\r\nweaknesses- lecture got more and more disorganized as class went on. ",
            "\u00a0This was one of the best classes I've taken in my life, so it's difficult to pinpoint specific strengths.  I was enraptured with very single lecture (which is rare) and section (WHICH IS RARE).  The class communicates most centrally how struggles against oppression are far more all-encompassing than a majority of people seem to assume.  For instance, one of its arguments is that the movements for sovereignty and freedom in the Third World did not simply call for a rupture with formal colonialism, but an inversion of the colonial world-system and a global alternative in the name of the transnational working class.\r\n\r\nAs for weaknesses, the only one that strikes me is an occasional need to provide more specific instructions for the final paper.  Also, a fair warning that the final paper involves writing an 8 to 10 page essay in mostly narrative form, but drawing on theory from 15 to 20 class sources--this seems a bit much to cram into this many pages unless the sources are engaged on a strictly superficial level.  I feel that this can be fixed either with a higher page limit or fewer sources required. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Okihiro's teaching style is a strength. He doesn't use lecture slides and his lecturing style is based on a combination of the readings and information he deems important for the week's themes/topics. It can get a bit crazy and disorganized from time to time, but for the most part it makes the class more engaging and authentic. The wide variety of readings was also great, as I felt I was reading material I wouldn't get around to in any of my other classes. That being said, there were WAY too many readings. In any given week, there would be a minimum of 80 pages, but the total would often be more than 100 and we had to synthesize all them into a paragraph long reading response. There just wasn't enough time for me to get to everything in any given week, but the expectation was that we would read everything from beginning to end. I think 3 readings is a good number for most weeks. As it stands now, the main number of readings is 4, sometimes even 5, which is more than for my seminar classes. It's too much to read and synthesize and talk about in class each week. ",
            "\u00a0There tend to be a lot of readings. My friend and I split up the readings, and even then it was still a lot! Otherwise, it was fantastic. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: really makes you think about your role in all of this. Are you the oppressor? Are you the subaltern?? Can you speak?!?!?!?! Can you be heard??\r\nWeaknesses: the readings are DENSE. the theory is COMPLICATED. And that's definitely what you sign up for, but it's also kind of intense after a while. Lots of questioning your life (that's actually a strength). But the readings are long and difficult if you're just not that good at readings.\r\nAlso, the lecture was disorganized and it was kind of hard to ask any questions because half the time you didn't know what was going on. But that's also the point because the world is really complicated. ",
            "\u00a0An unrealistic amount of reading. I think assigning shorter excerpts would make it more likely for people to think they actually have time to do the readings, thereby increasing student engagement. ",
            "\u00a0You get a very rigorous theoretical understanding of Third World Studies. It's the only class at Yale where you read this much revolutionary text. But sometimes it felt too theoretical, compared to its subject matter. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strength of this course is Professor Okihiro himself, and his level of engagement with the students and with his subject. The only weakness is that in the way the class is structured, it is difficult to understand the trajectory of the course until it is finished. It would be improved by providing a kind of overview at the beginning of the course. Additionally, a midterm examination is a very poor way of testing knowledge of theory. It would have made more sense to have a paper assigned on the essay topics which were the questions in the midterm. ",
            "\u00a0The professor and TFs are very passionate, and the class is designed so that you can develop a more insightful understanding of yourself in the world's social formation. This class also attracts students dedicated to justice. Unfortunately, this course had so many dense readings that didn't allow us to really dive into the the writers' arguments in a more focused way. This course is more of a survey course in that way. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: It will change the way you look at the world and give you the tools/knowledge that you need to find faults in the current systems that exist that perpetuate prejudice/the legacies of colonialism etc etc. The final paper will also make you think critically about your own life has been fashioned by the social formation (which you will learn about in this class). Prof Okihiro is also a really sweet and funny old guy who invented the field of Third World Studies itself so you get to learn from the very person who created all this terminology!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I'm sorry to say that I found the lectures quite boring and disorganized. Prof Okihiro speaks without notes or powerpoints and throws out a bunch of names that he writes on the blackboard that you never seem to use in future assignments, so initially it was confusing. The lectures feel very much like a rehash of the week's readings which is sad because it makes lecture feel like a waste of 1h 20 min. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was great at mindset-shifting. Gender and sexuality could be incorporated better into the course instead of essentially being shoved into the last couple of weeks. Although this isn't really a weakness, I wish we could've talked more about practical aspects of organizing, social change, etc.; I left the course with a greater understanding of why, for example, capitalism is bad but little understanding of how we move beyond that. ",
            "\u00a0The teaching fellows this year were honestly a highlight of the course. They were very helpful in understanding the sometimes dense readings, fair graders, and very approachable scholars. Professor Okihiro's lecture style is both a strength and weakness. It doesn't feel like a lecture in the sense that he is constantly asking for student input. He is very relaxed and open to student ideas. However, sometimes his lectures didn't have much of a focus, and he actually ran out of material a few times which was pretty disappointing. However, in the grand scheme of things, this didn't matter too much. He is very wise, immensely inspiring, and a living legend.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, section could have been more focused on understanding the readings sometimes. A few of them were hard to grasp for practically everyone. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: many of the readings are interesting, Professor Okihiro is a gem.\r\nWeaknesses: this is the kind of course where you're basically supposed to take the course's conclusions as law, and you will be graded on your ability to regurgitate the hyper-intellectual rhetoric in ways that mimic what the professor and TFs have said. Weekly reading responses are burdensome. I took this course with the expectation of a final exam, as listed on the syllabus, but it is a final \"take-home\" exam with one essay prompt distributed months in advance. In other words, it is a final essay -- I wish it had been listed as such. ",
            "\u00a0The readings were sometimes a lot and difficult. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: incredible readings and a great final project assignment. I really liked how the class always challenged you to critically analyze how you yourself fit into the narrative. It made everything 10x personal.\r\nWeaknesses: I found Okihiro to be a bit of a rambler and very rarely introduced the texts into classroom discussion. In fact, he said that it was the job of the TAs to link what he lectured about to the readings, and perhaps that would be a fine concept except for the fact that some TAs did not have a good control over the texts themselves. Thus, the texts were great and the lectures were great, but we rarely critically analyzed what we read or what we heard. I wish this would have been different because I worry I didn't retain or properly understand the concepts that I read. ",
            "\u00a0would love it if we read more gender theory/integrated better how sexism and colonialism/imperialism were intertwined ",
            "\u00a0I think one thing that it could improve is the way in which we are asked to place ourselves within third world studies. I think this shouldnt have been left to the end for the final paper but rather should have been an exercise that is begun earlier in the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course materials could be better organized, sometimes I felt a bit lost in the different directions we went with the topics. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely a really broad introduction so a lot of material is covered very briefly, but truly engaging lectures that weave together the personal and the political ",
            "\u00a0The readings are theoretical and we dive into a lot of different topics that go into making third world studies. I think the tests and assignments are straightforward and overall the class is very well organized. ",
            "\u00a0The course is extremely disorganized. While Prof Okihiro is great in his enthusiasm and depth of understanding of the content, his lecture style is a bit hard to follow. It's not necessarily that he's unclear, but more that he is a bit rambly and it is hard to always glean what the main points are that one should take away from each lecture. In response to apparent student feedback on this, Professor Okihiro said he was trying to subvert our expectations about time and narrative through his lecture style... Often times, lecture seemed to consist more of a history lesson interspersed with the professor putting up some definitions and names of important people on the board. This worked fine for me, as I think it provided a decent overview of the topic, but meant that lecture did not involve a lot of critical thinking (it was descriptive rather than argumentative). Another issue was that the readings were often quite disconnected from lecture. They were related in that they were about similar topics, sure, but rarely did we explicitly engage or address the readings in lecture. Finally, the grading style of the course was extremely unclear. The grades that students received on midterms seemed inconsistent with each other, and we ended up being assigned a final paper even though the syllabus specified a final exam. \r\nNonetheless, I think the strengths of the course are in that the reading list is quite good, if not rather heavy each week. I am glad to have had the opportunity to read the works that we did and become familiar with the theories and authors. I think some people who may have never taken a class on a topic like this may have liked more structure or guidance through the readings, but I was quite happy to just review them on my own--which is the other positive about this class. In order to learn the material, you do have to do some legwork on your own, but the great thing is that there are not that many assessments so you have a good deal of freedom in this. \r\nFinally, Professor Okihiro really is very well versed and I always got the impression he would be very happy to talk to individual students in depth, either about the material of the class or just about current social justice or political problems as well. I really appreciated hearing about some of his life experiences related to these political movements, which he would occasionally mention in class. ",
            "\u00a0The class is very well taught and super engaging, I think it at times was too reading focused. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - Prof. Okihiro genuinely cares about you and about this course. Weaknesses are perhaps the lack of structure, although I personally enjoyed that aspect. ",
            "\u00a0I think the strength of this course was the reading materials and content, while the organization of the lectures could have been better. "

Please take this class.\r\n\r\nNow that my main point has been said, the reason why is because it has a tendency to change the way in which people interpret the world around them, which can lead to powerful revelations and much deeper strategic questions that pertain to how to create social change. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It's a nontraditional class in the subject matter and it gets you thinking about your own privilege and relationship to the material. It is a unique opportunity to examine what kind of agent you want to be in history. ",
            "\u00a0HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it. It really does make you think about your life and how you are a piece in a capitalist machine that is killing people. Like, really. You are. Definitely do the readings. If you don't do the readings, you. are. screwed. (like I was.) Aaanyway, I think this class is good. But hard. But I recommend it. ",

            "\u00a0I would! ",
            "\u00a0yes! constructing a critical framework through which to understand systemic oppression, exploitation, discourse, critical theory, etc. the way you do in this class in this way is something you would be hard-pressed to find at Yale ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this class has been eye-opening. It has taught me both theory and a new way of viewing the organization of societies around me. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student who wants to open their eyes to the injustices around the world and the thinkers and theories that work against oppressive formations. ",
            "\u00a0It depends what kind of student you are. I know people who really loved this class to the point that they would call it their favourite class at Yale, but I also know other people who were disappointed by this class as well. Prof Okihiro teaches a lot about theorists and old philosophers relating to each week's topics. The problem is that most of the readings are very theoretical and dense to read which makes them so challenging to read and finish. I thought the lectures were dry, and when the TAs/guest lecturers came in they were the complete opposite - so fast that it was hard to understand what they were saying. At the same time I really don't regret taking the class because on hindsight it taught me so much about how and why certain prejudices and forces (e.g. neoliberalism) exist today. They also informed and deepened my understanding of my other classes. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student. The workload is light (a good amount of reading, but very few actual graded assignments) and it's easy to get a good grade in this course. At the same time, I found it intellectually very engaging. It might be accurate to say that this course is like a \"get-woke-101\" in that it constructs and fleshes out a worldview/framework for viewing how the world operates that would be useful for any student and could inform how students critically engage with materials in other classes. Professor Okihiro's lectures are engaging and he does great at admitting his weaknesses and gaps in knowledge in ways other professors often shy from. I think it would be a great course for anyone to take, regardless of future academic interests. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This course completely changed the way I think about my place in the world, and gave me the chance to read theorists that I may not have otherwise stumbled upon. Third World Studies provides a great framework for thinking about how power operates in the world, and it is a great overview of topics like social formation, neo-colonialism, and nationalism. Additionally the readings work very well together - it made writing the final paper an enjoyable challenge. Additionally, section felt like a safe space to share sometimes shaky ideas about the sometimes abstract ideas and learn from each other. But aside from all of this, take the class for Gary Okihiro!! He is a gem, and articulates concepts beautifully. ",
            "\u00a0As you will likely see in the other course evaluations, most people who take this class love it. There's a good chance that you will too. But keep in mind that all of the people who dropped it did not get to leave a course evaluation. I did not have the same experience in this course as I had expected based on the reviews. I consider myself to be a pretty radically progressive person, and I honestly feel like this class made me slightly more conservative because of how outlandish some of our conclusions were, how unsupported so many of the claims were that we were supposed to take at face value, and how hyper-intellectualized all of the discourse was to the point of no longer making any sense. One discussion about queer theory led us to the conclusion that there was NO possible way of resisting anything - or, perhaps more accurately, this was the conclusion presented by the course instructors and the conclusion that we, as students, had to agree with. If you don't like hardcore theory and discussions far outside the realm of reality then this course is probably not for you, even if you are extremely progressive. ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely. An incredibly important course to stop thinking in US centric perspectives. Important history too. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely. Even though it has its weaknesses, the concepts are extremely important for people to learn about, and Okihiro truly is one of the greatest scholars in this field. It is worth everyone's time to take this class. ",

            "\u00a0Yes!!! This is an AMAZING course. If you want to be more \"woke\" in your life and at Yale take it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it for someone interested in getting a not-too-intense grasp of some important texts and key ideas from anti-colonial movements, racial formation as social construct theory, intersectional feminism, etc. At the end of the day, this course was not a deep dive and it was somewhat unorganized, but I am glad to have taken it and acquired the knowledge. A good fifth course or class to take to expand your disciplinary horizons, so to speak. The assignment load was fairly light and manageable. Midterm was completely doable, although I found its grading somewhat subjective and dubious. Overall, it's helped me think more complexly about a lot of issues of race, gender, and ethnicity, and I appreciate that. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the professor is very engaging and sparks interesting discussions. ",
