            "\u00a0Great understanding of banking crises, both from a conceptual and a practical perspective. The topic entails a number of different themes, and I feel I left the class we a solid framework to understanding and connecting many of these topics together. ",
            "\u00a0This was a great course and I learned a lot about financial stability. ",
            "\u00a0Financial stability will blow your mind. You freaking learn how to save Icelands economy from someone who actually did! But only Iceland. You will become a technocrat ",
            "\u00a0My first seminar for Econ, so it was cool to see the base ideas applied. Learned a lot of general knowledge about how banking works and how governments decide what policies to have. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a little about how banks can maintain and erode financial stability. "

            "\u00a0Maybe open the class for more group discussions. This could include in-class group activities related to the lecture's topic. ",
            "\u00a0This course is run like lecture which I liked because it was pretty chill during class time. Students also learned a lot and there were fewer graded assignments. ",
            "\u00a0More discussion would be good. Sigga is super clear and breaks down complicated concepts ",
            "\u00a0I think it would be better to meet twice a week for shorter times. Also, the students werent very involved, so there wasnt great discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Benediktsdottir is truly impressive and incredibly knowledgeable, but it was hard for me, someone without a background in finance, to understand very much of what she taught us. She moves through topics quickly and assumes a lot of prior knowledge. The seniors majoring in Economics may have had this knowledge, but as a junior majoring in Global Affairs I did not have much of a basis for learning the more complex concepts. As a result, I got a lot less out of this course than I feel I could have. "

            "\u00a0If you are interested about more macroeconomic trends and the reasons behind the many financial turmoils that modern finance has endured, then this course is a must. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. It was a chill lecture in seminar form and some interesting topics. If you are going into financial regulation this is a great course. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Take it because the financial market is freaking complicated and youll see the hidden beauty in leverage ratios and charts. Its useful is anyways or if you just want to be inspired every Monday ",
            "\u00a0Yes!!! Sigga is the best and knows so much about financial stability. Definitely take the class with her. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! You will learn so much about global financial stability and macroprudential policies in general. Sigga is one of the best professors of Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, low time commitment, Professor is great, but definitely not an engaging class. One presentation, one paper, and a final and thats it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student who has a good understanding of how financial systems function. If you do not have a solid background in this area, I feel you will be lost much of the time during class, unless you do a lot of work outside of class to catch yourself up to speed. If you understand the concepts discussed, I'm sure it is incredibly interesting and well-taught. "
