            "\u00a0Merriman is incredible and filled each seminar with new topics and interesting perspectives. The class feels like a family by the end. If you have a chance to take this class then take it! ",
            "\u00a0I really gained an insight into human nature by studying a large case study of what happened in Vichy France. ",
            "\u00a0This course provides a fascinating look at France's collaborationist regime between 1940 and 1944. While a course nominally on the Vichy, it extends to historical memory, and contemporary controversies in confronting the past. ",
            "\u00a0In this class, you learn a lot about a particularly fascinating period in French history. You tackle moral and philosophical questions, (what does it mean to resist? To collaborate?) as well as practical ones (using our definitions, who resisted?). ",
            "\u00a0Understanding of the complexities of the experience within Vichy France. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to be critical when analyzing different accounts of history and cognizant of certain biases that may be a result of different historiographical interpretations. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a great deal about French history and World War II. It was illuminating to go into a deep dive of Vichy France and its several repercussions for France--especially in terms of society. ",
            "\u00a0How to wade through vast amounts of research material and write a very very long paper using it. Also, how to read a book effectively each week. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about the power of memory, of the brutality but also the bravery of those in war, and about narratives that have for so long been forgotten about. In other words, learned about pretty much everything in this class as we explored everyday circumstances and stories as well broader and more conceptual concepts of the second world war. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to better use Yale's archives and great library resources. I also learned how to better analyze texts and synthesis information in a way that I can discuss it later. "

            "\u00a0No ways to improve, it was incredible! ",
            "\u00a0Phenomenal course, no weak spots whatsoever. ",
            "\u00a0This course cannot be improved upon. Professor Merriman is a Yale gem and he engages such a fascinating discussion of the material every section. The biggest draw is certainly John Merriman, even as the material is fascinating as well! To get to know him personally, to hear his expert thoughts, to joke around, is really a delight and certainly one of the best things about my Yale experience. ",
            "\u00a0Merriman is great and the topic is interesting. Perhaps having suggested deadlines. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Merriman is by far the course's strength  it has been an honour to take a seminar with him. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Merriman is an unbelievable teacher, especially in a small setting. The reading list was great too. ",
            "\u00a0Its basically book club with Prof M, which is really enjoyable. The onus is definitely on you though to formulate a cogent narrative of Vichy for yourself. Prof M is not going to walk you through the chronology or make it very simple. ",
            "\u00a0Strength is clearly being able to listen to John Merriman. His stories and anecdotes are fantastic and honestly could have listened to him talk for hours. This is not how the class went though, as everyone was eager to talk and share ideas. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: You learn how to read a lot and condense it as best as you can. Since you get assigned a book a week, you learn how to prioritize your readings. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes because each seminar was amazing but there is a good deal of reading and the final paper takes a lot of work. Merriman is helpful throughout the process though. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course, but act fast, it's popular! The reading is heavy, and the paper a commitment (25-35 pages); nevertheless, the material and exposure to John Merriman is well worth it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Merriman is the man. ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely! If you have any interest in the period or have enjoyed Professor Merriman's lecture classes, this is the seminar for you! ",
            "\u00a0This is an absolutely fantastic, in-depth, and intriguing course that analyzes the events that occurred in Vichy France during Nazi occupation at a high level. I recommend this to anyone who is interested in the social and political history  of WWII. Professor Merriman is amazing, he is extremely engaging and knowledgeable and genuinely cares about what he teaches and his students. Best history and in general best course I have taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, a 100 times over. ",
            "\u00a0Its interesting to focus on the subject but would be great to have more structured discussion about course themes ",
            "\u00a0Yes but vibe it out during shopping period to see if youll enjoy talking to these people for a semester. Also know that the final paper is really challenging if youve never written something thats 25 pages of research. the class is an undertaking Bc of the final project, but week to week is really not much. Its bqsically book club. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, one of a lifetime opportunity to learn from a professor so intelligent in this small seminar setting. Even if you aren't super interested in Vichy, France, he's an amazing person to listen/talk to and such a wonderful and nice person. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I learned so much about WW2 and how dictators can take over (and how they can not!). Merriman is good at leading discussions in a way that isn't stressful but is still meaningful "
