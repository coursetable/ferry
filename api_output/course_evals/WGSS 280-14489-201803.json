            "\u00a0I learned how to engage with religion and capitalism. I think I have gathered some sense of what religion is, but I think it remains a tenuous concept. ",
            "\u00a0I take away from this class a more profound grasp of what it means to be a subject of and within the institutions that permeate my daily life. This class taught me how to be an effective interlocutor on the world around me in addition to introducing me to key intellectuals in a way that was accessible and enlightening. ",
            "\u00a0Reading, thinking, critiquing, discussing. The number of skills I developed in this class is shocking. Not only did working through dense theory-based texts help me learn to read and write better on my own, but Lucia structured the class such that I was able to break down these points into more comprehensive and understandable components. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a deep insight to the foundations of our capitalist society from a religious and sociological perspective. I also learned critical reading and writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0First and foremost, this class was a great way to refine critical analysis skills. Even with the readings that were initially hard to digest, the class did a great job of breaking down each texts fundamental elements in a way that doesnt feel patronizing at all. ",
            "\u00a0I gained new vocabulary and ways of thinking about the most important forces in the society in which we live. I got better at reading complex theory, and better understood how to write about it. ",
            "\u00a0A broad framework for how capitalism came to be and its religious ideological roots ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about what it means to think about religion, how to question the distinction in my brain between capital 'R' Religion and religion, and how particular religious traditions intersect with capitalism. Above all, though, I came away with a way better capacity to read dense, old, theoretical texts and connect them to the questions I think about on a daily basis. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to critique texts in an in-depth way and connect them to each other in order to garner new ideas. I learned how to create concept maps of ideas such as human, agency, desire, debt, and credit to explain the relations between religion and capitalism. This class illuminated things that no other class at Yale touches on- the intersection of religion and capitalism illuminates so much about both concepts in an unprecedented way. ",
            "\u00a0Expanded my critical theory toolbox! Definitely felt very comfortable working/talking through theoretical texts towards the end of the course and putting these different scholars into conversation with one another. ",
            "\u00a0I really learned how to read theory for meaning. I feel like I have the tools to parse some dense political and religious theory, to find the intervention on a larger discussion, and to critically analyze the merits of an argument, judging not only by the content but also the form of a piece and the way it situates itself in a broader discourse. I'm learning ways to write more efficiently and to think about how I can lodge critiques in different forms and through different practices. And Lucia really encouraged me to take myself and my classmates seriously as scholars and thinkers toward alternative ways of making social groupings; I feel much more confident taking a stance and trusting my own and my peers' experiences as legitimate vantages from which to intervene on religious and capitalist criticism. ",
            "\u00a0In this course, I learned how to be a better reader of both theory and cultural objects of all kinds. I learned strategies to deal with writing difficulties, and I experienced a complete overhaul of how I had thought about religion and what I had conceived of as being within and beyond the purview of religion. I learned to parse an article's argument; never has a professor so explicitly walked a class I've been in through the steps one should take to read an article. This is crucial and should be done in every class, with attention given to the discipline that one engages with. This class gave me insight into how all classes can and should be taught--with an eye for skill and knowledge sharing, creating a space for us all to grow alongside one another and grow a body of knowledge together, as opposed to spaces that fail to give students the tools to fully engage with the materials.

            "\u00a0Strengths-- well organized syllabus with interesting readings that built week to week\r\n\r\nWeaknesses-- way more reading assigned than could be discussed each week ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Amazing professor support, great classroom engagement around exciting pieces. I think the format of the class and the atmosphere that Prof. Hulsether constructed were so conducive to participation in the seminar! Her consistent and thorough feedback on improving my writing and guiding my thinking were phenomenal.\r\nWeaknesses: The readings each week centered on a certain keyword, yet, I don't think I understood how the pieces fit together until the end of the weekly discussion. I think framing the pieces a bit more (in addition to the little blurbs above each week on the syllabus) might help students come into the readings with a better mindset. I.e., I could see a 5-minute discussion setting up the texts for the following week being very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The fact that this was a small seminar was very appropriate for the types of discussions we had. The readings were enough and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0This course was incredibly strong; Lucia taught in ways that were different, engaging, and really helpful. I particularly appreciated the variety of ways we talked about the course readings, from small group discussions to concept maps. ",
            "\u00a0Did not make any real objective claims - lots of open ended qs that felt unsatisfying as someone who wanted former critique ",
            "\u00a0This course is SO GOOD. It's because Lucia is a fantastic teacher, and also because we had a great group of students who were engaged and wanted to create a great classroom dynamic. (But that is also because Lucia expertly guided the class, and made us all want to show up having done the readings and ready to genuinely discuss). ",
            "\u00a0The main strength of the course, besides its instructor, was the syllabus. The syllabus was so extremely well curated with reading spanning disciplines and topics. We read everything from Marx to Nietzsche to modern religious theory and work on the Kardashians. ",
            "\u00a0An EXCELLENT class! I think the best part of the course is how expansive it can be without losing sight of its core focus (how can we employ critiques of capitalism to critique religion?). Lucia is an absolute gem, and she definitely defined the course for methe atmosphere of the class was grounding, interrogative, thoughtful, and welcoming, and I think the environment itself made all of us better scholars and thinkers. ",
            "\u00a0The keywords are a great way of structuring the syllabus, and I loved that the beginning of the semester gave a foundation in 'canonical'/older theory and paired it with contemporary queer, feminist, and POC critiques. I received really clear, helpful feedback on all my assignments, and Lucia is super approachable (I wish I'd gone to office hours sooner and more often). Lucia also just seems to have a good sense of how to build a great seminar space there was an application for the class, and somehow she picked a group of people who were really well disposed to learn from one another. She seemed to have a sixth sense for weeding out section assholes. I'd love some clearer guidelines and tips for approaching writing assignments before we start working on them. I sometimes felt like the assignments were too short for me to do what was asked of me, but the constraint also helped me condense my writing. I would have loved a little more guidance on things like how to write a thick description; even more attention paid to the form of the arguments we read in class would be great, not just in terms of analyzing what the author is trying to say but also assessing the strengths of certain tactics as we could apply them to our own writing. And this isn't a bad thing, but just something to be aware of: the grading is super fair, but it's not inflated the way a lot of Yale courses are. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were in the Lucia's thoughtful and brilliant facilitation and guidance, the format of the syllabus (with three articles in conversation each week), the papers (short and targeted in a way that makes the goal very clear), the exam (that we'd been perfectly prepared for with the work we'd already been doing all semester, and that showed us that we could do the same work of syllabus production that Lucia so thoughtfully did for us), the articles themselves (amazing--everyone needs to read these works), the decision to focus on the religiosity of capitalism and its contestations as opposed to focusing on the way religious organizations participate in capitalism, the exercise we were challenged to do before getting into the class (encouraged us to think of ourselves as scholars of the material before the semester had even begun), etc. The strengths are pretty much endless. The only weakness, I would say, would be that sometimes the conversation moved quickly in a way that was hard for me to follow. I could have used some reformulations/rephrasing at times, but the class as a whole was pretty verbally sophisticated so it was often probably not appropriate to slow down for the sake of one person. Oh, and another strength--never in my life have I received such thorough feedback, both on papers and in person. Lucia was so accessible and really encouraged us to think of ourselves as scholars whose work could push boundaries, and she also made herself available to think through the way these course materials informed our lives outside the classroom.

            "\u00a0Yes, I think this class is especially helpful for those with some exposure to the study of capitalism ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The class is engaging, well-formatted, and truly seemed to be organized around learning how to be a good interlocutor on the systems around me. We wrestled with complex topics and difficult to understand thinkers, but the professor made it to where no challenge was too great and helped guide us to a better understanding of the material. I received the most comprehensive feedback on my work in my career as a student and the value of that feedback cannot be overstated. I truly felt like I was being invested in and encouraged and in turn, I was excited to pour myself into this work. I leave this class a better writer, better student, and better person. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This class was a phenomenal exploration of texts on capitalism, religion, queer & feminist theoryand much more! You learn to critically engage with theorists, respond eloquently in writing, and sharpen your analytical \"toolbox\" for thinking about the world.  I have a much more well-educated approach to many of the ideas of inequality, oppression, and social interaction. Be ready to think seriously about your writing; Lucia gives intensive feedback, but it's for the better! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it gave me a great set of analytical skills and was the source of really deep and meaningful discussion. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would recommend this class to another student! The class dynamic coupled with the relevant material made me look forward to each class discussion. ",
            "\u00a0I would strongly recommend this course to another student. Every class discussion and every piece of reading felt worthwhile and like I was genuinely learning and growing. Nothing felt like busywork, and I was always excited for class. Lucia gave feedback on my work that helped me develop as a writer and a thinker. ",
            "\u00a0Not really.. u can get this tea in other classes that feel more substantial ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! I don't know if it will be taught again though, because I think Lucia is leaving after this year. I have no sense of whether the class would still be good without her specific framing of all our discussions and the kind of classroom dynamic she encouraged-- but if Lucia teaches it again, TAKE IT. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. ",
            "\u00a0this course was challenging in many ways, but i looked forward to it every week because the discussions were so engaging and everyone in the class was invested ",
            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY! If you are interested, even generally, in discussing capitalism and religion through various critical lenses (particularly through the work of POC, queer, and feminist scholars), then I definitely recommend that you take this course. This class is such a wonderful growing opportunity, and you will end the semester wishing you had more time to talk with Lucia and your fellow classmates. ",
            "\u00a0TAKE THIS CLASS. TAKE IT. TAKE ANY CLASS WITH LUCIA. @SEARCH COMMITTEES, HIRE LUCIA AS FULL TIME FACULTY. This class made me think deeply and in new, exciting ways. It elevated contemporary scholarship, and the syllabus exposed me to the voices and criticism of women, queers, and scholars of color something you'd be hard pressed to find in most theology, political philosophy, or theory classes. This class is the antidote to Directed Studies. If you're here to learn from your peers and take them seriously as a community of scholars, Lucia is here to help you do that, and you should take the opportunity. You'll get the chance to work with really exciting material, sometimes really dense material. But I guarantee that you will walk away from each seminar with a deeper understanding of the readings and of the field of religious and anti-capitalist scholarship this class met at 9:25 on a Tuesday and I was excited for it each and every class meeting. How often can you say that??? I had FUN taking the final. Not because it was easy but because it was exciting to see all I'd learned and to practice the skills I got to hone. Take this class early in your Yale career because it will hone your writing and change your approach to reading scholarship. Take it before you write your thesis because it'll teach you how to take yourself seriously as a scholar. Take it before you graduate because you won't get another chance to take a class like this. Take this class. Take this class. Take this class. ",
            "\u00a0In a heartbeat. This is probably the course I am the most glad to have taken at Yale. It intervened in a lot of the unseen logics that informed the way I move through the world, and it's challenged me to keep rethinking the way I relate to time, community, and the work we're doing here at Yale and in New Haven. This is the kind of course that can change a person's life, especially if they haven't had a professor like Lucia who so seamlessly produces an environment that feels continuous with the world beyond the classroom. I also found this course really empowering--by taking our scholarship seriously, Lucia encouraged us to really value the work we were doing together as a class and the outside work that came of that collective work.
