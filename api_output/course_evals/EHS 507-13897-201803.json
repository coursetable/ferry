            "\u00a0I feel that the course would be better marketed as \"topics in environmental epidemiology\" or as a seminar. Perhaps framing it as detailed case studies of different types of environmental epidemiology methods would be more accurate. It would have been interesting to hear about more research outside of the instructor's. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very poor. The topics were not incredibly interesting, and the lecture format was not exciting. The homework assignments were given without guidance, and they were graded quite critically. ",
            "\u00a0The course was a good introduction to EHS Epidemiology topics, but is somewhat redundant for EHS students. The assignments were reasonable, but an assignment that involves statistical analysis should be prefaced by some lecture that refreshes the statistical analysis expectations. ",
            "\u00a0Not all deadlines are on syllabus. Homework 3 was too hard and out of scope for the class. She did not teach us anything from the third assignment. ",
            "\u00a0Students can utilize the knowledge in biostatistics and epi they have learned in first year to conduct their thesis work on this class, and the workload of  this class is not too heavy. ",
            "\u00a0Non-interactive. \r\nStudent involvement is almost non-existent. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: a good course to apply the epi knowledge in case studies\r\n\r\nweaknesses: could introduce more cases extensively from other research fields ",
            "\u00a0I am not sure what the learning objective of this course was. I was hoping to learn more specific epidemiological skills, with specific applications to environmental health questions- however, I do not think I learned this at all. The lectures did not seem to have clear learning goals and were primarily the professor talking about her own research (which was interesting, but was not what I thought the course was designed for). The third homework, which involved recreating a published statistical analysis using SAS, was completely a surprise considering we never did any of this in class. Additionally, we did even receive any feedback on this assignment (which many students found very challenging) until after the last day of class. Although the final project (writing a grant proposal and designing a study) was interesting, I did not think we learned much in the course that was actually relevant to this project. Overall, I think the course could be improved by having more concrete learning objectives and better aligning what is taught in lecture with the assignments. ",
            "\u00a0The topics are interesting, but the way they are presented is not. Also, it would be best to have classes recorded for students who have to occasionally miss class. ",
            "\u00a0Almost no classroom participation or student engagement. Just a two hour lecture. Homework was poorly constructed and poorly graded. Slow grading. \r\nWithin the first 20 minutes, every student in class is doing other work on their laptops. ",
            "\u00a0The course is of the type where you get out of it what you put in. You could easily cruise through the semester and pass, but not learn much. If you put in time and effort to master the homework assignments (critique and analysis of studies), and take your research proposal as far as possible, you will have a covered quite a bit of ground. The TA Huang Huang and Dr. Zhang are both very helpful and make themselves available as needed throughout the semester. For some students, the course might be too open-ended and seem to lack high-definition guidelines, but this style of teaching also encourages students to be as thorough and analytical as possible, and forces students to ask questions when things are unclear. ",
            "\u00a0I did not enjoy this class. I felt like I did not learn any epidemiology and was in a glorified journal club. Additionally, some of the hw assignment were unfair; some students had taken AAME which taught them how to do the hw and similar analyses in SAS however many of us did not take this course and were never taught how to do the assignment. There were limited office hours and help to complete the assignment and we were never taught how to do it in class even after voicing this. Afterwards, the assignment was not curved to take into account that some students were never taught how to do the analyses and struggled for many hours on our own. I think the hw is appropriate in theory if we were taught the material. Overall, I wish I was taught more concrete things. ",
            "\u00a0This course was an absolutely waste of money. I learned absolutely nothing. The instruction was utterly un-engaging and uninspiring. ",
            "\u00a0The class is focused on critically analyzing scientific data through the review of scientific studies. This was an effective method and I really appreciated the opportunity to learn more about the methods used in study design. ",
            "\u00a0The course was too focused on the instructor's research, and didn't have enough breadth. \r\n\r\nStrengths: Case studies, research papers\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Duplication of material, too focused on instructor's field of research. ",

            "\u00a0I think what I learned from this course is very useful in future research. ",
            "\u00a0The class feels like a REVIEW of intro to epidemiology. The class did not introduce any new concepts regarding epidemiology. The lectures and homework are heavily based on the projects/papers done by the instructor. She walks through them during each lecture. She occasionally brings in guest speakers. The syllabus does not specify the due date of the homework, and some other deadlines, so it's hard to keep track of the class progress. The homework are usually assigned a week before due date, and ask you to summarize the assigned paper. ",

However, her lectures primarily focused on her specific research projects and it was not clear what students should be taking away/learning from this. I think she could improve her teaching by restructuring this course and providing very specific learning goals. She should teach specific skills that could be applied to many areas of environmental epidemiology, not just her specific studies. ",
