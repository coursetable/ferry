            "\u00a0This course taught me a foundational level of conversational fluency and developed my grammar at the same time as I was acquiring large amounts of vocabulary and conversation skills through immersion. ",
            "\u00a0I further developed my abilities with Kiswahili grammar and vocabulary. I wrote essays on field trips we went on. ",
            "\u00a0Speaking, reading, writing and grammar skills. Also learnt a lot about how culture shapes the language here. ",
            "\u00a0During L4 Kiswahili, we had the opportunity to visit many places--including the Swahili coast and the Ngorongoro crater.  This part of the program was extremely enjoyable and it was wonderful to get the opportunity to engage with so many brilliant and generous Kiswahili speakers while we travelled.  I learned a bit more about the dynamism of the language, and began to see dialectical patterns between different speakers.  My writing improved tremendously as I worked through the assigned projects, and found myself in utter shock that I had written all that I had by the end of the program. "

            "\u00a0The course being in Tanzania the whole time is a huge strength, as opposed to many Yale study abroad programs that are at Yale for half the time. The immersion was the most important part. The staying with a Tanzanian host family was very important as well. One weakness is that I think we could have delved deeper into Swahili grammar during class time. ",
            "\u00a0Many of the strengths of this course comes from it being a Yale Summer Session program. In this course we had both Yale's resources as well as the cultural resources of Tanzania. ",
            "\u00a0the biggest strength is its location in Tanzania, it could be improved by reducing the touristy trips and focussing on trips where students actually learn something. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths--\r\nopportunities to move around and engage outside of our home base was wonderful.  The day we cooked with Tanzanians was an experience I will never forget...\r\nWeaknesses--\r\nthe second half of the program lost some steam after we returned from our trip to the coast.  Many students lost engagement and the structure of class was lost.  I think we should have remained in our small groups at the end of the program. "

            "\u00a0Swahili classes are my favorite classes at Yale, which is saying something. If you are interested in acquiring the language and engaging in the Swahili culture, I give it a hard recommend. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this summer session to other students. The only way to really learn a language is to live in the country where it is spoken. ",
            "\u00a0definitely recommend, its amazing to do both L3 and L4 abroad. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to any student looking to improve their Kiswahili skills quickly and effectively.  Although sometimes the pace of the program was a little slow for my liking, the improvement in speaking, reading, and writing ability simply cannot be overstated. "
