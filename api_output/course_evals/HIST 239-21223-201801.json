            "\u00a0I learned about the history of the British Empire and its effect today. ",
            "\u00a0Great survey of the history of the British empire, with a focus not just on political elements of power (in fact there may have been a lack of political/military strategy and conquest). Instead there was a focus on the gendered/intellectual/social aspect of the empire which is something I did not expect, but turned out to be a pleasant surprise. The tests are not well conceived, and prioritize memorizing dates as opposed to arguments, contexts and trends. Lectures sometimes jump around quite a lot, which may be a constraint of the subject material, but they could definitely be improved and reorgnanized. \r\n\r\nOverall really interesting and worthwhile. It would be better without tests and with papers instead, I will admit. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about Britain's Empire and more about how much of the world was influenced by Britain's colonization. ",
            "\u00a0This class covers the British Empire from 1497 to the end of the 20th century.  It's a fascinating history that anyone can take up, and allows the analysis of the persisting elements of colonization. ",
            "\u00a0Survey of the British Empire since 1763. ",
            "\u00a0a very broad but at the same time thorough survey of the history of the British empire. pretty cool seeing how many different/disparate parts of the empire were linked together. ",
            "\u00a0Learned an amazing amount about the Empire and how it affected history and lots about the parts of the empire rarely talked about as well as the greater global connections within the empire. ",
            "\u00a0This course was incredible!  I learned so much about how Britain's Empire functioned and how it was developed in the first place.  More importantly, I think this course allowed me to finally comprehend the extent to which Britain and its Empire shaped and continue to shape the modern world.  I have shifted by focus in history to British imperialism because of this course. ",
            "\u00a0This course teaches British imperial history, so I learned a lot about the British empire and the historical context for post-colonial states, particularly India. However, the actual format of the course was structured like a high school history course, so I was unable to improve my writing or analytical skills. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a lot of insight on British history and also different elements that made up the British empire. It was very interesting to learn about British history and the impact they had on the rest of the world during the time of empire. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a broad overview of Britain's empire from American independence onward through a mostly intellectual history lens. ",
            "\u00a0You read a lot of primary sources in this course, and throughout it you become very comfortable working with 18th and 19th century British writing, or primary source writing in general, which I think is a valuable skill. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a great history survey class on the British Empire. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to approach the study of history from many different perspectives. I was able to contextualize arguments, and find value by giving them a sense of place. ",
            "\u00a0Great survey course on the largest empire the world has ever known. You'll learn a ton of really interesting and important material that you may have never heard of before, and you'll get a great sense of the broad trends that affected the empire in addition to the specific, intriguing events. ",

            "\u00a0While it covers very interesting material, its topic is so large that the lectures often felt disjointed. Moreover, it was not always clear before the exams and before the essay what was expected of students. ",
            "\u00a0Get rid of the tests, and replace them with more papers. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting concepts in the class\r\nWeaknesses: lectures seemed to skip around chronologically and thematically, which made studying for the midterms and finals pretty challenging. Not always straightforward what was expected of us on midterms/finals. ",
            "\u00a0Great class. \r\nBut we did not know until really soon before the exams what would be on them / how they would be formatted. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are the TA's, the primary source readings, and the Professor. There is nothing I'd take issue with. ",
            "\u00a0I think the lectures focused too much on facts/dates/events rather than presenting a narrative or argument like many other lecturers at Yale do. Lectures could jump around a lot, too. ",
            "\u00a0lectures were pretty dense -- choice of material could have been more discerning and some things were clearly shoehorned in to fit that day's theme, or so I felt. that said the course was really comprehensive and did a good job of packing in 300-odd years of the British empire into a semester. ",
            "\u00a0Good organisation and a fair amount of reading, only complaint is that reading is variable and can be a lot some weeks ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are brilliant, each of them weaving together the stories of large movements and the actions individual great men and women.  They are fast-paced, but extremely informative and delivered beautifully.  This course could not be improved! ",
            "\u00a0The course material is fairly interesting, and Professor Semmel tries to make lectures interesting. However, the lectures often seem disconnected and jumbled. Some of the topics were fascinating, but it was hard to understand them because lecture seemed to jump around. The course was also often highly disorganized, and we did not know the format of the final until the very last day of reading period. ",
            "\u00a0The material was interesting to learn and presented me with a different historical viewpoint. The course was very much rooted in primary sources which was also interesting. ",
            "\u00a0The first section of the course could be better organized ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Interesting information and good readings, and Prof. Semmel is great.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: My TA and the organization of lectures was at times hard to follow. ",
            "\u00a0I'd say one of its strengths is definitely the thematic approach it takes to the history of the British Empire. The professor makes a point of not just teaching the subject based on military and political events, but also incorporating elements of culture and society. Most lectures began with a piece of British art, and he would part his lecture from there. He also brings up a lot of the current history debates regarding the history of the British Empire, and how newer approaches to history are bringing up more aspects of the history of empire. I'd say this is a class that, in addition to teaching history, also asks its students to think about how history is studied and interpreted. \r\nOne of the weaknesses of this course is definitely how broad it tries to be. The lecture is trying to cover everything about the British empire and consequently fails to go in depth into anything. After taking it, I feel like I have a general and vague sense of what was happening in India, Australia, the Caribbean, South Africa, and England, but do not feel confident talking about any of those in detail. ",
            "\u00a0The course worked a lot with primary source material which helped in developing an understanding of the period. Certain lectures seemed less relevant to the overall course but in general it was a good class. ",
            "\u00a0I think a strength of the course is the material it covers, which is pertinent across large swathes of history. I think a weakness of this course was the amount of guidance provided on writing the paper. Students were largely let off on their own without many resources or support. ",
            "\u00a0This course teaches a lot of really important and too often overlooked material, so the content of the class is amazing. Also, I loved Professor Semmel's lecture style, and his personal enthusiasm for the material was what originally drew me into the course. There is, of course, some room for improvement. Many of the readings seemed unnecessary and impertinent (for instance, the Porter debate readings and many of the Metcalf readings), and that made lecture less interesting and productive. Also, probably more importantly, lectures should really be organized more clearly. As I said, I think Professor Semmel is a very engaging presenter, but the content is not organized clearly; lecture will constantly jump between territories, time periods, and themes, so this is something that can be worked on. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the class was a bit disorganized and the fact that the syllabus changed so many times was a bit confusing. ",
            "\u00a0Material was sometimes difficult to follow and that made studying difficult. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student if he or she is interested in British imperial history. He or she should be aware that the course covers a lot of material and it is not always clear how the subjects come together until later. ",
            "\u00a0Depends. It's good information but the assessment structure means it isn't worth it. Definitely credit/d it, but studying for tests and the focus on dates is abysmal and very tiring and unengaging. ",
            "\u00a0Somewhat. I enjoyed the class, but it's almost too broad of a topic to be in one class. The amount of content that you need to know is a bit overwhelming, especially if you aren't used to taking history classes. While a lot of the class is interesting, you're kind of expected to know everything for the midterm and final. I liked Professor Semmel but the class is definitely dry at times. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes the class is great. Certainly for students of all course backgrounds. The source material for the term essay is provided and the material is new and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested in a survey of the British empire, take the class. It touches on almost every corner of the world, and is a fundamental aspect of modern history. That being said, know that the lectures are very fact-heavy and the course gets \"bogged down in the details\". ",
            "\u00a0This is a wonderful course. A very thorough picture of the British empire is provided, with a very reasonable reading load that both is not a strain and also is comprehensive enough to leave an impression. The lectures are very interesting, and it's a good course for both people who are and aren't History majors. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This is a very thorough survey of the history of the British empire  so although lectures can be pretty dense and Stuart isn't exactly the most engaging you still come out knowing a ton about Britain and her empire. It's also pretty cool seeing all the linkages and relationships between parts of the empire, as well as the legacies of the empire today. Workload isn't much, midterm+paper+final and section participation, but you need to do the readings and will be responsible for them on the exams, so take good notes. Overall a fine lecture, and this is coming from a STEM major who was really only taking this class for the distribution credit. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course as it really is such an insightful course that really gets you thinking about a period of history and places which at least in America isnt covered that well ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely.  This is a must-take course for anyone interested at all in understanding the modern world!  Plus, Professor Semmel's lectures are so incredibly thoughtful and the assigned readings are great.  Favorite History course that I have taken at Yale so far. ",
            "\u00a0No. The topic is interesting, but the presentation of information is subpar and this classs section was the most unpleasant experience I have had at Yale. There are many other history courses at Yale that push you more and help you learn much better. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because it is an interesting course on Britain's empire and the worldwide effects it had. ",
            "\u00a0Don't take this class if you don't have an interest in British intellectual history. I struggled to stay engaged at times and it moves quickly. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. It's a nice survey of the British Empire, and the professor's more thematic and cultural approach makes it different from most military and politics based classes. Professor Semmel is a very good lecturer, and he structures his lectures in ways that are easy to keep up with, and also very interesting. He always began lecture with an element of 18th or 19th century British culture, whether that was art, a postcard, a poem, and parts from there. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was a good survey history class with interesting material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are interested in the material I think it would be a good history class to delve into because it allows for a broader perspective and larger overview. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Britain's Empire explores a wide range of super interesting and often overlooked topics, and it does so in a very engaging way. While lecture may not always be the most organized and readings are sometimes impertinent, the course overall is excellent, and I would highly recommend it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, pretty standard but good history class. "
