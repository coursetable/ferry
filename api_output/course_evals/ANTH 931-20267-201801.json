            "\u00a0I appreciated getting to know what other students are working on. The wide range of projects fed my own imagination. It's also always helpful to see someone else struggling with a prospectus, or a grant application, or other written means of communicating their ideas. But the most beneficial aspect of the working group to me was establishing, if only for myself, what I believe constitutes the parameters of scholarly inquiry. Kate Dudley is very good at prying open the aperture of what constitutes the scholarly canon, supporting creativity, and reinforcing the human, humane, compassionate and political ethics of researching human subjects.

            "\u00a0The strength of the course is the conversation between fellow researchers and the invaluable feedback one receives about one's work, from a room full of brilliant thinkers. That kind of sustained attention and feedback is so rare, it's a gift in developing any intellectual project. \r\n\r\nNot a weakness per se, but the regular rhythm of the meeting times, every other Thursday, started to get off-rhythm in the spring, which made the group feel less coherent, somehow. Attendance became less predictable. Like any good ritual, it's helpful to return to a space, or a practice, in a predictable way. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend the course for anyone using ethnography or oral history methods: the working group offers a space for interrogation and reflection that will help you press your own research further. ",
