            "\u00a0Taught me a lot about inorganic chemistry. If it wasn't for this class I wouldn't have learned anything from the accompanying lecture. Also learned how to use a Tanabe-Sugano diagram. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a fair bit about some of the basic techniques and software used to examine simple inorganic compounds, such as X-ray diffraction, IR, NMR, UV-Vis, and simple computational software.  I also learned the outline of ACS(American Chem Society) papers, and how to write in that style. I also learned how to use certain scientific paper writing software, such as EndNote(I know that's general software), Scifinder, Web of Science, etc... ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to use spectroscopic techniques like UV Vis, IR, NMR, and X-ray Crystallography to analyze organometallic compounds, as well as synthetic methods to produce compounds that proved informative in teaching and emphasizing key concepts in inorganic chemistry. I also learned how to write reports in ACS style and to structure such reports in a manner that makes them easiest to read for the average reader in the field of chemistry. ",
            "\u00a0I developed knowledge of common synthetic and analytical techniques used in inorganic chemistry labs by taking this course. I developed skills of power X-ray diffraction, Schlenk technique, IR analysis, UV-Vis analysis, and reaction progress kinetic analysis by proton NMR by taking this course. I also learned various techniques for manipulating chemical and physical equilibria to obtain a product, such as by evaporating solvent to decrease the product's solubility. I also developed scientific writing skills: being concise, professional, and unequivocal. This course also teaches several concepts that should be covered in Chem 252 but which are not: crystal field theory, ligand field theory, and gerade vs. ungerade states. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about different applications of Inorganic chemistry in the lab setting, which applied very well to the material learned in lecture. I reaffirmed my knowledge about safe and efficient lab techniques, and spent most time dedicated to this class constructing lab reports that I was proud to pass in. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about different types of inorganic synthesis.  In addition, this course is great for learning how to write official lab reports in the form of the ACS style. ",
            "\u00a0General chemistry techniques, using various analytical techniques including NMR, IR and UV spectroscopy, using special equipment including a rotary evaporator. Writing a paper using the ACS format and really focusing on properly producing a succinct and well formatted paper. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about experimental techniques/strategies in inorganic chemistry. Reinforced my understanding of inorganic chemistry concepts. ",
            "\u00a0I learned many good lab techniques and how to put together and ACS-style lab report. ",
            "\u00a0Advanced Lab skills and report writing ",
            "\u00a0I gained much insight about inorganic chemistry that I found to be extremely helpful in chem252 as well. They need to be taken simultaneously to get the most out of them. ",

            "\u00a0Strength is the instructor, Dr. Parr is an excellent instructor who really cares about each of his students. And because he cares he chooses experiments which are interesting, and makes the class a fun learning experience. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: 1. PARR. Honestly one of the best teachers... no, humans... I've met at Yale. He knows how to always make anything a teaching moment, is always positive yet provides solid criticism, and knows a lot about many varieties of chemistry and about the life cycle of a scientist. If you haven't been able to take a course with him, do so. \r\n2. This is honestly about the most optimal WR credit I could have asked for as a scientist. \r\n3. Lab reports aren't nearly as long as PCHEM Lab and every section is important. Moreover, you can customize them slightly to put emphasis and organize it how you want. \r\n4. There are variety of ways we interact with inorganic chemistry, from catalysis to synthesis and characterization\r\n5. Parr's Friday lectures are chill and help A LOT with outlining the paper.\r\nWeakness: 1. There is a lot of different software and techniques you use, so one of them is bound to fail on your computer for some reason and will send you into hysterics trying to figure it out because you NEED that info for the report and are stuck. 2. This is a trivial issue, but a lot of writing of real ACS papers often includes significant background and significance. It can be hard to write in a style when your experiment failed and there is no real significant reason to be run besides that you have to. ",
            "\u00a0Incredibly strong class as is, and Professor Parr is its strongest attribute. Super chill but you also learn a lot throughout. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: This course teaches multiple synthetic and analytical techniques used in inorganic research. Each lab has a unique set of techniques it aims to introduce; there is no unnecessary repetition of similar labs as there is in the organic lab courses. The course also teaches how to write scientifically. The course also teaches the core principles of inorganic chemistry that should be taught in the Chem 252 lecture but which are not: crystal field theory and ligand field theory. This course is like 2 for the time commitment of 1.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This course has no weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Parr is so helpful and interested in the success of his students. He is always informative in office hours and wants students to understand as best as possible. The lectures support the info necessary for lab and lab report success. The writing credit option is also helpful for Chem students who may not have time to take other classes. I really enjoyed this class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Multi-week experiments give students time to fully understand reactions and bring up questions\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: N/A ",
            "\u00a0Parr is with you all the way. He is an incredible instructor and is always willing to help. This course benefits from being extremely interesting and applicable and you dont do too much. ",
            "\u00a0This course is not that hard and not always engaging. ",
            "\u00a0More model reports at the beginning of the semester would be great! ",
            "\u00a0I think everything about it was perfectly run. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great class that teaches the fundamentals of scientific writing above all else. No complaints. "

            "\u00a0If you haven't taken a class with Dr. Parr, you need to. Also the material is pretty interesting, and will make the dry drivel Crabtree is trying to teach you much more interesting. ",
            "\u00a01000000% for CHEM majors as your lab credit. If you have any interest in inorganic chemistry or catalysis as a research focus, this course is a must take for more reasons than just the name of the course. \r\n\r\nHell, I'd even recommend this to off-CHEM majors as Parr explains most of the principles, so the course is very self contained. ",
            "\u00a0Take it! Whether you're a chem major or not this is a fantastic course to learn about scientific writing and to get to know Professor Parr, who is wonderful ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student. All of the labs are interesting. The workload is manageable: four lab reports, each due one week after the associated lab work is done, and four experimental plans. This course teaches students to write scientifically, so the reports are to be written in a concise manner with no flowery or repetitive language; this makes the writing process straightforward and fast. I would also recommend taking this course for the WR credit. It involves a few short assignments and a final paper, none of which affect your actual grade. Considering how much faster it is to writing scientifically than to write a humanities essay, you would have to be crazy to take this course and not take the WR credit if you do not already have two WR credits. Also, if you take Chem 252 concurrently as most students do, this course will teach you the key concepts of inorganic chemistry that should be covered in 252 but are not. So this course does double duty. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I loved this class and Dr. Parr is so great. Would definitely recommend this class to any chem majors, and I would recommend taking it while you are taking lecture as the principles learned and investigated in lab make understanding the class material much easier. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is a very interesting class for those interested in inorganic chemistry.  You learn more in this class than you do in chem252 (intro inorganic chemistry). ",
            "\u00a0Yes. A great chemistry course. Not too much work, but definitely enough. There is help when you need it, and you learn quite a lot that doesnt just have to do with inorganic chemistry. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Inorganic chemistry lab is a very fun and very chill class - the class is basically all chemistry majors which helped me to get to know the other chemistry majors better too. Parr is extraordinarily helpful and very chill (yes very very chill) - though you have to make the effort to ask for help and he will roast you if you're being dangerous in lab. The labs themselves are enjoyable and The Friday lectures are pretty interesting and tell you what you need to know to write the lab reports - though sometimes I feel asleep during the Friday lectures. The main downside is the lab reports take LONG time to do well - both the data analysis and the writing. Especially the writing since in pchem lab you can just spew out word more or less in inorganic lab (since i took it WR), you will want to try to write a bit more carefully - Parr gives useful feedback for this.\r\n\r\nHowever, the guidelines/rubric for most of the assignments are kind of non-existent. It would have been much more helpful if there was some kind of handout for each lab detailing what should be included in the lab report. This made writing the lab reports much more stressful. Also would have been nice if all the assignments and their due dates were uploaded onto canvas earlier (like at the beginning of the semester?) instead of a few days before the assignment was due. For example, the link to submit the EP for one of the labs wasn't published until the day of the lab. We also didn't get any feedback on the EPs but should be ok??? ",
            "\u00a0Its a fine lab credit, if you need it. ",
            "\u00a0Parr is fantastic! Take this as your advanced lab chemistry majors! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this was a super fun course with a great instructor. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, Prof. Parr is a great teacher and the class is fun. You learn a lot. ",
            "\u00a0yes! its a really fun and chill lab ",
            "\u00a0If you are looking for a chem lab course this is a good option. The labs are interesting and Dr Parr is a good instructor. There are only 4 lab reports, which is not too bad, and he is good about helping you know what makes a successful report. If you need a WR the credit comes with with only one major additional paper, but you should start it early because it requires a lot of research and planning time. "
