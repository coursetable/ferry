            "\u00a0This course is divided into weekly modules that focus on different types of viruses. Some modules were much stronger/engaging than other ones, mainly because they moved at a slower a pace and covered more background (e.g. history, clinical significance, epidemiology). A few (very few) modules jumped right into the molecular mechanisms making it extremely dry and hard to focus.\r\n\r\nOverall, this was a very well coordinated course and I gained a much greater appreciation for the field virology! ",
            "\u00a0I really liked how there was a survey of a wide range of topics and most of the lectures were interactive. ",
            "\u00a0It was great that all the notes were made available on Canvas ",
            "\u00a0Class was very good at giving a general overview of virology. It was very good to have the adjacent lectures on things like modeling and the immune system. The course could be further improved by the addition of primary literature based elements. Even a short (1hr/1paper) discussion of either a historical or modern virology paper would improve the relevance and usefulness of this class. "

            "\u00a0Yes. It is an excellent survey course and the way exams are structured encourages learning the topics you are most interested in very deeply. Also, a good way to interact with some cool researchers. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is a great introduction to virology basics ",
