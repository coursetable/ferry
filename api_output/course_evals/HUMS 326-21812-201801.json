            "\u00a0Close reading of important political texts by an important thinker. ",
            "\u00a0Having read almost all of Rousseau's work in this course, I was able to relate all of his ideas cohesively and critically. it also helped with reading modern philosophical critics, such as those from Strauss and Berlin. "

        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: I really like the structure of the course; an incredible amount can be learned by delving deeply into the work of a single thinker over some time rather than skimming through some important ideas over the course of centuries as in a survey course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think this course could have benefitted from meeting twice a week for 75 minutes rather than once for 110 minutes. The weekly discussions could feel really long with nearly 2 hours, and I think students would be more able to stay continuously engaged if the length were slightly shorter. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: we get to read all of his works, especially bigger ones like Emile. "

            "\u00a0Any serious student of political theory should take a course dedicated to Rousseau. After taking this course, it is clear to me that almost every great political theorist since Rousseau -- Burke, Tocqueville, Marx, Kant, Hegel -- has been profoundly influenced by the diverse, complex, and often self-contradictory work of Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Whether you're interested in reading Rousseau's treatises, his correspondence with Voltaire, his educational program, or even his opera, this class will engage and excite you. Definitely recommend ",
            "\u00a0A good class with a nice professor, but beware: Rousseau is not a thinker that one can simply understand by skimming texts or Wikipedia. Rousseau is hard to read dude! You need to put in the work to truly reap the benefits of engaging with such an influential thinker, and that means reading texts SLOWLY and CLOSELY (ideally twice or more). Skimming just won't do, particularly with an author like Rousseau who will seem completely contradictory and paradoxical to you at first glance until you have spent some GOOD time wrestling with the ideas he puts forth. If you are committed and remain true to that commitment, though, reading Rousseau could really change the way you think about things and the way you want to live your life. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The readings are great and Professor Steven Smith is helpful and engaging. "
