            "\u00a0Close critical analysis of landscape; situation of artists and art in historical and theoretical context ",
            "\u00a0I engaged with transatlantic themes and learned how to visually analyze works of art in this interesting and evolving cultural context. ",
            "\u00a0How to look at Paintings ",
            "\u00a0I learned about some of the inspirations, motivations, and history behind landscape painting in Britain and in America in the late 18th and first half of the 19th century.  I improved my visual analysis skills and had the opportunity to work on a lengthy research project with more stringent requirements than I have had to fulfill in art history classes in the past.  The project, in particular, was very exciting because we were given so much time to delve into the topic. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me a much deeper understanding of the American traditions around land art.  It complicated the histories of the majestic landscape paintings and taught us about native American conceptions of land as well.  We learned about landscape paintings' origins in England and how those were translated globally with the progression of the British empire.  I learned new ways of thinking about land as a site for movement and exile. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: Excellent field trips to West campus, Met, and Hudson Valley; excellent use and integration of objects from YCBA and YUAG; excellent instructors who facilitate robust discussion  \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none really ",
            "\u00a0The selections of artistic works and readings were well-paired and informative, and each lesson did an excellent job of building off the work of the last week's material. Both professors worked well together, and each class was engaging and enlightening in the best way. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:  The professors are both brilliant people and amazing teachers.  I loved how much the course made use of the collections here at Yale as well as in the area through its two field trips to the Met and to Olana and the Thomas Cole house.  These trips to places both near and far really added texture and richness to the readings and the concepts we discussed in class.  The other students in the class were also extraordinarily committed and thoughtful, and it was both intimidating and inspiring to hear everyone's insights in class each week.  Professors Raab and Barringer were wonderful at facilitating the conversation.\r\nWeaknesses:  The course is pretty narrowly focused, probably because it's centered around the two amazing exhibitions at the Met and at the Cole historical site.  Still, the readings offered a tantalizing glimpse into the various dimensions of landscape during the nineteenth century, and I wish we got to delve further into some of those directions.  Some examples:  the influence of/differences from Chinese landscape painting (particularly given the rising interest in chinoiserie), the role of theater and set design, photography (development of and use of), the role of historical conflicts (settler-colonialism (which we did cover), but also the many wars of the period (which we didn't) -- the War of 1812, the Seven Years' War, the Napoleonic Wars, the Opium Wars, etc.). ",
            "\u00a0Course was wonderful.  Strong syllabus with interesting themes, artworks, readings, and field trips.  I don't think I'd change a thing. "

            "\u00a0Yes. This is a wonderful chance to learn from excellent professors and make full use of Yale's collections. The topic is also significant because we all engage with the medium of landscape in one form or another: think iPhone panoramas. As a non-major, I found it helpful because it developed my toolkit for visual analysis. ",
            "\u00a0This is an absolutely wonderful course! The two professors specialize in the material, and listening to them lecture is a joy. Everyone who took it was brilliant and had something to bring to the table. I loved discussion as much as I loved hearing the professors lecture. I took it CR/D since I'd never taken an upper-level HSAR course before and so I could fully enjoy it--if you're not a HSAR major that might be the way to go as I still worked pretty hard on both papers. I'm not particularly attached to landscapes as a concept, and I'm still not, but I feel that I have a much better grasp of how to look at them and how to look at art in general. ",
            "\u00a0This class is wonderful! You get to engage with a pivotal period of art history from a multitude of angles, and the field trips to various locations around Yale and beyond are informative and enlightening. I truly enjoyed class discussions and feel much more knowledgeable when speaking on the artistic themes covered in the course. ",
            "\u00a0yes! landscapes can be interesting, and the field trips were great ",
            "\u00a0I'm not sure if this class would ever be offered again, or at least ever offered again in the same form, considering that its organizational impetus was two exhibitions (one of which has since closed) at the Met and at the Thomas Cole historical site.  That said, I highly recommend both Professors Barringer and Raab, whether they're teaching together or separately.  They're both brilliant, and they're actually good at (and not merely capable of) facilitating discussion, which made every class period an exciting and genuinely fun experience as well as information-packed.  The readings were fascinating and covered quite a range (though as mentioned in an earlier answer, we didn't always get to do justice to the entirety of that range -- my one complaint).  Finally, I loved the emphasis that the course structure placed on completing a research project with primary sources.  In a nutshell:  the class was wonderful, and it was all the more wonderful because of the people who were teaching it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!!! Professors Raab and Barringer are a power team.  This course was fascinating, the art was incredible, and the readings and discussions together challenged us to see land and its representations in more complex and accurate ways. "
