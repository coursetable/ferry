            "\u00a0So much amazing learning about different ways to look at music and resistance, separately and together. ",
            "\u00a0I gained knowledge about the history of music and resistance in the United States for much of the 20th century. I learned about various musical theories such as the aural border, musicking, and Audiotopia, and I got to listen to so many contemporary and classical artists who have influenced the musical and political landscapes today. I learned about the useful lenses through which we can view different forms of musical resistance, and how different artists have directly (or indirectly) influenced the musical/political landscapes of the 20th and 21st century. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to critically think about music and its subversive potential. The course engaged in close listening and also introduced theory and concepts to inform what we were listening to. It was helpful not just in terms of music, but in many other cultural formsI find myself applying what we learned in this class to other media. ",
            "\u00a0It made me think about music in a way I never have! Lots of theoretical thinking as well as looser thoughts and feelings and deep listening. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about music studies and cultural analysis in general, and feel like I am better equipped to notice and think about small details of texts. "

        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: Every listening was enjoyable. Every week had a clear theme and Lucy had clear questions to guide each week's discussion. The weekly blog post was useful for consolidating our thoughts for each week's readings. You can opt to create a form of musical resistance as a final project instead of writing a final paper.\r\nWeaknesses: Readings can be tedious at times, and some of the theoretical concepts are hard to comprehend. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this was a terrific class. Its structure of a weekly listening response was helpful and productive. Discussions, despite being mostly dominated by students, nonetheless stayed on track and felt like they had a purpose, which I think is really hard to do! ",
            "\u00a0I didn't come out feeling super solid about having learned any specific things. ",
            "\u00a0I like the way the course was set up, and most of the readings were fantastic. I also really liked the blog posts-- that helped me organize my thoughts and see others' thoughts. Discussion was usually great, but there were several times where I felt like we had reached a level of abstraction that was neither interesting nor helpful. "

            "\u00a0yes! ",
            "\u00a0I would. It's especially interesting if you're someone who doesn't have a music background. You learn much about the permutations of music throughout different geographical, temporal, and communal contexts. You also learn how to write about music, both from an academic standpoint, but also from a more general standpoint of cultural critique. You can take the class as a means of exploring a medium in a grounded way and not be too overwhelmed with the content. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would! If you are interested in music, music history, and how music has intersected politics, this is the perfect course for you. Lucy is such an incredible professor, and the course materials were so engaging. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend to any student who likes thinking about and listening to music. It's a great way to revisit stuff you love and expose yourself to new music, all under a framework that many may not use when approaching music. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! I truly enjoyed the work so much! ",
            "\u00a0Yes-- either if you want to learn specifically about music or if you just want to think about deep questions of politics and culture. "
