            "\u00a0I learned about German fairytales and interpretations of them. I found it super interesting to read the more obscure Grimm tales that I'd never even heard of before I took the class. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my German writing/speaking/reading/listening and also learned a lot about German fairy tales. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about fairy tales, read a lot in German, reviewed a little bit of grammar ",
            "\u00a0We developed our grammatical skills in German and got to practice complex grammatical forms. We had the chance to practice both academic and creative writing in German, and learn the grammar and format conventions of both. We learn about the content, conventions and cultural relevance of German fairy tales through history. ",
            "\u00a0German ",
            "\u00a0In taking this course, you learn about the cultural background of German fairy tales and the prevalent themes expressed in many of the works. In the duration of this course, you read many fairy tales and scholarly secondary sources, so you significantly improve your reading ability. In addition, the class is held in German and weekly assignments necessitate that you practice your speaking abilities as well. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: This is the best-structured course I've taken at Yale in terms of workload. The assignments were spread out and very manageable. I enjoyed doing the creative tasks and I really appreciated that they made up most of the grade, which made the course feel a lot less high-pressure than classes that just have a handful of exams or papers. The course's content is also just a lot of fun to read and discuss. Weaknesses: I think this aspect really improved during the second half of the course, but the secondary texts were kind of dense and hard to comprehend (maybe because this was my first L5 class), so I often had trouble figuring out what they were saying or what was important. However, the annotated readings really helped with that. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Very interesting readings, conversations, activities, assignments, etc. Theresa is very helpful and wants to make sure everyone improves. Assignments are appropriate in getting us to improve our German while also being flexible/catering to the different German abilities of students in the class. Good feedback on assignments. Class time is also spent on a variety of activities which keeps it interesting. I also learned a lot more than I expected about fairy tales! ",
            "\u00a0I think a major strength of this course were the grammatical exercises that we did in class. They were probably the most helpful and valuable component of this class for me. My biggest recommendation would be to have more such exercises incorporated into the course regularly. Of course, the level should be appropriate for an L5 course; it would be helpful to have exercises for complex grammatical structures. Other than that, the content of the course is very well selected and highly interesting. Clearly a lot of thought has gone into designing this course and it has turned out very well. ",
            "\u00a0Perfect ",
            "\u00a0The course was very well-organized and clearly laid out what topics would be covered in each week. The fairy-tales were chosen well to fit the theme covered in the given week, and the secondary sources complemented the fairy tales well. One weakness of the course is that it didn't hold students accountable to learn as much as previous German courses. With the addition of random or scheduled vocabulary quizzes every so often from a given set of important words from the fairy tales or secondary sources, it could motivate the students more to remember the vocabulary for a longer time.

            "\u00a0Yes! This was a really fun humanities credit for me and I would totally recommend it. Actually, just take everything Theresa teaches; she's fantastic. ",

            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this to a starting-level L5 student- someone who is looking not just to study a topic in depth in German but also to develop German language long-form writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to a German student who has reached the L5 level. The secondary sources that you read are challenging enough to improve your German, and the fairy tales are fun and interesting to read. It is a good class, and you learn the German language and more about German culture. "
