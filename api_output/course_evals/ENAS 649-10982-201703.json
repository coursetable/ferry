He uses that knowledge to present each model with great clarity.\r\n\r\nA weakness of the course, for me, however, was that I often found problem sets and test questions to be more difficult than those we did in class. Part of this was, no doubt, due to not having Prof Kaplan around to explain them for me. One approach that might help would be to have students spend a few minutes attempting to set up models themselves in class before Prof Kaplan's explanation. This might help us develop the right instincts when faced with a new problem without an expert guide. "
