            "\u00a0This was my first economics course, so I learned how to think through the lens of an economist for the first time ",

        [
            "\u00a0A strength of this course was the small size that allowed for a lot participation. A few weaknesses were that it moves very quickly for an introduction and the material is infrequently tested, only on one midterm and a final. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked all the practice problems we did together in class, and got the chance to do on the black board. I really appreciated that the slides were posted on blackboard, as were the problem set solutions, and the Piazza site we had access to at the end of the year. I also think the tests were quite fair. Sometimes the problem sets gave me difficulty, and on rare instances, I felt as though some problem set questions were at a much higher difficulty than what was taught in lecture. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to someone who knows that they like economics already. For someone who just wants to explore econ for the first time I definitely would not. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I really would. The professor makes the class very engaging and interesting, and the material is quite relevant to everyday life. I find myself applying things I learned in class in many scenarios outside the classroom. "
