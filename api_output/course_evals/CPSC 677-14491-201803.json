            "\u00a0While I learned a bit more in-detail about selected topics in NLP from the class presentations, the vast majority of what I learned was from the topics I chose for my presentation, replication, and final project. These spanned spectral learning, graph convolutional networks, and word sense embeddings. ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge: Student-selected research topics in NLP. Word embeddings and text representations (doc, sentence embeddings; topic and language models); related probability and math, graph and linalg techniques; supervised and unsupervised learning with applications in MT, retrieval, common sense, question answering, sentiment analysis, etc. Lots of prior knowledge is assumed.\r\nSkills: Giving a presentation, reading/skimming papers, background and novel research + paper replication.\r\nInsights: Unsupervised language modeling with high data efficiency is crucial to so many techniques, for instance sentiment analysis in which a single neural cell codes for sentiment. There is a lot of \"engineering\" being done to get shit to perform well, but some of the theory and tricks toward greater data efficiency, etc., are interesting. Non-neural methods such as spectral methods are interesting. ",

            "\u00a0This course was great - it is absolutely astonishing to see how much you can learn in just one semester. I loved that the classes were driven by students and their interests. I really learned a lot from taking this course. ",
            "\u00a0The presentations and bibliographies are very useful for getting an overview of a topic. I think that spreading the final project over a longer timetable with periodic updates would have been helpful to stay on track. ",
            "\u00a0I felt very lucky to be able to take this class. It was pretty exciting to read papers that had first been published this year-- sometimes only weeks before we read them -- and some of the research we learned about was totally mind-blowing. The format of student presentations predictably meant there was a lot of variation in the lecture quality. For some topics, I felt that even after reading the paper and listening to the lecture I had no idea what was going on (sometimes I was missing important background, or there just too much math to cover in an hour). I definitely didn't become an expert in anything but it was nice to get the exposure. ",

            "\u00a0Strength - great coverage of topics , instructors deep involvement ",
            "\u00a0The course is well-organized, and the opportunity to do a paper replication, final project, and presentation lets you really get into topics deeply, which I liked. It also is a very good introduction to NLP research, and is very paper-focused. But, it's hard to get a lot out of some of the student presentations. With or without the required paper, students are not as good at explaining as professors, and it's difficult to convey all the nuances of a topic in one lecture: because of the requirement to include research papers, they were often high-level but had to leave details/intuitions about the fundamental methodology out. Despite a lot of student effort and preparation, lectures were just by nature not often as intellectually stimulating, coherent, or effective as in other classes. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Some EXCELLENT student presentations. Really.\r\nWeaknesses: Some not-so-excellent student presentations. Easy to go off on your own on all projects and let deadlines creep up on you. Gotta stay disciplined; good news is it preps you for real research. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:  Covers a lot of material.  The material was very interesting.  Drago provides a lot of support for creating lectures, making sure that lectures always are at a baseline of usefulness.\r\nWeaknesses:  Because almost all of the lectures were taught by different students, presentation quality would vary widely.  Additionally, different students would have different assumptions as to what was \"common knowledge\" was, leading to some lectures being way above some student's prerequisite knowledge. "

Week to week the workload is extremely light, and Drago is a very flexible and easygoing teacher. Having said that, you won't gain as many hard skills as you might in another classit's more about getting exposure. It also helps if you're a self-starter / independent ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It's a good class to learn about the field ",

            "\u00a0If you're interested in ML research, this course is a good opportunity to see what's cutting edge and get a feel for what papers in NLP look like, what the current research is, etc. It's not a lot of work most of the time, and lectures are not extremely fulfilling, but the projects are time intensive, and it's possible to really get a good understanding of an interesting topic out of them. Because you can choose your own topics for the assignments, it's possible to tailor your experience to your own interests. ",
