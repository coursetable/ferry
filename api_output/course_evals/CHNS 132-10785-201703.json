            "\u00a0My written Chinese improved drastically, as well as my conversational skill. I can now use many more grammar patterns, and I've gained a great deal of confidence in my Chinese ability. ",
            "\u00a0Improved writing, reading, and speaking of Chinese through daily quizzes, oral presentations, and readings. The class was very organized and structured. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about how to write Chinese characters and read basic paragraphs. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read and write Han Chinese characters and improved my pinyin skills. Before the class, I was unable to read or write Chinese at all besides my name and a few basic characters, so there was a very steep learning curve for me and I ended up having a much more expansive knowledge of Chinese than I did previously. I also improved my grammar and pronunciation. ",
            "\u00a0I relearned how to read and write in Chinese. I strengthened my speaking skills as well as developed more insight about the differences between Chinese and American cultures. I can now more easily hold a conversation in Chinese. ",
            "\u00a0I not only increased my level of Chinese, but learned valuable time management lessons as well. I also learned that engagement and participation are essential to doing well in the class. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to improve my phrasing and my vocabulary when writing and reading. "

            "\u00a0The straightforward nature of the course made learning a lot easier. The class discussions were directly related to the material, and on any given day, we knew what to expect (dictation, discussion, grammar drills, etc.) We went one-by-one through every grammatical structure in each lesson, and the teaching was quite systematic.\r\n\r\nThe class, however, was a bit too fast-paced. We often rushed through grammar without the class truly understanding the usage, and by the end of the semester, I had forgotten a good deal of the words from the first lessons. Many grammar points I only figured out after class in office hours or with classmates in study sessions. ",
            "\u00a0The class was very structured and organized. Every homework assignment and class activities were designed to help us improve our understanding of the Chinese language. The professors also dedicated their time to read over our assignments and give us constructive feedbacks. ",
            "\u00a0It is enjoyable to learn during class, and I liked how the day-to-day lesson outlines were consistent. ",
            "\u00a0I believe this class had only strengths. I really enjoyed my section because it was only 10 students, so it was a very interpersonal setting and it felt as though we were really being drilled on the content of the class. ",
            "\u00a0I think the structure of this course is strong. At the beginning of the course, we learned very basic Chinese and the work did not seem overwhelming at all. We gradually began learning more complicated words and grammar patterns, and by the end of the semester, I was learning completely new material rather than refreshing knowledge I once had in Chinese school. However there were many things we learned in class that were easy to forget because after discussing them once, we never talked about them again. ",
            "\u00a0Not all students begun the class at the same level of Chinese, and the teachers acknowledged that, so they had unique evaluations of each student as opposed to a general rubric. The teachers were readily available to help, or at least set an appointment with a TA. Very well structured class.\r\n\r\nI have no criticisms of the class. ",
            "\u00a0I liked how comfortable the environment was and how the course was specifically designed with students like me in mind. I wish it was slightly more accelerated and that we had more exposure to other forms of media, like film or audio. "

            "\u00a0YES! I would highly recommend this class to any heritage speaker. My speaking and writing skills improved dramatically over the semester, and the professors truly want you to succeed. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely would recommend. My Chinese level was very poor from the start, but improved drastically at the end. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because it definitely helped improve my overall Chinese skills. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student because the teachers are wonderful and your language abilities really do improve as long as you personally put in the effort to learn and do the homework and study. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you grew up in a Chinese-speaking household, this class really helps you develop your reading, writing, and speaking skills quickly. We learned a lot this semester and my parents are amazed by how much more Chinese I know each time I call them. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course, especially with the current instructors. ",
            "\u00a0Yes it was very beneficial for students of my skill level. "
