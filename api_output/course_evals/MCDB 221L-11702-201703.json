            "\u00a0If you have to take a bio lab this is definitely the one to take. It offered a comprehensive understanding of everything that goes on in a bio lab and I came away with so many skills that I hadn't been exposed to before (PCR, pipetting, ELISA, etc.). ",
            "\u00a0I gained skill in working with a variety of model organisms, such as bacteria, zebrafish, fruit flies, and more. The procedures included in the labs were very practical, and the step-by-step guidance for lab reports greatly enhanced my scientific writing skills and ability to create effective figures to represent data. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about multiple model organisms used in biology research, and the different experiments that these organisms may be used for in fields such as genetics developmental biology. I also learned how to write a science paper presenting our findings, and how to take appropriate notes in a journal. ",

            "\u00a0I really learned a lot about how science works. I never had any experience in a lab coming into the class, and it felt like being thrown into the fire. But my TA and Dr. Moreno were very helpful and patient and I learned a significant amount in the class. It came to be the class that I liked coming to the most because I loved the hands-on experiments. You can tell that Dr. Moreno pours her heart into the experiment and she really cares that they're well done, and if you approach it with the correct mindset, I think you can get a lot out of the class. ",

            "\u00a0I thought it was so nice to have exposure to so many different model organisms. I work primarily with bacteria in the lab, so it was really great to try working with flies, worms, and fish embryos. I think it exposed me to interesting topics of research as well, and it was so helpful to have a list of labs that worked with each organism every week. ",
            "\u00a0This course was an exceptional introduction to performing basic laboratory methods and writing in a scientific research context. Professor Moreno was the most helpful and patient teacher, and always did her best to make sure her students all had explicit guidance on the assignments. I feel confident using this course as a springboard into actual scientific research and my senior project, in the future. ",
            "\u00a0I gained many technical skills that are fundamental to laboratory work in biology, including but not limited to pipetting, growing a culture, microscopy, and PCR. I also gained insight into how to prepare and write a scientific lab report and record observations and notes in a lab journal. ",
            "\u00a0Practiced standard molecular biology techniques, learned about a range of model organisms, developed the ability to think critically as a scientist. ",
            "\u00a0This was a great introductory course to a broad range of methods and topics in biology. However, even as a senior I felt that I got a lot out of this course. This course involves a lot of writing, and I feel that my ability to concisely communicated my ideas in writing has improved greatly. ",

            "\u00a0This is an excellent course, and a very fun experience. You learn so many practical skills in biological research, from running gel electrophoresis to centrifuging to running an ELISA. It's a great combination of working with your brain and working with your hands  has a lot in common with, say, an art class. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: topics of study, in-class engagement, diversity of skills/topics introduced, wonderful classroom atmosphere and TA/professor guidance\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: ENORMOUS workload (I wrote 60+ pages of lab reports this semester, from scratch) ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of this class is familiarizing students with a variety of necessary research methods in biology. It's important to understand how to perform a lot of the experiments that are commonly discussed in biology lectures and this course helps with that. I thought one weakness of the course was that there were times when the expectations for the lab report seemed unclear and confusing. We often left lab unsure of what we were supposed to do for the report. Professor Moreno did take time to clarify any questions about the reports, but sometimes it seemed like the expectations between Professor Moreno and the TAs were different. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are in the material. The exposure to lab skills is excellent. Dr. Moreno also gives lists of potential research labs that correlate with each week's exercise -- that is totally brilliant. Weak spots are that some of the labs can be a little bit unorganized and long, but after the fact this feels relatively minor. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include the topics and model organisms covered, the procedures included, and the step-by-step guidance for lab reports and figures. Strengths include the focus on creating effective figures to communicate data, which has been a very useful skill outside of the course as well. The setup of the lab facilitated learning well, with Professor Moreno and the TA always available for answering questions. It could have been improved with clearer directions for the discussion of the lab reports, which were the most important for scientific communication/analysis. ",
            "\u00a0The course is structures around 8-9 modules, each module usually being completed in 1 or 2 weeks. I feel like made each experiment exciting for we were learning a new experiment or were being introduced to a new organism with each week. I would improve the course by giving students more power over the experiments they get to design with each model organism. Though there was a design your own experiment\" section to most experiments, these tended to be guided. I enjoyed the final lab because students were able to design a new experiment without guidance from the instruction team and I wish more experiments could have been like this. ",
            "\u00a0strengths - learn a LOT of things, wide variety of model organisms as the name of the class suggests\r\n\r\nweaknesses - TAs are not necessarily consistent, mine was AMAZING, but not sure about others, sometimes expectations were unclear (ie professor told you to do one thing, but the TA ended up grading in a completely different manner) ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the workload decreases after the first half of the semester, and Moreno is very flexible with deadlines and is willing to adapt report deadlines around other possible exams/assignments students have.\r\nWeaknesses: The workload of the reports is very large. There are about five, each around 10 pages and taking up a lot of time to write. Additionally, time efficiently spent in lab varies from day to day (this is hearing from friends on different lab sections with different TAs). Some sections were always able to get out earlier, while some spent longer doing the same experiment. This is not necessarily terrible, but it's a bit frustrating to know that you could have been out of all the experiments earlier if the TA had a bit more experience and independence. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of this course was the applicability to actual research settings. The scientific protocols we learned are widely utilized in labs, and the writing we did is integral for grant writing and communication of results to the public and scientific community. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a number of technical skills through the different laboratory topics in this course. I gained tangible skills such as pipetting and culturing. I also further developed my scientific writing skills through the lab reports. The one weakness of this course might be the front-heavy workload of the class. While it is nice later in the semester with finals, it was time-consuming and challenging to do a lab report each week in the beginning of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Dr. Moreno prepared each class's materials extremely thoroughly. Weakness: Expectations for the first lab report could have been made clearer. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a lot of writing, both in keeping a lab notebook and writing the weekly/ biweekly lab reports. I feel that this sometimes took away from an appreciation of the basic biology experiments, but in the end my writing improved significantly. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that all of the lab sessions had very interesting material. The weaknesses is that each lab was very inefficient. There was a lot of dead time waiting around doing nothing. ",
            "\u00a0It can be stressful because most weeks result in staying past 4:30 pm, so the time commitment is a lot. \r\nHowever, you come out learning a vast amount! ",
            "\u00a0Pedagogically, this class was brilliant. Every week, we tested what we learned by designing our own experiments, where we got to recombine tactics we had practiced to conduct more in-depth explorations of the principles we'd studied, or apply them in new contexts. I always left feeling like I'd learned something. In addition, there was a great mix of qualitative skills and quantitative ones. For example, we learned skills in the class ranging from microscopic photography and pipetting to administering spectroscopic assays and applying chi-squared tests. (In fact, for the statistics portion, we even had a super helpful visit from an expert from Yale's data science squad!) \r\nThe class is also very collaborative, so you get a feeling for what real research is like, and you also make a ton of friends. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is the curriculum. The use of the lab time itself could be improved. Sometimes there was lag time at the beginning of the lab and between the introduction to the lab and when we actually got started. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting and relevant experiments, good instruction for both the experimental and the writing parts of the class ",
            "\u00a0I thought it was a great course. ",
            "\u00a0I found our activities useful but sometimes time was spent inefficiently. ",
            "\u00a0The course was a good survey to multiple model organisms and did a good job with guiding you through the lab reports. The number of lab reports could be decreased though. "

        [
            "\u00a0This is a really hard question to answer, which I suppose says something about the intensity of the highs and lows in this class. In hindsight, I have no regrets about taking this course. But did I regret it every time I had to write my lab reports during the semester? Yes (so five times). All in all, I guess my suggestion is this: If you've got a chill semester ahead of you and are genuinely interested in exploring a variety of model organisms in a relaxed lab setting, this could be a great class for you. Each lab day itself is really fun and easy, but the workload that follows (for the writeup) is intense and often convoluted (there are, in fact, some 20 pages of instructions you have to read to understand what is required of you in your lab report). If you abhor writing lab reports of any kind, don't take this class. If you're OK with that, the payoff isn't bad at all  like I said, I don't actually regret taking this course in the end. Maybe it's because I liked my TA/lab section so much.\r\n\r\nOn that note: bonus points if you take this class with a friend or two (on the same lab day, preferably) I think that saved the experience for me, because nothing beats solidarity. Note that you'll also make other friends in this lab, since this lab encourages collaboration. \r\n\r\nThe final practical/report was the easiest of all of the labs, so you should have no qualms there. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great class if you are trying to find a biology lab to take or if you are trying to learn more about biology research. Each week focuses on a different skill or model organism and you learn about how to perform the fundamental experiments related to the topic. There are only four lab reports during the semester, but there is an additional one due during reading week. These took a surprisingly long amount of time so be prepared to put some effort into each one. Being in lab itself is enjoyable, but it can feel like the amount of work expected for each report is a bit high. This shouldn't deter you from taking the class, however, as it does not feel like too much work if you get started a little bit early, and the lab itself is engaging. ",
            "\u00a0The class is super interesting! You get to work with different model organisms in bio research and you can decide for yourself what you would like to work with in the future. However, the 6 super long lab reports (ranging anywhere from 15 to 20 pages) seemed pointless and did not really facilitate learning. ",
            "\u00a0This is a good lab for those with less lab experience. The experiments were quite interesting and you can tell that Dr. Moreno really cares about the course and student learning. The lab reports take a great deal of time. Labs usually don't get out early, and sometimes ran late. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a lot. A lot of writing and it feels like a full credit. That being said, it is a great class and I would recommend it to any biology student at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Would recommend! ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! I could not have asked for a better first biology lab at Yale. I learned a lot about a variety of laboratory techniques and working with different model organisms, such as bacteria, zebrafish, fruit flies, nematodes, and more. The procedures we got to carry out in the lab were truly awesome and so well-prepared for us. Professor Moreno and my TA were always available for guidance during labs. The lab reports, although honestly pretty long and challenging at times, really helped me grow in scientific reporting and in creating great figures for representing data. The setup of the laboratory felt different than other labs I have taken - I felt more connected as a class due to the nature of the lab reports and pooling data together. I loved this lab - take it!! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the class to any students that may be wanting to learn more about some of the model organisms used in modern biology research. It will help you better understand science papers that use some of these organisms in their experiments ",
            "\u00a0Would recommend only if you don't have extensive lab experience...I'd imagine that just going thru certain things like PCR would be really boring if you already regularly do it in a lab...however, professor is wonderful, the class is fun, and in general would recommend ",
            "\u00a0Yes! A good introduction to a variety of model organisms for scientific research. Take it just to have a class with Dr. Moreno, who is quite literally the most amazing person ever. What a kind teacher who just knows so much about science and will make you think and ask questions that you never thought about before. The class itself introduced me to many kinds of scientific research, and I think that because it covers a wide breadth of organisms, anyone in biology or the life sciences can benefit from the class. ",
            "\u00a0I might not necessarily recommend this unless you're incredibly interested in model organisms. I took this because I needed a bio lab, but the workload of this lab is honestly worth a credit and not worth the half credit it was; in retrospect, I would have possibly preferred to take a less intense lab. However, Moreno is very enthusiastic about the experiments and organisms, and made the actual lab experience not too bad. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course is a wonderful survey course of different model organisms, but be prepared to do a lot of writing in order to earn that WR designation. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to a student, especially to one who does not have previous research experience. Professor Moreno is excellent and the course is organized in a manner conducive for learning a large variety of protocols. The only warning is that the workload can be relatively intense at times, especially for a half credit course. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this laboratory course to any pre-meds and anyone interested in biology or biological research. It is a great introductory lab that allows you to get a feel for some fundamental laboratory skills and become acquainted with scientific writing and literature. ",
            "\u00a0In retrospect, really a pretty decent bio lab! The first lab report can be a little overwhelming because it's not clear what the expectations in terms of thoroughness and page length are, but it gets a lot better from there. Pretty heavy workload for the first half of the course, but it dies down and ends up being pretty fun for the second half. Expect lab to usually last between 3-4 hours (except the first lab, which lasted almost 5). ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students who may have done research using one experimental technique but wish to understand other approaches. Also, this course works with live specimens (it's not all mixing reagents) - personally I loved this, and recommend it to anyone who may want to recapture some feeling of initial interest in biology brought on by looking at bugs under a microscope, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would definitely recommend this course to other students. It was one of the most interesting labs I have taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0It's definitely useful if you want to work in a biology lab and don't have the fundamental techniques. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course. It's fun, engaging, and something I looked forward to every week. It's also just so empowering to notice yourself learning these real-world skills over the course of the semester! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, especially for students unsure of what kind of research to pursue during college. Great biology lab. ",
            "\u00a0Everything that is done in this lab is fairly interesting - no busy work!  The few lab reports are long, but they are the sort of rote preparation that you have to do to really learn how to make high-quality papers. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a lot of work in the beginning of the semester but it tapers off near the middle. It's a great lab class and I really enjoyed it. Moreno is a wonderful instructor. The workload is manageable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I thought it was a great biology lab that was separate from a lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend this course to another student. The work can take a long time, but there aren't too many assignments as far as labs go. I also found the labs useful and non-repetitive. ",
            "\u00a0It's a good lab course that isn't too challenging but offers a good glimpse of all the different model organisms. The workload is a bit heavy for a half credit course, but the assignments are straight forward. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great class that allows you to dabble in a lot of different bio lab techniques and practices, making it a good class if you want to increase your exposure to different wet lab concepts. Prof. Moreno is very knowledgeable and so sweet, even if she comes off as strict in class. My only complaint is that grading rubrics for lab reports were not established and that lead to variance in grading by different TAs. Oh yeah, lab reports take up a HUGE amount of time per week (at least 8 hours per report, usually around 10 or even more). However, if you put in the effort, the end result is well worth it, because you gain so many skills and the TAs aren't super harsh graders. The workload is front-heavy, as lab reports are less frequent towards the end. I ended up writing over 60 pages of lab reports in scientific paper format, so be ready for that. Although I cried a lot while writing reports, ultimately I'm glad I took this course! "
