            "\u00a0I developed thorough insight into Lorca's plays and poetry. We discussed common themes in Lorca's works, such as the presence of death and discussion of marginalized groups. We not only read Lorca's works, but also watched film adaptations of his works and read scholarly interpretations. We also read literary works that deal with the figure of Lorca by authors such as Ginsberg, Bensko, etc.  We also discussed the Spanish civil war and artistic movements prominent at the time of Lorca's writing (e.g. surrealism). ",
            "\u00a0In this course, I developed a strong vocabulary and understanding of Spanish literature. I learned about the poignancy of twentieth century Spanish art culture and the value of death and love in specifically Lorca's works. ",
            "\u00a0I learned all about Lorcahis plays, his poetry, and his significance as a cultural figure. I also was able to hone my craft at writing academic essays in Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0Learned how to analyze poetry more in-depth in Spanish and write academic papers and research essays. ",
            "\u00a0This course was an in-depth discussion of the Spanish poet Federico Garca Lorca. The course helped me put the poet's works in a historical and cultural context. I also helped me understand the influence that Lorca had on future poets and artists. ",
            "\u00a0SO MUCH! Besides the language skills of writing and analyzing poetry in Spanish, this is an absolutely phenomenal literature survey course of Lorca's writing. I personally learned a bunch about poetic tradition/style in Spain. Sociologically it is a wonderful anaylsis of Lorca's life and what it meant to be a gay artist living in two sub-cultures under a fascist regime. ",
            "\u00a0I developed more in-depth poetry analysis skills in the Spanish language and gained insight on several topics surrounding the Spanish society and culture in light of Federico Garcia Lorca and his works. ",
            "\u00a0Gained exposure to Lorca, a playwright and poet who I'd never read before! ",
            "\u00a0I learned about Lorca as a person, a writer, and a cultural icon. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my ability to analyze both poetry and prose in Spanish, all while immersing myself in Lorca's crazy, mystical world. The course also helped to regain some of my familiarity with Spanish, as the class is a mix of lecture and discussion. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my reading comprehension as well as my writing and speaking abilities in the Spanish language. I also gained familiarity with the oeuvre of the famous author Federico Garca Lorca and his contemporaries. I learned how to analyze his particular style of poetry and I gained insight into common themes in his poetry and plays and how they related to the social and political context of Spain in Lorca's time. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a ton about FGL! This class was truly fascinating, but you have to commit to it really only being about one man. ",
            "\u00a0I de ",
            "\u00a0I got to learn so much about Lorca! Not only did I get to read a lot of his works, but I also got to read poems and essay about him. "

            "\u00a0This course covers a lot of ground and provides a thorough insight into Lorca's work and Spanish literature as a whole. There is a large focus on literary criticism. The written assignments are not too overwhelming but still provide plenty of opportunities to engage with the material. The readings are also not at all overwhelming and extremely diverse. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this course was amazing! My one critique would have to be the length, for most of the lecture I would be all in, but after the hour mark it became difficult to remain at attention as sometimes the material was rather dense and paying attention for so long in a foreign language can be brutal. ",
            "\u00a0While I enjoyed that the class was very discussion based, I didn't feel that discussions were always productive. I think that I would have benefited from having more traditional lecturing at the beginning of the class followed by an open discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths\r\n- we go very in depth into Lorca, and get a good sense of his work\r\n- the professor is very interesting\r\n- though it is a lecture, most of class is discussion and anyone who wants to speak gets a chance to\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n- lots of reading assigned, to an unpredictable degree\r\n- more time spent on plays than poems\r\n- not a lot of effort to encourage discussion from people who aren't normally inclined to speak (this is mostly those students' faults though) ",
            "\u00a0Grade is very reliant on papers ",
            "\u00a0This course read a lot of variety when it came to Garcia Lorca's works. I would say, though, that I sometimes was lost with the main point of that class' lecture. Professor Valis made sure to have her students participate in class, but that often led to getting us off topic or leading to unnecessary dead ends. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Nel Valis is quite literally THE expert on Lorca and his body of work. Lorca's texts are rich with meaning and leave plenty to analyze and talk about. It's an uncapped lecture, but feels like a seminar in the way Valis opens the conversation to everyone in the room--whether that means translating a bit of a phrase or helping explain a niche Spain-centered joke, this course feels very accessible.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none that come to mind! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of the course include having a very caring and passionate professor that is able and more than willing to provide assistance when necessary as well as not having a very heavy workload. One weakness is that it is very literary work based, so for individuals coming in with limited knowledge on literary devices and analysis, analyzing resources and commenting upon them in Spanish is very intimidating. A recommendation is having a review packet or review class of literary devices and methods of analysis in the introduction class or on the following day of class, so that everybody is on equal footing. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is the teacher's passion for the material. The weakness of this course is that it is very difficult for students who are not fluent in the language. The class should be smaller to increase engagement. ",
            "\u00a0Profesora Valis is excellent, as she constructed an interesting syllabus and led lively class discussions. I entered this class confident in my literary analysis abilities, but soon discovered that many technical elements of English literary analysis (rhyme, meter, etc) don't easily translate into Spanish. This is the one weakness of this class: that it presupposes a skillset in Spanish literary analysis. Though I was able to teach myself, I wish there had been just a little more guidance on this front (even so much as 5-10 minutes at the end of maybe one or two classes!). ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the diversity of the materialI liked that we took an interdisciplinary approach and looked at pieces from a wide variety of genres and media, including fiction, creative nonfiction, poetry, and film. I also really liked how Lorca's writing was grouped with critical analysis or works inspired by his writing so that we could look at the influence of his writing on others as well as the context in which it was written. I would appreciate if this class could incorporate more visual media, i.e. powerpoint presentations with art and photographs or key points written outit was sometimes monotonous and difficult to understand when the class was just a 90-minute lecture. ",
            "\u00a0It was a solid course. I think occasionally it was hard to keep up with all of the native speakers in the class, which made it less accessible to people coming from outside of the department or didn't speak the language natively. ",
            "\u00a0This course's weaknesses are major. The assignments are incredibly unclear. All papers are listed as a \"commentary\" with an open theme. The expectations of the professor are incredibly unclear in regard to these essays and are not set forth anywhere in the syllabus. There are no rubrics, guidelines, or suggestions. Additionally, the professor provides almost no information about the content of the midterm, which makes it very difficult to study. All in all, this was a significant negative for me. \r\n\r\nThis course's strength is that it is taught by a professor who is very passionate about the topic, which makes class exciting. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is Profesora Valis--she is a wonderful lecturer and makes the classroom a comfortable environment to speak up. The syllabus is well-thought-out: a good selection of Lorca's works, essays about Lorca, and related readings. That said, I did wish that the class was smaller (but I also understand that she wants to teach everyone who wants to learn about Lorca!). "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY! You do not only practice speaking and writing Spanish, but also improve your analytical skills. The course also covers not only Lorca's poetry and plays, but also film and literary criticism. Professor Valis is also an extremely engaging instructor and deeply cares about her students. She is extremely knowledgeable and accessible as well. You can tell she genuinely cares about the material she is teaching as well as her students. Even though the material may seem a bit niche at times, she tries to make it accessible to students.  The class is larger than a seminar, but still provides plenty of opportunity for discussion.  Most classes consist of discussion about the readings assigned, which are extremely manageable. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student that is interested in Spanish poetry and plays! This class also had a surprising amount of conversations surrounding LGBTQ+ identity politics and gender issues that were embedded in Lorca's work, and made for very rich conversations. Worth it! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This is a great, relaxed way to read some interesting literature and improve/practice/speak Spanish. I felt like most people in the class were more fluent/proficient than I was but I still got a lot out of the course and it wasn't too stressful. ",
            "\u00a0Yesfor someone who is willing to make a real effort in their Spanish studies, and is interested in literature, this is a great course. However, if you are not interested in reading plays in Spanish do not take this coursewe read a LOT of Lorca's plays. I am someone who is not a great speaker (just got a 5 on the AP test) and was able to take this classhowever, it takes a lot of time to produce work at the same level as native Spanish speakers in the class. Also, be ready for class periods that are mostly made up of discussion. ",
            "\u00a0If you like Lorca and want a challenge, then yes. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student who was interested in poetry or in Spanish literature. ",
            "\u00a0In a heartbeat. This course is one of the most wonderful literature based courses I have taken here at Yale, and Valis's enthusiam for Lorca bleeds into every moment of her teaching. If you can speak and read Spanish without too much difficulty, this course should be on your bucket-list. Professor Valis works to create a community in the classroom, and undeniably, she succeeded despite the larger lecture size. If you are able to take this course and are even slightly interested in Lorca, take this course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course to other students. The course teaches a lot about the history of a country (Spain) and the world during the periods of time that Federico Garcia Lorca lived. Students also debate upon subjects such as sexuality, the role of gender in society, psychological and sociological topics, and political events as they tie into the works of the famous Spanish poet.  The course works well for individuals that want a class that is in Spanish but not a grammar and solely language course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Definitely only take if you feel comfortable with your spoken Spanish, however, or else it is easy to feel lost. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to another student because it was very difficult for me, even though I did all the work. ",
            "\u00a0I recommend this class to anyone seeking an accessible Spanish literature class! Especially if it is taught my Profesora Valis ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would recommend this course to another student. I learned a lot about Lorca and really enjoyed reading and thinking about his work. ",
            "\u00a0I would reccomend it because the professor is very passionate, despite the incredibly unclear nature of assignments. ",
            "\u00a0I would 100% recommend this course to another student. I think it is one of the more accessible L5 courses, and Lorca is great! "
