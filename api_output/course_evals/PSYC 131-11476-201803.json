What I wanted was a solid foundation in the study of human emotion, but what I really got was fragments of information that I could have easily gotten from my own readings or from other related courses.\r\n\r\nThe lectures (and the syllabus overall) do not follow any clear outline and are very hard to follow. The instructor's teaching style is dull and he clearly does not put in the effort to make the lectures interesting or even arrive to class on time. "
