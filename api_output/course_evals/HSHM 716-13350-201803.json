            "\u00a0This course primarily allowed me to develop my knowledge of the history of science and medicine in the early modern period. However, the course was structured to include discussions of broader historical events and their impact on the creation, practice, and dissemination of science, medicine, and knowledge more broadly. ",
            "\u00a0Everything. Paola knows how to bring people into the discipline of hshm and also how to teach good research and reading skills. This research seminar is fantastic at honing ones ability to research and talk about projects, sources, and goals. ",
            "\u00a0Taking this course was most helpful in terms of writing and research. I learned a lot by reading my peers work and listening to Professor Bertuccis advice concerning different aspects of what it means to do early modern historical work. ",
            "\u00a0I believe that I really grew as a historian in this course. I was very new to the subject material and the methodology, but Professor Bertucci was so supportive throughout the semester. I also think that my horizons were really expanded, especially with regard to what science has historically been. Overall, this course was a wonderful introduction that allowed me to start to work on foundation historiographical skills that I hope to implement in my scholarship. "

            "\u00a0This course was very well organized and included a variety of working modes: review papers, presentations, chapter discussions etc. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest weakness of the course is that the 6 week spread of the second half meant that students were not always in a good place with their papers when they presented. I would have liked for the reading section to be longer and to have each student present for only half of a class so as to group all of the papers into a closer timeframe. ",
            "\u00a0I thought a huge strength of the course were the in-class archival presentations. It was so wonderful to have a chance to look at so much of our archive at Yale, and to see how and why other students pulled what they did. It was also a huge learning experience for me when I did my own presentation; I think that it acted as a good \"warm-up\" for me as I prepared to look in the archives for my own final paper. I also really appreciated the paper workshopping period. However, I think that two hours was too long to workshop papers of 12-15 pages in length. Instead, perhaps we could have done a couple more weeks of reading books, and then doubled up on paper workshop days (two students per day). I know that this might make for a lot of draft-reading in one week, so it's perhaps not a perfect solution. I do think those days need to be shortened a bit, though. "

            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone interested in developing their knowledge of early modern science and medicine. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Especially if they were looking to focus on their writing techniques. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I loved this course! I learned so much, and felt so entirely supported in my learning by Professor Bertucci. I really believe that out of all of my courses, this was the one in which I learned and grew the most as a student. I also truly enjoyed coming to class and participating in discussion. The feedback I received was very helpful, and helped me improve in each assignment. "
