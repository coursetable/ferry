            "\u00a0I learn how to critically engage ethical and philosophical texts. In addition, I was introduced to recent work in ethical theory, which was indeed intellectually stimulating. ",

            "\u00a0We spent too much time on Professor Darwall's own views when we studied Down Girl and Fellow Creatures. Often classes were spent discussing second personal attitudes even when they were extremely tangential to the text. I think it prevented me from getting as much out of the texts as I could have. ",
            "\u00a0No feedback for this section. I was there to learn, and I learned a lot. ",
            "\u00a0I like doing two drafts of term papers. It helps me with time management, and Steve gave me some really helpful and encouraging feedback on the first draft. My ethics paper was the best thing I wrote this semester, largely thanks to the draft/feedback process. \r\n\r\nDiscussion dynamics felt a little awkward sometimes. Steve gave us an agenda every week, but we never got through it all, and it wasnt clear if it mattered or not. Either approach would have been fine with me. We could make a point of staying focused and getting through the agenda - or we could scrap the agenda and let the conversation evolve organically. But we kept splitting the difference. \r\n\r\nI think its cool that Steve put student writing responses on the agenda. Its interesting to hear what the others are thinking about, and presenting your argument in front of the class is good practice. But we didnt always get around to the reading responses. I would like to prioritize them by putting them near the beginning of class so we dont run out of time (I would usually rather spend time hearing what the undergrads wrote about than, say, doing a close reading of Kant) and because the reading responses might launch class discussions.
