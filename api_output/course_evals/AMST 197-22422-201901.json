It is neither a class purely about architecture, nor a class purely about history --- this course is true to its cross-listed status, cross-cutting across disciplines in a manner accessible to all (even those without prior background in any of the academic fields!) by emphasizing themes as opposed to rote memorization of facts. Learned how architectural papers are organized, and even got to try my hand at writing two (one of which was a building research analysis of some building in New Haven --- super fun!) Also learned how to memorize the names, dates, locations, and architects/designers of over a hundred buildings in three days, but I suppose this was a necessary evil. ",

We discussed the forces that shaped the American landscape and the key players. We critiqued buildings and sites on their own terms, far beyond physical appearance or style. We traced buildings over time and analyzed what makes a piece of architecture \"good.\" We spent time discussing the impact of architecture on marginalized communities, and in particular, heritage and dissonant heritage. We spent time talking about the rich architectural fabric of New Haven and used this city as a way to make lectures more concrete. Through the first project, I learned how to trace the history of a building. I've become infinitely more aware of the landscapes I move through and live in, and I have felt a deeper connection to the city of New Haven. ",

            "\u00a0Professor Rubin definitely tried to make this course more accessible to broader disciplines beyond architecture in his lectures, which was pretty great. I would say a weakness within the sections (maybe it was just the makeup of mine) is that it felt difficult at times to keep up without understanding and knowing architectural terms off the back of your head. The course seems to rely a lot on memorization, which I don't think I was prepared to do. Nevertheless, the professor and TFs seem eager to help. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- Professor Rubin is an INCREDIBLE lecturerpretty much every class would fly\r\n- The class covers a little bit of everything, so things never get stale and there is something for everyone\r\n- Resources on Canvas are well organized\r\n- Professor Rubin provides myriad opportunities to engage with the material outside of class, such as optional sessions at the Beinecke and Manuscripts and Archives looking at old site plans, etc.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- lecture itself can sometime feel disorganized and Professor Rubin can go off on tangents where you are unsure whether to take notes or not (though in the end this doesn't really matter because he provides such a detailed study guide for the final and sufficient review sessions that if you missed a few things it's no big deal) ",
            "\u00a0The course has no structure. Professor Rubin is very knowledgeable and is clearly passionate but this means he jumps from topic to topic as he covers too much. I feel like we covered a lot but learned very little. ",

He is a strength, as well as the TA staff who lead riveting discussions based on slide comparisons. Weakness would be the sheer number of images that are presented in the class, and the fact that there is no compiled list of buildings to focus on knowing and understanding until Reading Period, which is a bit too late (there was a class website for images, but it wasn't updated after Lecture 5). There also wasn't much transparency with regards to paper grading criteria, which seemed too dependent on the TA. But, the TAs gave super detailed feedback for the first paper, which helped a lot going into writing the second. ",

It covers every major period of American Architecture thoroughly, exposes every student to archival research at the New Haven Museum, Beinecke, and Manuscripts and Archives, and had a stunning team of TFs. It's difficult to think of any weaknesses of the class -- it's one of my favorite that I've taken at Yale. As a senior, I especially appreciated the chance to learn about the built environment of New Haven before graduating. ",

Rubin excels in exciting his students about the subject matter and making them eager to explore their own built environments. I really enjoyed my section; LiWei brought great insight and did a good job pulling discussion from silence. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting and relevant assignments, good TAs who all love architecture (most are arch school grad students, not art history students), Rubin as lecturer, not that much week to week work.\r\nWeaknesses: You have to remember 120 buildings for the final. It's kind of annoying, but you just have to get a quizlet and start early in reading period. ",
            "\u00a0Loved the material taught in class. That said, I only attended about 60% of lectures cause they were definitely not necessary to do well in the class. The sections were fine, but the discussion wasn't very high level at all which I was sort of bummed about. The readings were interesting for the most part. ",
            "\u00a0This class could be mandatory for all Yale students, as it only does us good. The lectures are low-stress and high return, the assignments are not overly difficult but force you to engage more critically and inquisitively with the built world around you, and the exams are fair. The sections have both strengths and weaknesses: they are a great forum for discussing architecture in a smaller group, but I think the fact that some people have much more of a background in the content than others comes through during section. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a low-stress way to engage with the history of American architecture & urbanism. Professor Rubin gave great lectures that complemented the weekly readings and was clearly passionate about and engaged with the subject matter every class. The assignments helped take what we were learning in class and put it to practice in our own research about different architectural trends. I enjoyed how Professor Rubin tied lessons back to examples of architecture here in New Haven, which has helped me look at the city in an entirely different light knowing the history of different buildings that I pass by on a daily basis. Often Professor Rubin tried to cram a lot into each one of his lectures so the last several slides would always get covered very quickly as he went over time, which was a downside to otherwise great lectures. I wish a little more time was given in the beginning of the course to understanding different architectural vocabulary, as much of the reading uses specific terminology when discussing buildings and structures that makes some parts of the readings hard to picture/engage with as a student not coming from an architectural background. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were very compelling. The two assignments were very fun to do since there was so much individual choice. It was hard to understand what you should take notes on in order to prepare for the final. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the research assignment and paper, section, weekly reading responses forced me to read the material, lecture is interesting \r\nWeaknesses: if you miss a lecture, hard to make it up because the slides are mostly just pictures without words ",
            "\u00a0The weekly readings are really well curated to supplement the lectures. The lectures are engaging, conversational, and encourage continued thought on the topic outside the classroom. The class is also very low-stress, which is a welcomed change of pace. ",

            "\u00a0The learning process in this course is structured around a 4-pillared model: lectures, readings, section, and independent research. I found this to be highly effective in terms of facilitating learning as each part contributed to a particular kind of learning: lectures provided the core material and themes which created a stable background knowledge base with which to engage with the rest of the course; readings offered specific examples and more in-depth analysis of projects and movements related to the week's key theme; section allowed for  critical discussion and the consideration of a plurality of perspectives and opinions; and the independent research projects made the course material relevant and engaging to each specific student based on their interests. \r\nOne weakness of this course is that I think the assignments (and especially the final exam) could have been made more challenging so as to encourage deeper engagement with the course from all students; although on the other hand the existing structure allowed different students to engage with the course at different levels depending on how much it interested them.

You have to memorize 126 images and their corresponding years/architects, but I suppose it's not unlike AP Art History, for those familiar with the format of the exam. That's probably the single weakness to this class, and I'm not even sure how that would be amended.\r\nOtherwise, this class is PHENOMENAL. Professor Rubin is hands down one of the best professors at Yale. I looked forward to lecture every Monday and Wednesday, the assignments (two research-y projects) were enjoyable, and the material had so much Yale in it that you could take a walk and see a building from lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the course materials and lectures were usually very interesting, the instructor and teaching fellows were all knowledgeable in the material being taught. Weaknesses: The course was poorly organized in terms of tracking the students' improvement/ grasp of the material; in particular, since there was only one major exam in the course, it was difficult to know what to expect/ gauging if one actually had a clear understanding of the material in preparation for the final. I would suggest adding a midterm in order to avoid such issues. ",
            "\u00a0The strength and weakness of the course is its breadth: covering all of American architecture and urbanism in a single semester is ambitious but valuable. While I wish there were more attention to indigenous building, vernacular styles, and the sociology of cities over time, it is also amazing to cover all the major movements in architecture in such a short time.

Readings were primarily about individual buildings or projects, so getting a big-picture view was sometimes difficult. Assingment #1 was difficult but super interesting, and Professor Rubin and the TFs provided wonderful support in researching/seeing Sanborns, etc. It felt like a very welcoming learning environment.

            "\u00a0This course gives a mostly engaging introduction to architectural history. The main thing that would imprive the course would be giving an overview of the architectural movements/styles and vocabulary at the very start of the course.

The class was well-organized and cohesive. However, the class was so broad that sometimes I felt that it couldn't decide if it was an American Studies course, an architecture course, or an art history course---yes it is cross-listed as all three, and I felt that sometimes that was to the detriment of the class overall. ",
            "\u00a0The lecture was great but the class wouldn't be successful without a good TF and section group. Professor Rubin does a really fantastic job of introducing concepts and eras with prominent examples, but the section is what really made it stick for me. ",

The assignments allowed students to engage in anything that really interested them and do real research. The readings, classes, and sections all prepared me well for the exam and I genuinely learned a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures are absolutely fantasticProfessor Rubin makes each lecture feel like its own TED talk, yet with the overarching theme of the course tying each one together. Section can sometimes be boring, especially if people havent done the reading. ",
            "\u00a0I think a strength of this course was the breadth of knowledge we gained in relation to the built environment. Every lecture taught me something new and interesting and the course readings helped understand at a deeper level the content Professor Rubin went over in class. One aspect of the class I really enjoyed was the focus on New Haven. New Haven proved a perfect cross-section of the different movements and trends in architectural history that we learned about in class. Through a hands-on project we were able to go look deeper into the built environment of New Haven and apply the insights we gained in class to a tangible object. \r\n\r\nI think one way the course could be improved would be to make the lectures longer. Often the professor had more content to go over than we had time in class, so we always were sort of catching up each lecture. I think if the lectures were an hour 15 minutes instead of 50 minutes long, much of this problem could be solved. ",
            "\u00a0The section could serve more as a review for the class, as opposed to just an exploration of the broad themes. The final exam could also include less memorization and more analysis. ",

I also really liked how the history of Yale and New Haven were integrated in the course and really enjoyed the two research projects we had to do. One way it could be improved is I wish more time had been dedicated to learning the necessary background knowledge in architecture. As someone who came in without any background in architecture, some of the material would have been a lot less confusing if we had a previous lecture just dedicated to defining relevant architecture terms and movements. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were always very entertaining and Elihu Rubin was always very charismatic in his talks. I think maybe the readings could have been more concise and better curated, because sometime it was hard to get through them and actually understand them. ",

The class was heavily focused on overarching themes and then it seemed like Prof Rubin would intentionally teach us slide ID analysis just for the exam, while everything else was for the purpose of learning architectural themes. ",
            "\u00a0this is majorly a survey class, so its really good at getting the big ideas/trends but not as good at really explaining the reasons behind them and doesnt really get into the details. we moved through content very quickly so it sometimes was hard to keep up, which is not a problem week-to-week because theres pretty much zero work (besides reading responses and 2 short assignments) but the studying for the final definitely can feel like a huge rock to scale ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were fairly unorganized, which made it difficult to study when the final came around. I think it also made it more difficult to learn and retain the information in general because there were no clear themes throughout the lecture. Each lecture started with a list of \"themes\" but they were difficult to follow through all of the examples. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Rubin is an amazing lecturer! Lecture portion of the class was great. Assignments were also interesting and allowed students to pursue certain topics.

One of the strengths is the building assignment where students choose a single building in New Haven and find out as much as they can about it. This was a cool assignment because it allowed students to engage with the city. However, while Professor Rubin had suggested to go to the New Haven Museum to gain material for the project, I wish he would have been more explicit in how necessary the museum visit would be for the project since so much of the information needed was only available at the museum. \r\nI thought the lectures were very engaging and provided great deals of information. However, I thought the quantity of the readings was too much for a survey lecture, and many of the readings' content was far too specific on a single topic that was not later discussed at any point in detail throughout the course.

The course is equally accessible for those with a background in architecture/urbanism and those without, and the level of engagement is essentially up to you (you can get away without doing the readings, or going to lecture, if you wish - but you really are selling yourself short if you do). The freedom given in the assignments allows for active engagement with the material, and encourages learning more about New Haven in particular (through the building research project) as well as a topic of interest to you - which will allow you to uncover some hidden and probably very important history about a part of the built environment that matters to you (or has shaped you, or been shaped by you, in some way).
