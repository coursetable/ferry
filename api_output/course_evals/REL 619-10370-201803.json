            "\u00a0A bit mansplainy. But overall friendly and funny, good at filling in lectures where Bishop Ian was absent. ",
            "\u00a0Mr. Wyatt was super helpful. He was available to talk every time needed, and his feedback was excellent and thorough.  I enjoyed his moderating of the class in the Bishops' absence, as well. ",
            "\u00a0Super organized and prepared ; Ben was a great TF ",
            "\u00a0Ben gave a couple of excellent lectures--well-organized, clear, enthusiastically delivered. He's a good lecturer and should be encouraged to do more. I was less happy with his analytical approach to essays. I've now had classes with a number of TFs and I have to say that Ben was the toughest and most critical, and sometimes unnecessarily so. He tends to focus on argument and analysis, and while this is fine, I feel he gives analytical argument too much emphasis, especially in cases where the topic at hand is largely historical. I found his comments on papers detailed and thoughtful, even when I sometimes disagreed with the emphasis. I found he was willing to discuss topics in advance and provide fruitful input. I suspect this is one of the first classes for which he has served as TF, and my one suggestion would be to ease up a little, and take time to recognize other styles and approaches can be as fruitful as the one he favors. Also, he should feel comfortable making small decisions on his own without referring them above to the professors; it consumes their time unnecessarily and it cedes responsibility that he could easily manage on his own exercises and/or developing his own good judgment. ",
            "\u00a0Ben's written feedback was fantastic, not overly complementary but constructive. His comments were explicit, precise, and thought provoking.  \r\nBen was able to make contributions in class as a member of the team without injecting himself unnecessarily.\r\n\r\nI was anxious to have a (very) recent YDS graduate involved in providing feedback to current students; however, Ben was highly professional in all interactions and via feedback. I would look forward to having him participate in my future learning as a TF or as a professor (if he is so called in the future). ",
            "\u00a0Ben has the heart of a teacher and it was a delight to watch him grow this semester. He has a critical eye and often makes good observations. He can improve by being a bit more aware of his presence in the room and how he relates to the other teachers and the students. ",
            "\u00a0Ben was always present and attentive during class and provided thoughtful feedback on assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Ben was exceptionally helpful and skilled in his role as TF. His written comments were helpful, and his lectures were clear and informative. "
