            "\u00a0This class is about the theory of translation, the practice of translation, and writing for craft.  Mondays are dedicated to discussing our readings on theory and historically important translations.  Wednesdays are devoted to workshopping our semester-long translation projects.  Obviously, I learned a ton about translation theory, and working on the semester-long translation project under Professor Creswell's guidance was a great experience.  But I think that the best thing for me about this class was that it taught me how to appreciate the \"form\" part of poetry.  Over the course of the semester, all of our close-reading and translation-comparisons slowly but surely developed my \"ear\" for nice language.  Finally, Professor Creswell gave of line-by-line feedback on all of our written work, which was fantastic. ",
            "\u00a0I wish I could say I developed any skills by taking this class. All I can say is that I did a bunch of readings that didn't really stay in my head, and whatever work I had done in the class, I could have done (perhaps even more efficiently) outside of the class. I did like my classmates though, who share a lot of my salt and confusion, and I believe the best thing this class has granted me is the group of friends that bonded over the strange experience of the class itself. Insights? I shall drop classes like this with more determination in the future, and not waver just because I've done a substantial amount of work, which is what unfortunately happened to this class. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of readings in the history and theory of translation. Intensive feedback and the chance to do many revisions of your own work. Interesting window onto other people's processes. "

        [
            "\u00a0The course is split on a weekly basis between workshops and discussions on the theory of translation. I actually think it would be more helpful to decrease the hefty reading load and spend a bit more class-time on workshopping our translations, thinking through what makes a \"good translation\" together. ",
            "\u00a0This is an amazing course.  The subject matter is interesting, and the workshops are both fun and instructive.  The large amount of high-quality feedback on our writing is one of the main strengths of the course.  Doing a semester-long translation project is a fun experience.  The only weakness is that the reading load sometimes felt a bit excessive for what was only a 1-hour discussion.  With slightly pared-down reading, I think it would have been easier to focus on the important parts. ",
            "\u00a0I have one sincere suggestion that, I believe, shall bring about drastic improvements to the class. Change its instructor. Either find someone who knows enough languages and has read enough literature in all of those languages to communicate with students working with every single one of them, or have enrollment limited to those who know the languages the instructor knows well. It is a horrible, horrible idea to \"workshop the English text only\" - translation has lost its purpose when the original is detached from the class conversation. And it is even a worse idea to have the instructor, who knows nothing of most of the originals translated by his students, make comments on the translated text, intentionally diverting it from the essence of the original (Creswell might ask the author of this evaluation to explain the meaning of \"essence\" again here, as he has done for one student's paper. Yet I wonder how can one assign readings full of more abstract words that never get explained, while complaining about how the word \"essence\" is abstract and mars the argument of a paper? To better explain \"essence\": on the first day of class Creswell asked all of us what makes poetry poetry. If he himself has an answer to that, it is the \"essence\" I was referring to. If he doesn't? Well, why would a teacher ask a question in class when he himself doesn't even know the answer?).\r\nSpeaking of the readings, most of the theoretical texts in the syllabus, if I may say, serve no purpose and don't really facilitate any learning at all. A get together at the end of the term with my classmates revealed that none of us really understood or took away anything from any of the readings, and we all assumed that others understood the readings well while they just - well - bullshit, if I may use the word - in class. What is the purpose of readings like this, may I ask? What is the purpose of a class if nobody really takes anything away from the texts, if everybody merely figures out a way to \"finish the assignment\" and \"complete the class\"? I have taken many wonderful classes during my not-so-short time at Yale, and even up to now I can occasionally remember fragments of the readings and class conversations I had as early as first semester of freshman year. And will I, in the future, one or two or five or ten years, remember anything from this class that will strike me with amazement when I encounter some other words or thoughts? No. I will not. In my humble opinion, the readings have either been selected or presented poorly, and both reflect the impotence of the instructor. This is a bad class, and the worst I have ever taken at Yale. I've wasted many hours doing work in vain, and it hurts even more to discover that, perhaps, the instructor has never really paid attention to the growth of his students, or taken effort to jump outside his own box of thinking and really get to know the texts his students are working on. This shall be elaborated in the instructor evaluation section. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely take this course!  You will grow a lot whether you already have a strong literature background or just want to try out translation.  But be ready for a lot of work.  I think I spent almost as much time on this course--doing readings and working on my long-term project--as on the rest of my courses combined.  For me, it was well worth the time. ",
            "\u00a0No. Especially if it's taught by Creswell again, and more so if you don't work with the languages he knows. ",
            "\u00a0This course is basically divided into two very different \"modules.\" On Monday, you discuss translation theory, and on Wednesday there is a workshop for the translation projects that you and your peers are working on. The theory discussions are pretty bad, especially since everyone realizes pretty quickly that you don't have to do the readings and the discussion gets a lot worse from that point on. Moreover, though I would never say this to Creswell's face, under the security of anonymity I have to admit that I don't think the theory we read ever got much more sophisticated than \"don't be too literal but also remember to be faithful\"which is pretty obvious anyway. ON THE OTHER HAND, the workshops are amazing and I think that my translation ability dramatically improved from the beginning to the end of the semester. It's great to get feedback from your peers and really look into the how and why of all the little choices you make, and Creswell is incredibly dedicated and gives great feedback. "
