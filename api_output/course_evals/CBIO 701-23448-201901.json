            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the basic optics and microscopy techniques. We learned the theory and the practical aspects of using the microscope in investigating cell biological questions. ",
            "\u00a0I gained valuable information about multiple imaging/microscopy techniques. This information will help me select appropriate methods for my future experiments, and process the data in a robust way. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a TON of practical and theoretical knowledge about a wide range of imaging methods. ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge of the anatomy of a general microscope, the uses and advantages of each microscope, mechanisms of fluorescence activation, etc. ",
            "\u00a0How to take \"good\" images for microscopy, the variety of microscopy tools available to me and how to choose which tool to apply towards my own research. The course has helped me make well informed decisions during my own confocal imaging experiments (i.e. avoid saturation, maintain consistent imaging conditions). "

            "\u00a0It is a great class where experts of each microscopy technique will share their insight and experience. Not only is it well-grounded theoretically but students also get to see the real microscopes and apply the learned knowledge on site. ",
            "\u00a0I like the atmosphere of the class. It is both rigorous and relaxed. I think this is allowed by the small class size. The instructors are fantastic. I think ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Covers a ton of relevant information that I can actually use in the lab\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the lectures were taught too quickly for the complexity of the topic being covered\r\nCould be improved by adding a ImageJ homework to give a hands on example of using the ImageJ methods Dr. Shao taught. ",

            "\u00a0I definitely would. I hope any students who will have to work with microscopes would take this course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to students who are serious about improving their microscopy skills. The amount of information to be gathered from this course will probably depend on motivation and mental effort. For these people, I think this course is extremely valuable. ",
            "\u00a0I think that any student who is going to use imaging in their research should take this class because otherwise a lot of people won't take the time to actually learn the fundamentals of how the scopes work and will instead just mess with things until they get a pretty picture. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - very useful for our research. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if the student wants to apply microscopy in their own thesis project, then I think this class is almost essential. It is much easier to learn all the information through instructors rather than read it through texts, which may take a lot longer and may not cover all the necessary details required to make well informed decisions in microscopy "
