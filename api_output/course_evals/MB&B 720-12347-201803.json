            "\u00a0Strengths - exposure to a great deal of material that could potentially be accessible and beneficial in graduate school. Variety of instructors teaching on their expertise. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Almost instructed that we had to memorize material (crossing out slide, giving lists of everything you need to know, saying \"such and such is fair game for the exam\"). Felt rushed through many lectures. I thought this course would \"feel\" like a graduate school course when it was more of an extension of coursework from undergraduate. NMR lectures left a fair amount to be desired. ",
            "\u00a0This class was very disorganized, and it seemed as if the person who wrote the tests had never even stepped in the class. I really thought we were learning cool things in the class, but the tests REALLY missed the mark. We would spend a ton of time focusing on something in class, but then when it came to the test we would have a huge question on something that wasn't even talked about in the lecture. My biggest recommendation would be that if you want something to be tested on heavily emphasize that topic in class. For example, on the final there was a whole page on FCS, but we barely talked about that in class and we definitely did not talk about it on the level it was tested on. If you want the class to know something deeper but don't have time to go into it, then give us some resources to read outside of class. We spent so much time studying by googling all the things in the slides, but it would have been so much more effective if we had outside resources. Having a textbook for the first half of the course was really helpful, but once we didn't have that the class kind of tanked. ",
            "\u00a0Pymol activities were not very organized, but I do think it was good to learn how to use it.\r\n\r\nOften, topics were presented in a 'rapid fire' manner and as a result there was more breadth as opposed to depth in learning. As a consequence, it is quite difficult to learn 'everything' for an exam. ",
            "\u00a0Cryo and Xray are well structured and online resources are great. Optics needs to improve because the full message wasn't very clear. NMR felt easy but some questions such as NOESY and COZY should be better explained. ",

Allowing us to teach a section is also a good way to get us involved in the material. The availability of practice exams and Andrew's NMR \"need to know\" sheet was helpful for studying. \r\n\r\nweaknesses: Not enough desk space in the room for everyone, and occasionally there were not enough printed notes for the whole class. In general, there was a lot of confusion in what the expectations were for a specific grade - it was hard to know where we stand grade-wise until right before the final (too late!). When we received grades on the homework and the lesson, there was very minimal feedback so it was difficult to know what exactly we did wrong. ",

However, I had a much more difficult time understanding the microscopy section and the TAs frequently focused on different topics during their session. \r\nI did have some issues with organization - sometimes we would go over something twice or not at all because there wasn't enough communication between instructors. ",

            "\u00a0This course is very disjointed. There doesn't appear to be much agreement between the professors on how to approach it, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it was noticeable in this case, particularly in the apparent interactions between the professors and the TAs. In the lectures, Dr. Xiong appeared rushed in all of his sections, while Dr. Miranker, especially,  floated along without much driving force. However, I did learn a lot in this course - I think the amount of material is sufficient - I just think time should be reallocated. Additionally, while I think the homework is sufficiently challenging to be meaningful, we need better explanations of the answers to the homeworks afterwords. That way we can correct things we didn't figure out. Here, the TAs were woefully under-equipped despite what appeared to be significant effort on their behalfs.\r\n\r\nFurther, despite the NMR section being the weakest in my opinion, I think the course would flow better with NMR first. The use of Fourier transform within NMR is more straightforward and while I didn't find Dr. Xiong's approach to be particularly lacking, it may be helpful to have an easier introduction to Fourier transformation first. ",
            "\u00a0The class attempts to pack in a lot of content during the semester. I think this is a strength and makes the class reasonably challenging. I also appreciated the level of organization in X-ray crystallography, cryoEM, and macromolecular structure lectures, however, I thought that the other lectures could have been organized in a more cohesive manner. The overall structure of the class also could have allowed for more time to complete the NMR lectures, as they felt rather rushed for such a challenging subject matter. ",
            "\u00a0the strengths is that it cover all the basic method which will be used in future biochemistry/biophysics study, it can give us a brief idea about what should do and how we do it. the weaknesses is the connection in each subtitle is kind of weak. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very disorganized. The microscopy lectures are terrible, and completely ineffective. The NMR material, and most of the stuff Andrew presents is pretty good however. ",
            "\u00a0I would like to start by saying this course made me question my decision to come to yale as a grad student. This program was very highly ranked and I was really disappointed by the quality and engagement of the professors that taught this course. \r\n\r\nBig things that stand out that need to be fixed:\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving 6 courses of basic biochemistry in the beginning of the course is a waist of time. It was taught really poorly by (AM) using only lengthy power points that were not well rehearsed.  With a focus on undergraduate level concepts from a undergraduate textbook. this was really boring and did not engage the student body to think at a grad student level. \r\n\r\nTrying to teach the fundamentals of NMR in 2 or 3 classes is not a functional method to learn it. It was so rushed it was almost a waist of time. (AM) really really needs to practice teaching this material. Again flashing hundreds of ppt slides then calling it teaching is not effective. \r\n\r\n-Course organization: The course as it stands is very hard to follow because it jumps around a lot and overlaps with the quantitative course a lot. It seems that one of the courses should be a quantitive course and one should be a spectroscopy course. \r\n\r\n-Answers to home work should be provided in depth after the due date. If the TA's don't write comments on the graded work ( which happened a lot) one is left wondering what was wrong. This is not conducive to learning the material because you are always second guessing. I would like to clarify that this is not really the TA's fault because often the answers they were given to grade were only a word or two for very complex problems. \r\n\r\n -Consistent grading by the TA's: 1 TA would take 40 or 50 points off with no description of errors while the other would take of 5 points with engaged descriptions.\r\n\r\n-The final covered many topics that were literally only covered for a slide or two and left out some major topics that were covered way more in depth. This course also needs significantly more journal reading and less undergraduate level true and false answers. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Good introduction into various topics, that are essential to understand to succeed in the MBB department. \r\nWeaknesses: The organization of the class could be improved. Some topics seemed a bit random. I wasn't clear on whether we needed a background in the material prior to coming to the class, or not. If it we were not expected to have known this material prior, then we should have gotten more background on all the topics. It is fair to assume that the students had been exposed to this material beforehand, but a lot of people had not so it was difficult. The feedback given on the first test was a little vague and the answer key was posted really late. "
