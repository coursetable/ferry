            "\u00a0How to do basic game theory and apply it to politics. ",
            "\u00a0It is a great introduction to the field and methods. \r\nIt helped me (i) understand the role and utility game theory could play in political science, (ii) learn how to solve basic games, (iii) think about how to frame political questions into maths/games. ",
            "\u00a0I learned an enormous amount about a wide range of concepts/issues in game theory. It was a really nice intro class that exposed me to lots of different aspects of the topic. Furthermore, I learned lots about how to apply game theory to substantive issues in political science that I'm interested in exploring. This will be really helpful for me going forward. ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge:  A nice survey of game theory and its applications to international relations.\r\n\r\nSkills:  Solving games, applying them to international relations.\r\n\r\nInsights:  Game theoretic models of international relations ",
            "\u00a0This class was a good introduction to the fundamentals of game theory as a methodology for use in political science, taught with frequent reference to its application in international relations. I gained a sense of how the tools of game theory could be used in political science, including the concepts of one-shot and repeated games, bargaining games, Nash equilibria, and perfect Bayesian equilibria. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\nBoth classes and sections were clear, useful and interesting. \r\nThe problem sets were very well balanced (in terms of quantity and level) to help us understand the concepts and games.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nIt would have been good to spend more time on maths in class (when we did, sometimes it was too fast for it to be really useful). We might have been able to cover more models and games.\r\nI would keep the substantive applications to subfield-specific classes, it is hard to get really involved on applications that are very far from my substantive interests. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n\r\nLots of different game theoretic concepts and challenging problem sets forced me to grapple with/learn how to solve games and apply them. The professor and TF were incredibly clear and helpful in providing feedback/suggestions. The course was really well organized and had clear requirements.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n\r\nWish there could have been more practice problems that were just a bit shorter in length so that we could get more repetition when trying to learn how to solve certain games. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:  Great coverage of game theory, good coverage of international relations as well.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:  I wish that we would have covered some applications to political science in areas other than just international relations. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the examples of game theory in application, which drew directly from the International Relations canon. It made the abstract concepts of game theory much more concrete. However, I had a hard time with some of the concepts, particularly mixed strategy Nash equilibria. Where many of the other \"solutions\" for games seemed to have a clear process, I was never quite clear on what that was supposed to be for mixed strategies. ",

This would be particularly useful for exams, where questions were often more difficult than the material covered in problem sets or lectures. ",

            "\u00a0Yes. Game theory figures prominently in many papers I've read, but I've never truly understood the concepts involved. This class has allowed me to interpret this literature. However, I think I would have benefited from taking a class on formal theory first. ",
