            "\u00a0This was the first class I've taken with such a heavy emphasis on proofs. I picked up a lot of problem solving tools that I'm sure will come in handy in my research. The topics in this course are extremely relevant in network science. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of interesting probabilistic techniques for approaching a very wide range of problems in network science. I also learned more about what sorts of theoretical questions have been asked in this field (which extend to other fields), and a hint of what applications they are. ",
            "\u00a0Better understanding of networks as well as concentration results. Plus we got to see some nifty proofs. ",
            "\u00a0Better understanding of several mathematical topics, exposure to various proof techniques. "

            "\u00a0I think Amin really illustrate the materials well, and the topics are interesting. If there is anything to be improved, I would say the order of materials. For example, the CF theorem should be introduced before we talk about isoperimetry. ",
            "\u00a0Course content was very interesting. Professor Karbasi is a great lecturer and is clearly interested in the topics. \r\n\r\nMidterm had a number of errors in it which made it more stressful to write, this was compounded by the fact that we didn't get any grades back until after the final exam. ",
            "\u00a0Amin Karbasi is great. He NEEDS a TA. It is irresponsible for him not to have one. We did not receive any feedback (homework grades, midterm, finals). I have literally no idea what grade I am about to receive. Fingers crossed! ",
            "\u00a0Not to be that kid, but I don't think this class is suited towards in-class exams. I recognize the merit and appreciate that I do have a better understanding of the material since I had to study so much for the exams. But when the homeworks and the exams were the same length and difficulty and it took me an entire weekend to finish a homework while I only had an hour and a half to finish the exam, it didn't feel like a fair evaluation to me. I also wish we had received feedback on the homeworks or midterm before the final. ",
            "\u00a0The course's main strengths were the subject material and the style of teaching. Topics were very cool -- accessible but challenging, useful, and interesting -- and Professor Karbasi is great at explaining things and maintaining active engagement in class. The weaknesses were the lack of assignments, and receiving no graded work back. No HW solutions were posted, nor did we get them back, and having only 3 meant that we didn't have a chance to engage more with a lot of the topics. Also, the homework and exam problems on spectral graph theory apparently came from an outside set of lecture notes, which was not ideal ",
            "\u00a0If the course material can be uploaded immediately after the course, this course would be perfect ",
            "\u00a0Very interesting material. Good examples and questions about the topics we covered. Perhaps having a longer time period for either the final or the midterm would be helpful, as that would allow for harder/more interesting questions to be asked and answered. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Relatively slow pace, so that we understand every step. Extremely positive for a purely mathematical course like this.\r\n\r\nWeakness: No feedback on our homework or midterm, because there was no TA. Also there were some mistakes in the homeworks. "

            "\u00a0I recommend this course if and only if Amin Karbasi gets a TA. We got *literally* no feedback (no homeworks returned, no midterm returned, no final returned). I have literally no idea what grade I am about to receive. I hope it's a good one, but honestly I think it's uniform over [C,A] depending on which assignments Amin had time to look at and how he curved the midterm and final.\r\n\r\nHe is a great lecturer and I learned a lot, but I'm not sure if I would have taken the course had I known how it would be organized. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course because the topics that were presented were fantastic. I really enjoyed everything that I learned. The homeworks were challenging but doable, and great notes were available online. But it is very much a graduate class. Without a TA, we didn't get any feedback on the midterms or assignments. I have absolutely no idea what my grade is going to be as I type this evaluation. So if you're okay with that and want to learn about some really good topics, you should take this course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student, because it covers very interesting material and is well-taught. However, I would warn them that receiving no graded work, and having very few assignments (and long exams) is frustrating, and makes it more of a black box. Also, heavy emphasis is placed on being active in class and remembering previous lectures (which is harder if you had many other classes earlier the same day, but such is life) ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is a great course on network science. ",
