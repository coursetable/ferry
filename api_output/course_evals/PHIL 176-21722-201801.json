In addition, it does something that not all philosophy can claim to do: it raises some questions that, in attempting to answer them, you may find that your behavior and thoughts about life outside of class will change. As someone who lost two close family members early in the semester, it was very valuable to obtain a structured approached to thinking about the almost unfathomable questions about life and death. ",

There is no wishy-washy \"both sides are equally truthful\" sort of stuff. ",

The biggest one being the non exsistance of souls. Our entire course was shaped around that and though I found it interesting to look at it from this perspective. Something was lost in not putting multiple views about souls in conversation with each other throughout the course. ",

            "\u00a0The positive parts of the course are also the negative partsit's not a class for everyone, but for the people that take the class very seriously, it's undoubtedly a valuable experience. In section, you receive three participation grades (the semester is broken down into 3 parts). The participation grades force students to engage with the section discussions, and the nature of the grades being divided into three parts means that students receive pretty constant, clear, and fairly-objective feedback while maintaining room for improvement throughout the semester. I found that the level of engagement/contribution in my section was way higher than other courses. The class is pretty self-selecting because of its difficulty, so you'll be surrounded by incredibly smart and engaged students. The TA's are also very willing to discuss the topics outside of class / meet to work on papers, which is really helpful. These aspects of the course are really only bad insofar as you want a class that won't significantly challenge you. Aside from those, the only real weakness I saw was that the class was highly abstract (in my opinion), and it was hard to stay motivated sometimes when the topics felt so impersonal/distant. ",

",
            "\u00a0I think the topic and discussion section were strengths. I thought the class could be improved if it focused more on important philosophers' views on death. We read Plato, but few other well known philosophers. Topics like nihilism, existentialism, absurdism might have been interesting to cover. ",
            "\u00a0Shelley was a very compelling lecturer who never failed to engage us in his material. The subject of \"Death\" is complicated, but Shelley made it digestible by walking us through every topic and especially putting a lot of attention into the basic philosophical concepts we covered at the beginning of the course. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of the course was definitely the discussions we had in section. The people in section were really interested by the material, and we had some great (albeit sometimes heated!) discussions. Another strength was Shelly himself, who is a pretty engaging lecturer (most of the time; see below). The course was also structured in a good way, going from a discussion of souls, to whether death is bad, immortality, suicide etc. I also really enjoyed how open Shelly was to taking questions and comments from the class, and then debating them. It was interesting and impressive!\r\n\r\nI also liked how my TA was open to me exploring my own ideas in the papers which diverted a bit from the exact arguments we discussed in class. This was also (in a way) actively encouraged in the final paper.\r\n\r\nA weakness was that Shelly often repeated content, and also spent quite a bit of time on hypotheticals to explain fairly intuitive concepts or dilemmas. This meant sometimes lectures could be a bit slow or boring, despite Shelly's high-energy speaking/lecturing style. ",
            "\u00a0The classs lectures were interesting and Shelly is a good lecturer. I would say the improvements would be to nix the readings entirely or include the readings more in lecture/section. I was doing readings that were never discussed for the whole semester. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course was very strong, as Shelly Kagan is probably the most engaging professor I've had thus far at Yale. The course examines death from many different perspectives and gives you the opportunity to discuss those perspectives and think critically about what your own perspective is. My only complaint is that suicide could have been talked about a little more sensitively. ",

            "\u00a0Shelly Kagan is an incredible lecturer, best I've listened to at Yale so far. Very engaging, entertaining and funny. Weaknesses: toward the end it gets slightly repetitive and less interesting because he completely avoids the ultimate question of the class: after learning what we have about death, what is even the meaning of life? ",
            "\u00a0Shelly is a great lecturer- fun, enthusiastic and compelling. My TA was also excellent at moderating discussions and ensuring we all got our say in section.\r\n\r\nSome improvements could be made with the syllabus- somewhere in the middle, the topics seem to be a repetition of the same metaphysical questions that seem a bit too detached from reality, and interest tends to a drop a little.

            "\u00a0A tried-and-true course that has been taught every year with little changes, it runs smoothly with the number of students who want to take a class with Professor Kagan. The grading scale is notoriously difficult, assigning an arbitrary curve that depends totally on the quality of the individual sections led by different TA's that can make it very variant. ",

            "\u00a0Strength: the combination of lectures and sections provides a great opportunity for students to share their ideas and thinking, either in a mass of people or in a small group. The course content and structure are also well-designed and very illustrative. Sections are well-moderated well.\r\n\r\nPotential improvement: in lectures and sections, it could be better if we could refer to, relate to, or reflect on those reading materials. Some of them have been covered and discussed, explicitly, in class already; others are not, yet reflecting on them more frequently, either in lectures or sections, might help us better understand and appreciate those materials, as well as incentivize us to allocate more time reading them.

This turned section essentially into a competition, which was not conducive to productive conversation. Instead of being a time to have interesting conversations about the lectures and readings, sections were stressful and unpleasant. Rather than being rewarded for listening to other students and responding to their points in a thoughtful way, students were rewarded for speaking up the most frequently. In addition to the unproductive sections, I also found class lectures to be disappointing. I found many of Shelly's arguments to be hastily-made and unconvincing. Shelly has much better classes than this. I would recommend taking one of those. ",

To be fair, I am a STEM major who has never taken a philosophy class who took it Credit/D/Fail, but it wasnt quite my cup of tea. In addition, the complaints about Shellys grading are unfoundedthe class is straightforward, and with some assistance from the TAs, you can definitely pull off a B at least without overexerting yourself.

Without a doubt, Shelly is one of the most engaging lecturers I have encountered here and the material is powerful, insightful, thought-provoking. As a person of faith, I was slightly afraid that I was wandering into the snake-pit, but this course challenged me to confront many of my own preconceived beliefs about religion and death. It was truly a journey, and I am very grateful to have had the opportunity to take a step outside of my comfort zone and approach my faith from an objective and philosophical standpoint. It also taught me to be accepting of new ideas, as well as the importance of understanding why it is believe what we do. My faith was only strengthened by the challenges of this course (sorry, Shelly), and, for once, discussion sections were actually enjoyable. TAKE IT--by studying death, you may even learn more than you think about life. It may be wise to begin this class C/D/F, just don't let yourself graduate without taking a class with Shelly. That would be a shame. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Highly recommend this class (take it credit D though)! It is a good introduction to a college philosophy class- with an incredible professor! Very though-provoking and unique. Seems like an experience you will never get again outside of college/Yale, so I recommend taking it if you have any interest in philosophy! ",
            "\u00a0Don't do it. Not even Credit/D. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommended to majors and non-majors alike. As a class that contains elements of analytical philosophy, while still being an intro course, majors should be aware that section isn't always *that* analytically rigorous, while non-majors should be aware that this is very far from a literary or psychological approach to questions of death, and lectures will sometimes be rather abstract and esoteric. All that said, a fantastic class. ",
            "\u00a0If you plan to take a course with Shelly, I would recommend Intro to Ethics over this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely! It's a very enjoyable class which you can get a lot out from. Shelly is great fun to listen to and the questions he raises will get you discussing the topics with everyone around you. ",
            "\u00a0This is a interesting course and serves as a great introduction to philosophical and  argumentative thinking and writing. Shelly Kagan is an incredible scholar and a great lecturer, so the lectures are an experience. The discussion sections are also quite fun. The class focus on death does not necessarily make it morbid, but rather gives a lot of perspective in thinking about our mortality. If youre interested in becoming exposed to philosophical thinking while not having too much extra work, take this course Credit/D. ",
            "\u00a0Shelly is a great lecturer and this is a course that forces you to confront difficult uncomfortable questions. Take it C/D/F. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely, as a non-humanities major, it was very interesting to take a pure humanities course and was on my bucket list before graduating. The course is fascinating since discussing death means you must also discuss life. I had many conversations with friends outside the class about what we talked about in lecture and it was always very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0No. It was an interesting course but the actual material had to take a backseat to understanding the grading structure, which was unnecessarily difficult. ",
            "\u00a0It's very doable, and a good introduction to Philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0I watched some clips of this course online years before I came to Yale. It is absolutely a great opportunity to sit in the classroom and enjoy the introduction, analysis and discussion of different ideas about death. The class is very energetic and vibrant. More importantly, the sections provide a venue where twelve or so students could gather and discuss life and death every week, with moderation of a thoughtful TA. This is actually the greatest in-curricular experience I have ever had at Yale. Overtime, I can sense my improvement in logical thinking, group discussion, elucidating abstract and complex ideas, as well as a more thorough and thoughtful attitude towards life and death. Highly recommended for those who love thinking and care about the meanings of life and death. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely loved this class. The material is relevant and engaging. It was very well taught, from both professor and TF. I found the workload to be practical and even enjoyable, and I feel I got something out of every single lecture, section, and assignment. I would highly recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0no ",
            "\u00a0This course is a good way to begin studying philosophy, as Shelly is a very clear and engaging lecturer. In my opinion however, just beware that this course will present to you a detailed view of one side of an argument. Three weeks or so are spent considering whether or not the soul exists, at the end of which it is decided that there is apparently no soul (personally, I did not find the presented arguments convincing enough to lead to this conclusion). Afterwards, the remainder of the course focuses on the other aspects of death with this underlying assumption. It is an intriguing class and you will learn much about the physicalist perception of the value of life and death. However, I had hoped to learn more of the other positions held regarding the soul, life, and death which I felt were scarcely conveyed through this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Really animated professor and fascinating topic. After almost every section or lecture, I found myself continuing the conversation with friends. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Although you can get deep into the philosophy and complicated arguments, all of the actual material is very accessible and relevant to any person. I think just about anyone can take away a number of lifelong insights from this course. ",
            "\u00a0Would recommend to a student interested in gaining an introduction to philosophy. Would not recommend for students with background in topics on metaphysics. Also would nto recommend to students who have already viewed/participated in the free class/lectures online. ",
            "\u00a0It's super philosophical, thought-provoking, the essays are super fun. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Gives you new perspectives on life and I found the essays really fun to write and Shelly is a great lecturer "
