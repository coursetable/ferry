I learned that the Greek pantheon acts like a family, and humans are not considered as important or ingenious they are in other pantheons. The class expanded my appreciation and knowledge of Greco-Roman culture, storytelling, morals, and deities. "

            "\u00a0Professor Freudenburg was definitely  one of the strengths of the course. It was so clear how interested he was in the subject every time he spoke and it was hard not to share his enthusiasm. ",

            "\u00a0We are really engaged in the professors teaching and its wonderful. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Size of class, the way that it was set up (homework, test, way class was run) \r\n\r\nWeakness: Course load was expected to be difficult but it was a bit hard to read as much as we had to read in 5 weeks. ",
            "\u00a0It was perfectly organized, clear, and helpful. ",
            "\u00a0It analyzes Greek mythology in the context of Greek culture for the majority of the course, and lightly touches on Roman. It ignores the fusions between Roman, Celtic, Gaelic, Etruscan, Thracian, and Egyptian cultures and mythologies, and is also heavily interested in analyzing Homer's and Virgil's writing style. Though these are all important to the culture of the Greeks and Romans, I would like to focus on the implications behind these stories as well as the stories themselves. This course also moved very quickly. so I did not have time in class or out of class to really engage with the stories and analyze them. "
