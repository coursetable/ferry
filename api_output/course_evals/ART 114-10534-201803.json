            "\u00a0I learned more about technical skills of drawing as well as types and ways of drawing. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the basic techniques of observational drawing using graphite and charcoal before moving on to other media. Being able to translate what you see into a two-dimensional representation is a fundamental skill for artists, and this class was a very good starting-off point. Drawing is a lot more complicated than you think it is before you start! ",
            "\u00a0I learned the technical skill involved in drawing, such as line drawing, perspective, value, and more. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about drawing in different mediums and the concepts behind drawing. ",
            "\u00a0My drawing skills were deeply improved and my ability to talk about the specifics of a drawing and breaking down all of its elements. ",
            "\u00a0Great class, learned a lot of basic drawing skills from the ground up. Broke misconceptions and made drawing decisions more deliberate ",
            "\u00a0Anahita does a very good job of teaching the basic skills of drawing, exploring line, value, and scale. ",
            "\u00a0Drawing from observation, which involved studies in line, methods of abstract measurement, perspective, value, and composition. ",
            "\u00a0Unlike other Basic Drawing sections, which are more experimental, Anahitas section is very technical and will really teach you observational drawing the old fashion way. Thats the first half of the semester (can get boring). Second half is much cooler and we get to use what weve learned to go crazy. ",
            "\u00a0Basic techniques of drawing, using plumb lines and measuring lines to get things into proportion and perspectives. Techniques for using tone and shading as well. Drawing from life. Drawing scaling up. "

            "\u00a0I really enjoy the hands-on nature of this course, also how diverse the types of projects are. I also appreciated the structure - we honed our skills at the beginning of the semester and then used them in a diverse array of projects. I would want more critiques. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: starts out very simple, which might be frustrating for students who have already taken drawing, but for me it was perfect. Focuses on one aspect of drawing at a time - proportion, line, composition, value. I'm not an expert on drawing techniques (obviously) but it felt like a pretty comprehensive basic drawing survey for only three months. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I would have loved to meet three times a week rather than two, in order to have more in-class drawing time with direct feedback without sacrificing class time. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - a great variety of project themes were involved in the class, we were able to focus on many types of content which kept it exciting \r\nWeaknesses - there was a large range of pre-existing skill sets coming into the class; some individuals came in with a lot of experience and others came in with none; this made it harder to move at a consistent pace among the class ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Lots of hands-on engagement, interaction with course material\r\nWeaknesses: Critiques take up a lot of class time- these could be a weekly assignment for online, sometimes feels like it doesn't have a lot of direction ",
            "\u00a0The assignments were not very engaging and it was sometimes hard to be creative with homework. The discussions were very in depth and it helped me improvement and grow. ",
            "\u00a0Syllabus is great, workload is appropriate. I would maybe like the idea of blind critiques where you dont know the artist in order to remove biases midway through the semester, etc ",
            "\u00a0With Anahita you ALWAYS know where youre standing. That woman is he best Canvas user Ive come across (she even uses the calendar!!). I do wish we had spent more time in different mediums though. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Taught me what I needed to know\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Assignments were terribly boring. Awful still lifes, drawing tables and chairs. Buildings. No room for creativity. Hard to be passionate and stay focused on assignments that were so run-of-the-mill. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely! A great way to learn and/or improve on drawing skills. ",
            "\u00a0Yes- everyone should learn how to draw and engage different parts of their brain for a new kind of learning. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I think it is a good precursor to other art courses. ",
            "\u00a0Great class! Its a nice way to do different types of homework. Drawing skills help, but listening to professor and doing the things they say are important for the assignment is better ",
