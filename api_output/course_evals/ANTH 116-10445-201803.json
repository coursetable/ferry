            "\u00a0This class provided an overview of biological anthropology, of the history of human evolution, and of current areas of research as regards human evolution. Though not in depth, the knowledge is a strong foundation for anyone interested in biological anthropology. I gained some skills in dealing with bones and identifying their characteristics. ",
            "\u00a0The course provides a survey of some of the key topics in biological/physical anthropology, including natural selection, genetics, primatology, hominin/human evolution, diet, and reproductive ecology. I really enjoyed the labs and thought that it was so helpful to be able to see some concrete examples of the things that we talked about in lecture. This really helped with my learning because it's much easier to remember the defining features of a certain family of primates, for example, by being able to identify them in a skull, rather than just by trying to memorize a list. ",
            "\u00a0This class really changed the way I think about human evolution and even the way I view myself. I am walking away with lots of fun facts and a few cool skills like being able to ID different kinds of primate skulls. ",
            "\u00a0Not much. This class is an incredibly broad survey of broad topics--even when Prof. Watts attempts to go into detail about a topic he simply skims the surface for an hour. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a better understanding of evolution, primates, reproductive ecology and other aspects of biology. This course was very in-depth and ",
            "\u00a0I didnt. Class was boring, problem sets didnt teach me anything, and the structure of lecture notes on canvas wasnt conducive to learning. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the evolutionary history of humans, starting with apes and moving through the variety of other hominins, understanding their physical and behavioral characteristics and what makes humans stand apart from those species. ",
            "\u00a0Such a fantastic course. You learn all about where humans originate from. The course is taught in an interesting way and the connections made between our lives and our ancestors is fantastic. ",
            "\u00a0Basically, the class covers Darwinian evolution, primate evolution, human evolution, and then a few ways that evolutionary and biological concepts impact human health and culture today. I felt like I got a good overview of all of these topics. ",
            "\u00a0The course provides introduction to primatology, hominin evolution, and then biological aspects of modern humans (disease, skin color, variation, etc). ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the evolution of modern humans through looking at recent ancestors, as well as hominid species that were closely related to us. We also learned about how our evolutionary line impacts modern humans, looking at things like the modern human diet. The class also covered modern primates' behaviors, diets, and appearances. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a basic understanding of early hominin evolution, how selection pressures cause adaptations in species, and an overview of biological anthropology as a whole. ",
            "\u00a0Great Intro anthropology class and learned was a great introduction into biological anthropology including primates, human evolution, and human selection. ",
            "\u00a0I developed skills in identifying bones of primates and homonins, as well as the ability to determine cultural and social behaviours based on arcehological and bone remnants. ",

            "\u00a0A strength of this class is that it covers a variety of topics, allowing students to engage with topics they find especially interesting. However, I learnt much more during section than in lecture. The lecture's biggest weakness is the fact that it simply covers what is on the presentation slides. It would have been more engaging to view the class as an opportunity for Professor Watts, as an expert, to speak about what he knows about the topics that need to be covered, rather than as a rather dry review of what was already in the readings. A further weakness is that the psets are a little vague, and complicated to understand even when they are not complicated to complete. ",
            "\u00a0I think one of the main areas in which the course needs improvement is just a quick organizational fix. The problem set due dates were not on the syllabus at the beginning of the semester, which made it more difficult for me to plan out how I should organize my own work throughout the semester. Prof. Watts would generally post the problem sets a week or so before they were due, which was fine because most of them weren't very long. I still would have appreciated knowing the due dates in advance because I was working on my thesis and some other big, time-intensive projects this semester, and not knowing problem set due dates until such short notice often required me to replan my work schedule for the coming week to accommodate that. \r\n\r\nOne of the main strengths of the course is that lab and lecture complement each other really well. At least for me, lab was helpful because it gave us a chance to see what we were learning about, which was more helpful than seeing pictures on slides. Prof. Watts also clearly knows so much about all of the topics that we covered, and the examples given in lecture also did a good job of illustrating the concepts. ",
            "\u00a0I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the lab sections and getting to regularly handle specimens. There were also quite a few readings that were really interesting. One thing that could be improved was the lecture themselves, which often felt like a dry barrage of technical information and lost my interest as a result. The lectures in which we watched videos were the better ones. There was also an issue with problem set grades not being released in a timely fashion, which made it difficult to have a clear idea of how you were doing in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Slides are super lengthy and verbose. Exam questions are oddly specific and confusing. P-sets are vague and don't help you practice concepts. Sections are kind of cool since you get to play with bones, but they don't help you learn the material. Textbook is super expensive. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: great instructor who was an expert in various aspects of biological anthropology, very personable, very friendly, energetic \r\nWeakness: instructor rambles a lot, provides too much information, and doesn't make tests too well\r\nImprovements: provided course objectives and make test study guides concise ",
            "\u00a0I don't really know what I expected but I think the course was a little heavy on content about ancient hominins and non-human primates at the expense of talking more about recent evolution, which I personally found more interesting and was more along the lines of what I thought the course would be. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah. David Watts, while really knowledgeable, was not a good lecturer. I often found myself distracted in lecture as he went off on unrelated tangents that didnt add anything to the lecture. ",
            "\u00a0I particularly enjoyed the lab sessions that we had outside of our lectures, as being able to handle bones, tools, and casts was a very engaging way of being able to understand some of the topics we had discussed in lecture. Most of the lectures were informative and very helpful, but sometimes it was hard to tell what information was extremely important/would be tested on and what was just interesting extra information. ",
            "\u00a0The first half was horribly boring; second half was more interesting but very basic. The first midterm made no sense and for most of the assignments I spent more time trying to figure out what was being asked/said than actually doing the assignment. Grading is unclear and too particular. TFs often had no idea what was going on. ",
            "\u00a0Even though the tone can be a bit monotonous, you learn a lot of interesting facts about where we all originate from. The strengths are centered around the labs where you actually get to see actual skulls of these primates! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: broad range of topics, easy to understand without knowledge of biology or anthropology, genuinely interesting stuff\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: poor organization and boring lectures ",
            "\u00a0I found this course very interesting overall, and the workload was extremely manageable. If I could change anything I would cut out some of the introductory biology lectures at the beginning of the course, because it took several lectures before we actually began learning about hominids. ",
            "\u00a0Because this course requires a grasp of many concrete biological facts and an anthropological framework with which to understand species that no longer exist, it would be more conducive to students' learning to have a more straightforward, linear progression of ideas. Although many ideas are intersecting, and the course does a good job of covering a wide range of concepts, presenting all of these themes in a less crisscross, backtracking manner would be very helpful for students. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are during lab when you got hands-on experience with what was learned during lecture. The main weakness could be that lecture can get repetitive and could be a bit more interactive. ",
            "\u00a0I believe a weakness of the course was the amount extraneous information that was presented in class. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the inconsistency in the problem set assignments was an issue. There was never an organized schedule in which they were doled out, so I would oftentimes need to schedule time to work on them at the last minute. Knowing well in advance when each problem set would be due would have been very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Very content heavy though extremely interesting, I initially thought the course would be more general but it is very specific and in depth which was useful although I wish we were made aware of this prior to the first test etc. The engagement and content in lab did not match the overall challenge presented in problem sets and tests, I wish those could help prepare us a bit better. Overall, very good course though ",
            "\u00a0The best aspect of this course was the readings that didn't come from the textbook. The textbook itself was fine, but the original papers and general-audience science articles were engaging, focused, informative, and really hammered in that this field is actively changing. It was cool to read groundbreaking research published less than a year ago and wonder how different this course will be a few years from now.\r\n\r\nThe lectures for this course were not engaging, and there was almost zero interaction between the professor and students. It would have been nice if the professor had occasionally asked the students to try to answer a question, or if the environment had been such that a student would bother to ask a question more than once a month.

            "\u00a0Unless the student was specifically interested in biological anthropology, no. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in biological anthropology, or just people who need a science credit and don't want to do anything math-intensive. The first part of the course on natural selection and genetics was mostly a review from AP Bio, and I suspect that many non-STEM majors who took that class in high school felt the same. Even as someone who isn't super interested in science, I thought the course and a lot of the readings were interesting because anthropology is such an interdisciplinary field and a lot of the things we learned about have implications for more social science-oriented fields as well. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to anyone who needs a science credit but wants it to be applicable to their own life. It is not a gut, but it was definitely manageable for a humanities major with 4 other demanding classes on their schedule. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely not. The material has no application to anything you'll ever encounter again, and Prof. Watts skips all social implications of topics that could otherwise humanize such an ancient, dusty field. This class is the epitome of science for the sake of science. ",
            "\u00a0not a gut ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it if looking to fulfill a distributional requirement, however I would caution them. This class doesn't really have set course objectives whereas most other classes do. This can make it challenging on the student as what information to retain. So if the student was interested in biology, I would definitely recommend. If they like the anthropology aspect, then I wouldn't. ",
            "\u00a0If you're looking for a Science gut, this is not a class I would pick. The class was disorganized, the lectures were extremely boring, and the slides (which the Professor essentially reads from) were always posted online. While that may make it easy to skip class, I think there are better ways to take an easy and more relevant Science credit. ",
            "\u00a0Nope. Course sucked. Midterm and final were brutally hard for a poorly taught course. My fault I didnt study as hard as I could have, but the study guides given to use were completely unrelated to the test matieral. ",
            "\u00a0This class is nicely geared towards non-STEM majors who have an interest in human/hominin evolution. I think for people who are really interested in this topic, that this class might do too much skimming over the basic information of this topic for them to be very invested, but it does a nice job as an intro level class. ",
            "\u00a0This is a course that certainly presents some interesting material, but I think it requires heavy engagement to get the most out of it. ",
            "\u00a0No, the class was an entire waste of my time because it was boring, hard, and confusing. ",
            "\u00a0No ",
            "\u00a0Take it if you are genuinely curious about where humans originate from. Some parts of the course may not be as interesting as others, but you will definitely find most of it fascinating if you want to learn about these topics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! if you have any interest in anthropology or human evolution, you don't have a science background, and you can put up with boring lectures, I think this class is a great and easy science credit ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend it to other students. I thought it was a very interesting class that provided a general survey of biological study of humans. Some of it, especially things about early hominins and primates, can be a little slow if you aren't interested in it. Otherwise, it is a great class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. It was very interesting to see how ancient species and behaviors shape so much of who we are today, and not much work is required outside of class. ",
            "\u00a0The course covers a wide range of information that often involves the interception of hard biological concepts with an anthropological framework to reach a conclusion about species that no longer exist. If you are interested in studying anthropology and want a science credit, I would recommend taking it. It should be kept in mind that it is an introductory course that covers a huge range of topics that connect in myriad ways. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to another student. It was an interesting class and very straightforward. It was a great intro class that was divided into sections. The concepts are simple to understand and interesting look at primates and human evolution/selection. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in evolution and who does not mind having in-flux deadlines. ",
            "\u00a0Yes but only if they are interested in evolutionary bio ",
            "\u00a0I actually have recommended this course to another student, because the material is really interesting and it's a very science-heavy social science credit. However, the format in which the information is presented isn't great. "
