He taught the concepts at the speed that assumed people had a basic understanding of linguistics principles, which wasn't necessarily the case. While the information was sometimes interesting, it was difficult to remain engaged as the practicality of learning it all became a little puzzling at some points. ",

More importantly, I learned a lot of linguisitics material, as each unit basically covered a small introduction to different sectors of linguisitics.

I also learned a lot about the cognitive science field in general, and got a small glimpse of the sheer breadth of the field. We began the course with linguistic basics, such as the techniques that linguists use to analyze different languages. Then, we delved into the way that language is reflected in the brain, and the way that different languages influence thoughts and developments (or vice versa). Then, we learned ways to model the way that language is processed in the brain, which involved delving into the realm of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Although these different topics appear disparate, they were very well-connected and related when presented in the class. "

Professor Frank is a great lecturer and is very engaging, however, I wish more introductory material was given at the beginning of the course. ",
            "\u00a0He tended to answer questions using large linguistic-based or computer-science-y terms that I rarely understood. Often times, if there were questions asked about homework/assignments, the answers were confusing and just prompted more questions. Also, it takes FOREVER for the assignments to be graded. We submitted one assignment BEFORE spring break and haven't received the grade yet (during Reading Week!). ",
            "\u00a0No weaknesses, all strengths. Bob Frank is an amazing lecturer and all of the concepts are so well-explained. I never felt like I was not grasping something, and if I was, I know he and the TFs were extremely receptive. I will say we had two random reading responses at the very beginning of the semester that we then just never had again, so after the first few weeks I stopped doing the readings entirely but still didn't have a problem on the midterms or the final. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are how the notes and lecture basically discuss all that is needed to know on exams and most homework assignments, saving time for those who are busy from reading all of the extra material (which are emphasized as supplementary in class). Another strength is that Professor Frank is really passionate about the material and teaches it in an understandable manner, which makes both understand and note-taking simple in class. The powerpoints and modules on Canvas are very well put together as well. Improvements could be providing a little more time for assignments around midterm and finals season and posting the powerpoints for the class a little earlier than the day of class or the night before.

The lectures cover and incredible amount of information and the lecture slides often only explain part of the topic covered. Therefore, when you are studying for the exams, the lecture slides often prove unhelpful as not all of the information necessary is on them. Additionally, the lecture slides are never posted before class so you cannot follow along with them as Professor Frank is explaining the material, making it even more difficult to understand the topics covered. ",

Also, I am skeptical of some of the research presented in the course, particularly experiments on babies or animals, but the findings of these studies were presented as facts. ",
            "\u00a0This course is well organized, and has three non-cumulative exams that are relatively easy to study for. However, I think that the overarching topics and questions being posed in the lectures are not clear until the study guide for each exam is released. It would be much easier to learn the material if the lectures started with a quick plan of the elements we are going to cover, and ended with a summary of key points and questions. ",
            "\u00a0The actual concepts covered in class are quite fascinating and can be applied to everyday life. Professor Frank is a fairly engaging lecturer who is genuinely interested in the topics at hand. However, the class was extremely disorganized and lectures could be dull due to abrupt transitions in concepts. The workload fluctuated wildly and assignments were not put on the syllabus and were thus assigned out of the blue. The TAs withdrew from the course right when we had a bunch of difficult assignments to work on. ",

Sometimes if one didn't take notes for a part of the class, or if one missed something the teacher said, it was hard to read the powerpoints and understand what was going on. ",

I found that it felt a little all over the place, with some material coming across more clearly than others. This may seem like a lightly ridiculous suggestion, and I understand it may just be me that noticed this, but even little things like using a consistent format for the slideshows to bring some consistency to the way the information was presented would have helped me a lot. I think the changes in format added to the feeling that the course was somewhat disorganized. ",

It had areas where we went really in depth but also areas where we were able to get an overview to give us a taste of many different areas of linguistics. The teaching is also a strength and Professor Frank always ensured that lectures were engaging. I think that the weakness of this class is that the lectures are too long. 50 minute lectures could help keep students focussed for the whole lecture. ",

I learned a lot about linguistics and our mind's perception of language, and I liked the structure of the class with problem sets and three equally weighted exams (all very fair). He made the material challenging and went pretty in-depth at some points into things like neural networks and syllable typology, which I really appreciated (didn't feel just like a surface-level class). ",

The actual concepts covered in the course are quite fascinating and I felt like I came away with a good basic foundation of linguistics after taking this class.

The five homework assignments we were expected to complete did not have dates listed in the syllabus and were thus assigned out of the blue at the most inconvenient times with a week to do. In addition, the assignments were extremely difficult and could essentially only be completed with the guidance of TAs, but it just so happened that both TAs withdrew from the course in the middle of the semester so it became even more difficult to do the homeworks. Lectures were generally confusing and seemed out of order. We also fell behind about a week so both midterms were pushed back. If the course structure were changed drastically, I would wholeheartedly recommend the course. ",
