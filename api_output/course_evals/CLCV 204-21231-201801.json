            "\u00a0The lectures can be a little scattered but the study guides are incredibly helpful and the course is really interesting ",
            "\u00a0This course needs better organization and focus. The lectures bounced around and had no trend and the readings were hard to follow and never seemed to relate back to the material we learned that week. ",
            "\u00a01. there is too much reading assigned, so no one does all of the reading each week\r\n2. lectures during the 2nd half of the semester were too focused on sociology and other niche aspects of history, as opposed to the political \"real\" history that the course relied on earlier.\r\n3. The first exam had a great format. Nice how hard work directly translates to success. \r\n4. The 2nd exam had an okay format, but the first question source analysis seemed superfluous. ",
            "\u00a0I like how the lectures were to elaborate on the readings, and I liked how they were more narrative and theme-based, but they could ramble sometimes and I would lose sight of what the overall meaning of the lecture was. ",
            "\u00a0This course was overall very strong. ",
            "\u00a0We could have spent more time on Alexander the Great ",
            "\u00a0The largest strength of this course is the subject matter. The readings and the time period that this class covers are incredibly interesting. It ties together the grandeur of classical Greece with the glory of the Roman Empire.\r\n\r\nThat said, this class was not very well organized. The TAs (who were excellent in my experience) seems to need to pester Professor Manning for any sort of clarity on the upcoming assignments (papers!). The lecture slides and notes were not posted in an organized manner, and often not posted at all. If you don't want to post the lecture slides, that's fine. But please don't tell us you're going to and then not!\r\n\r\nPlease provide additional clarity about the papers earlier in the semester (lengths of assignments not released in the syllabus!). For writing credit, grade makeup should be 30% midterm, 30% section/papers, 40% final. For three papers plus section participation, 25% is too little!\r\n\r\nI understand that Professor Manning is an excellent historian and extremely intelligent man, but his class would've benefitted from this additional level of organization. The lectures themselves were a bit jumpy and often posed more questions than they answered. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting content, but many times the format of the class made it so that it was more important to do the readings than go to the lectures as we were only tested on those. \r\nAlso, while it is interesting to study history by topics, I did feel lost on the timeline of events most of the time and it would be nice if rather than just saying the years, there was a bit more contextualizing. ",
            "\u00a0Very interesting material, taught very well. ",
            "\u00a0Please do the course chronologically - it was SO confusing to have it taught by geographical sections and themes. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were interesting and engaging. The discussion periods allowed students to clear up any confusion they may have had and to gain greater insight into specific occurrences. ",
            "\u00a0The primary source readings for the class are a lot of fun, but sometimes the secondary source readings were overwhelming. Overall, I think the balance was fine by the end of the semester. Lectures were mostly fascinating, but sometimes a bit unorganized and too reflective of the powerpoints. Two TA's (Andy and Liam) gave excellent guest lectures. ",
            "\u00a0This course was able to combine the leading documents on the Hellenistic age to try and create a holistic view of the age. Yet, it challenged us to see if the view truly was holistic or whether there were some things that needed further investigating or were tougher to truly decipher than previously thought. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest weakness of the course was the structure and nature of the assessment. I felt that the subject matter of the class tailored more to a written paper than an exam, and I think it would have been better to have assigned a longer paper in lieu of a final exam. The structure of the final exam, which basically was two essays, reflected that and it would've been more conducive to the students I think to have just had us write a paper drawing from a wide variety of sources and the things we learned in class than to give us a couple of essay questions in advance and have us prepare essays to write in a three-hour period. \r\nAlso for a class about Alexander the Great and the Hellenistic World, it might have been nice to have focused at least for another week on Alexander, it felt like we skipped over him fairly quickly and while admittedly the primary source base isn't great I think we definitely could have managed to do another week on him. Or you could just take him out of the course title. ",
            "\u00a0For the WR credit: A lot of paper writing but worth less than 25% of the grade. Could be skewed a little more in favor of the papers. The reading is all excellent and super interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I think this class is excellent! I learned much more and was much more interested than I thought I would be. Professor Manning is an excellent lecturer. I think one of the strengths of this class is its focus on studying ancient sources over modern surveys of the period; I think this is very important because for many students like me, this may be their first or only class in ancient history. I think one of the weaknesses of this class is its lack of focus on Alexander himself; while of course in a 300-year time period only so much time can be dedicated to one person, Alexander the Great is a fascinating figure (and half of the title of the course) as well as an important one, and for that reason I believe that this class could benefit from focusing on this figure more than it did. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of this course was Professor Manning, who I will discuss further later. The other main strength of the course was its material - Alexander the Great and the Hellenistic period is a fascinating period of ancient history that is regrettably understudied compared to Classical Greece and Rome. It was in particular interesting noting how Hellenistic history constantly interacted - from effectively the very start - with Roman Republican history. Regrettably, however, the course did have one main weakness: the amount of reading. It was simply unnecessary how much Errington in particular was often assigned, and often how many Austin sources were assigned; many of the articles were redundant or excessively long as well. It was also then frustrating because we didn't have time in section to go over the vast majority of the reading that had been assigned. "

        [
            "\u00a0Probably not, while it was interesting it was really difficult to study for things because I was unsure what the purpose of the class was. The themes were very hard to identify because I'm not sure that there were many, if any, that were emphasized. ",
            "\u00a0I took this class for the 300+ level credit and for the pre-industrial credit, so I took the non-writing section. Overall, this class is a mixed bag. I learned A LOT about Hellenistic History, and the subject matter is pretty interesting in of itself. Unfortunately, a lot of this learning was done on my own, in the days before the exam. The lectures start off strong, but quickly wander onto niche subjects later in the semester. Consequently, lecture attendance is rather poor. The level of reading you need to do is highly dependent on your TF, but no one does all of the reading each week. On the bright side, the exams are very straightforward, as Manning basically releases all the possible questions ahead of time and then picks a few you have to answer. If you put in the work to study, you WILL be rewarded with a fairly good grade, which is more than I can say about some of the other lectures I've taken at Yale. Overall, I would recommend this class for those looking for: a low workload class, a 300+ level/preindustrial for the major, predictable grades, a class that you don't have to attend lecture, or for learning about an underappreciated historical period. I would NOT recommend this class for those who want riveting lectures, or dislike primary source analyses. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course to take as a PI for the history major. Manning's lectures and especially engaging, and the workload is not too tough at all. It offers a great introduction to the Ancient world and analyzing some really interesting primary sources. Very glad I took this course. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this class. As a history major, it was interesting material about an important period of time that I didn't know much about. There were a lot of classic majors who liked to flex about how much they knew about the period though. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely would, as it enhanced my knowledge of the ancient world. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if they were interested in Ancient History ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to any student interested in taking a class in ancient history. As many other reviews identify, Alexander the Great actually dies in about the third week of the semester. The history that follows, however, is incredibly interesting. I'm an S&DS/Econ major, and I've taken two other history dept classes. I took this for a WR, and I enjoyed the content more than any other history class that I've taken.\r\n\r\nThat said, the workload was much more than advertised. You actually need to do the reading (for real!) if you take the writing section (at least the stuff in the Austin anthology, which is very manageable) in order to write the papers. The papers themselves were longer than expected: first was about 7-9 pages, the second about 10-12 pages, and the third was to add 3-4 pages to your second paper. ",
            "\u00a0yup! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was interesting! There are a lot of readings but it's a way of learning how history is studied in a more formal level. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend since it's a cool subject. Where else would you learn about ancient war elephants and sarissas? ",
            "\u00a0I'm not sure I would recommend this course to another student. The subject matter is interesting, and I learned a lot more about the period, but I think the course was not terribly well organized. The reading amounts varied a lot week to week, whereas the lectures consistently had low amounts of information and felt disorganized to the point of having trouble taking notes sometimes. I think the key themes of the course came through clearly, though. I didn't take the writing section, so I can't speak to that element. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - very interesting and if you do the bulk of the readings I assure you the course will be way more interesting ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but actually do the readings. I essentially had to learn the entire course three days before the final and turns out it's actually really interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student that is interested in the life of Alexander the Great and ancient history. Although I do not wish to major in history, I appreciated the insight that this course had to offer and I enjoyed taking the class very much. ",
            "\u00a0If you are at all interested in what happend after Alexander the Great dies and before the Roman Empire began Id recommend it. Id also recommend it to history majors looking for a lighter workload or for people looking to balance their majors with a good class with a manageable workload. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend the course to anyone interested in understanding the complicated historical period between classical Athens and Rome -- it's absolutely a brilliant time that fills in a significant gap that is looked over in most history courses (and DS). ",
            "\u00a0Manning is a disorganized teacher and lecturer, and teaches you very little directly during class. The class focuses on analyzing sources and gives you very little direct knowledge of the period.  This is partly because the source material is sparse from this period.  The exams do not test knowledge of the period but knowledge of obscure source material.   If you want to go to grad school for ancient history then take, if you want to learn something, then beware. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student as it is informative and challenges previous held notions. ",
            "\u00a0Yea probably. I did it because I find the period to be very interesting, so I came in with pretty high expectations and I don't think the class really met them. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Anyone interested in getting into ancient history should take this course. You see the big (troop movements, politics etc) and small (how people lived). ",
            "\u00a0I think I'd recommend this course. The material was interesting enough. The exams were fair and as someone in the WR section, the essays weren't terrible. It's worth a look. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, take it! Prof. Manning is a great lecturer, and you won't really learn about this stuff in such an in-depth manner in another context. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to another student for many reasons. Firstly, if a student wishes to gain a better understanding of how to study ancient history as compared to more contemporary history, this class is an excellent introduction. Secondly, this class is an excellent example of history done right in general; if you are going to take only a few history courses at Yale, this should be one of them. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in history, especially Western history. The Hellenistic period is a key period for understanding the comprehensive arc of Ancient (Western) history - without understanding Alexander and the Hellenistic period, it is hard to have a thorough grasp of the Ancient Western world.
