            "\u00a0Basic level Japanese and a better understanding of Japanese culture and customs. It is very interesting to learn a language structured so differently than english. ",

            "\u00a0A basic knowledge of Elementary Japanese ",
            "\u00a0elementary Japanese listening, speaking and reading ",
            "\u00a0The ability to communicate in simple terms in japanese. They were countless grammar structures, themes and vocab lists that made the class very fruitful and productive. ",

            "\u00a0The content is challenging, however the workload is manageable given enough dedication and interest. ",
            "\u00a0Japanese 110 is extremely well taught (Saito is great), but very intensive. \r\n\r\nThis could be because of my experience with romance languages coming in, but compared to other parallel language courses, I felt that studied more, learned more, and got a lot more out of it than other languages that I've taken @ Yale.\r\n\r\nI think the big thing is that homework could take you 2 hours of legitimately paying attention and doing work EVERY DAY, and if you do that, you'll be fine, and if you don't, you might struggle.  Once you become adjusted to the scheduling system that the teachers use (they post a weekly agenda with homework and material to review for each day), keeping it organized is no problem, but 2 hours of daily work for a single class can be a hard habit to form.\r\n\r\nOne thing that I feel is under-emphasized is how willing the professors are to work with you to resolve things you don't understand, whether you're reaching out to them via email or going to office hours, if you're willing to mark out time and talk with them, many of them are happy to continue working with you until you're comfortable with what's going on. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of work but overall good class. More writing practice would be helpful. It would make sense to consolidate the textbook and the course packet into one volume so we don't need to buy two versions of essentially the same book. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: well-organized syllabus, responsible teachers\r\nweakness: rules are too strict, especially regarding assignments ",
            "\u00a0The course was well-structured, well-taught and very intensive. It was great being able to learn so much in such a short time, instructors were also very accommodating with extra help. ",
            "\u00a0Its a lot of work, but the work has a good payoff in the end ",
            "\u00a0The course is well-organized every day, and every student is highly involved. The assignments are very interesting. But I think it might be even better if we could learn more Chinese characters per semester. "

            "\u00a0I would highly recommend! Very fun and stimulating, but also very rigorous. The professors are wonderful people and do their best to help the students learn the language and the culture! ",

            "\u00a0If you're interested in learning Japanese and prepared to work, I would definitely recommend the course. ",
            "\u00a0Whether you are interested in learning Japanese or simply satisfying the language requirement, this class is very fulfilling and engaging. The professors are very invested in their students and the lessons are masterfully crafted. ",

            "\u00a0Yes because it is always useful to learn a new language, and this is a great program ",
            "\u00a0Of course to other students who are also interested in Japanese and Japanese cultures. The instructors are all energetic and friendly to students. And from the Japanese Table not only have I enjoyed speaking Japanese but also met a lot of other Japanese learners from different levels. "
