            "\u00a0I learned how to analyze organic molecules to identify resonance, etc. We also spent a lot of time learning about the various kinds of stereochemistry in molecules and what their effects are on molecular reactivity. The last half of the course was mostly filled with learning a variety of reactions that organic molecules can undergo, and through those reactions we gained experience in drawing arrow-pushing mechanisms that reveal exactly how such a reaction proceeds. ",
            "\u00a0This course did give me slightly more confidence in dealing with organic compounds and stereochemistry. It also taught me how to deal with exams that are so much more difficult than anything the professor provides in class and also feeling like you never know enough to complete anything. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of organic reactions and how to understand organic chemistry without having to memorize too much ",
            "\u00a0Orgo helped me think about chemistry in a new way. I feel more confident in understanding the underlying principles now that I have a foundation in orgo. ",
            "\u00a0Important basics for premed, good skills for mcat ",
            "\u00a0Orgo I is about learning principles of chemical reactions in carbon-based compounds. There is a ton of stereochemistry. Not so much theory and naming. A lot of reaction mechanisms. ",
            "\u00a0Gained a basic understanding of organic chemistry. Developed an intuition for organic mechanisms. "

            "\u00a0Professor Slavoff is absolutely the best instructor for organic chemistry. She systematizes the material and teaches it in small bits that make students realize that the subject is not as hard as it is sometimes characterized. Lectures were very informative and section gave a lot of practice problems to work with in order to really refine student's understanding of the material. Attendance was at times abysmal, so I would recommend making it somehow a portion of students' grades, perhaps through brief in class multiple choice quizzes. Going to section makes a huge difference in how well you do in the course overall, and that is a trend that becomes very obvious in the grade distribution for the exams. GO TO SECTION!!!!! ",
            "\u00a0This course is very fast paced, and it is very easy to fall behind. Once that happens, several classes can go by before a student is able to master the concepts presented early on  in the course. Because everything in this class builds on earlier concepts, falling behind at any point can hinder understandings several weeks' worth of material. ",
            "\u00a0The notes in class are generally well laid out and neat. However, they are nowhere near enough for either the homeworks or the exams and this was such an enormous source of stress. This course is also an endurance test. It never rewards your learning. You could understand the concepts in class completely and screw up the test. It doesn't matter whether or not the tests are curved, doing poorly having a class average in the 50s in an exam just doesn't feel good. The sapling psets were also ridiculous. The later ones in the semester could take up to 6/7 hours to do each (on top of the normal, written homework) and they were only worth 5% TOTAL. ",
            "\u00a0The course is taught clearly and in an unintimidatijg way. I thi k the layout of homework, tests, and sections could be a bit more efficient, though. Sometimes we'd have homework or section after a test that deals with material pertinent to that same test. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths = 4 exams, 1 drop, no cumulative final, weekly psets\r\n\r\nWeaknesses = class is spent so much on unnecessary details, would be better spent doing problems, psets should be graded for completion than accuracy ",
            "\u00a0Pretty standard orgo class. Perhaps more resources for summary/overview of reactions. ",
            "\u00a0This class is really suited to student learning in a way the big lecture is not. The class feels small and theres a chance for everyone to ask questions which is really helpful. \r\n\r\nProf slavoff was excellent. Clear explanations. Very patient and willing to listen to students questions. Created a class environment that really made students comfortable and everyones voices heard. \r\n\r\nHaving a 9:25 MWF up science was really difficult. \r\n\r\nI wish more time had been spent in class working through practice problems. During the last week, we went through review problems and it was really helpful in starting to think through problems the right way. I wish that had been more Incorporated into class. "

            "\u00a0Organic chemistry was absolutely my favorite course this semester (maybe ever) simply because all of it made sense. The material is very interesting and, if you view the class as more than a pre-med requirement, it can be a very enjoyable experience. It made me strongly consider a major in chemistry. ",
            "\u00a0To a student deciding between taking this course in the fall versus the spring, I would say that I've heard exams in the fall are easier and that the fall course does not come with the weekly homework sets. This may be an appealing choice for a very problem-set-heavy semester, though the benefit of having the weekly assignments was that students were forced to develop some understanding of the course concepts each week, rather than cramming everything until the week before an exam. The different set ups will work better for different students. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely not. If you need to take this course, you'll be in the class anyway. I personally recommend to take it on-cycle with Ellman instead of Slavoff. ",
            "\u00a0If youre interested in chemistry this course is definitely worth taking just to see what kind of reactions are out there. If youre willing to put in the effort the class becomes very rewarding and even enjoyable once you can understand whats going on ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I'd recommend this class with Sarah! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, orgo is an incredible subject. Unfortunately, Yale's chem dept is not the best, though sarah slavoff is one of the better profs. The plus side is that because it's such a common subject all over the country, there's many online resources to self teach the subject ",
            "\u00a0Yes, take it if you have to. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Espsrically over the large lecture. It gives you a chance to really engage with the material and ask questions.
