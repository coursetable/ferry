            "\u00a0As someone who came in to the course knowing how to write only 20 or so characters, I came out of Fall Semester knowing how to read and write over 500! Even though I was exposed to conversational Mandarin in my home, I learned so many new phrases and vocabulary. I also felt like I was more engaged with my culture and being able to share that with others was very important to me. The classroom environment was very positive and fostered a learning space that encouraged me to ask questions about things I didn't understand and gave me a lot of room to grow! ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write characters for the first time, I learned pinyin, and I learned how to read Chinese. Beyond that, I learned more about my heritage and Chinese culture. ",
            "\u00a0New vocabulary, literary skills, more confidence in speaking Chinese. ",
            "\u00a0Huge improvements in reading and writing chinese, as well as concrete knowledge on grammar ",
            "\u00a0I developed a deeper understanding for Chinese culture and increased fluency in Mandarin. ",
            "\u00a0As someone who didnt speak Chinese prior to coming to Yale, I learned a tremendous amount from this class. It is an incredibly useful class for someone who is of Chinese descent but doesnt have prior experience. "

            "\u00a0This class is super engaging and my teacher was constantly asking us to repeat phrases and vocabulary so we could get the pronunciation down. The oral presentation part of the course was also a strength because I loved the idea of learning from and about others in a language that we're all trying to master. ",
            "\u00a0The only weakness of this course was that a lot of the vocab we learned would not typically be used during regular day-to-day conversations. In other words, since the textbook's vocabulary was specialized at points, we learned obscure terms. The strengths of the course are too many to list. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: I loved my classmates and of course Chan laoshi. My love for the people makes the class more fun. I think the course is great. There was one week when we crammed two lessons into four days and that was pretty rough not gonna lie. Wish things were a little more spaced out there. ",
            "\u00a0The quizzes got a little repetitive and involved too much rote memorization. ",
            "\u00a0The small class size allowed the teacher to give attention to every student. The daily quizzes and oral presentations were really helpful. The only thing I would change is the structure of the daily quizzes. I think when we memorized the pinyin of the characters, I remembered the tones a lot better compared to when we switched over to quizzes that were just dictations from the text. ",
            "\u00a0This is a really well taught class! It moves at a very fast pace, but it allows you to learn a lot in a short period of time. The daily quizzes everyday add a lot of work, but they allow you to really learn all of the words fully. "

            "\u00a0Yes, I would! This course is great for people who have grown up speaking Chinese because there is a greater emphasis on reading and writing. It's also a great space to learn from your peers that may use different vocabulary or phrases -- all of which one can integrate into their own speech and writing! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this to another student if they were heritage like I am. I've learned an unbelievable amount and I feel more in touch with my roots. The professors are kind, understanding, and accommodating. On top of that, they are engaging in class and funny. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! I was afraid of this course at first because I didn't have confidence in my Chinese skills, but this is a good course for heritage learners who may or may not speak at home but can at least mostly understand conversational Chinese. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, great course with great students; developed a tight group of friends ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The heritage track allowed for the class to talk about Chinese traditions. I learned so much Mandarin in one semester, and although it was everyday, I thoroughly enjoyed going to class. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. The professor is excellent and is very enthusiastic about helping students, and going to office hours is very helpful. Participating in class improves both speaking and grammar skills. The class is well-organized, and the workload is divided into manageable portions every week. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Please take this class if you want to learn Chinese! Not only have I learned a lot of language/grammar/culture, but I have also met a lot of other Chinese American students that I have become very close with. "
