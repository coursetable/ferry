            "\u00a0I liked the idea of studying the same topics alternately between the U.S. and Latin America. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Provide basic knowledge for a wide range of economic-historical issues. ",
            "\u00a0In general, I thought the course was well done. Sometimes when I was reading papers it wasn't immediately clear what I should be expected to take away from them. A good example was the Morgan Henderson paper--I worked really hard to grind through it and understand the model, only for Naomi to say \"this paper was bad, I just wanted you to know they added and took away non-citizen voting rights.\" Obviously part of becoming a scholar is learning how to prioritize, but when working through a general research area that isn't my primary interest (and so thus I couldn't just use \"will I do research here?\" as a barometer) it would've been useful to have a bit of a clearer sense on what to focus on.
