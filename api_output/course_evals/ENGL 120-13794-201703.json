            "\u00a0You learn to become a better writer by learning to close read the writing of THE BEST essay writers (subjective of course, but the syllabus includes a wide variety of amazing writers who help you develop your own techniques) ",
            "\u00a0I definitely learned to make my writing a lot clearer. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to properly include details and other writing techniques in my essay. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how to read critically and analyze essays to find the strategies used by authors to get their point across and keep the audience engaged. I learned various methods for writing nonfiction essays in the style of personal essay, place essay, profile essay, cultural analysis, and humor. ",
            "\u00a0We were really able to target our specific problem areas across all five pieces. ",
            "\u00a0My skill in writing greatly developed. I learned a variety of techniques from not only the assigned readings, but also from my peers. ",
            "\u00a0I learned specific ways to improve my creative non-fiction writing. ",
            "\u00a0I believe that I learned a lot by reading the several different essays and discussing them in class. I really enjoyed the workshop process and I believe it helped me to improve my writing the most. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about myself as a writer and my voice. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: Most of the assigned essays were great reads. In class discussions were engaging and interesting. Essays that we wrote ourselves (place essay, personal essay, profile, cultural analysis, humor) were all fun to write in different ways. The thorough edits and suggestions I got on my essays were unlike anything I had ever seen in high school. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is the curriculum itself. The readings are wonderful, refreshing, and controversial. However, myself and other students constantly felt invalidated by our professor due to her belief that her opinion was the only correct one. At times, this made me unmotivated to work and hurt in and of itself. ",
            "\u00a0The professor was engaging and the assigned readings were interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the readings we did in class, and I learned a lot about different tools they used to make their writing clear and interesting. At times, there were almost too many different writing strategies that we discussed in class. I sometimes wished that we had focused more closely on a few strategies so I would know what to incorporate in my essays. The feedback that the professor gave on our essays was very helpful, as were the workshops. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were a very good foundation of writers to be reading from and a very in depth analysis of those readings and how they can apply to our own essays.\r\na weakness was the the class felt very repetitive. ",
            "\u00a0We write five essays, which is great because you can track your progress throughout the semester and see what sort of weaknesses you consistently have. We also read essays by some of the greatest writers out there. ",
            "\u00a0I believe the workshops were the biggest strength of the class. I wish that there was a little more variation in style from class to class, however. Every day we would analyze the essays in the same way. I enjoyed when there was some variation like breaking up into small groups. ",
            "\u00a0I think the readings were really great and helpful in moving the course along. \r\nI didn't like how the essays were structured and I thought it was weird to have the humor essay be the last piece. Especially in our section because we read them aloud it was awkward and stressful to have to read out our humor pieces more than I think it would've been for the other essays. "

            "\u00a0English 120 is a great course and Professor Newton is a great instructor. I'm more of a STEM person, and I still was able to find the class enjoyable and helpful. The grading is tough, but it's worth it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are interested in nonfiction essay and improving your writing, then I think this class is a great fit. It wasn't too demanding in its workload and the essays we wrote were quite short in length. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course. The reading was generally interesting and I enjoyed writing the essays. I also think my writing improved. ",
            "\u00a0120 is great if you really want to improve your writing. Everyone says it's unlikely that you'll get an A, and that's true, but it's worth it for the experience. The readings are really great to. It's also great for teaching to read for craft rather than content. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. I really enjoyed writing in a new way (ie. not necessarily reading the books and writing argumentative essays). It really put me in a different state of mind for English which I really enjoyed. Thank you. ",
