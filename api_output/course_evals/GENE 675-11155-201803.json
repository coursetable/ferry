Previously, it was suggested that it would be a great idea to invite some of the first or senior authors of the papers presented as way to get a better sense of the thinking behind a given experiment or the knowledge of the field at that time.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I see a potential if students are allowed to choose the person who are going to be reading with (e.g. a member of their qualifying committee) . For example, most students are qualifying during the development of the course and reading relevant papers in their respective areas. Thus, it would be good idea to allow the students to present a paper that they have read with one of the evaluating committee as it will give an opportunity for the students to consolidate the knowledge acquired during the reading period and also being able to explain that to their peers. ",
