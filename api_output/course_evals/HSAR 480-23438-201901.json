            "\u00a0Feminist theory from an art historic perspective ",
            "\u00a0This class focuses on women artists of Europe and the U.S., covering topics like the role of women in paintings of the Salon, modern avant-garde movements, botanical illustration, early photography, etc. In addition to looking at the art itself, the course thinks critically about issues such as how feminism interacts with art, what social and historical barriers women artists faced in entering art institutions, and what it means to revise the male-centric canon of art history. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot more about women artists and both the history and the art of women. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about women artists and different ways of addressing/thinking about the \"woman problem\" in art. I feel like I developed more insights on women artists throughout history, in different art forms and different positions, and how identity relates to art. ",
            "\u00a0The course improved my knowledge of Western women artists, covering the span of 1600-today. The class devoted a significant amount of time to Artemisia Gentileschi, French Rococo, early photography, and first-wave feminism; in my opinion the central debate was whether or not women artists' work could be essentialized. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about different women artists throughout time, feminist theory, and exhibitions of the work of women artists. I have a lot more insight about the obstacles the women artist faced throughout history, and about how to better discuss women artists. I learned about some of the issues in the ways art historians have historically studied women's art. Lastly, I gained skill in writing and analysis through a twenty page research paper about an artist of my choosing. "

            "\u00a0Weaknesses was the fact that there was little organization ",
            "\u00a0If youre interested in feminism and art, the readings for this class will appeal to you, and Professor Armstrong is definitely knowledgeable about the subject. The major weakness of this class, though, is the structure, since we were expected to bring in points from the readings every week; our discussions rarely went beyond these prepared points and students didn't really listen to or engage with one another. Other than one final project (presentation and 20-25 page paper on one woman artist), it was unclear what we were being graded on. As there were about 18 students in the seminar when I took it, I think the class would have had more fruitful discussions if there were fewer people. ",
            "\u00a0Perhaps, too many readings per session? So it was difficult to personally digest one reading over the other. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of the readings were very interesting, and it was great to be able to focus on one topic for basically the whole semester. The topic of the \"woman artist\" is very interesting, but also very involved, and I felt like we only scratched the surface. I feel like the scope of the course is so large, and maybe would work better if it focused on a specific time period. ",
            "\u00a0One strength of the course was its wide timeline and chronological order. I think Women Artists would have been much more effective with three changes. First, the page count per week (normally 150-200) could be reduced, allowing us to gain an in-depth knowledge of and engage more critically with the readings. Second, the number of assignments could be increased: the only explicitly graded assignments were a 20-page final paper and a 20-minute presentation, on the subject of the final paper. Further, we only received oral feedback after the presentation, never a number/letter grade. This made it difficult to gauge where we were in the class, and what we needed to improve. Finally, it would have been beneficial to see a complete syllabus, with the readings and deadlines specified, at the beginning of the semesterrather than having to search through emails to prepare for each class. ",
            "\u00a0I think learning about women artists is very important for Art History students, and other students who want to better understand the discipline or the obstacles women have faced. The readings were well chosen, and Professor Armstrong led discussions well. The class felt relaxed, and I enjoyed hearing other students present on female artists. "

            "\u00a0For a non art history student- it was rather informative but also dry ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course for anyone interested in art/art history, since women artists shouldn't only be interesting to women, and the course raises a lot of important questions about art that are relevant to everyone. ",
            "\u00a0I wouldn't recommend this course as it exists currently to another student. Though the art history curriculum needs to cover more women artists more frequently, the organization of the course prevented me from gaining the insights I wished I would. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It was a relaxed seminar with a very bright professor. The material is important, and I learned a lot not only about Art History, but about feminism. "
