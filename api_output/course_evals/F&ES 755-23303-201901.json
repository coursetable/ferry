Also, the quality of my work (and the depth of my learning) definitely benefited from the fact that Prof. Tomlin wanted our HW submissions to demonstrate a better-than-superficial understanding of the appropriate context in which to apply each tool and the significance of its output.

            "\u00a0Strengths: pedagogical approach that emphasized connecting what we learned/talked about in class with other experiences and ideas\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I loved the breadth of the course, but I felt the connections/overlaps/contradictions among all of the perspectives was missing. I would have appreciated the last lecture or discussion to be some sort of mapping exercise in which we made those connections more visually explicit. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course was great, it was a lot of work as I had expected (about 10/hrs a week) but that time is really necessary for understanding how to use ArcGIS and understanding why you are doing things the way they are done. I would have liked to learn a bit more about using python with ArcGIS in class, but Dana provides very thorough handouts on all things GIS related. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: Yale has the ability to have EVERY student in a computer lab to learn this material - ONE step at a time. Instead, we have a theoretical lecture on these operations, when they have been created into a programming system, so that they can be used pragmatically. For the students who will WORK for hours on end to figure out the professor's puzzles - they have no lives. For those of us with lives, this course added nothing for me. It's a shame. If I wanted to work on a puzzle, I'd open up a newspaper and work on a puzzle. These assignments were not practical. We needed to have a setting where we are having lecture and then having a lab on GIS. There are people who are YOUNGER and live NEARBY who have the qualifications to teach this course in such a setting. I'm just confounded how antiquated this course is taught. ",
            "\u00a0I think this is a great course to learn GIS. I took two GIS courses in undergrad and learned absolutely nothing. Dana is patient and really explains the material well. Also, for people (like me) who need to learn by doing, his worksheets are a god sent. The one thing that didn't really resonate with me was the slightly competitive nature of the class (which was really just through grading), but I think F&ES students are cooperative enough that this was not really an issue. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths start with Dana Tomlin, the professor and Bhartendu Pandey the PhD student and TA. They keep you from settling on something that can seem rote and strictly algorithmic in the progressively more difficult assignments.  Weaknesses are the ramping up intensity and challenge. It can be a lot to manage, but that is the nature of FES. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are Dana's interesting and engaging teaching styles and the help from Piazza, the TF, and other classmates in solving homework problems. I think sometimes the homework assignments didn't seem to line up with the skills we learned in class and also sometimes were a much greater challenge and time commitment than I think was appropriate. I also think there could more formal structures for receiving feedback on homework assignments, such as a mid-semester feedback document given to each student that discusses things that they could improve upon for the future. ",
            "\u00a0The only thing I'm not satisfied is the poor course recordings. ",
            "\u00a0I think the weekly assignments could be slightly more guided. For example, perhaps weekly group office hour sessions where students work on their projects and ask open questions to the TA. This will allow students to get an idea of how others are approaching the task, as well as the common stumbling blocks people face. Alternatively, this session could be to cover the ideal solution to the past week's homework, so that students who struggled can catch up and avoid falling behind on those skills, especially since the tasks tend to be cumulative in their expectations of the skills to be employed. More feedback could be given to the homework tasks to allow students to grow from week to week. ",
            "\u00a0strength: sometimes we don't always have to go arcpy since some operation on raster data can be done with a few clicks in Arcmap. This class made me more comfortable using GIS. The most strongest feature of this class is that we have Prof. Dana Tomlin.\r\n\r\nweakness: For most of the weekly homework there were some explicit criteria of grading, which sometimes limited my creativity as I knew that there would always be a \"one answer\" to the question. ",
            "\u00a0I wish that we were given more direction about how our assignments would be graded and what the proper steps were to achieve a good grade -- not from a current student in the class. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were sometimes hard to follow. Too many metaphors. More practical demonstrations could be useful. \r\n\r\nHowever, I appreciated that Prof. Tomlin prioritized us fully understanding the functions we were using rather than just showing us how to use them. ",
            "\u00a0This course is amazing. Dana is up front with how demanding it will be time wise, but the amount of learning that happens is remarkable. I really appreciated the readings; they helped augment our more hands-on learning with a higher level cerebral approach. ",
            "\u00a0The subject matter and the lectures were excellent. The biggest weakness is that you need way more TAs. Could get a lot more done if you could have more office hours. ",
            "\u00a0The weekly homeworks are a strength and the TA (Bhartendu) was very kind and eager to help. I think more personalized feedback would have been more helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that Dana created Map Algebra and he's an expert in GIS. Thus, you can ask him anything about the software and its uses. The weaknesses are that since Dana is an expert and so well-versed in spatial analysis, he has a hard time transferring the knowledge from his brain to a brain that is untrained or unfamiliar with GIS. Although this course doesn't require any prior knowledge of GIS, I was definitely very lost for the first several weeks. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths\r\n1. Great faculty and TAs\r\n2. Piazza was very useful in terms of getting help efficiently\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n1. I think Yale students should be graded differently from Penn.\r\n2. The assignments tend to be complex and consume so much time to complete. They could be simplified eg by focusing on specific tools/ products ",
            "\u00a0The pedagogy was exceptional. Each week we were able to build on previous weeks. Many time the lessons were fairly short but had significant implications for a broad array of applications. The weekly assignments forced us to explore those applications and master them through trial and error and creative approaches. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: challenging problem sets, engaging lectures, extremely knowledgeable instructor\r\nWeaknesses: would it be possible to hold this class in a computer lab? ",
            "\u00a0I appreciate Dana's teaching approach of giving us the basics and then throwing us in the deep end to do creative problem solving. But it was really, really hard. I don't think that walking through more examples would be too much hand holding; I think it would make learning more effective. The class definitely had an impact on my mental health, and I don't think it has to be that way. The saving grace of the course is Bhartendu, the TA, who is incredible. But all the burden of rescuing bewildered students should not fall on him. ",
            "\u00a0Although the course structure is very clear, I would suggest that the class \"library\" be structured differently\", because trying to browse around different document or guides to find a particular item may result in a very frustrating task\r\nThe way in which the feeback of the course is given can also be improved. I would suggest, at the beginning of each class, solving the problem of the previous class in order to reinforce the knowledge of the tools acquired through the homework ",
            "\u00a0The strength is the professor; everything else I could list is just a by-product of his being the instructor. For example: thoroughness of explanatory handouts he provides; his freakish (?!) eloquence when speaking and writing (seriously, his sentences could come straight out of a perfectly edited book), and the clarity it affords his explanations; the fairness of the grading system and Prof. Tomlin's willingness to listen to dissent; the impressive dedication of the professor (and his TAs) to answering students' questions as soon as possible (particularly on Piazza); the break he always gave us halfway through the three-hour class (!); and lots of others. \r\nI can't really think of a weakness... Maybe just that Prof. Tomlin also works at UPenn and can therefore only come to Yale once a week. It makes for a long weekly class and also means he's not on campus for us to visit/pester. It's not the end of the world, though  I'm happy if we just take what we can get! "

            "\u00a0If you like to spend days on an assignment, receive poetic and cryptic answers to questions, learn about the theory of GIS operations, figure out which piece of food is different from other woods, by all means - TAKE THIS COURSE. If you want to learn GIS, download ArcGIS, go to Youtube, and learn from a tutorial. It's a waste of time to take it at Yale. ",

It's a good idea to become friends with the people who have had prior experience and be sure to work with them on homework assignments. Completing one of these assignments alone is very frustrating and challenging. ",

The knowledge is focused in the realm of raster GIS but the skills for creative thinking and problem solving will be valuable for all aspects of life moving forward. ",
            "\u00a0The class will tax you in a way that no other FES class does, and may really impact your mental health. Be aware of this and decide whether it's really worth your while. You will learn how to do stuff in GIS, but you will also have to figure out a lot on your own that should probably be taught in the class. The saving grace of the class is Bhartendu, the TA, who is incredible. Definitely work with him, work with others, and be willing to walk away from a problem set if you have to. ",

Beware, however, of the time that you'll need to spend in the homeworks. Definitely make good use of the office hours ",
            "\u00a0I'm not going to lie, this course won't be much fun if you're uninterested in spatial analysis and have no motivation to learn it. But if you are/do, or if you even just want to GET interested in it, then this course is probably worth your while. Granted, that \"while\" is kind of substantial  almost all students in this class (myself included) spent more hours per week on these assignments than we would've liked. But the simple fact is that you get out of this course what you put into it, so the time you spend on the assignment every week is by no means wasted time. (Unless, of course, you're wasting time.) In other words, the amount of work you'll do for this course isn't trivial, but if you want or need to learn raster GIS, then it'll almost definitely be worth your while. "
