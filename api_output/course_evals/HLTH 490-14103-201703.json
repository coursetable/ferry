            "\u00a0In this course, I went through the full process of writing a manuscript ready for submission to a peer-reviewed journal in public health. This course was a key piece to me in getting my summer work translatable to an academic audience. ",
            "\u00a0This course was enormously helpful for me. I learned *so* much from Kristina and my classmates about designing a research project, conducting quantitative analysis, giving a presentation, and writing a manuscript. Honestly, would not have been able to formulate my project, analyze my data, have a direction for my manuscript, and write a manuscript for submission without this class. The guidance and mentorship I received here has really been invaluable. ",
            "\u00a0This class gave me the opportunity to write a full manuscript draft to submit for publishing, with incredibly valuable feedback from a professor and classmates. I learned how to write a full paper, how to organize my thoughts, and how to manage my time to complete such a project. This was definitely one of, if not the, most valuable learning experiences I have had at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0HLTH 490 is primarily designed to allow students to synthesize manuscripts for publication from their summer research experiences. Since students come in with a range of research methods and questions, the course is tailored to allow students to work independently and still have time to come together to reflect on each others' research and provide advice. Prof. Talbert-Slagle helped me think critically about the central thesis of my research and work through the presentation of my data. From this course, I gained a deeper practical understanding of research ethics and the intricacies of publication. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write a public health manuscript from scratch. If you enjoyed your overall experience of summer research fieldwork + this course, then you might be a good fit for public health academia! ",
            "\u00a0I learned an incredible amount from this course. Although I am not a global health scholar, the summer research that I worked on was with two other undergraduates who are global health scholars. I knew little about synthesizing data, especially the vast amount that we had, and this class was the perfect balance of independent work and in-class support in order to really engage with that process. I gained much insight into the publishing process from Professor Talbert-Slagle, who had a lot of firsthand experience to share that was incredibly helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I felt so much ownership over my colloquium project. I learned how to write a complete manuscript based on a study, from the title page to the end. I learned how to structure/frame a research question based on the data we collected, how to identify a gap in the literature that can be addressed by our research. I learned how to conduct quantitative (e.g. logistic regression, etc.) AND qualitative data analysis, and how to weave it together into a mixed methods paper. I also learned how to present and speak about my research in a clear way in a short amount of time, along the way, the instructor gave so much helpful advice about how to frame my workwhether in writing or in speakingthat I will carry with me for the rest of my career. This class pushed me to submit an abstract to the American Academy of Health Behavior, where my work was accepted for a poster presentation. The instructor and class made me believe that my work was important to share with the world, and gave me every tool I needed to get it out there. "

            "\u00a0I don't see many weaknesses in the course at all. I think I reflect all of our sentiments in saying that not only the hard deadlines, but also the peer review and instructor feedback really pushed us to think hard about our results and get good papers together on time. I'm incredibly thankful for that as well, because as a GH Scholar I feel like if I had not had dedicated class time and peer/instructor mentorship, then I would not have gotten my summer work together into a manuscript like I had wanted. ",
            "\u00a0This course was extremely adaptable to student needs, which I think was aided by the fact that we were all pretty self motivated to get our manuscripts published and we were a small group (of 9). We were able to receive one-on-one attention and mentorship from Kristina and others that she put us in contact with. Furthermore, I was very impressed with my classmates. I felt like I got to know their projects pretty well and was able to provide constructive feedback and vice versa. Only weakness that I can think of is that 80% of our final grade was determined by the final presentation + final paper, but I guess that's inevitable for a class like this. ",
            "\u00a0This class was great. It allowed one to be independent while receiving a huge amount of support from peers and professors. I really have no weaknesses to speak of. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths \r\n- Students are allowed a great degree of independence and freedom in developing their manuscripts since each student has a different research paper. \r\n- Dr. Talbert-Slagle is an invaluable resource and will help connect students with other professors or researchers when she is not well-versed in the question at hand. \r\n- Student leave the course with a product they can truly submit for publication. \r\n- Dr. Talbert-Slagle gives AMAZING detailed feedback!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses \r\n- I wish there were more consistent official deadlines because it can be difficult to manage one's own deadlines when other schoolwork gets intense. ",
            "\u00a0This course is undoubtedly one of the best in the entire Global Health Studies program. You get to integrate the skills you learned in previous core courses such as epidemiology and research methods/ethics. It's so satisfying to see your work culminate in an actual, substantial product. The workload is sporadic-ish because we each set our own schedule/timeline for completing portions of our project. This independence in pacing was great! Prof KTS was also very understanding when we adjusted our own timeline (given sufficient reason and a backup plan).\r\nThat said, be aware that the course is solely research-focused. We had minimal discussion of research/policy crossover implications. This means the course is not a perfect fit for ~every~ GH scholar or everyone interested in GH. (If you're interested in policy/advocacy, take the spring semester course in global health grand strategy.) Going forward in GH Studies, this course should be incorporated as the final course within a research track, while the spring semester senior course could be the endpoint in a implementation/policy track. ",
            "\u00a0This course was designed to guide us through the process of writing a manuscript draft from start to finish, and it did just that. While structured with a few deadlines, it was really tailored to our needs and I really appreciated the flexibility and feedback offered. I loved learning from Professor Talbert-Slagle, as well as my peers working through the same process, and felt that the flexible nature of the course, while having an end goal in mind, was exactly what I was looking for. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are the mentorship you get from Kristina, going through the process of developing a paper and finishing it with the rest of the class, and having set deadlines that help move the project along. I think the class would benefit from a little more organization next year, perhaps in the syllabus and in when things are due/when presentations are. "

            "\u00a0I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this course to another student. To me, it's one of the most important courses int the GH Scholars curriculum. It helps us translate our seemingly illegible data into a narrative that makes broader sense. If you have the sense that you want to do any sort of public health research, or you have public health data to work with, absolutely take this course! ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! But probably only if you are looking to publish a manuscript. The whole class is geared towards that, so it would probably be most helpful if you have a project (quant or qual) that you can analyze and write up a manuscript for. Otherwise, you would probably learn some helpful skills, but not sure the class would be well suited. ",
            "\u00a0I could not recommend this course more. It has been a highlight of my time at Yale. Without it I would not have the manuscript I have today as a product of my summer research. If a person has conducted some sort of health research, or has access to data that they would like to analyze, this course is an incredible way to do so. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to any Global Health Scholar who did summer research or anyone who would like a structured time to really write up their research into a manuscript for potential publication! Since students come in with a range of research methods and questions, the course is tailored to allow students to work independently and still have time to come together to reflect on each others' research and provide advice. \r\n\r\nDr. Talbert-Slagle is an invaluable resource and will help connect students with other professors or researchers when she is not well-versed in the question at hand. She takes the time to give AMAZING detailed feedback!\r\n\r\nOne caveat: If you are not good at making deadlines for yourself and sticking with them, be sure to have a game plan to address that! Because of the independence Dr. Talbert-Slagle grants to students in the course, sometimes it can feel that the final presentation deadline or the manuscript deadline come quicker that you think! ",
            "\u00a0A must-take if and only if 1) you're interested in public health research and 2) you've completed all the data- gathering portion of a public health project. \r\n\r\nDo not take it if you don't like research! ",
            "\u00a0This research project was one of the most rewarding experiences I have had at Yale and I am so grateful I had the opportunity to write a manuscript in a structured, supportive environment. ",
            "\u00a0If you are looking for a way to synthesize your research and really get a product out of it, this is the way to go. The work could be a lot at times, but you get out as much as you put into it, and it was an incredible learning experience. I felt like I learned and did so much in just the span of a semester, and am so happy I took this class. Because it was so small, also, it was a great opportunity to closely engage with people doing similar things in public and global health and learn about their projects. ",
            "\u00a0YES! This class will help take you through the process of writing a manuscript based on your summer research. It is INCREDIBLY helpful in getting you to a finished product by the end of the semester. I couldnt have done it without this class. You'll learn so much along the way. This has been the best course I've taken at Yale. "
