            "\u00a0We started off with classical theories on dreams which constituted the start point of western philosophy and leaped into Freud, Jung who are the major pillars for the topic. From their witty arguments we started to develop certain senses about the content, material and characters of dream and unconscious. ",
            "\u00a0I learned psychological thinking about dreams, and this class is an inspiration for me that opens up a new field of subject which sounds worth studying. ",
            "\u00a0Discussions and brain storming skills.\r\nDeep analyzing skills for even the most simple things.\r\nHuge amount of knowledge about psychology and philosophy. ",

            "\u00a0The strengths would be the highly interacting and provoking environment offered by the professor and classmates, multiple media learning method and detailed instructions provided by TA and Professor.\r\n\r\nYet due to the limited time length, readings are a little bit overwhelming and not fully explained or discussed in class. ",
            "\u00a0This class is more like a seminar which is very good. But the workload is a bit high because sometimes we couldnt finish what we are supposed to finish in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Plenty of sources to read from and discuss.\r\nCovers vast range of topics that are related to dreams. ",
            "\u00a0The reading assignments are all squished together and can be a huge workload. It is understandable as this is a summer course. The class is awesome in general. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Content is very interesting and is approached from both a psychological perspective and a philosophical perspective. Small class, very good for letting students discuss and share their thoughts equally. ",
