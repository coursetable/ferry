The class also goes through most of the foundations of math in a more abstract way, much deeper than anything you likely did previously, and gives a stronger understanding of what linear algebra and calculus actually are.

            "\u00a0In class, we basically covered the first half of real analysis and the first half of linear algebra. On the problem sets, we went a bit beyond that into other interesting and challenging topics in mathematics. On the whole, it was a complete immersion into the world of writing mathematical proofs: I grew enormously in my ability to get to the heart of a math problem and write a clear, rigorous proof of my answer. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about fields, linear transformations, point-set topology, derivatives in higher dimensions, analysis, continuity, and limits of functions, and linear algebra. I also gained a lot of proof-writing skills and practice, as well as skills in mathematical logic. ",

            "\u00a0This course teaches you how to reason mathematically. It improves your proof-writing skills and develops mathematical maturity. (Proofs are a large component of the course). As you learn more about linear algebra and calculus, you also become familiar with ideas in number theory, logic, set theory, and abstract algebra. The course teaches mathematics in a very unified and cohesive way: the bigger picture in all its depth and variety, is certainly Prof. Devlin's goal. It's not just about any one specific topic that we learned, but rather the way that they all related. You uncover, in this course, the true beauty of mathematics in all of its complexity. More concretely, in the course, calculus is developed from the axioms of analysis, and much of the initial phase of the course involved developing fundamental theorems in real analysis and topology. We then pivoted to systems of equations, Gaussian elimination, determinants, and eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The course was excellently planned and quite expansive, as mentioned above. While you will certainly learn linear algebra and vector calculus, you will also understand the relevant ideas in a deeper sense. Through our studies in linear algebra, for example, we also learned about isomorphisms, group homomorphisms, and equivalence classes. In calculus, we proved fundamental results from topology. 230 focuses more on the linear algebra side of things, in the end. ",

I came in with almost no experience with writing proofs, but after this class I feel much more confident in my proof writing abilities and my problem solving skills as a whole. The course also really opened my eyes to what math *really* is -- Pat really does a good job of linking all the topics in analysis and linear algebra together even though they may seem like separate things. The psets take a while but I found myself really trying to think through all the problems for the sake of the math, not the deadline. ",

This class is really good at connecting many ideas from different fields of math together and teaching it in a fairly abstract manner. ",

",

I learned that assumptions are dangerous, that rigor in proofs greatly improves understanding, and that connecting concepts allows one to solve massive questions. ",

This will show you if you actually like mathematics. ",

The enthusiasm of the instructor had him add an inordinate amount of problems to the PSETs because he found them interesting. The students in this class certainly love maths, but they do have other commitments and interests as well, and the PSET length could at times be a hinderance. It was also somewhat concerning that crucial and important concepts were introduced on the PSETs, having never been mentioned in class ",

            "\u00a0This course has been amazingly engaging and fun! It is extremely challenging, but that's part of the experience. It's not always the most well-organized, but Pat makes the class a lot of fun and a very supportive environment. ",
            "\u00a0This course is awesome! The only slight weakness is the the content can be little unstructured and haphazard at times, you might need to draw the links and connections yourself. ",
            "\u00a0The course ends up getting very abstract and you rarely do any actual computation, which can be fairly jarring compared to most high school level math courses. Beyond that, the problem sets are supposed to take about 20 hours a week, and while I didn't spend that much, some of the problem sets could run up to 15 hours or so, and if you don't plan around that, you can end up with some grueling nights before they're due. Plus some of the problems are so difficult to that point that they're almost to do yourself, and you occasionally end up seeking out help for a decent part of the pset. While the psets are very difficult, the exams are relatively easy compared to it, and Pat makes sure that the hours you spent doing the homework actually translate into the test. The average exams grades were pretty high in the A/A- range, making the effort you put in seem more rewarding. The best part of this course is probably Pat; he spends a lot of time in the math lounge for helping students, and at several points has stayed until 3 am to provide help. While he makes the class hard he really isn't out to get you and is a pretty chill guy. ",
            "\u00a0I think the problem sets were a strength in that they helped me learn to write proofs and apply knowledge I learned in class. I also think the strong community developed in this course was very important. I think it could be improved by including more examples of full, detailed proofs in class, and by adding more emphasis to the important theorems learned by briefly providing examples of their applications. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The curriculum was very well organized and delivered. The availability of the instructor and the TAs to answer questions outside of class was phenomenal. Weaknesses: The problem sets were sometimes exceedingly long. There seems little point in requiring 20+ hours of homework for a college class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: you learn an absurd amount in this class. But the thing is that Pat makes it all so easy--he's a fantastic teacher and the psets, lectures, and content are structured in a way that makes sense and builds on everything. Another strength is the people in the class, who are legitimately so intelligent and who you get to know through the psets. Finally, the math you learn is just so cool--it's a completely different way of looking at what you've been doing for years. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: it's a huge time commitment, and there's a learning curve at first as you get used to writing proofs. But you definitely get used to it over time, and the beginning psets are definitely easier to compensate! ",
            "\u00a0It was an excellent course. I think, given the rigor of the homework, that it should be weighted more heavily, but the course was both good and fair, and the instructor was great. ",
            "\u00a0The course approaches mathematics, philosophically speaking, from a constructive, rigorous approach. We \"build the logical pyramid,\" so to speak, as we go through the course. The results we prove on earlier problem sets become crucial tools for the proofs we are asked to show, on subsequent ones. This method is a strength of the course: it is leads to transparency and accessibility. You can see precisely how the ideas we've been studying relate to one another. Almost all of the results we've needed are proven either in class, in the course textbook, or assigned on problem sets. Another strength is that, oftentimes, the proofs we complete are corroborated by using different methods. Seeing different ways of proving the same result makes you a stronger mathematician. ",
            "\u00a0It's strength was Patrick Devlin. The only weakness was that it might not be taught by Prof. Devlin. ",
            "\u00a0I have really enjoyed the class--especially the exposure that it provides to several mathematical concepts. One weakness that sticks out is the problem set structure. I'm not sure quite what I mean, because the psets feel necessary and beneficial, but somehow they are off. Sorry this is not useful. ",
            "\u00a0This class is really well organized for everyone to do well if they put in the effort. There are really helpful peer tutors who hold office hours and recitations every week, so if you're stuck on problems you can always ask them for guidance. And of course, Pat is also VERY helpful and encouraging and really wants his students to do well in his class. He teaches at the perfect pace so it doesn't feel too fast even for people coming in with very little proof experience (like I did). ",
            "\u00a0Strong sense of community, very welcoming, TAs were very helpful, Professor very approachable, material was challenging but doable. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is that you really are fully immersed in the world of mathematical proofs from the very beginning. Though a bit intimidating, there is a steep learning curve, and by the end of the course, you gain a thorough mastery of proofs. \r\nOn the other hand, the course does require quite a lot of time and work. The p-sets are often quite time consuming, and may require some late nights spent at the math lounge. And although they do not account for much of the final grade, success in the course depends on the assumption that you have given thorough effort on the p-sets and understand them. ",
            "\u00a0The course is strong. ",
            "\u00a0The course presented lots of resources and opportunities for collaboration, which was very helpful. The class was engaging and placed emphasis on the awesomeness of math and why we are learning linear algebra, and the problem sets were challenging and instructive. However, I feel that the course ultimately moved too slowly and could have moved faster. ",
            "\u00a0The problem sets in this course were incredibly well designed. I felt that they really helped me explore and reform my understanding of mathematics. I also felt that the way material was presented felt well designed. The order of subject matter felt appropriately consecutive, and built on itself nicely. Honestly, I can't think of anything that I would really improve. ",
            "\u00a0The instructor was very responsive to feedback and engaging. He made available the requisite resources we needed to achieve success in the course. This included things like lecture notes on canvas, sample solutions, the peer tutors were great and very available and helpful.\r\n\r\nA relative weakness of the course was, for someone with not a super strong background in math coming into the course, it was often hard to place where new pieces of knowledge fall under. A day spent early on in the semester to situate/give a general overview of the course and what FUNCTIONS different topics of instruction serve would've been helpful. ",
            "\u00a0By far the biggest strength of this class is Pat Devlin. He has worked very hard to create an educational environment which is both intellectually stimulating and inclusive to all. He put in a ton of extra time to ensure that we as students had the resources that we needed to learn what he wanted us to understand, and the level of support from the instructor, graduate teaching fellow, and peer tutors in unmatched in any course I've ever taken. I've walked into the math lounge quite literally at 2:30 AM and one, if not all, of the above people have been there to help me on homework or understand the course material.\r\n\r\nThe only weaknesses I can think of for the course are: 1) the lectures can appear somewhat disorganized, but there is a lot of method in the madness; because the course covers such a wide field of mathematics, it isn't always clear why the things you are learning now are relevant until (sometimes months) later, but there is always a reason for learning what is taught; the downside to this is that you may need to code-switch a bit between topology and analysis and linear algebra, and so it's hard to go into this course with the same mindset as you would a more specific course, where you know exactly what the material is and how it all fits together. 2) Sometimes the reviews for the classes can seem lacking. There has only been one review per exam, which feels like not enough, especially considering how much content there is in this class. I would appreciate if there were multiple review sessions, each devoted to more specific topics, like I've seen in some of the chemistry review sessions, rather than a single monolithic review session which doesn't really do the course justice. Additionally, more review materials would have been nice, especially going into the final. Finally, the fact that the class is not graded on a curve is a double edged sword; while it does wonders in promoting a collaborative environment, it makes the tests very stressful. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes the problem sets can be a bit excessive - seven parts to a problem are rarely necessary to elucidate some mathematical concept. ",
            "\u00a0Pat was really enthusiastic about math, which I highly appreciated. However, some things were a little irritating. Pat sometimes said that he would do something (e.g. post midterm practice problems) and changed his mind without telling us (these problems would really be helpful). It would be helpful if the sample solutions to problem set problems were posted (Pat started doing so yet stopped in late October). I wasn't sure how to do some of the problems, and I really wish I could have looked at the solutions. ",
            "\u00a0The problem sets will kill you, and to fully understand the material on the problem sets without having taken a course structured similarly to 230 before, a good 10-15+ hours will be spent per week. But, these are only worth 20% of your grade; it would be better if the problem sets were weighted more. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include very engaging problem sets and a willingness to adapt by the professor. While not necessarily a weakness, a concern is that topics frequently deviate from linear algebra and vector calculus, and a more thorough knowledge past the problem sets and class lectures are required on some questions on the exams. ",
            "\u00a0This course teaches a variety of math concepts and its pace keeps the course interesting without being overwhelming. The problem sets teach a lot of concepts and they reach whatever the in-class lectures do not. The class teaches a lot about what math really is and helps the student discover whether they do or do not want to go further into math in the future. There aren't really the many bad things about the class other than the heavy workload, but for me at least, this work was a break from the other work that I had to do, and I made some good friends trying to finish problem sets the nights/mornings before they were due. ",
            "\u00a0Pat is fantastic. He creates a really encouraging and supportive learning environment. ",
            "\u00a0This course is incredibly challenging but most definitely worth it. The psets are a little much but you will leave the class feeling as though you learned a lot about math. ",
            "\u00a0The material covered in the course was interesting and engaging, for the most part. The p-set were enjoyable and an appropriate amount of work. The class was a good length and very well taught. If I were to look for a problem, I would say the topics were sometimes repetitive. However, the teacher helped resolve that by interlacing random interesting topics. The peer tutoring, while I didn't always use it, was a welcome resource, and the tutors were very nice and helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the level of discovery in the weekly problem sets, but I felt like it could have been connected a little more to in-class curriculum. ",
            "\u00a0The long problem sets are integral to the course - they facilitated much of the learning. One very good thing about this course in the fall is that it meets MWF! I know the T TH schedule for 231 will hurt the course! It is very helpful to meet 3 times a week and have shorter classes with time to work on the problem sets in between! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- a really good support system to help with the admittedly challenging p-sets. Also, the rigor of the course means that now I can be confident moving forward that I know how to apply what I've learned in this class.\r\nWeaknesses- not so much a weakness as an acknowledged problem, but this class is quite academically rigorous and mentally demanding, and certainly a big jump from high school ",
            "\u00a0The community this course creates is a huge strength to this course.\r\n\r\nA weakness lies within this community, there seems to be a small group of students who have definitely seen much more math than the rest of the students; engaging these students with additional content of something of the like could help them become more a part of the rest of the community. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing course. Amazing professor. ",

            "\u00a0I think problem sets could be targeted more towards the material we are learning in class. I also think that problem sets could be weighted more considering I spent much much more time working on problem sets than studying for tests. ",
            "\u00a0Class time was kind of disorganized, and sometimes it was hard to tell where the problem sets were leading. However, I felt like I learned to think in a different way. This class will not however teach you how to solve applied problems in multi variable calculus and linear algebra. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this class are that it challenges students to approach math differently than they ever have before, rely on intuition while also being provided with a lot of information, and learn more about what it means to be a mathematician. A weakness is that the high workload can sometimes detract from the learning process, and it tends to favor certain types of math students over others. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very interesting, but extremely intense. I don't know that it could be improved that much, because the professor and the TAs work very hard to keep people afloat. The only thing that I though could really be improved was the pace at the beginning, because I know a lot of people were struggling to stay afloat at the start of the class. "

The psets are essentially what your week is built around and you will definitely have to plan for it (unless you're ready to throw away your sleep on a regular basis). By the end, if you enjoy math, the psets won't feel like a complete pain, and you might even realize you want to major in math, if you weren't already. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student who has an interest in math and is not taking other very hard courses. This class was extremely interesting and helpful to me because of my interest in math, but I would not have been able to manage the workload if I were taking another class with a similar workload. ",
            "\u00a0Math 230 with Pat is a truly wonderful experience, rewarding in countless ways. Just know that you will likely spend 20+ hours per week working on the problem sets if you do every question thoroughly. Putting in this extraordinary amount of time is very rewarding when you see how much you grow, but your life outside of Math 230 may suffer. That being said, there is tentative discussion brewing that the workload for future iterations of Math 230 could be somewhat reduced as soon as next year. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! But only if they're willing to commit the energy to it and have adequate preparation. 230 is a huge commitment to take on first semester of your first year, but it was entirely worth it for me. The integrated nature of the course material and the depth that you go in make the work so, so worth it. Looking back, I feel like I've learned and grown so much just by being in the class. Also, having to do the psets every week definitely helped my time management skills, so that's a plus, too! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. It is a challenging course, but well worth it. It is both rewarding and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely, but only if you're willing and interested to work hard in it. The problem sets are time-consuming (many hours) and you have to be prepared to put that amount of time into the course. You will be rewarded for it. You will become a better mathematician and you will learn to appreciate math more than you did prior to taking the course. You build fundamental insights about the nature of mathematical reasoning, and by doing more math and doing it intensively you just become better at it. (This is true about almost anything in life, of course.) If you are at all open to the possibility of working hard in a challenging course and becoming a better person as a result of your hard work, then definitely take this course. It's a really fun time, if you enjoy (or are prepared to learn to enjoy) mathematics. The class is a community and a (one of many) gateway to studying higher level mathematics at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the enthusiasm which the professor has with the course along with he enormous amount of learning that the professor had in store for us is an amazing opportunity for first years which should not be passed up. ",
            "\u00a0YES. PLEASE TAKE THIS COURSE. I learned so much in this class about topics that I was always curious about but never had the chance to learn formally (things like open/closed sets, sequences, and linear algebra). Even if you have little to no proof writing experience but are curious about math, this class is perfect for you because your proof writing abilities will improve so much no matter where you start. The psets take 15-20 hours per week, which is definitely a lot, but you get a really good support system through your classmates, peer tutors, and Pat. Please don't feel intimidated by the workload -- it's so worth it and you'll learn so much. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are willing to put in the time. The course is a lot of fun and the professor is great, but it is also a lot of work. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. If you like math at all, then yes. It's tough, but it's tough with friends, so it's not that tough after all. ",
            "\u00a0Yes.\r\n\r\nProvides a a solid understanding of the foundations of linear algebra. ",
            "\u00a0I would not unless they are pretty sure they want to be a pure math major. It was so much work for not very much pay off in my opinion. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student who is very passionate about math and is interested in learning more about the world of mathematical proofs. However, I would not recommend this to a student who is simply looking to learn more about vector calculus or linear algebra; I would instead recommend something like 120 for vector calculus or 222/225 for linear algebra. ",
            "\u00a0Only to students who are incredibly passionate about math. Anyone else would be miserable. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. Its a challenge to be sure, but worth it if you have the time. ",
            "\u00a0Yea, if you don't mind getting toasted. ",
            "\u00a0I recommend taking this class! It pushes you to think harder and is set up really well, and linear algebra is also super important. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only if they're willing to put in the work. This course had a very high workload and I absolutely loved it and felt it was important. However, if I wasn't willing to put in the work, this course would feel super overwhelming and I would've been lost much of the time. In other words, I wouldn't have learned all that much. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It's a great intro to college level mana DNA great way to judge whether theoretical mathematics is something you're interested in. Plus it definitely gets you to think at a higher level, likely differently from anything you've experienced before. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in mathematics: ABSOLUTELY. This has been one of the most fantastically challenging courses I've ever taken, and it is exceptionally well taught; I know that in subsequent years, students may not have the same teacher, but if you have a chance to take this class (or any other) taught by Pat Devlin, you really should; he puts in an insane amount of time and effort into his teaching and it makes the class really enjoyable to take. Be forewarned though, this class is a lot of work. The weekly psets are no joke, and they will take up your whole week if you do not get a jump start. Frequently there are people in the math lounge working until the very early hours of the morning on Thursday night and Friday, so please if you do take this class understand the time commitment required and definitely start the psets as soon as you can. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It is rigorous; this means that it is a lot of work, but it also means that one grows quite a bit by taking it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Take it if the rest of your workload isn't bad, if you want to meet new brilliant people, and/or if you're majoring in math. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, even though the class requires a lot of time, it is still an excellent introductory to proofs. I thought the psets were very difficult at the time, but looking back, they weren't too bad. After this class, other classes will seem like a walk in the park. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, for math majors or students very interested in math only. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend the course. Best Math course ever. ",
            "\u00a0For any student who is willing to put in the time, I would definitely recommend this course to them. This course has a large time commitment and the problem sets take a long time to complete, but it is a very rewarding experience to work through a problem for a couple hours and to finally have a sudden insight that allows you to solve it completely. Also, you gain a lot of knowledge about what math really is and if you really do want to pursue it. The class has a variety of topics, so if you do not like one part of it, there may be other parts of the class that you do like, and you will never be stuck on a single topic for long enough to get bored of it. ",
            "\u00a0The course is a great choice for someone considering a math major. It will help you decide whether math is for you. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It's difficult but the work pays off. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to students interested in math and improving their skills in proofs. I think this class does a fairly good job at this. However, because of the time and effort you need to commit, it isn't a class for people who aren't fairly sure they like math. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course for anyone with more time in their schedule. It is a wonderful course and the concepts we covered were deep and very interesting. However, for those without as much time to commit to the lengthy psets, it can be more challenging to fit the work into a weekly schedule. ",
            "\u00a0I would strongly recommend this course to other students if they are interested in pursuing a math major and if they have a flair for problem solving. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, given that they are a mathematics major. This course demands a lot of time, and I don't see it being useful in the long term unless the student plans on pursuing something math related. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you're going to be a math major, or you know you're going to take many more math classes in the department and want to have the best preparation for it. Go in recognizing that it's not going to be easy, by any means, but you'll be better for it if you get through. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It is challenging but incredibly worth it. I feel equipped to solve a larger variety of math problems now. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. If you are an aspiring mathematician, or just like math, please take this course. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to learn linear algebra and multivariable calculus (including the real analysis groundwork of calculus), then I would strongly recommend taking this course.  It is a fair amount of work but is still a rewarding experience.  Professor Devlin is also a very engaging instructor who is happy to explore math topics outside of the syllabus. ",
            "\u00a0I would strongly recommend this course to other students, if they want to devote a chunk of their time to learning real math. I guarantee that any freshman (even sophomore) will benefit a lot from this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - it was a lot of work, but definitely taught a lot of meaningful mathematics and organizational skills. It also taught the importance of working together and writing rigorous proofs. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! At the very least, shop it, think about the first pset, and consider whether you'd enjoy diving deep into proof-based math. It was a very large time drawprobably the most difficult course of my first semesterbut I'm very glad I took it. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in understanding what the math major and what being a mathematician is like, this is the class for you! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class if the student had a good sense of what it was going to be like going in and was willing to devote the time. ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend this course to prospective math majors. It is a very large amount of work that a person not fascinated with math would prefer not to do on a weekly basis. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely. The community in the course is amazing, and it serves as a fantastic foundation of real theoretical mathematics. "
