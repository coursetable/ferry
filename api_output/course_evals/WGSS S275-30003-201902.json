            "\u00a0I gained a thorough overview of how to approach ethnic studies with an intersectional and critical perspective, allowing me to make links to understand racialized histories in a unique way. I also learned how power dynamics exist on so many different scales, and how even within minorities ethnic groups, varying degrees of power imbalances exist on systematic and local levels, and these are perpetuated and combatted through popular culture. ",
            "\u00a0I think through out the course we looked deeper into the different aspects of culture, and it teaches people to look at things from different perspectives. ",
            "\u00a0I systematically learned how Asian Americans are represented in differing media. Also, ideology like orientalism and multicultralism are also included in the course content. After the course, I understand the importance of ethical study and how it helps to achieve a polycultural society. ",
            "\u00a0I found this course to be much more insightful than I had initially thought it to be  by the name of the course, one would expect to be sitting around a table discussing yellow fever, Youtubers and Crazy Rich Asians, and not much else. While the course does encompass all of this, it also includes a lot more about history, politics, the intersectionality of race, class and gender, abjection, narrative landscapes etc. and in many different contexts (i.e.: not just Youtube and movies, but also in theater, in music, in stand-up comedy, etc.). I learned a great deal not simply about these topics but also on how to approach them in a way that considers different stakeholders. "

            "\u00a0I really loved the way it was taught, I only wish we had more time. I think that having more time to delve into students' questions for the readings at the end would have been useful (most of the time this was good, but sometimes we got to student questions towards the end and had less time to discuss). Overall, though, the structure and engagement of the course was fantastic. ",
            "\u00a0I feel that the inclusion of many different topics is both a strength and weakness of this course. It is essential that we look at instances as they are  intersectionally, with intertwining social identities that affect every crevice of our lives. However, at the same time, this makes the course content more difficult to understand, since most academic institutions tend to look at things in singular fashion (i.e.: taking an economics course, politics course, and history course separately). Due to the time constraints on summer session courses, it is difficult to ascertain that each student is comfortable with the foundation lenses that the rest of the course will be looked at through, and much of the vocabulary is inaccessible for international students.

            "\u00a0Yes take the class! We got to learn about Asian American history/culture through the lens of popular media. The class was a bit more theoretical than I thought, with some dense readings heavy on theories. But overall, I think the theory part was also useful in terms of gaining an in-depth understanding of the subject. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! It has really made me look at ethnic studies and popular culture in a more critical way, and has encouraged me to have conversations about these topics with friends and family. ",
            "\u00a0I think the amount of reading in this course is really high, it is also very hard to read these readings because they are very hard. I would only recommend this course to students who's first language is English. ",
            "\u00a0Of course I will. Many of my friends don't understand why I am learning this course. I think first of all, this course will give them a sense of how different culture blend and conflict, then form a system of world culture. Also, I think this course will provide them a new sight of what underlying discrimination and how to effectively improve the situation. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if one is looking for a challenge, as it is extremely rewarding and allows one to engage with topics that are of interest and relevance to our everyday lives. "
