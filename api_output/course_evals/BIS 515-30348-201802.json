",
            "\u00a0This course is incredibly designed. Maria is an expert in the field that is able to actually teach students that are new to the topics. She breaks down each topic in a way that is easily followed. Her slides are thorough, but only include relevant information, so they are not overwhelming. She additionally works through each type of problem step by step and then the in-class exercises supplement by asking a different point of the topic.... just really cleverly designed.\r\n\r\nShe also makes SAS extremely approachable. I like how we work with one dataset throughout the course, continuously analyzing the different variables we create. ",

Difficult to justify to oneself the need to spend several hours on a lab that individually is only 2.5% of the final grade  - particularly when the lab formatting/technical skills aren't a focal point of the midterm or final.

Her instructions are highly detailed, and the step by step solution methodology, the slides and the in class problem sets, she teaches is really the \"secret sauce\" to the course.  \r\nThe good thing about this course is that it covers many topics, including some that go beyond the first level Statistics, so it really provides a very strong base.  \r\nConversely, my criticism of this course is that it taught at a level for students who intend in doing some level of research (or would be researchers), while many of the individuals in the class are not intending to be researchers but rather administrators.  That is where the other methods of statistics would be handy such as Quantative Methods of Business Analysis (figuring out risk/reward/compensation scenarios, line queue's, etc.), these would be more helpful for healthcare business administrators. ",

            "\u00a0Weakness: It is too much wokload to cover all the chapters in a text book compacted into 6 weeks along with SAS lab, Epidemiology and Social and behavioral studies which were all demanding time, long assignments and a lot of reading. Sometimes the concepts taught in biostats did not correspond to approaches for solving questions in epidemiology\r\nStrengths: It is a good foundational course and covers biostats quickly. the slides were thorough and the teaching assistant, Victoria was also excellent and very responsive to questions. I appreciated Victoria taking extra time to go over where we made mistakes and teaching us to think through the problems patiently. The slides and the classwork sheets were very useful as well as the lab slides and exercises. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: I like that in-class assignments were incorporated into the lecture to help us understand new concepts. I also really enjoyed the labs taught by the TA and appreciated that application - based nature of lab assignments so we could see where/how SAS can be utilized. \r\nWeaknesses: The only weakness is the length of the class. I understand it's an accelerated course, but 2.5 hours is a long time so a break halfway would be helpful. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Great teacher who knows her stuff and is excited about teaching the content. \r\nWeaknesses: Pace was too slow to begin (3 weeks on basics), and then rushed through final content, did not make it to more advanced modeling, which is what I had hoped for / expected based on the syllabus and this being a graduate level course. Unfortunately I don't feel like I'm leaving with a sufficient skillset to conduct new analyses.\r\n\r\nSuggestion: Give students prep work over the summer and dive into where we started week 3/4 so there is more time for learning new/more advanced content/skills.

The good thing about this course is that it covers many topics, including some that go beyond the first level Statistics, so it really provides a very strong base.  \r\n\r\nConversely, my criticism of this course is that it taught at a level for students who intend in doing some level of research (or would be researchers), while many of the individuals in the class are not intending to be researchers but rather administrators.  That is where the other methods of statistics would be handy such as Quantative Methods of Business Analysis (figuring out risk/reward/compensation/cost & benefit scenarios, line queue's, etc.), these would be more helpful for healthcare administrators.  \r\n\r\nMy other potential criticism of this course is that although majority of the students will do well in taking this course, some of us who are non-science will not do as well, so although I really liked this course a lot, I do not want my grades/passing to suffer so much because this course is really intended to challenge students with science based backgrounds. If Yale wants to produce the senior leaders of tomorrow, my suggestion at this juncture would be to try to gear this course more toward healthcare administrators. \r\n\r\nNote: From my experience, one of the hardest things for a healthcare leaders is to figure out (from a statistical strategic perspective) whether: (I) a merger or acquisition will work out well; or (ii) whether litigating or settling a conflict is preferred, or whether to use product A versus product B for a particular type of procedure given their cost, benefits and risks, or (iii) whether to add a wing to the hospital for specific purposes like neonatal unit or whether to change a wing in a hospital from being preventative medicine based to being more cancer or more orthopedic issues based; (iv) whether to build a hospital in a certain area given the population and demographics, (v) the impact on healthcare costs and benefit of a change in policy or law, etc.  That is something all senior healthcare administrators need to understand better and be able to strategize to lead the organizations. Most administrators do not have a comprehensive understanding of these issues, although I think they are relatively easy to teach. \r\n\r\nPlease note, I offer the above suggestions with two things in mind:  this is only my first semester at Yale, so I don't really know the depth and breadth of what lies ahead till I take more courses; and conversely, I join this program after having many years of business and law experience and I do believe I have an idea of what the future leaders in healthcare need.
