            "\u00a0Greater familiarity with how methods mix - different values for questions, different epistemologies, etc. I found it especially useful to discuss book-length examples of mixed methods work: they were enlightening about some of the issues in ways that talking about them in the abstract can't quite match. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a better understanding of the current debate about mixed methods research and a familiarity with the different ways to combine qualitative and quantitative research methods. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about different frameworks for thinking about mixed-methods research and how it can add to empirical work. ",
            "\u00a0Useful introduction to mixed-methods research design, at a useful moment in our methods sequence.\r\nIt was useful to be able to start thinking of a research design for the prospectus and beyond. ",
            "\u00a0Good overview of what mixed methods research is. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a survey of quantitative and qualitative methods and how they can be effectively combined within the same research design. I appreciated the introduction to new methods, or methods I had heard of but did not really understand. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0A little bit more guidance to student presenters on how they should structure their contribution. There were very varied approaches undertaken - that could be fine, but I think there were some who were unsure what to do. I would maybe have one or two more book-length examples included and merge some of the other weeks into each other. ",
            "\u00a0The class would have benefitted from more practical applications and training on how to conduct the sort of data analysis necessary for mixed methods research. ",
            "\u00a0Going forward, I think it would be better to have more lecture as opposed to student presentations. Students are often not experts in a method and so it is not always a big value added. Perhaps more guest lectures from within the department. \r\n\r\nAn alternative would be to spend the first few weeks discussing the logic of mixed-methods research, followed by more of a workshop style approach with students presenting on their projects and getting feedback on how to effectively integrate different methods. Or even there could be assignments where we do practical research tasks, like trying to come up with interview questions. Basically it sometimes felt like we ended up in meandering class discussions, so I think there would just be value to adding more structure to the course. ",
            "\u00a0The readings were interesting, the paper and due dates well-staggered and organized to help us make progress and receive feedback. Discussions were often interesting. \r\nI think the class would have benefited from more lecturing by the Professor and more structure. \r\nMore examples of concrete, applied research techniques would also be great, although it might be difficult given the different methodological backgrounds in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Would have been much more useful if taught as a methods course instead of a course about a method. Actually digging in to what kinds of methods are best suited for what questions and how to actually use those methods would have been very helpful. I generally don't find student-led classes useful, and that design for this class seemed less effective than having a seminar on methods led by an instructor. ",
            "\u00a0I feel this course would have been better if it was lecture formatted like other methods courses, because often students presenting had the same questions students listening to the student-guided courses had and we all ended up confused and not going much deeper than the textbook. It also would have been better if undergraduates were not in the course or were not paired with grad students for projects because unfortunately a lot of them seemed out of their depth or didn't contribute equally. ",
            "\u00a0While the range of methods explored was good, I wanted more detail and substance in how to actually use these methods. I feel like I now know what tools are out there, but not how to use them, which is frustrating because that's what I had hoped to gain from the course. I would have preferred more instruction, including clear demonstrations of the methods discussed -- even if that meant doing problem sets! That would have been more helpful for me than student-led discussions, which made for some interesting epistemological discussions but did not give me much clarity on the  mechanics of methods. "

            "\u00a0Yes, but as noted above I think the structure of the course could be improved. ",

            "\u00a0If a student (especially a first-year student) was looking for a cursory survey of what methods are available and how they can be combined, I would recommend it, but I would not recommend it to someone looking for greater detail or practical knowledge. "
