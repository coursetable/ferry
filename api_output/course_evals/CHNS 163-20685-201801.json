            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how to use Chinese to communicate about contemporary issues that aren't really gone over in lower level Chinese classes. ",
            "\u00a0Deep understanding of Chinese culture, language, history and idioms. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about pressing social, economic, and political issues in China. For example, many of the chapters in our textbook were about China's pollution, migrant workers, hukou (household registration) system, economic inequality between rural and urban areas, government corruption, economic development at the end of the 1900s, etc. I also learned a lot of new/useful vocabulary and chengyu (Chinese idioms) that have greatly improved my writing and speaking abilities.

            "\u00a0This course is strong because Professor Su really cares about how much you're learning and gives a lot of feedback. This course could be improved if it was less structured and gave more opportunity to speak. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: depth and breadth of material covered, including Chinese philosophy, modern politics, cultural history, and more. Our assignments were difficult, but helpful in improving the strength of our knowledge.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It would have been helpful if we were encouraged more to visit the professor to discuss essays more often. ",
            "\u00a0The best thing about this course was our teacher, Su Laoshi. Every day in class, in addition to going over the material/lessons for that day, he would often teach us relevant chengyu (Chinese idioms), quotes by famous Chinese philosophers like Confucius or Laozi, quotes by famous Chinese political leaders like Mao Zedong or Deng Xiaoping, stories about his childhood in China, stories about Chinese history, etc. It was so exciting to be in his class because we did not just learn the traditional material from the textbook. You would never know what you would end up learning each day. Additionally, because the class was so small and it was a seminar, you could get to know your classmates better. The class was right before lunch, and on most days, several students from the class would eat lunch together. Su Laoshi would sometimes join as well. Although it was such a fun and laid-back Chinese class, I also learned so much vocabulary and grammar, which greatly improved my writing and speaking. Another strength of this course was that the chapters in the textbook were about current social, economic, and political issues in China. Therefore, the class was both a language class and a Chinese history/economics/politics class. The vocabulary we learned was extremely useful because we can now talk about these important topics in Chinese at a high level. "

            "\u00a0This class is definitely a step up from 162 and it is slightly harder. However the material is more relevant and engaging. You should definitely take it if you want to improve your Chinese ability! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if they want to understand Chinese at a deep level, and are prepared to put in the work. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would definitely recommend this course to another student. First of all, the professor is amazing. He is so passionate and energetic about teaching that every class is a fun and relaxing environment. I learn a lot from the textbook, but I also learn a lot from his stories about different Chinese idioms, Chinese leaders, and his time living under the Mao regime. Additionally, I really appreciated the fact that the material in the textbook was about relevant/pressing issues in China. My favorite classes are ones where the material I learn is applicable to the real world. I don't want to learn things that cannot be used in the future, once my time in college is over. After taking this class, I feel capable of talking to others in Chinese about China's pollution, migrant workers, economic inequality, government corruption, economic boom. These are all extremely important issues that will continue to be addressed over the next several years. I am very glad that my vocabulary can cover such a wide range of topics. "
