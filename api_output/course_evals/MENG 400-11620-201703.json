            "\u00a0A deeper understanding of the development and fundamental principles of computer-aided design. Put our hands on writing the codes for rotation and FEA. The class was otherwise largely devoted to designing and simulation using SolidWorks, so by the end of the course you should be fairly proficient in the package. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to use solidworks and more about the design and manufacturing process. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to use Solidworks for design and analysis! It is a very practical skill to come away with. I also learned about the history of CAD, and general engineering principles. ",
            "\u00a0How to design parts and assemblies in solid works, as well as how to do static simulations, motion studies, flow analyses, etc ",
            "\u00a0Got much better at using Solidworks. Learned much more about the simulation capabilities of Solidworks beyond basic static studies\r\n\r\nAlso got a bit more experience with Matlab which was a nice surprise ",
            "\u00a0Solidworks. If you want to learn how to use Solidworks take this class. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a great introduction to SolidWorks. In addition to going over modeling and simulation, we also did two assignments in Matlab to explore some of the math and theory behind how 3D modeling and simulation works, which I thought were pretty cool. ",
            "\u00a0This course allowed me to discover the vast capabilities of solidworks, including design, static studies, motion analysis, FEM, flow analysis, and manufacturing tools. Awesome material! ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to use computer design software and methods to engage in cost efficient and advanced engineering. It was very useful to learn simulation tools in Soldworks, finite element analysis, as well as computer graphics and displays. It was exciting to learn skills that are highly applicable to engineerss work in industry. ",
            "\u00a0Very  applicable class I learned a lot of CAD skills that will be very applicable no matter my engineering career. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: covers a lot of content and details, with abundant hands-on practice in class.\r\nWeakness: although there are lecture notes posted by Prof. Long, these are not step by step guides or cautions of commonly made mistakes. If you didn't pay full attention in class and missed some details, you'll be stranded. The class progressed very quickly, and could easily throw you off when you're fixated at getting the previous operation right. ",
            "\u00a0Strength- I picked up a ton of skill from this class.\r\nWeakness- I think the way it was taught, the class assumed a lot of prior engineering knowledge. I was very hard for me to measure up to others who had more experience than I did ",
            "\u00a0It is an excellent introduction to using solidworks, and I think it gives the students a very strong foundation in CAD. One improvement could be to have some more hands-on aspects in the course before the very end. I think some more guidance for the final project (what would be a good thing to choose to do) would be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this class was great- one of my favorite classes this semester! The psets were challenging but super helpful for learning the material. ",
            "\u00a0Very well taught class. For some, the trial-and-error format of working with Solidworks for our assignments can be very frustrating but is quite realistic for how we will be using Solidworks in our \r\nfuture engineering experiences. ",
            "\u00a0All the assignments were well thought out and were spaced pretty well over the course of the semester. The windshield assignment could use a bit more theory in class about how to design a windshield but otherwise they were pretty good. The main suggestion I would make would be to consider moving the final project earlier so students don't have to work on it during reading week and have the presentations during reading week. I would also hold office hours at a different time than 4pm because many students have sports practice at that time. ",
            "\u00a0The lecture material was dry and didn't seem very applicable at times. When Prof Long did Solidworks examples, however, it was very useful and a good way to learn. The two homeworks involving Matlab coding seemed a little out of the scope of the course, but the rest of the assignments were fair! ",
            "\u00a0It was exciting that the course material was very applicable to real life. I liked hot the weeks were structured to introduce us to a different simulation tool each week. The course could be made stronger by making sure that students dont fall behind while listening in class, as it is difficult to catch up on Solidworks when we dont know which button to click. "

            "\u00a0Definitely take it as it empowers you with some of the handiest tools that you'll use in design and modeling. I'd say it's one of the best engineering electives. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it, but it's very hard to catch on if you don't have a little bit of solidworks knowledge already. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This course gives you some real skills to walk away with and apply in the real world. You do not have to be a mechanical engineer to benefit from this. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! If you think youll use solid works in your career then definitely take this. If you dont think youll use solid works, still take this! The class was a great cumulation and application of a bunch of mechanical engineering principles learned in other meche classes. Additionally, Marshall Long is a great guy who is really dedicated to this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This is, by far, one of the best MENG electives that someone could take. It mixes both the fun of designing and creating something as well as preparing us with some of the tools that will be immensely useful in the future. ",
            "\u00a0If you think you will ever have to use solidworks I highly recommend this class. I walked in with a relatively low skill set and left feeling like a significantly more competent solidworks user. ",
            "\u00a0CAD is a great engineering elective. SolidWorks is a very useful skill and Prof. Long is a kind and good instructor. The homework assignments definitely take some time but they are overall very reasonable in terms of workload. Take it! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, take this if you want to learn how to design using a CAD program (solidworks)!! It is very educational and you will definitely be shown new techniques and features that you didn't realize solidworks contains. It is similar to a compsci class in that there are weekly psets that require a bit of troubleshooting, but the solutions are much more apparent than with coding. ",
            "\u00a0Almost any mechanical engineering job requires the use or understanding of 3D modeling software. Hence this course is very practical for mechanical engineers and for designing and testing new parts before fabrication. ",
            "\u00a0The course mainly teaches you SolidWorks and a lot of simulation methods that come with it. Its one of the few very practical and applicable courses to the engineering industry. It also has components in finite element analysis, computer graphics and prototyping. The weekly assignments start to take more and more time over the semester, but they are rather fun to work on. It gives you great insight into how real-world engineers conduct simulations and design different mechanical systems. ",
            "\u00a0Very  applicable class I learned a lot of CAD skills that will be very applicable no matter my engineering career. "
