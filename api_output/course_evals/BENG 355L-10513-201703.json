            "\u00a0This was a very practical physiological lab course - I learned about practical evaluation methods for various conditions regarding the cardiovascular system, neuromuscular system, etc. Overall, a good, helpful course - we examined bone mechanics and the respiratory system as well. It was practical ",

I got very comfortable with using Matlab to gather digital data, and using it to analyze graphs and then to interpret data. I also learned how to use various devices and transducers which were really cool to use. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about physiology and matlab. I think it was very interesting to have us do the test on ourselves because not only does it give us the ability of applying the test but also to understand how our individual bodies work. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: the course had fairly challenging lab reports, but offered a ton of support for succeeding. Feedback was precise and fair. Topics were all relevant, and I felt like I learned something from every lab. Weaknesses: sometimes the labs became a bit too hand-holdy. While I appreciated it from a \"get-to-go-home-faster\" perspective, I perhaps learned slightly less than I otherwise would have. ",
            "\u00a0The lab was very well organized! The lab reports were fair and we have on average about 2 weeks to complete them. The lab preparation documents were also extremely helpful. A potential weakness would be the corrections of the lab reports. It would be helpful if we had better feedback on what the correct expected results should be or if an \"answer key\" for the labs could be posted after they were submitted. ",
            "\u00a0This class is great--the labs are all super interesting and the workload is definitely manageable. The strengths are the labs themselves and Prof. Fan who worked tirelessly to help us in this class and also beyond by setting up an alumni panel and passing along internship opportunities for this summer. ",
            "\u00a0Felt like the lab reports were very time consuming but not productive (i.e. lots of number crunching). Would be better to do less data analysis and focus on learning. ",
            "\u00a0The preparation and procedure guidelines for each lab were straightforward, and Prof. Fan and the TAs were also on hand and willing to help. The lab reports themselves varied  I felt that some were unnecessarily tedious and could be improved by eliminating some of the repetitive calculations we had to do by hand. I really liked having lab only once every two weeks, especially because it gave us more time to work through tedious calculations. ",
            "\u00a0Workload is very nice. The material is interesting too. Perhaps more demos? ",
            "\u00a0Great course overall. Lab report forms could be made more clear about what type of answer is expected. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were great TAs and great spacing on the labs.  We had two weeks to do everything which was really nice.  This is the first lab I took that actually made sense to be a half credit.  \r\n` ",

            "\u00a0The big selling point of this course is that the time investment is proportional to the .5 credits given, unlike most labs at Yale. There are only 5 labs, and you only have to come in every other week. Plus, most of the labs are pretty interesting. Maybe more timely feedback on the lab reports would be helpful though. ",
            "\u00a0The prelab readings were really helpful in understanding the theory behind all the experiments, and the labs themselves are pretty fun and to the point. You pretty much know what you can expect from each lab report and all the labs. The teaching staff is also really helpful and available. ",

The labs were also quite fascinating and fun to do.\r\nI think the lab questions could be confusing sometimes because it didn't always seem like the answers could be found by doing the lab or reading the backgrounds.

The lab was biweekly and if you didn't wait until the last minute, not a lot of work. The lab preparation documents were also extremely helpful and provided information that would be tested in the final exam. ",

In addition, this class is basically every other week, so the time in lab isn't a huge drawback, while you still learn some important information. ",

            "\u00a0You probably wouldnt take this lab unless its required for the BME major, but it was definitely one of the most interesting and least stressful labs for BME/premeds. Meeting only once every two weeks was really helpful  if I had a busy week ahead, I could have more flexibility with deciding when to finish the lab report. The labs were interesting and resulted in meaningful data for the most part, and the reports themselves were sometimes tedious but overall not too much of a time suck (especially compared to the PHYS 205L/206L sequence). Prof. Fan and the TAs were all very laidback and helpful, so we were able to finish every lab early and didnt even have to go in the second week. Overall, I think this was a well-designed class that really helped me solidify my knowledge of different physiological systems and medical afflictions/procedures. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It is the best bio lab I have taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Very well organized course. If you finish your lab quickly, you only have to go in once every other week (which is super nice!). ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend.  This is a great class!  Also great for bonding with other BME students.  Really fun nd cool stuff and the TAs are absolutely amazing and super helpful with everything.  You have two weeks to do all the labs, but always finish the first week so you dont have to go to lab at all the second week and you have two weeks to do all the lab reports.  The reports can be a lot of work, but nothing too crazy.  Manageable to do all in one day/night but going to take many hours.  Def take!! super chill and fun.  We run the labs on ourselves so we are reading our ecg and seeing our lung capacity and motor nueron responses. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah not too bad at all, chill lab session and you get to do some interesting things. Take with friends. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Good labs that helped you learn the concepts. Reasonable amount of time for each lab. The lab report questions and graphs we made were helpful to learning and understanding the questions. Overall I enjoyed this lab and think it definitely was the best lab I have taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! absolutely my favorite lab I've taken at Yale. Incredible class, and it tied together concepts learned throughout all my BME and math classes at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0It's a required course so you have to take it. That being said You do learn a lot and it's a great application of some of the things you learned in physio. ",
            "\u00a0This was a great course - it might be tough to find yourself taking it unless you're a BME major, but it is a useful, enjoyable, and not at all insanely demanding class. If trying to fulfill the laboratory requirement for med school, this is a good option ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This is the best lab I have taken at Yale (not really a high bar though). The labs are interesting and not too time consuming. I walked away with a better understanding of ECG, the nervous system, and respiration. ",
            "\u00a0For sure, best lab class I've taken at Yale. Really fun, pretty low maintanance, practically meets once every two weeks. ",
            "\u00a0It's required for BME majors, and in that case, it's one of the easier requirements. For pre-med people looking for a bio lab, it's definitely interesting, but be prepared to have to use MatLab a lot. There were a few instances where I definitely would have been very lost if I did not have experience with MatLab; that being said, the TAs could be good resources and it definitely is doable, as I know many pre-meds who took it with no coding experience. ",
            "\u00a0I think this lab was well worth the time. I felt that I learned a lot and wanted to put the time in to understand each process. ",
            "\u00a0It wasn't the worst, not stressful, sometimes annoying, take it probavly ",
            "\u00a0Overall a decent lab course. Experiments were pretty interesting, lab reports a bit tedious but not too difficult. There is a final exam, but it was fairly straightforward using information from the prelab presentations and the report questions. Lab is only every other week (after the first two weeks back to back) so it's pretty chill. "
