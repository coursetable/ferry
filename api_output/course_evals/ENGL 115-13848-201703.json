            "\u00a0Significantly improved writing/organization of writing; introduction of new and extensive literary theory created an interesting lens through which to view literature ",
            "\u00a0I not only improved my skills as a writer, but also gained deeper insights about who I am as a person through our exploration of selfhood and identity. The course exposed me to academic terms that described social phenomena which I had previously been unable to describe and encouraged me to engage critically with the structures I was encountering in my first semester.

            "\u00a0The course is very strong in the texts and critical pairings that were presented. Class discussion, though it lagged at points, struck the perfect balance between being student-led and teacher-led. I struggle to find any overt weaknesses with the course. "

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. As previously mentioned, I think that even though the literature we read was mostly from the 19th century, the ideas we explored were extremely topical for first years who are seeking to define and construct their own selfhood.
