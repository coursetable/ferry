            "\u00a0Northern Ireland! And a bit about the political theory surrounding conflict. ",
            "\u00a0I gained insight into civil conflict, broadly, and the drivers of political violence in a number of regions globally. ",
            "\u00a0This course covered topics relating to civil conflict on both macro and micro levels: why individual people participate, why movements begin, and the goals at each of these levels, among many other topics. This course helped me think more critically about rebellion, conflict, and states. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the Northern Ireland conflict, which is suprisingly a very complex situation. This class offered the opportunities to have actual conversations with people who have undergone the troubles and have had direct interactions with the conflict through classroom guest speakers. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a great appreciation for the academic literature of civil conflict. The individual case study of Northern Ireland, along with student presentations about other cases, helped me gain new knowledge on global geopolitics. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the conflict in Northern Ireland, the history behind the conflict, and contemporary political issues surrounding the conflict today. "

            "\u00a0Having so many guest speakers was great, but I'd have preferred having 1 or 2 less and more class discussion. ",
            "\u00a0I LOVED the guest lectures and the student presentations. Would've appreciated more feedback on my work though. ",
            "\u00a0Given that the course is a seminar, it might benefit from more in-class discussion structured into the syllabus. Furthermore, Professor Weir is brilliant, so while I enjoyed our guest speakers, I wish she had spoken a bit more to us directly, rather than having quite as many guest discussions. ",
            "\u00a0This course was well organized and had a breadth of readings and class discussions, as well as visitors over skype and in person who were relevant to course materials. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths include the opportunity to talk to people who have had experiences with the Northern Ireland conflict. \r\n\r\nI wished we had expanded the class to look more in-depth at other case studies of civil conflict, not just Northern Ireland. Janine was a fascinating guest speaker because shes reported on various different conflicts, so maybe more speakers like her. Also, I would have liked to have more discussions on the readings in class. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the class include Professor Weir and the student presentations. She approached each class with a great deal of energy that greatly facilitated learning. One weakness of the class was the overuse of Skype for class speakers. I felt I would have preferred more class discussion as opposed to lectures online. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Focused material, interesting readings, a lot of guest speakers\r\nWeaknesses: The assignments were mainly reflections or question submissions which is more difficult to keep track of than it seems "

            "\u00a0Yes, Prof. Weir is amazing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this was such a fun lecture course. The guest lectures make it all the more worth it. So many amazing people to hear from! ",
            "\u00a0I think with certain modifications to increase class discussion, I would. I would definitely recommend Professor Weir! ",
            "\u00a0This course is fantastic and the professor is especially exceptional! ",
            "\u00a0If you like the Northern Ireland conflict, take this course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to another student, especially those who have little background in political science. At times, the class became too focused on speakers, but the speakers did provide excellent perspective. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone interested in the conflict in Northern Ireland or about civil conflict theory in general. The class is very manageable for anyone daunted by a load of political science papers. There is one final paper requirement for the class and the rest of the assignments consist of reading responses, reflections, and question submissions. "
