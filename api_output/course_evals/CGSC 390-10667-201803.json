            "\u00a0I learned about various different subjects/areas of research within cognitive science, as well as the methods and tools used to learn more about them. ",
            "\u00a0This class strikes the right balance between broad overview and depth within topics. Every week was different, and I learned a lot of things about a lot of things. I feel like I have much more confidence in speaking and thinking critically about various fields within cognitive science. ",
            "\u00a0A great survey of cognitive science "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: writing a senior project proposal, writing a paper draft, presenting to the class, and producing a final paper. This process really prepared me for what I will be tackling next year as a senior in the major. Another strength was the class discussions--it was really interesting to hear other students' opinions on topics they were passionate about. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: students are very involved in their own learning and the learning process. Weaknesses: we didn't get much regular feedback. I think the seminar discussion often dove into the nitty-gritty details of uninteresting or irrelevant topics and student engagement was lost at this time ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: weekly topic, reasonable amount of reading with suggested and recommended papers made available, high student involvement during class\r\nWeaknesses: disconnect between topics, more time spent on some branches of cogsci (like psych, econ) than others ",
            "\u00a0This is a strong course, very focused on active learning. I enjoyed that immensely! ",
            "\u00a0Active learning meant really high engagement and great discussions "

            "\u00a0Yes! As a CogSci major, it gives you a level of understanding and credibility in talking about the different domains of cognitive science as a field, rather than just the topic you are interested in. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to juniors in the cognitive science major. I had very high hopes for this seminar, and it wasn't as fun or as interesting as I expected it to be, so I guess just go in with the right expectations. Still very useful to me, and I have no regrets about taking it. ",
            "\u00a0To all cognitive science majors -- YES! A great way to learn a LOT about the field we are studying. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely to all cog sci majors. A lot of work but so worth it "
