            "\u00a0I learned so, so much from Professor Freeman, not only about Early National America but about how to approach history. I feel like I learned a lot about the period itself and about how we know what we know about history. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to view history through the lens of the people who lived in the period rather than just from the leaders and figures that history tends to revolve around. I also learned more about how marginalized groups factor into the foundations of the US and the significance of recognizing those who often go unnoticed in the history of the US, as well as why the US is like it is today. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this course was a good representation of the time period. It's pretty broad though, but a good introduction. ",
            "\u00a0Well, I learnt a lot about the early National America. As a international student, I really enjoyed learning about Washington, Jefferson, Hamilton, or Jackson.\r\n\r\nAlso, every time I see cheese, I can't help laughing. (You need to take the course to understand why!) ",
            "\u00a0Great survey course. I'm a senior-spring history major, so the structure was nothing new, but fascinating content and Professor Freeman is absolutely, without a doubt, among the best anywhere. ",
            "\u00a0Narrative of the formation of an American identity post-Revolution. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about how to evaluate sources and historical arguments and why we should question simple narratives. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Freeman's class does not only teach students about the larger political, social, and economic conditions of early national America. Her lectures and the readings she's chosen to reinforce them focus on cultivating a sense of historical thinking. Her lectures posed fundamental questions that that students, over the semester, were pushed to consider and answer. And by keeping these questions on students' minds, Professor Freeman helped cultivate a broad view of change over time. In short: I learned a lot about life in the early national period (as much as a survey course can teach you) but also asked, and answered for myself, some of the most important questions on the minds of historians and the people of the time. ",
            "\u00a0Really helpful overview of this period in American history. It felt like the right amount of time to be focusing on (roughly 50 or so years) in the sense that it didn't feel too overly focused that the lectures were on small mundane details but not too broad of a survey that we didn't feel like we had a deep knowledge of the material. There are several very interesting concepts to follow throughout this time period, and Professor Freeman is a very conceptual teacher which I appreciated. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a keen perspective on the political and social realities of the early national period in United States history. More so than anything, I have learned that while it is easy to apply our modern-day lenses to history, it is important to understand events from those who were there at the time. I enjoyed how this course used traditional history textbook events to elucidate the time period and culture surrounding them. It definitely teaches you to become a better historian and question the bias of primary sources and generalized claims. ",

            "\u00a0This course completely changed my understanding of early national America through deliberate exploration of the truth and highlighting the flaws and failures of early American leaders. I can easily say this course is vital to take for any student intent on concentrating in American studies given that it tosses aside the flowery perspective on the Founding Fathers and instead offers something real, humorous, relatable, and controversially interesting.

            "\u00a0The content of the course is basically what you would have learned in APUSH if you took it, but you don't take the course for the content, you take it to get to hear how Freeman thinks about history. ",
            "\u00a0I certainly learned a lot about Early National America and the factors that drove the period. ",
            "\u00a0Great anecdotes into early National American history. ",
            "\u00a0A much more nuanced understanding of American history between 1789 and the 1820s ",
            "\u00a0I gained a deeper understanding of Early National America and the various moments and situations that helped define this period. From the time starting with a drafting of the constitution to the Age of Jefferson and then Jackson this course goes through the stages of America as it looked to develop and find its own national identity. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about Early American history through lectures, readings, papers, and primary source documents. The class was FASCINATING. It is a must-take, especially with Professor Freeman!! I had taken American history in the past, but this class offered a whole new perspective and I feel like I got a better sense of the character of the nation during this time, as well as the personalities of significant leaders. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent overview of the time period, a great sense for different possible Historical approaches to understanding this period (and a little about the historiography of those approaches), and a strong understanding of some of the broad themes that are central to prewar US. ",

            "\u00a0I learned so much about Early American history and I'm excited to learn more. The feedback on my papers was informative and helpful and I will use that feedback in order to improve my paper-writing skills in the future. This was a wonderful learning experience! ",
            "\u00a0I learned about 1785-1840 from a historian who emphasizes the biggest historical trends. I have a strengthened understanding of the time, its social and political trends, and how democracy was shaped. Im armed with historical anecdotes from the time. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to think more about the broader themes of early national American history. Professor Freeman does an excellent job of highlighting overarching trends and patterns, as well as going over the more specific terms and events that you may have learned in APUSH. ",
            "\u00a0This is a comprehensive survey course of the Early National period, spanning from effectively 1776 to 1850. There is very little military history, mostly a political and cultural survey of the course. ",
            "\u00a0This class gave me a good conceptual understanding of the Early National Period in American History. Professor Freeman does a great job narrating history through the lens of various themes, and throughout the class I got lots of practice tying in evidence to support the narratives that Professor Freeman was teaching. ",
            "\u00a0Early National America did not so much focus on dates, major events, and important figures of the time period as it did on the radically PUBLIC FEELINGS of this time period. This course focused on the sentiments--the fears, hopes, anxieties, and more--one might have felt if one had lived at this time. To that end, this course taught me how to step into the shoes of people living in the past, to drop the prejudices of the modern eye; Early National America asked me to become another person entirely, and as soon as I had done so, threw me into the tumultuous, rowdy, uncertain beginnings of the United States. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about bridging elite writings and social/cultural history to think about contingency in political systems. ",
            "\u00a0The course subject matter was an overview of U.S. political and cultural history between the American Revolution and the Age of Jackson. While the course material was largely review if you took an advanced U.S. history course in high school, Professor Freeman recontextualized this information by heavily citing fascinating primary sources in lecture and picking secondary source readings that provided new approaches to the study of early national American history (ex. lens of political festivals, transnational comparisons with Haiti, etc.). Skillwise, I honed my primary source analysis skills in take-home papers and synthesis skills in in-class exams. ",
            "\u00a0This course provides a thorough understanding and overview of American history from the years immediately following the American Revolution to the years during the Jackson administration. "

        [
            "\u00a0I think the best part of this class is the lecture. Professor Freeman is so structured and really guides you through what is important. Not having to figure out what I needed to know helped me to focus on what she was teaching me. She made lecture so fun, and I felt like she valued my time because she always delivered what she said she would, within the time frame.\r\n\r\nA weakness is definitely the reading. Having 150 pages of reading every week just wasn't always feasible, and I felt like when we had less I could actually read it thoroughly and contribute more than when I just frantically read 160 pages in two days. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures and section were very engaging and informative; Professor Freeman is a very charismatic lecturer who makes the 50 min class time fly by with her stories and insights and section really helps with digesting and understanding the information and concepts brought forth in lecture. The paper prompts can be a little challenging, especially because it's a little difficult to gauge where your writing could be improved when class isn't really focused on the formulation of historical essays. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Professor Freeman is a wonderful lecturer. I never felt bored in class and was always interested.\r\nWeakness: Paper assignments felt a little random, and so did the grading. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: JOANNE FREAKING FREEMAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\r\n\r\nWeakness: The TAs are not all good. I loved my TA but my friend hated her's. ",
            "\u00a0Lecture is fabulous and Professor Freeman is exceptional. Section tended to drag along, but that's kind of the nature of history lecture sections. ",
            "\u00a0Great for really getting into the mindset of the period and its major players. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - Professor Freeman is an incredible lecturer. She's well-organized and brings her sense of humor and lifetime of research to enliven her presentation. You are certain to learn something new every class and will look forward to lectures. If you pay close attention to lectures and take good notes, exams are fair. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - grading is contingent on TAs and some of the section discussions were less than exciting ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Freeman is a captivating lecturer, the TFs are all extremely knowledgable, and the material and readings are genuinely interesting. It's a very easy lecture to be engaged in.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Professor Freeman lectures without handouts or slides. It's not that her lectures are disorganized; in fact, they're phenomenally structured. But the lack of substantive material other than lecture notes makes it a bit difficult to review. For many weeks, the readings were so demanding that I could not finish them because it simply was not possible to do so in the time I had balancing all of my other responsibilities. Moreover, some material can be a bit simplistic if one took an in-depth American history course recently. ",
            "\u00a0Less reading, perhaps. Though my theory is that the professor knows that some students aren't doing ALL of the reading, and assigns so much because even if only half was read, it would still be enough to understand the key concepts for the week. If this is the case, then keep the amount of reading the same. However, if all students are expected to be reading every last page, I would really suggest cutting it down a bit. \r\n\r\nEssays were great, though I think clearer prompts would be helpful as I got points docked in the first essay for doing the whole thing somewhat wrong. Apparently I got to \"into\" the prompt of writing as a member of the time period. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The lectures and readings are certainly the best parts of the course. Professor Freeman is interesting to listen to, especially how she weaves in funny stories of the time period to break down a very dynamic time period. There were not any textbook readings, but instead a series of historical monographs/books and primary sources that did a much better job at reinforcing learning. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The sections varied A LOT depending upon which teaching assistant you had. I know a lot of other students who received useful tips for the exams and clear feedback on their writing. I did not. My teaching assistant did not prepare us for exams and was focused on showing our class how great he was as a student at the Yale Law School. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Amazing lecturer and great TFs ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - Professor Freeman is such a knowledgable and engaging lecturer. She is truly a leading scholar of early national politics and always has fun anecdotes from her historical research to share in class. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - The readings for this class were often hefty and dense. A lot of it was focused on the politics and religion of early America, while only two books had a nontraditional focus on women and the Haitian Revolution. Incorporating more of these nontraditional approaches to studying early American history could have made the class more engaging and less of a repetition of high school US history classes, where the main focus is often elite white men. ",
            "\u00a0Weakness: exams. ",
            "\u00a0Almost all strengths.  I guess my only negative comment would be I thought a few of the readings were a bit off-topic and not relevant (i.e. Sam Patch, Haitian Revolution). ",
            "\u00a0A really fabulous course. It was really well organized and interesting - I never got bored in class. Readings were not too long and some of them were particularly gaging (the Sam Patch book especially). Grading was also fine and I was given a lot of instruction on how to improve. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: 1790s + Jackson\r\nweaknesses: compared to depth of rest of 1790-1830 we cover, the 1800-1820 period is basically entirely skipped over. Too much emphasis (basically everything after Spring Break) ",
            "\u00a0This course could be improved to accommodate different styles of learning. I am a visual learner so it was a bit tough -- lectures had no visual material. ",
            "\u00a0It was really strong, I did not like the first paper assignment. Also, there was too much reading. ",
            "\u00a0Wow. This course is absolutely fantastic. Prof. Freeman is simultaneously brilliant and engaging. Her lectures are always interesting, funny, and an ideal synthesis of the subject. Her vast expertise and experience really shines through in this course. This is an incredible history course to take at Yale and undoubtedly will provide new insights into the post-Revolution period in America, even if you've already studied the topic. ",
            "\u00a0I really can't think of any weaknesses about this course. It was extremely well taught, readings were good, sections were informative, and the assignments were fair. ",

            "\u00a0The lectures were captivating- especially with Professor Freeman's anecdotes. The readings also supplement the lectures nicely and provide more detail to some of the themes Professor Freeman discussed. ",
            "\u00a0This was a very strong course: Professor Freeman's lectures are a work of art, the readings were fascinating and did a great job expanding beyond and building on the lecture material, and I had a great experience in my section with Catherine. \r\n\r\nThe only weakness I can think of would be that the structure of the lectures sometimes bounced back and forth between a linear narrative of politicians' actions and broader overviews of the US from various perspectives. However, this approach also allowed for multiple perspectives and historical methods of inquiry. A small suggestion might be to build a greater narrative between the social and cultural lectures (the one on non-voters, on the Second Great Awakening, etc) so that they feel less like standalone lectures that portray a single historical moment.\r\n\r\nHowever, overall a really fantastic course. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Freeman really makes this course. She is a fantastic lecturer and her passion is contagious. I would remove some of the secondary readings and add more primary documents. ",
            "\u00a0I think the TFs and professor were excellent, the readings corresponded to lectures, and the second essay helped me more fully understand the material. However, I think the first essay was pretty unhelpful. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength is Prof. Freeman, who is a fantastic, engaged, and well-prepared lecturer. Reading for the course is heavily weighted towards social history, which could be a strength or weakness depending on preference (I didn't mind it). There were two essays for the class, both a bit of a slog  the first, a semi-creative \"letter\" from the perspective of an 18th century U.S. constituent to their Congressman (which felt a little childish), and the second, a fairly standard primary source analysis. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is professor Joanne Freeman, who is fantastic. The syllabus is also quite well structured and organized. The weakness is the course could have focused more on the experience of Native Americans and African Americans. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Freeman was a wonderful lecturer, and the readings complemented the lectures very well. She did a great job of talking about specific historical changes while reminding us of broader, sweeping themes. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Freeman is a very engaging lecturer, particularly because you can tell how much she loves the material. Sometimes she will throw a few rapid-fire points at you and it's hard to keep up sometimes, and then other parts of the lecture will be more anecdotal and less content-based. So some more balance to the lecture might be nice. But overall it was an amazing class. One weakness was the Sam Patch book. I did not enjoy it and did not get much out of it in terms of learning about the history of the time period either. Generally though I loved most of the readings. I loved the Federalist. Liberty and Power had a lot of great content. The Hofstadter was interesting. The primary sources were also great. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Joanne Freeman is a tremendously engaging professor and gave the most interesting lectures. The discussion sections were effective as further explorations of the readings, as well as ways to get perspectives different from Professor Freeman's view. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Joanne Freemans organized, detailed, passionate, and amusing lectures. Weaknesses: if youve taken early American history courses before, you already know the story (though without Freemans nuance & perspective). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Freeman is an incredibly engaging and enthusiastic lecturer. She always has so many cool anecdotes that she shares, and she truly makes each lecture so entertaining and interesting.\r\nWeaknesses: There sometimes feels like there is a disconnect between the lecture material and the exams. While classes focus a lot on big ideas and themes, tests can focus more on specific events. So you'll have to do some extra studying for these IDs to prepare for the midterms. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Freeman is perhaps one of the best possible history lecturers  she knows her stuff, she cares about her students, she's extremely organized and makes lectures both engaging and strong learning tools. It's spectacularly easy to take cohesive, easily followable notes. The weakness of the course is probably just that it cannot go in as deep as a seminar might be able. But nonetheless, it is both extremely accessible and very informative and educational. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were excellent Professor Freeman is engaging, clear, and very funny. However, the readings could often get dull and loosely related to class material, giving me little motivation to focus on them. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Freeman's lecturing is one of the clear highlights to this course. She organizes each class period in a clear and understandable way, and expertly weaves together larger themes of the course across classes. There aren't many weaknesses to the course, I think it was well organized and thought out, assignments were clear, and the material was enjoyable and thought-provoking throughout. ",

She is the most captivating lecturer I have found at Yale, and her countless funny anecdotes make class exciting, interesting, and memorable. This has been one of my favorite classes at Yale so far. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are easy to list: Freeman is, by far, the most engaging lecturer I've ever had the chance to learn from; the material that she assigned was diverse and interesting; and the assignments and exams for this class were fair yet challenging. ",
            "\u00a0I think this class is brilliant: reading, scope, essays, lectures were all engaging and helped me learn. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: wonderful, experienced, and engaged professor; well-selected readings; strong TFs; extensive use of primary sources; fair exams and grading on papers; very accessible Pre-Industrial credit for history majors.\r\nWeaknesses: not necessarily the most intellectual rigorous course among introductory history classes (so occasionally easy to disengage when not in lecture), readings did not always seem to line up with what discussed in lecture that week. ",
            "\u00a0This course provides a good overview of early American history. Professor Freeman is a fantastic lecturer with deep enthusiasm for American history. Her passion shines through in the intriguing anecdotes she spreads throughout her lectures. As a weakness, readings could be a bit too long at times making it hard to stay engaged with them. "

But I have already been telling my friends that getting to meet Professor Freeman and hear her lectures is amazing and so they should take the class. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. Professor Freeman is amazing and incredibly knowledgeable about her field of study and is great at conveying her passion for her studies to her students. I learned so much more about the early US than I knew existed and while dry at times, the history of the politics and societal structure of the US maintain relevance to the modern day in multiple ways.

I enjoyed attending lecture; engaging with the material and readings; and found myself excited to attend class. Professor Freeman encourages you not only to learn the facts of the period but to also think as a historianquestioning, answering, and evaluating others' answers. That being said, if you've taken AP US History within the past 2 years, you might find some of the material repetitive. ",

Thus, I have learned so much more than ever before in a history class - largely from the way Freeman teaches. She is a fun and exciting individual, leaving her students wanting to catch every word she says. Time flies during lecture! Furthermore, the workload she asks for is by no means excessive and can have a reasonable place in even the busiest student's schedule. I can say I uninhibitedly recommend Freeman's Early National America, for students both jaded by American history and fascinated by it, even to students who fear the prospect of a history class. Freeman's approach to teaching is superb and fun, so I recommend her to any student regardless of their major. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but it definitely helps to have a genuine interest in studying this time period. To those more interested in contemporary history, this class may seem a bit too niche in topic and scope. Otherwise, if you want to take a class from Professor Freeman or are just looking for basic exposure to a history class at Yale, this course would be a great choice! ",
            "\u00a0If you're at all consider taking this class you should definitely shop it.  Interesting and engaging for any student in any department, and Joanne is fantastic. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely. A truly wonderful class that will make your semester better. Professor Freeman is amazing and the material is really interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I think this period of history is really interesting and Joane Freeman is an amazing lecturer. I enjoyed going to lecture + section was fun and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0If they generally perform well in history classes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend this course. This is one of those history lectures at Yale that is incredibly worthwhile to take before you graduate. ",
            "\u00a0I recommend other students shop this class first. If you're looking for a course that explains history in a very traditional way, this might not be for you. Professor Freeman is delightful and a great public speaker, however she won't get into the nitty gritty of historical processes and deals more with anecdotes and overarching themes than might be to everyone's taste. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely not a must-take, but if you want a pretty easy history lecture with a good lecturer, take it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend to another student. It is a good course to get your foot in the door to more history classes. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this class! The lectures are fantastic and Professor Freeman's expertise in this subject really shows! As someone who never took APUSH in high school, I learned so much about early American history and the roots of modern American democracy, partisan politics, and so much more. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Take the course just because of Professor Freeman. Even if youre not interested in this time period or in American history, she makes it an incredible class. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. The only downside of the course is that I wasn't able to put more time into it because of the rest of my courseload this semester. Joanne is an absolute amazing lecturer, and every single lecture was infinitely entertaining and informative, especially about an incredibly interesting period of American history. Furthermore, my TF (Catherine) was fantastic, and made section the most informative it could be. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Its ok ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course, Professor Freeman is an amazing lecturer and really delivers them with passion and nuanced knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Take this class with Professor Freeman! A true rockstar! ",
            "\u00a0This was a very strong course: Professor Freeman's lectures are a work of art, the readings were fascinating and did a great job expanding beyond and building on the lecture material, and I had a great experience in my section. Honestly this course is such a great candidate for non-History majors in that it isn't super intense, but it's absolutely worth going to even without a background in History. The readings aren't too long and are really fun, and it really is hard to overstate how engaging and clear Professor Freeman is as a lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend for Professor Freeman's personality alone. A must take for anyone with interest in American history. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! And if you have the chance to take it with professor Freeman, do! ",
            "\u00a0This is the best of the 10 history courses I've taken at Yale. Professor Freeman is an unbelievable lecturer and makes the material very engaging. It's an interesting time period to learn about and doing it with Professor Freeman makes it even better. Highly recommended. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was well taught and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely recommend this course. At first, I was just taking it to fill a preindustrial requirement for the history major. However, professor Freeman quickly drew me in and showed me the value in learning about this era of American history. I learned so much about the early national period, and as a result, I have a better understanding of the country today. Plus, I have a newfound appreciation for cheese (take the course, you'll figure it out). ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Even if you aren't a history major, or if you don't think you're interested in this specific period, this class will change your approach to learning history and may even give you a newfound appreciation for the subject. Prof. Freeman's lectures are accessible to anyone, yet still fascinating if you have more experience with the topic. ",
            "\u00a0I would! Professor Freeman shows that she cares about both the class material and her students. Lectures were always so fun to go to. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to just about anybody, whether they are history majors or have no interest in the subject. Professor Freeman makes the subject incredibly engaging and is an inspiration. The class is fun, informative, and certainly the most interesting lecture course I have taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. Expect an enriching lecture course with a low workload. All assignments and exams were fair and expected. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! In my opinion Prof. Freeman has the best lectures in the History Department-- she combines her academic rigor as a researcher and professor with an excellent sense of humor as a fun person. She weaves lots of anecdotes into her lectures and they flow simply beautifully. The workload is decent and the exams are straightforward. It is a great history class--so glad that I took it. ",
            "\u00a0Regardless of whether you have a lot of interest in early national American history, take it! The course is much more than learning about the events of the 1780s-1830s. It's about learning and discussing broader themes that can be applied to history at large, which is a really cool skill. ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend this course to others. It's not an easy class, but it is somewhat forgiving and gives what you put into it. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a good class if you are looking for a low-key and interesting history lecture. The readings are short, the exams are straightforward, and the lectures are great. It will not be a great class, but it will be a good class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, love the anecdotes ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Everyone with even a remote interest in history should take one of Professor Freeman's classes while they're at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0YES, TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU HAVE THE CHANCE TO. \r\nI seriously cannot recommend Joanne Freeman more. She was a Hamilton scholar before it was cool to be a Hamilton scholar: she understands the time period with a frightening clarity, and is able to bring it to life with expert world-building. All throughout her lectures Freeman draws on quirky, goofy, moving stories of the time period to humanize the past, and remind us how very similar the people of the past were to us. \r\nI will never look at American history the same way. This course has given me a rare, priceless peek into the uncertainty, anxiety, and improvisation, successes and shortcomings of the Early National Republic. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Freeman will teach you to look at history in an excellent and engaging way. Incredibly for history majors, even more necessary for everyone else! You'll enjoy it so much, the work is light, and it's such an important period for thinking about our government. Take this class, or anything else she teaches!! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a history major looking for an accessible PI course or looking to learn from a very accomplished, but still fun, funny, and engaging professor, or any other student interested in the time period. This course is likely a straightforward HU credit, but would probably best serve students who are actually interested in the period and/or enjoy cultural history. The grading and expectations in this course are fair and reasonable and the course is very well-organized. Lectures are a joy and workload isn't too high! ",
            "\u00a0Yes if the student is interested in Early American history you will struggle to find a better professor than Professor Freeman to learn from. "
