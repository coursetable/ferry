",
            "\u00a0The course was ok.  I felt as though the final exam and some homework assignments were outside the scope of the class.  Some lectures seemed irrelevent.  If I am coming to an 8am class every week, I think it is reasonable to have the material needed for assignments to be presented in class rather than needing to rely heavily on readings.  \r\nI also felt that the nurses and doctors in the class had more respect from the professors than the MPH students.  The professors would often direct questions to the nurses and doctors when many of the MPH students had strong background on that topic and could answer the question.  It made me feel discouraged from volunteering when questions were not directed towards me. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much - real-world components were definitely a strength, weaknesses were that the course overall used a lot of jargon that those who have not spent time in hospitals might not understand. ",
            "\u00a0Guest lecturer format made it a little bit disjointed. Would have been nice to have some case study homework to practice. Really truly spent an hour and a half talking about how to wash hands. Sometimes the vibe seemed a little condescending towards the non-clinical people ",
            "\u00a02 hour lectures can be a bit dry ",
            "\u00a0Good overview of issues in healthcare epidemiology.  Many of the guest speakers were very good and engaging.  As this was a smaller class, it would have been nice to have more in-class interaction with the other students through scenarios, etc.  It was nice having doctors and infection preventionists in the class.  I wish we could have heard their perspective more often.\r\n\r\nSome of the readings for the homework assignments were not always relevant to the essay question. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this course.  Its material was exactly what I expected when signing up for the course; it was a great introduction to different areas of healthcare epidemiology.  The hospital tour was one of my favorite parts of the class, and I think that this experience was very important for MPH students with minimal clinical exposure. ",
            "\u00a0It was nice to have experts present the topics in which they specialize. Dr. Dembry and Dr. Banach always provided very useful feedback. I liked the short assignments we did and the group project. The hospital tour is also a great aspect of the class. ",

Class is a mix of public health and clinical students, including a bunch of nurses who are already infection preventionists, which was made very obvious all the time. If you're dedicated, it's an interesting overview of how to apply epi to infection prevention, but it felt disjointed (lots of guest lecturers) with no common thread and no real practice homeworks.

Hospital exposures are one of the most important sources of infectious disease burden in the United States, and as students of public health here, I think it is important for all of us to have some hospital epidemiology knowledge.
