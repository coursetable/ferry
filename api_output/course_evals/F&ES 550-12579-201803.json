I also developed a better understanding of the logistics of writing a research proposal, particularly with respect to its layout, the info that each of its sections should include, and a practical appreciation for what it takes to put it all together. ",

            "\u00a0Poorly. I was hoping for more tangible skills on academic writing and constructing proposals. Instead we had unrelated readings and conversations ",
            "\u00a0At the beginning of the semester, I had very few expectations about how this course would be conducted, but I nevertheless found myself surprised at how it was done. The portions that were most aligned with my prior expectations were the times in class when Bill and the students would have interesting, stimulating debates/discussions on research-related (and not research-related) topics that people seemed genuinely engaged with and interested in discussing. ",

However, I did not learn anything about reading literature and organizing my bibliography. I also did not learn much about scientific writing besides the outlines of research proposals. I have to learn these by attending other sessions at Yale. "

            "\u00a0It seemed like the lone strength of the course was the interactions I had with other researchers in the class. The main weaknesses were a lack of effort and passion by the instructor- for the most part he did not seem that interested in being in the room with us. Besides discussing some readings, there was very little in the way of a designed curriculum that clarified research methods per se. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths include: the conversations with classmates and the professor about science, research, academic career were very interesting; the instructions of the assignments were very clear.\r\nThe weakness include: the workload was quite low, and the course does not feel like a 3-credit one, and we did not meet during the whole October. In fact, it would be better to be a 0-credit mandatory class for the MESc and MFS students, so that we can take more classes in the first semester. We learnt mostly from the discussions and the insights, instead of hardcore skills. However, these weakness are not due to the instructor, but the MESc & MFS track design. ",
            "\u00a0I think it needs to be a real class, not a half class.  I want to learn about quantitative methods. ",
            "\u00a0Little to no structure, not much feedback on work. Not much engagement from the class on our projects. ",
            "\u00a0Good structure to build up to your intro, and then the proposal.  I didn't like having October off from class meetings.  Maybe for super-motivated people that is helpful but I think the meetings would have been helpful to stay on track. ",
            "\u00a0Strength-wise, I appreciated Bills relaxed style as a professor, and I appreciated how he told us repeatedly that he would be happy to meet with us outside of class about our assignments and/or our overall research projects. One change that I think would improve the course is to meet weekly throughout the semester; I personally thought that not going to class during the month of October slowed my momentum when it came to thinking about my research project in the midst of my other classes plentiful assignments. Also, I liked that Bill wrote feedback on the last page of each written assignment, but I wouldve really liked for those comments to be more numerous and more specific, as I probably couldve used a bit more constructive criticism on things like my writing style and my project idea. Finally, I think it would be hugely beneficial to spend a few class sessions discussing strategies for finding and organizing scientific articles, annotating/making notes on the ones you've read, and identifying and incorporating into your writing those that are relevant to your research project. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: make us figure out our projects and write a proposal. Weaknesses: class sessions were not useful - discussions of papers and concepts that were not applicable to actually doing research most of the time. It was more about the concept of research than the actual methods of doing it. I would rather meet less often or meet more often but actually do something useful like workshop each others' research projects. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course would be better if the instructor could provide more practice to help the students to write down the scientific questions with accessible and logical words. ",
            "\u00a0The strength was forcing me to write my research proposal. I think it could be improved by having students edit each other's proposals and practice writing grant applications. ",
            "\u00a0This class was less interactive than I would have liked or expected- I wish we all got to learn more about each other's thesis ideas. I thought it would have been beneficial to introduce each other to our research topics earlier on in the semester, so we could bounce ideas around, better understand who will be analyzing similar data, etc. ",
            "\u00a0The course should have taught us more about searching and reading literature effectively and how to organize our citations. The discussion on the philosophy of science was interesting but may not be very useful for writing our research proposal. ",
            "\u00a0I recognize that the MESc program accepts students with a wide-degree of experience with scientific research and manuscript preparation. And I recognize the need for the school to claim that all of its MESc graduates have some baseline skill level in the sciences. However, the course does not offer much at all to students who have already conducted and published research. I believe for students with an exceptionally strong research background there should be an option (at their advisor's discretion) to opt out of the Research Methods course. Putting students on a deadline to draft an introduction and proposal WAS an effective technique to get everyone's research wheels spinning, and I think that if an \"opt out\" path is offered in the future, students must be expected to work with their advisor to achieve these research milestones in sync with those in the Research Methods course. However I often did not find my time in class be that productive.\r\n\r\nI do think the course could be improved by having 1-on-1 peer discussions with more frequency. There was a brief moment that we did this when we met with the Qualitative Methods course, and I got some of the most insightful feedback I got on my project during that session. "

            "\u00a0Use a citation management software, and make sure it has a Microsoft Word plugin! Ive used Mendeley for many years and am happy with it all around. Ive also heard some good things about Zotero (specifically that it has a Word plugin). Since Yale pays for EndNote, I tried that for a total of two minutes before deciding that the learning curve would be a waste of time when I was already content with Mendeley. In truth, it doesnt really matter which citation software you use  in my opinion, its mostly the Word plugin thats key: you can use it to add in-text citations to your document, and by keeping track of those, it can automatically compile your literature cited section! It has saved me an incredible amount of time, so I highly recommend it for anyone working with sources that s/he might have to reference. ",

            "\u00a0Don't take it if you can. If you can't, bring other work to do during class. ",
            "\u00a0Schedule frequent meetings with you advisor ahead of time. Set them up months in advance if you have to. As you read hundreds of pages of background research about your topic, your ideas about what to study will naturally change and develop.  Your advisor will be well equipped to help you navigate through your new ideas, and will be able to keep you engaged with a project that is manageable in the two-year MESc time period. "
