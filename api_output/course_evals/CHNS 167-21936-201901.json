            "\u00a0The course is very self-directed and large, which is both a strength and a weakness. You could get by fine without doing much of the work and speaking a handful of times when the professor cold calls you, but if you really put the work in you'll get a lot of the class, both in terms of knowledge and language skills. Could feel a bit impersonal. Readings aren't from textbooks but actual news articles and op-eds, which is nice. Important phrases and sayings are always explained thoroughly, which is nice as well.

Perhaps the scheduling of presentations could be improved as they usually clash with other deadlines, but other than that I have no major qualms with the course. ",

The strength is no doubt the professor; Zhou laoshi is a caring and approachable teacher who always thinks of the students  wellbeing first.
