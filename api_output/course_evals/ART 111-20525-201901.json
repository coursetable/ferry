            "\u00a0I developed knowledge of the way formal elements work in visual works, in both 2d and 3d and across time. I also learned how to apply formal elements in order to critique and analyze work, and how to incorporate them into my own artistic practice to make it more effective. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me an eye for the formal elements of artworks. It taught me several ways to approach creating and interpreting art. ",
            "\u00a0How to think and talk about art, concepts relating to visual art, how to use various 2D, 3D, and digital mediums ",
            "\u00a0I learned about form, balance, and material. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to break down a piece, both 2D and 3D, by its formal elements (e.g. color, material). This helped me realize how works of art 'keep you looking' which was extremely useful. "

            "\u00a0This course is strong in the principles it aims to teach. I think it could be improved by having some more introductory info about critique for students who haven't taken art classes before. ",
            "\u00a0There was too much time spent on critiques! We rarely did anything in class other than critiquing homework assignments. I do believe that learning about formal elements and ways of approaching artworks are very important, but for an introductory art course I'd much be spending our class time doing more hands-on assignments ",
            "\u00a0The course is great because it covers a wide variety of mediums such as printmaking, photography, sculpture, film, virtual reality, etc. so you get to experiment with a lot of things. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course would function better if we were given more time to do independent projects and were encouraged to use the classroom space outside of class time. I think that we focused too much on critiques and learning terms which made it a bit difficult to actually apply that knowledge to our work. Maybe if we didn't immediately jump into critiques and instead were given time to create our own things at first, while Anahita guided us individually, then as a larger group, it would have flowed better. The weakness of this course on a whole might be that it tries to cover too much in one semester, therefore leaving students oftentimes overwhelmed or confused along the way. ",

            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course unless the student prefers extremely structured assignments and long hours of critiques. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the class is very informative and you get to make a lot of cool stuff. A lot of the assignments are pretty open-ended, so you have a lot of freedom. ",
