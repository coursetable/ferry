            "\u00a0Basic music theory, how to write, understand, and listen to music. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the fundamentals of Western music notation and, more importantly, that this style is only one way to do it. ",
            "\u00a0I now know a lot more about music than before. I had a very rudimentary understanding coming in, and now I really feel like I have a greater knowledge on how music actually works. It's so complicated! "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal and really enjoyed it. My only suggestion for improvement is that I think the last few weeks of the course cold move at as rigorous a pace as the rest of the course, to fit more knowledge of melody and harmony. ",
            "\u00a0This course does a good job of getting everyone up to speed. I came into the course with slightly more music experience than the average person in my class, so the first few weeks were a little slow, but once everyone was on the same page, I think we all learned a lot. The daily homework was only sometimes useful--sometimes it was too basic and not a good use of my time, and sometimes it was way too much and too tedious, though I do think that I learned these skills a lot better through practice. The composition assignments were definitely a strength of this course because they helped us apply the principles we had been learning about, which I assume is the reason most of us are taking the class. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely learned a lot, and the daily homework and low-stakes quizzes are a definite strength. Weakness would be the fact that kids who are WAY TOO QUALIFIED take this course and it is kinda upsetting. "

        [
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this class! Be prepared to do homework for every class though and to study for regular quizzes, since it's the kind of material that really builds on itself, like a math class. ",
            "\u00a0If you don't know a ton about music and want to learn, this course is perfect. Definitely not too hard, but you learn a lot that will change the way you listen to music even if you don't play or study it formally outside of class. It's like learning a new language, but one you hear all the time and don't fully understand. Truly a great experience. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, and I already have! It's fun and a way to switch up your thinking outside of your usual classes, whether they are humanities or sciences. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course for anyone looking to understand the basics of music in an environment with minimal stress. "
