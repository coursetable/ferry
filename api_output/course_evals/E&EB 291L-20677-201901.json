            "\u00a0Super interesting dissections, great overview of vertebrate anatomy! Improved my visualization skills for sure ",
            "\u00a0I developed a much stronger understanding of vertebrate anatomy and grew in my ability to perform dissections while analyzing the body structures present. ",
            "\u00a0I learned valuable skills on how to analyze and dissect specimens. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to perform dissections and learned about how evolution has influenced th resulting anatomy of vertebrates. ",
            "\u00a0This course teaches you a lot about using microscopes to identify different slides and how to conduct a proper dissection. Units range from cell types to bones, muscles, and organs. It is good for students with all types of lab backgrounds. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt how to understand similarities and differences in form through dissection and observation. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0wish the lab reports were more connected to the actual labs. I feel like during the labs I learned how to dissect, but didn't learn about the organisms like what muscles do what, and the functions of the body parts. Then for the report I felt like I had to google everything because the book is extremely hard to navigate and we didn't learn it in class. ",
            "\u00a0The exams were very unrelated to material covered in class, and required a lot of outside studying/reading. However, it was a really cool lab class with great dissections and clear lab handouts. The instruction was also good. It's pretty independent so I think it works well for older students. ",
            "\u00a0This course is wonderful in that there are many dissections that you get to do and the teaching staff are wonderful. However, the lab handouts and lab reports can be vague at times. That being said, the lab reports were helpful in forcing me to research and understand the material in order to write them well. ",
            "\u00a0It was a bit disorganized, and it seems like each year a new professor teaches it so the instructor never really knows what to do or what is going on. There should be an established professor for this course. But it aligns very nicely and compliments the lecture course. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the organization of the course and the ability to become familiar with using a microscope, examining bone specimens, and dissecting specimens. \r\n\r\nI would make the exams more tailored to the actual lab course rather than the lecture course. I found there to be questions on material not emphasized in the lab but was rather found in the lecture course. "

            "\u00a0Yes! Cool lab. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, it is a wonderful anatomy lab and is very helpful if you are in the lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! Much chiller compared to the lecture class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It is very hands-on and you learn a lot! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It is required for the EEB major track two but it is also a fun biology lab where you get to experience anatomy hands on but in a low stress environment. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this to anyone with interests in medicine, whether human or veterinary. I would also strongly recommend students in the lecture course to take the lab course at the same time. "
