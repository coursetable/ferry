            "\u00a0Spanish in film helped me expand my vocabulary, understand film terms and techniques, and practice my speaking and writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0Throughout the span of this course, I was able to develop skills in aural comprehension in the Spanish language while watching and analyzing movies. I also improved in my Spanish writing and speaking abilities. ",
            "\u00a0This class both improved my Spanish writing skills and taught me a lot about the history and evolution of Latin American cinema. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the history of Latin American cinema and different film techniques and vocabulary.  I was also given an insight into the filmmaking process through filmmaker visits and the film festival. ",
            "\u00a0Learned to think critically about film and what the producer is trying to convey and the methods through which they do it.\r\n\r\nLearned to inspect situations in countries from a global, less biased, perspective ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about Latin American culture and world cinema during this class. I improved my Spanish by using it to learn and discuss ideas that arose in the movies and films we watched. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about different cultures in Spanish speaking countries and about film in general. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about film making in Latin America, as well as learning about the history and cultures of each of the places. ",

            "\u00a0Analysis of movies, how to critique art, music, and film in conjunction, and my language listening skills. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Tortora's lectures, the assignments, the guest lectures, the Spanish and Iberian film festival\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: course organization, the films, the readings, feedback\r\n\r\nThis course could be improved by clarifying assignments, selecting a more well-rounded canon of films, and organizing the Canvas page. It would also help to have faster feedback for assignments and more opportunities to speak in Spanish, especially in a language course intended to perfect one's Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very informative and gives good practice with Spanish writing as well as sufficient class discussion to improve speaking skills. Watching the assigned movies also helps to improve listening and comprehension skills. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very interactive and gave students a unique insight into Latin American film.  It did however require a lot of free time to watch the films which were sometimes very long. ",
            "\u00a0It was really nice, if it was a bit more organized it would be very helpful ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course is that it covers a lot of very interesting material and presents it in context with history and cultural significance. Another strength was the filmmaker visits that we had, where directors came into our class to speak with us and talk to us about their films and the Latin American film industry. This was a unique opportunity that we would not get anywhere else and I really appreciated it. A weakness of this course is that we do not receive much feedback on the writing we submit until after the semester has finished, which makes it hard for us to improve our writing without Professor feedback. Something else that could improve is the expectations for the \"pruebas,\" as it was sometimes confusing what we were expected to know or takeaway with regards to how it was tested. A study guide would be helpful for students to understand what they need to know, or a class review session before the test to go over any unclear or missed concepts. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: great films and Prof Tortora is so knowledgeable and willing to help students on assignments if you take the time to meet with her beforehand. Weaknesses: It felt more like a lecture sometimes than a discussion--often went through classes without saying anything. ",
            "\u00a0It was very interesting. I thought the films chosen were enjoyable and thought-provoking. However, I wish there had been a greater degree of in class discussion covering the trends within film making in each of the countries. We did to some extent with Mexico, which I enjoyed greatly. ",
            "\u00a0I like how we are given enough time to do our assignments. I wish the class was more structured, so students wouldnt be confused about upcoming tasks or how we are supposed to do it. ",
            "\u00a0All of the films that we watched were phenomenal an gave me a broad understanding of Latin American film. I wish we had more time to engage and speak with each other in class both with Profesora Trtora and each other, and I wish we had spent less time doing presentations and more time discussing. "

            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend this course to anyone that is interested in practicing their Spanish in a fun interactive way. I enjoyed this class because it was a film class taught in Spanish and that allowed me to enjoy the class without completely focusing on the language aspect. It was a natural feeling class full of great conversation and amazing opportunities. ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend this course to students who are already proficient in the Spanish language and who do not need to take a course to perfect their Spanish speaking and writing. For students who intend to improve their speaking and writing skills, this course may not be right for you! Also, if you are not able to work well with a lack of structured/consistent lectures in the class, this course is also not right for you! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone interested in film or wanting to work on Spanish writing with minimal speaking necessary. A good class to fulfill a language credit but be prepared that its a good amount of work. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It's a class that will have you leaving with a lot of interesting knowledge and a new perspective on films and the film industry. ",
            "\u00a0100% amazing profesora ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in Spanish and looking for a way to study the language through a lens different than the traditional literature classes often offered. This class is unique in that it provides students access to a wide diversity of films and goes through each one to understand its cultural significance. I thoroughly enjoyed watching the movies and films and learning about them in class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but probably only if it's not their first L5. I think it's best suited for those who want to /practice/ Spanish and learn about film--not those who want/need to keep /learning/ Spanish. Also, it was a lot more work than I expected! Be prepared to work hard on many writing assignments and the final project. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would. It is fun and thought-provoking. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It also depends on what type of teaching style you like. If you dont mind that you are more responsible to do your work, then this class is for you. ",
            "\u00a0This class really expanded my understanding of the nuances of language between different Latin American countries. "
