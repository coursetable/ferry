            "\u00a0I learned a ton about algorithms and how computers work. A great introductory course. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to problem solve and think algorithmically. I learned to break down questions into easier parts and put them together - this is a completely different way of thinking that I'm used to, so it was really difficult at first but fulfilling to improve. We were taught about different algorithms and how things like computers or check digits worked (practical applications). ",
            "\u00a0It's a survey course about computer science. ",
            "\u00a0Deeper understanding of Computer Science and its applications. ",

            "\u00a0Good professor, fair amount of work, in class exams could use some tweaking to be more prepared for from homework. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Eisenstat breaks things down into understandable information. Doesn't feel super applicable, though. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: well explained \r\nWeakness: sometimes goes a little too fast. ",
            "\u00a0This course is taught very well and you learn a lot. I think it would be interesting to include a lecture on the modern issues and applications of what is going on in the digital world - with privacy, hacking, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: it's challenging if you're not STEM and forces you to think in a different way. Also there is an abundance of help, office hours by appointment and during weekdays from both the professor and TAs. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some lecture topics at the end of the semester that weren't on the final were a little rushed (the loops coding) and because they weren't tested but were complicated, I think people might not have put full effort into learning them. Psets could have more comments on why you were wrong. Also the solutions presented in class seemed more simple than the ones that would be a \"correct\" answer. ",
            "\u00a0Some topics are too challenging for an intro level course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Interesting subject material, enthusiastic professor. Weaknesses: Slightly \"front-loaded\" in the sense that more complex topics were introduced too early. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very well paced and the lectures were self-explanatory, which made the course very easy to follow. I would have loved to spend more time on algorithms as the more technical side of the course slightly went over my head. ",

            "\u00a0Absolutely.  A great introduction to algorithms, and the p-sets are about as fun as a problem set can get. The professor is great, and it is not overly difficult to do well. ",
            "\u00a0As a person who tends toward humanities classes, this course really forced me to get out of my comfort zone and think in an entirely new way. Its very hard to go to lecture sometimes because its not the most compelling material but the class was a good overview of more of the mindset of CPSC classes. Great for non STEM majors. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it really stretches your brain especially if you are not STEM. Algorithms are like puzzles and if you're not used to using the problem-solving/puzzle side of your brain this class can be challenging. However, there's a lot of help offered and if you put a lot into the class, you'll get a lot out of it. Some of the material is really interesting (the Wells Fargo greedy algorithm application, check digits, how images/sounds are turned into bits/how information is represented, etc). ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0If youre looking for a genuinely kind QR gut, this is it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - even if you do not understand how to code, it is important to understand the applicability of CS. This class helps you do that. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! A wonderful QR! "
