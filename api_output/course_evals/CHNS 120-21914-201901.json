The faculty in the Chinese department do well to create a sense of community between all Chinese students, in each class and between many classes. The learning is not dry; it is very engaging and fun. A great way to start your day!\r\n\r\nOne thing that could be improved are the oral tests. They are usually performed with 20 or so students at a time in a big computer lab all at once, and everybody around speaking can be very distracting. Oral tests may be better reflections of students' abilities if they were done privately in-person with TAs or teachers. ",
