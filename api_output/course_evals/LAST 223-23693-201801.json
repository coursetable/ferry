            "\u00a0I learned a lot not only about the history of cinema in Latin America, Europe and the US, but also about the history of Latin America. ",
            "\u00a0Listening and reading comprehension skills, oral expression, film analysis ",
            "\u00a0The main skill I gained in taking this course was the ability to recognize certain techniques and methods of capturing movement and expression in film utilized by the directors. I also gained an appreciation for Latin American film that I did not have prior to taking this class. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about Spanish Film as well as had experience hearing a variety of different Spanish dialects in the films. I really enjoyed the speaker series, in which Spanish filmmakers presented their work and we got to ask questions. This course was definitely a lot of work, but felt like a worthwhile Spanish course. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the basic vocabulary for film in Spanish. Very little to no instruction of how to properly analyze films was given in class. Instead, the professor gave past examples on Canvas. It would have been much more helpful for her to talk more about how to analyze or critique films in her class. I also learned about the giants of latin film and the development of the film industry at the beginning. It was very hard to improve on any oral skills in this class because it was not at all discussion-based. Instead, we watched movies and read for homework and were lectured in class. My aural skills improved a bit but nearly every single movie had English subtitles so it was easy to simply rely on those. ",
            "\u00a0I previously knew almost nothing about Latin American and Spanish film, which meant the learning curve in the class was steep. Film is a great way to get a window into the culture and history of a given country--and is much more interesting than taking a lecture class on culture/history. I'm also glad to know the lexicon of film terms, such as types of shots, etc. Helpful when watching any movie. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a tremendous amount about the development and growth of the film industry in Latin America. I also learned specific film terminology and how to analyze films. "

            "\u00a0The course was well-organized to learn about the history of film, its impact in Spanish-speaking countries, and its manifestation in modern films with filmmakers that we got to meet. I loved this class! The course had a ton of smaller assignments, which I think detracted from the overall meaning of the course because people didn't have as much time to prepare for a productive discussion. ",
            "\u00a0This course could benefit from a more round table style of teaching, where the seminar size of the class is better taken advantage of. I felt that, despite the small class size, the course felt more like a lecture than it did a conversation among classmates and the professor. ",
            "\u00a0I really struggled with the writing assignments due to inexperience studying Spanish grammar. While I was able to get a tutor halfway through the course (after which my grades on assignments considerably increased), I would have appreciated more immediate feedback from the professor so I could have gotten a tutor earlier and learned from my mistakes earlier. Possibly allowing for rough drafts of the first film critique or the midterm essay would have helped with this. ",
            "\u00a0This class should be a discussion-based class instead of a 1 hour and 15 minute lecture by Profesor Tortora. If this were a discussion-based class more students would actually engage with the material and be able to improve their speaking skills, which is so important especially in an L5 class. Another weakness of this course was that all of the major assignments were due on Wednesday instead of Monday. It would be much more helpful to the students if major assignments were due on Monday so students had more time to work on them over the weekend. Additionally, the extra sessions with the LIFFY directors and filmmakers were most definitely enriching. However, it is unfair to students, some of whom have 2.5 hours of practice for varsity sports or 4 hours of practice for on-campus productions daily to devote up to 1.5 hours of Q and A sessions after they watch a 2 hour film. If a director presents to the class during the class time, then probably students should not be expected to attend their LIFFY presentation as well. The LIFFY aspect of the class must be advertised more during shopping period because five of these sessions is a huge commitment. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the visiting filmmaker series, history lessons, assigned movie watching (and I think it would be helpful to make us fill out the movie guides, at least partially, before class), final project \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I always think it's helpful to have mini vocab quizzes in a Spanish class, though I realize that this gives the instructor more to grade. I'd love to find a way to incorporate learning vocab into class, since we only have class twice per week. ",
            "\u00a0The film series outside of class is really great, though the times can be inconvenient ",
            "\u00a0The course itself was very interesting and gave a broad introduction to Spanish film from past to present. My one critique of the class would be that the syllabus felt a little disorganized. Sometimes it was hard to know what readings we were supposed to do for which dates. Furthermore, I felt that a lot of the assessments fell within a very short timeframe. It would have been nice to have them a little more spread out. "

            "\u00a0Yes, you get to watch movies as work and truly feel like youre learning something worthwhile. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, if you are interested in film and improving your Spanish! Be prepared to go to a lot of the film screenings and to meet really inspirational filmmakers. This course provided some incredible opportunities, so make time to take advantage of them! ",
            "\u00a0If you are looking to better your spoken Spanish through a higher level Spanish class, this one may not be for you, as the majority of your time will be spent listening and writing rather than talking. However, if you are pursuing a degree in Spanish or just need to fulfill a language requirement, this course is a super fun class and the seemingly never-ending knowledge of Profesora Tortora makes taking the class very much worthwhile. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would absolutely recommend this course to someone who wants more than just the general Spanish course and instead wants to dive deep into the culture of Spanish film. However, I would not recommend it for anyone who is not willing or able to put in the work or take time to watch the films. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students who are invested in both Spanish and film with the pretense that it is a big time commitment. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend the class to another student. It was always engaging, and provided a good survey of the classic films of Latin America (I've also watched a few more films since summer began, thanks to the library on Canvas). ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if they are interested in learning more about culture than language ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone interested in film. We got to watch so many interesting movies and even met some directors and producers. The course material was also very interesting for film enthusiasts. "
