            "\u00a0I learned that as a professional within the environmental field, my engagements should be conducted in a reflective and mindful way. This engagement should be conscious of the concerns and priorities of the communities that I am serving and must comprehensively address the intersectional realities impacting these individuals. "

I am aware that reflective practice and a commitment to justice have not historically been prioritized in my line of work, and I am excited to do my part to foster collaborations and work in ways that enrich populations.

            "\u00a0Strengths: Format of the class.  The framing lecture + student lead discussion + guest speak or activity was really great. \r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes I felt like we were pressed for time in class fitting everything in.  Would have loved more time for Q/A or discussion with guest speakers. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided incredible course readings, opportunities for discussion, challenging academic commitments (course presentation and 20-page paper on independent research), unique field visits (Beinecke Library, Yale Art Gallery, etc), and thought-provoking course speakers. I learned from this multifaceted experience and thoroughly enjoyed my interactions with the visiting professionals that came to the class. Moreover, Mike Mendez is a wonderful mentor and supported our growth in the class.\r\n\r\nI believe this course could be improved if offered as a foundations course. This would encourage more students to participate, and the concepts that we were presented with have impacted my preparedness as a professional. "

            "\u00a0Take it!\r\nThere are not many EJ focused courses at FES, so that alone is enough of a reason to take the course.  In addition to that, the discussion-based nature of the class is really great - you'll learn a lot from your classmates.  You'll get a lot of feedback on the major assignment, a research paper, which I think is useful for anyone who hasn't written something like this in awhile. ",
