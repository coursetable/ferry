            "\u00a0I learned about a lot of different theories or prominent thinkers regarding markets and ethics. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about moral issues that face markets and learned more about how markets work in the United States. ",
            "\u00a0Moral limits of markets, efficiency-equity trade-off, theories of justice, etc. ",
            "\u00a0This class approaches economics in a unique way: instead of addressing morality as an afterthought, it starts with questions about how to morally structure markets. ",
            "\u00a0This class helped to introduce students to the major political philosophical debates concerning the nature of the market and what domains of society it should extend into. The course exposed me to interesting authors such as Carens, G.A. Cohen, and Thomas Nagel on a variety of topics such as equality, taxation, and socialism. ",
            "\u00a0This class really expanded my understanding of normative ideas and structures. We spent an extensive time analyzing and understanding political philosophy readings and ideas regarding markets and what was moral and admirable. The essays really pushed me to think normatively about arguments ",
            "\u00a0This class stradldes, politics, economics, and philosophy (both normative and practical). I learned about the key ways in which mrkets and morals instersect. I also learned how to write analytic pholosophical essays. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think about the intersection of markets and morals. ",
            "\u00a0This class delves into the many ways morality interacts with markets. We discussed how markets can crowd our morals, things money cant buy and many other fascinating topics. ",
            "\u00a0This course was particularly helpful for me to better understand moral philosophy. I had never before considered many of the topics: Is it moral to pay to cut in line? What should and should not be sold? Should taxes be used to redistribute wealth? It was very interesting to hear the wide range of opinions from my peers. ",
            "\u00a0This class helped me learn how to be very precise in my logical argumentation. I also learned a lot about the interaction between markets and morals, which may seem obvious, but shows that the course achieved its objective. "

            "\u00a0The topic is interesting. I think we could have covered more in less detail and it would have been better. The kids in the class were kind of small minded which decreased my enjoyment and learning. The readings varied from being engaging and doable to too long/too complex to really process. The papers were a bit too vague in topic. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Quality of discussion\r\nWeaknesses: There were times in which more time is spent on lectures than discussions. Expectations for papers could be discussed in class. ",
            "\u00a0This class was great. The syllabus was well thought through and Professor Gajevic was receptive to feedback. He started to have us debate and did a better job of facilitating discussion after our midterm feedback. The three short papers with a longer paper at the end were a great way to think about the material. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength of the course was that provided a fascinating syllabus that helped to counter the growth of neoliberal, over-economized thinking that has gripped academic departments recently. Professor Gajevic effectively stoked discussion about the theoretical limits of markets, and how markets fail when they are extended to encompass all of society.\r\n\r\nThere were, however, many weaknesses to the course. First, the flow of the seminar was extremely disjointed because Professor Gajevic mostly lectured from a powerpoint that summarized the readings. Professor Gajevic is exceptionally kind and enthusiastic, but sometimes his energy was hard to follow and his comments trailed off. The readings, though interesting, were not especially in depth. Altogether, the syllabus compiled an interesting list of readings but felt like a superficial gloss over major topics. Since the seminar was mostly directed by powerpoint and lecture, the class participation was prompted by questions that felt loaded and angled towards certain perspectives. Class discussion was mostly shallow, and only got better as the semester continued and we did more group work. ",
            "\u00a0This was a great class. I really learned a lot, and the material was interesting and engaging. The content was not too dense, but it still pushed me to think critically and learn. The only weakness would be this course tends to lean too heavily towards lecture rather than discussion. ",
            "\u00a0This is a really really fantastic course. The strengths include: well-designed syllabus, and thoroughly prepared class presentations, engaging teaching, interesting paper topics and very helpful feedback. Another big strength to the class is the level of participation - professor Gajevic is great and facilitating student discussion and I think that made the class even more interesting. Weaknesses include: we had one long class once a week and that could be a bit too tiring for me - Id rather split it up I think. Im finding it hard to think of anything else to criticise. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very interesting topic and great discussions\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none that I can think of ",
            "\u00a0Professor Sayegh is amazing and encourages everyone to share their thoughts on the readings. He facilities fantastic class discussions! ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed this class the most when there was an even mix between lectures and class discussions. There were times when I felt like there was too much lecturing, but at the same time all of the information was important, so I understand that it is difficult to find a right balance. Professor Sayegh is an excellent professor who keeps the class engaged and I actively look forward to attending every week. "

            "\u00a0Probably not. It really depends on how willing the other students are to be intellectually curious and open minded. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. Professor Sayegh is helpful, funny (without going off topic), and great at facilitating class discussion. This class is also a great introduction to the intersections between economics, politics, and ethics. It is very much up to you, however, which angle you want to take in approaching the class. None of the texts focus particularly strongly on one field. In your essays, you are free to choose the areas you want to focus on based on your own interests. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. If you want to study this interesting cross-section of ethics and economics, by all means, take this course! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Such an important way to think about the economy. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course, but only if the teaching style was tweaked and the syllabus made more focused. This class has great potential, as the proper role of markets in our lives and in society is an issue of paramount importance. Professor Gajevic, too, is a kind, smart, and fair instructor -- his enthusiasm makes the class casual and fun. However, the light hearted tone of the class and the superficial gloss over material did not make for an in-depth learning experience. I have not walked out of the class with many more insights than I had coming in. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This was a great class. If you are at all interested in political philosophy, morality, or markets, then take this class. Professor Gajevic is incredible. He is super friendly and willing to help! This content is interesting and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would really really recommend that you check out this class if the topic looks interesting but also if youre not sure about the topic but are just interested in ethics or politics or ecomics separately - I never thought I would enjoy a class about markets but professor Gajevic is such a great teacher and the topics are so relevant and important that I actually loved this class. I cant recommend the professor enough. He is fantastic at facilitating student discussion, he is very knowledgeable, well-spoken, intelligent and strikes a great balance between teaching from slides and having group discussion. This class was an unexpected gem. You can basically decide whether the class will be a heavy workload or not because there is usually only roughly 20-40pages of mandatory reading per week (rough ballpark est) but there are also several recommended readings and Gajevic recaps the texts in his PowerPoint slides - so its possible to engage and enjoy the class even if you dont do every single reading (a huge plus in my opinion) but also theres the opportunity to really get stuck into the material if the inspiration grips you. ",
            "\u00a0Yes-- fits a hole in the marketplace of ideas ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Take this course if you can. The readings are interesting and the professor is amazing! ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course. If your Yale coursework has not focused on philosophy and you're interested in getting a taste of it, this is the course to do it in. Workload is fair, the professor is amazing, and every class has some really interesting conversations. The topics themselves are of things you actually experience in life, and is very relatable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely take this course. Very interesting topics covered, and Professor Gajevic is very enthusiastic about the material, which is infectious. An excellent cross of philosophy, political science, and economics. "
