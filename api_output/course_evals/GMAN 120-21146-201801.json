            "\u00a0Learning a new language in a fun and interactive way. ",
            "\u00a0I finished out my learning of introductory German skills, both verbal and written. ",
            "\u00a0This is a level 2 elementary German course that teaches specialized vocabulary for specific topics as well as general vocabulary. Additionally, it teaches a significant amount of grammar constructions, including the imperative, subjunctive, and passive forms, in addition to many tenses for verbs, adjective-noun agreement, and the dative and genitive cases. This course teaches the skills of listening, reading, speaking, and writing. ",
            "\u00a0A better grasp of spoken and written German.\r\nA deeper understanding and appreciation of German Culture. ",
            "\u00a0Expanded my knowledge or german language significantly ",
            "\u00a0We continued on where we left off in L1.  We covered more sentence structures and ventured into adjective endings.  We also learned more about German culture and history than we did in L1. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely improved my German language abilities! It's actually slightly shocking how quickly you go from knowing literally no German to being fairly comfortable speaking, writing, and reading. I love the immersive nature of this class and the fast pace. It really helped me pick things up and practice them. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more German vocabulary and grammar. The course enabled me to practice my speaking and listening skills with other students and the professor. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: great professors, reasonable workload, reasonable assessments\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: online homework assignments are sometimes are very annoying ",
            "\u00a0I feel that participation could have been encouraged a bit more, and that instead of hand-raising for turns to read or speak, we could have just rotated around, so that everyone would have to practice verbal skills. ",
            "\u00a0This course is good in that it allows the students to practice German every way in some different form. The partner and small-group German conversations and exercises that occur in class are particularly helpful for learning how to speak the language. I think that a weakness of the class that could be improved is a focusing a little more on vocabulary, and specific words that are generally useful in conversational German that is not necessarily emphasized by the book. ",
            "\u00a0- The course instructor was incredible.\r\n-The course has the perfect amount of homework. I felt I was fully engaging with the content but not being unnecessarily stressed.\r\n-The weekly tests break up the syllabus into manageable segments for review. I really appreciate this as I would hate to have one dense exam at the end of the semester.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses.\r\n-Though we were meant to speak freely during the speaking tasks, I would always become self conscious and mentally prep what I was going to say. I think this defeats the purpose. Please consider making them risk free that is students should be able to get full credit(plus helpful feedback) by merely attempting the task. No points should be deducted for grammatical and other errors. Students will then be able to really speak freely. Alternatively dedicate one class/or exchange one class period per week for Kafeeklatsch in which students move around and speak for a few minutes with the instructor and get feedback later. We need to be forced to use the language spontaneously without fear of loss of points.\r\n- The relevance and effectiveness of the final group project ought to be re-considered. Outside the script no german is spoken and they are a huge time commitment. I would recommend making the group aspect optional, in large groups a lot of people get left out in the creative and german learning components and just come on set to read off their lines. If it were an individual or pair project, they'd be forced to do research and think actively about the German that goes into the end result. It also doesn't necessarily have to be a movie.\r\n- There's no need for a humanities class to be up science hill ",
            "\u00a0Good course, covers speaking, listening, and communicating very thoroughly ",
            "\u00a0This is a pretty good class.  Time spent during class always feels worthwhile as we practice exercises that effectively teach.  Occasionally the connect homework has parts that seem pointless but if you put in the work you'll get a lot better at the language. ",
            "\u00a0I love that this course was taught entirely in German! I also liked how many partner activities we did in class. Speaking conversationally with my peers really helped me understand the language better and become more comfortable with it. ",
            "\u00a0GMAN 120 offers the consistent practice necessary to build up language skills. I thought the time spent on learning about German culture felt more manufactured and superficial. It's hard to delve into a subject when we have such limited vocabulary, and it felt like we were just fulfilling a requirement of the syllabus rather than exploring an interesting topic when we talked about things like Swiss traditions.

            "\u00a0It is definitely a worthwhile language to learn and, while the workload is not as rigorous as some other languages, you still learn just as much. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think my introductory German experience overall has been enjoyable, and the department does a good job. ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course to another student. It is formatted in a great way to facilitate learning a second language, and the immersive format of the class makes it so that the sentence structure and grammatical rules are more intuitive. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The course workload is manageable and the German language is really interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is challenging but a great way to learn german quickly ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class if you want to learn German and are willing to put in the time.  It's possible to use google translate to get yourself through the class but you won't really learn anything.  Actually work at it and you'll notice yourself improving. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would! This class was interesting and really taught me a lot of German, but it wasn't a crushing workload either. It was a great balance. There was just enough work to encourage me to think through and practice the concepts, but not too much that it was redundant or burdensome. ",
            "\u00a0For anyone interested in learning German, it's a necessary part of the process. I think the German language is interesting in general and encourage anyone considering it to talk to faculty to learn more about what it has to offer. "
