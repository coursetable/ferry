            "\u00a0At the beginning of the semester, I thought this course will be easy for me. Things turned out differently. Dr. Claus asked us to solve some challenging problems in real life database. Through the semester, I've learned not only to do coding and make tables and figures, but to present my analysis in writing scientific abstracts and in oral presentation. I feel this is very important training for a data scientist.\r\n\r\nSuggestions: Sometimes I feel it's hard to follow class schedule. I understand this is the first year for this course. I hope this could be improved in future.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I like this course. ",
            "\u00a0The course was great and Dr. Claus is brilliant! I learned a lot about regression models and am applying it to my own research as we speak. Unfortunately, a lot of students wanted to be spoon-fed the material and didn't start their problem sets until the last minute. There was a lot of complaining, but I think it was unfounded and students really need to take more responsibility for their own education, especially since this is a graduate level course. \r\n\r\nThat said, I do wish the grading was a bit more transparent -- that's my only suggestion for improvement! ",
            "\u00a0Weakness: Instructor assumes students have prior knowledge of some concepts so she barely explains anything.\r\nInitial home works do not reflect course materials\r\nNo power point slides\r\nstrength: Continuous use of SAS made me understand the software ",
            "\u00a0Very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are the diverse, in-depth regression skills one acquires in just a few short months.  The only weakness was that the homeworks and labs were due on the same day, which made for a huge wave of work every few weeks. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I have learned to push my limits in this course (in terms of sleep, patience, reading multiple books at a time). I learned the core concepts of regression models. I finished the semester with various nice SAS templates for different regression questions/models. Weaknesses: It was the most disorganized course I have ever taken. Nothing was clear. Lecture notes which were scanned copies of handwritten slides, were not helpful. Given the broad spectrum of the regression models, most of the topics were covered superficially. Homeworks were not clear, they required a lot of additional information, sometimes even TAs were not sure what to do. I spent at least 50% of my time during the whole semester for this course. If it was planned better,  I could have learned more spending this amount of time. ",
            "\u00a0not bad ",
            "\u00a0strengths: really interesting and engaging material to learn and very rewarding when you accomplish the assignments. the theories and concepts are valuable though at times may be hard to grasp fully. \r\n\r\nweaknesses: the integral part of the course are the assignments where we get to use programming and creativity to answer the question but this is a steep learning curve that may require a bit more guidance. perhaps emphasize the point that students are free to be liberally creative in answering the questions for assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Given that many students had taken AAMIE the prior semester, it would have been more worthwhile to either do a very quick recap of linear/log regression, or to tackle more complicated, nuanced analyses. Also, if our labs were more interactive, that would have helped with our learning to engage with SAS with respect to the curriculum. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Instructor is experienced and approachable. Weakness: Assignments are often not clear and lack of feedback loops. ",
            "\u00a0For me this course missed the mark. The goal was admirable- to give an overview and practical instruction on common regression methods. I felt that the readings were too disconnected and from too many sources to take full advantage of the subject material. Additionally, having only 4 homeworks over the semester left little room for error. Shorter, more frequent homeworks may have benefitted the class, especially as the take home product for most students in this class was getting familiarity with the SAS coding for the different models and the data management necessary for type of regression. I would suggest picking readings from books available via the Yale Library, or having PDFs on canvas for each section if they are not from the primary book or two. The overhead slides were difficult to read on the canvas PDFs, making review of the material from class (I missed 1 class) difficult. I do think the class would have benefitted from some more examples, and perhaps some more in class coding (the labs were essentially the TAs reading slides, which can be accomplished by students on their own time). ",
            "\u00a0Overall this was a good course. \r\nStrength: practical and allows students to use their own data of interest for the final project\r\nWeakness: the final hw assignment and final project are scheduled closely together ",
            "\u00a0This class is awesome! The instructor first gives a brief summary of the intro biostat class, then covers a wide range of topics that are applicable to public health research. The instructor provides SAS code and output for each topic, which makes everything logic and organized. The weekly lab assignments reflect the materials covered in the recent lectures. The abstract  (JAMA style) required for each lab assignment was helpful in practicing writing skills. One thing to note is that the homework could take a long time (sometimes >20 hours) and be difficult. ",

            "\u00a0She can explain concepts better and homework can also be better written. Understanding the question is an entire hurdle on its own. Working on the final project was a good real world practice. Her feedback was appreciated ",

            "\u00a0Professor Claus is very knowledgeable about each of the regression models and approaches for their interpretation.  She will challenge you to work hard but also gives you the tools to do well in the homework and lab assignments.  She is also open to student feedback and wants to help you get out of the course what you need in your professional development. ",
            "\u00a0There is no doubt that Dr. Claus is a very knowledgeable biostatistician and physician. Her examples in the class were very helpful. But the way of her teaching style was not easy to follow. Some of the assignments were lacking critical information to understand the goal or what was asked. She even deleted a question form a homework that she uploaded before and did not inform anyone about it. And her handwriting was not readable. ",

The content itself is hard to teach and requires repetition and application to fully understand the material. It may be better to incorporate and summary lesson to review and tie in all the concepts together. ",
            "\u00a0We were never quite sure what to expect of the homeworks, and it was always a huge scramble to get our assignments completed because we didn't know what we were supposed to be writing, or what \"correct\" was. At some point, people started to think that as long as you wrote a decent abstract, the actual statistics/values that were reported were trivial. ",

She offers helpful and timely feedbacks on lectures and homework questions. Although the weekly lab sessions are led by TFs, she stays to answer questions. She is awesome, but her handwriting could be improved :) ",

            "\u00a0This is a great course for surveying major types of health-related and clinicalregression models.  You will feel pushed hard, but by the end you'll have an awesome toolkit of SAS code and a new mindset for more rigorous research moving forward.  I definitely recommend to public health students wishing to solidify and practice these important biostats skills! ",

More examples are handy, of course, but if there's something more interesting or convenient for your schedule, I'd recommend going for that class instead. ",
            "\u00a0Good for reviewing materials. Would seek for other classes outside of YSPH for more advanced modeling classes. ",
            "\u00a0It's goal is admirable. I think with some serious iterations, a revamp of the sources used, and a more efficient use of class time this could be an extremely valuable class for people looking to apply regression techniques in their research. ",
            "\u00a0Some of the homework assignment questions are a bit vague so start early and ask for clarifications. ",
            "\u00a0The class would be a good fit for non-biostat students who wish to learn more SAS, study design and model selections. After taking the class, I knew which model to choose and its corresponding SAS codes when I had a data set. The class covers a wide range of topics that could be useful in almost all settings. I highly recommend the class. ",
