            "\u00a0I learned how diverse art critics can be in both style and message. I was exposed to so many theories that I never would have thought of. Many of the authors had insights that were thoroughly fascinating and challenging. ",
            "\u00a0The course introduced me to a diverse range of texts from art historians over the course of the 20th century. The texts were sourced from a wide range of demographic backgrounds other than straight white men, which I found refreshing. ",
            "\u00a0Exploration of identity and art in contemporary art history. Skills in seeing, analyzing and debating the significance of art, and relating to questions of politics, identity, erotics, and aesthetics. "

        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: The readings were well-selected and well organized thematically. I enjoyed the assignments/papers, which were different from those of any other class I've taken, and genuinely fun to do. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: The emulation project was very engaging and really stretched my skills as an artist.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Classtime was not always as engaging as I wouldve liked. Wouldve liked more museum outings/variety in classtime besides lecture/limited discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: small class size, very engaging discussion and intimate learning environment. "

        [
            "\u00a0Yes! This class proved to be a great space to discuss the art world and art theory free of judgment over lack of previous knowledge. Prof. Weinberg does a great job of ensuring everyone feels comfortable offering their takes on the subjects at hand, and he avoids bias while introducing the writings of influential critics. He has a wealth of knowledge to offer! ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend to those looking to explore art from a critical lens, and have opportunities to put learnings into practice. Great even for non-art majors. "
