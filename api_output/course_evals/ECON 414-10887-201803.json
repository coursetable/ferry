            "\u00a0I gained a better understanding of intellectual property law and innovation and how these policies influence the marketplace. I also understand better licensing, pools, and mergers. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a focus on firm interaction, business models, and intellectual property. We did a decent amount of case studies (in the form of group presentations) where we would learn about an industry (e.g. cell phones, airplanes, pharmaceuticals), and learn about the top competitors. In lecture, we learned about intellectual property rights, patents, licensing, price competition. These were complemented by a numerous amount of mathematical exercises related to these topics. ",
            "\u00a0Enhancement of microeconomics knowledge. Learned a lot about parents, types of integration, and the business behind IP. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the economic principles behind innovation, cumulative innovation, copyrights, licensing, patents... Very interesting and relevant content! ",
            "\u00a0Gained some new economic insights on how to value new technology developments for companies. ",

            "\u00a0One of the best econ courses I have taken at Yale.\r\nStrengths: interesting content, balanced workload, fair exams (Professor Chalioti teaches what will be tested and tests what was taught, no absurd twists or arbitrary curveballs like the ones that incompetent professors often put on their exams) \r\nWeaknesses: none ",
            "\u00a0The quantitative part of this course was very good. Professor Chalioti explained the material well in the classworking through problems on the board and giving students plenty of practice material. She also made her expectations for problems sets and exams very clear. However, I thought the qualitative aspects of the course could be improved. I'm not sure how useful the case study was and often found the non-quantitative lectures to be boring. ",
            "\u00a0One of the strengths of the course is definitely the course content and the focus on the applicability of the material. I often feel that much of microeconomic theory is taught to be so entrenched in models and seems so intangible and inapplicable, but I appreciated how the material in this course was grounded in real examples and companies, in particular with our exploration of different companies through the case presentations. Many of our problem sets explore the theoretical effects of licensing and mergers on companies, but I think it would also be interesting to incorporate a comparison of how these theoretical effects compare with the historical effects of licensing on prices and profitability. ",
            "\u00a0The course could use a better TA but other than that its phenomenal. ",
            "\u00a0This course was great! The only improvement I could see would be to let us pick the groups for the presentation ourselves instead of assigning them. ",
            "\u00a0It was a well structured course but more examples and demonstrations on how to do problems would be appreciated. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Chalioti is very kind and invested in her students' success! ",
            "\u00a0Material covered is what is on the problem sets, which is what is on the exams. Very fair class that is well taught. ",
            "\u00a0No weaknesses, all strengths, Prof. is a legend and excellent and enthusiastic teacher ",
            "\u00a0Prof Chalioti makes everything very clear. Her lectures match the psets, we go over the questions in class, and as a result the class is a straightforward econ lecture. The presentations were interesting and not exhausting. A couple psets at the beginning of the semester were quite long, but Prof Chalioti adjusted them to be shorter after receiving feedback mid-semester. ",

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Professor Chalioti was fantastic when she taught Intermediate Micro, and this course is no different. I have absolutely no complaints. This is a very fair course, not too difficult but difficult enough to be interesting. I appreciated that Professor Chalioti teaches what will be tested and tests what was taught. She does not put absurd twists or arbitrary curveballs on her exams as countless incompetent professors often do. The lecture slides are concise, clear, and well-organized. The group project was relatively painless and actually very chill. Take this course before it's gone. It is one of the best I have ever taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This course has a reputation for being one of the easier of the 400-level Econ courses for good reason. However, I didn't think that that meant that it was not intellectually rigorous or interesting. The material was pretty cool. Still, I think the biggest allure of this class is that the expectations for the kind of problems you'll have to solve on an exam is made clear from Day 1. They resemble the kinds of problems you do in class and find on the problem sets. Unfortunately, this is rare among econ (and STEM) exams at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, would highly recommend this class! Very interesting, doable problem sets and great professor! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely! This is definitely one of the better economics senior lectures, and it gives you a really good understanding of forms of innovation and the influence of patents, IP law, and licensing in the marketplace. Professor Chalioti is also extremely kind and cares a lot about her students. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you liked intermediate micro. The exercises you must solve are VERY similar to intermediate micro (lots of algebra and partial derivatives). It's a great way to briefly learn about a variety of industries, and get an in-depth look into firm behavior. Professor Chalioti is also fabulous and an excellent teacher. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is a great class to take as an Econ major. It develops on knowledge you have learned in previous classes. Also, prof Chalioti is one of the best professors Ive had. Shes very open for office hours, super approachable, and accommodating. Shes so nice to the students and wants the best for them. I would take any course she teaches because you know itll be great! ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely! One of my favorite classes I've taken in the Econ major at Yale. You'll learn a lot about innovation, patents, licensing... These are all interesting and incredibly relevant topics in today's world. If you liked intermediate micro you'll like this class. But really the star of this course is Professor Chalioti! She has been my favorite professor in the Econ department, by far. I'd highly recommend taking the class just for the opportunity to take a class with her, she's a true gem. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any majors in economics. I think it was a really interesting course where I learned a lot of new things that I wouldnt have learned in any other course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend taking it - it isn't very challenging though. ",
            "\u00a0Great senior seminar, similar amount of work to core economics classes. Length of the problem sets is more similar to intro than intermediate, some can take 4-5 hours, some can take 1-2. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, good fun, not too hard. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Great senior seminar. Straightforward. Go to class, do the psets, study for the exams. ",
            "\u00a0YES - best econ elective thats offered. Its not too much work but you learn A LOT and Eva is a gem of a professor "
