            "\u00a0This course really helped me better understand the progression of narratives told in Israel since its independence, and has helped me frame my understanding of conflicts and politics in Israel through the additional view of narrative. I am now able to view Israeli media and think more critically about what is being shown, by whom, and why. ",
            "\u00a0I learned critical thinking skills and historical background that allowed me to understand and enjoy authentic Israeli cultural works. For the first time after taking this course, I finally feel verse enough in Israeli culture and history to understand political discussion about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and various other relevant issues. I gained close reading skills that allow me to better understand media in general. We paid close attention to recognizing perspective inherent in different the different ways people express the same ideas. With these techniques, I will be able to be a more critical consumer of contentbe it media or artin the future. ",
            "\u00a0How to analyze Israeli narratives within the context of Israeli society. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a great deal about how to interpret and analyze different forms of narratives. I also gained greater insights into the Israeli consciousness in ways I never would have simply studying its history. ",
            "\u00a0This was a really interesting class. A nice overview of Israeli Literature and culture. It's a very small seminar and is mostly class discussions and guest speakers. "

        [
            "\u00a0The biggest strengths of this course are the professor and the wide variety of course material taught. I really enjoyed that fact that the class mixed novels, poems, artwork, and films/TV to give a more holistic view of narrative structure in Israel and how it is portrayed in many types of media. Shiri is an excellent lecturer and fosters really great discussion! ",
            "\u00a0This course opened my eyes to topics of Israeli identity, cultural memory, the role of media and art in society, and the Israeli history the provides context for contemporary study of Israel today. I really cannot point to anything I would like to change in this course. We had so many guest lectures and events outside of class, which helped make the class feel so relevant in a greater academic context. I can't tell whether Yale just has amazing resources providing enrichment (like archives, and funds for speakers, etc) that Professor Goren was able to procure around our curriculum, or if our curriculum was procured around these enrichment opportunities, but this class really felt resource rich. Regardless, this class seemed to take advantage of so many resources that Yale has to offer. I looked forward to this class each week, and the weekly reading responses and in-class discussions forced me to stay up to date in readings, and since the readings themselves were quite well procured, I truly feel that this course allowed me to grow so much academically. ",
            "\u00a0The reading level was perfect, more time in class could be spent on discussion than on housekeeping. ",
            "\u00a0Very well done with guest lectures and set plans for each class. ",
            "\u00a0I would have liked more literature and less art and music, but perhaps that's just a personal preference. I found it a lot easier to talk about the readings vs. everything else. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to another student interested in learning more about how to view events in Israel from a new lense, and learn a little history along the way. While not being a history course, the course requires you to learn about history through reading narratives, from independence to present day, regarding the Palestinian conflict, religiosity, and other topics. Although way outside my major, this class was always very interesting and kept me engaged! ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would recommend this course to another student. I enjoyed the wide variation in subject matter. The way the course was designed (with reading-responses and in-depth class discussion) caused me to stay on my game. If you are a student who sometimes falls behind in humanities courses that do not require much weekly accountability, this course would be a great option for you. Even for our final paper, Professor Goren required we submit an abstract well before any due date, thus causing us to start working on our final paper far before it was due. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The readings were always super enjoyable and did not feel like homework. The papers were super manageable. Definitely take this class if you are interested in Israel and/or how stories are told. ",
            "\u00a0Yes especially if you enjoy reading or learning more about Israel. ",
            "\u00a0Yes--if you are interested in doing a deep dive into Israeli culture and art, this is right for you. "
