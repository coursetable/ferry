            "\u00a0This class was excellent for developing a strong understanding of techniques used in the field of Chemical Biology. The conceptual information presented in the class was not as challenging as other classes, instead opting to focus on how scientists have used many different systems and strategies to study cells and organisms. One of the strongest insights that the class gave was in conducting science, including practice designing an original experiment with relevant controls and techniques. This class really enables application. ",

            "\u00a0Although I appreciate the breadth of topics covered in the course, I think it would be more useful to instead go deeper into just several of them. I'm not sure the minimal information I memorized about each topic will ever come in handy in the future. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of this course is providing students with a toolbox of experimental techniques that they can use in an actual research setting. I think there were times when the discussion of these techniques became too detached from research, though, and this made it difficult to understand the purpose behind some of the lectures. Including a sentence or two about an actual experiment that used a technique after it is discussed in class might make some of the lectures less confusing. ",
            "\u00a0The content of the class is really cool and useful, and I learned some invaluable information that will be enormously helpful as a hopeful future biomedical researcher.  The professors were enthusiastic and accessible.  I do think, however, that assessments could be improved to engage students more.  Problem sets just involved looking up information in papers, and didn't require much thought.  The NSF presentation system could also be reformed, since we spent a third of the semester listening to them and lost out on time to learn more material (maybe have students do them in pairs, make the time limit shorter, or have them be done in section?). ",
            "\u00a0The course gave a great overview of various topics in chemical biology with enough depth to allow us to understand current research being done. However, the beginning of the semester was very fast-paced, and the end of the semester consisted only of student presentations. While it is valuable to hear colleagues present, it didn't seem fair that the professors showed up consistently only for the first two weeks of these presentations while all students were required to attend every class period. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were engaging and informative. Perhaps too much time was spent on student presentations, felt like we skipped some content. Problem sets were interesting but inconsistent in difficulty -- wish final problem sets had been more like exams for practice's sake ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were a bit long and we never seemed to finish them. The lecture content was great, however. And the psets were challenging and really prepared us for the test. ",
            "\u00a0Hard for person with limited chemistry background, which is understandable. It was hard to know what the professors wanted to emphasize and it may have been better to focus on a few methods in detail rather than speeding through a large number of methods. ",
            "\u00a0Overall a great class. I wish the lectures could have been a bit more spread out -- it would have been great to go a little slower with the material instead of having the entire last month of class be student presentations. Nonetheless, I learned a ton, was definitely worth the hard work. ",
            "\u00a0The largest strength of the class is Professor Schepartz, followed by the actual design of the class and what it chooses to focus on. Professor Schepartz is an excellent lecturer that helps clarify concepts to students while being highly engaging with the material. Professor Crawford is by no means a bad lecturer, in fact, he is fairly good, but Professor Schepartz was excellent. The design of the class is another great strength. The class surveys techniques used in the lab to study a given system. There is not an excessive amount of memorization like other classes, instead focusing on understanding conceptually the purpose of experiments and how to conduct science. This culminates in a presentation on a topic of your choosing, which while a lot of work, is perhaps the most rewarding part of the class. The biggest weakness is that the class had a fair number of students, and each one needed to present, meaning the last month wasn't really spent learning new material but listening to other student presentations, which while enjoyable, was also somewhat repetitive and boring at times. ",
            "\u00a0The material of this class was amazing- I feel like I learned a ton! Both professors were great lecturers, and our TA Angela was also really helpful. The one thing that could be improved however is the schedule of the class- It was really disappointing to me that a full third of the semester was devoted to student presentations instead of  learning new material. In the future if there are a similar number of students enrolled in the class, I would recommend moving the presentations to section or making them shorter so that we don't lose so many lectures. Also because of the presentations, the problem sets ended up being really unevenly distributed (as did the exams), so adjusting the problem sets and exam schedule to the material might be nice. Also, it would be nice if the psets could be given out earlier so we have more time to work on them- especially the first two psets were long, and it would have helped me to plan out my semester if I could have gotten a head start on psets. In the same vein, putting out the presentation schedule earlier would have helped people to plan, especially since there was a two week difference between when the written proposal was due and when the first presentations happened. ",
            "\u00a0I wish that it wasn't so methods oriented and that you learned the implications of the technology as well. Also, I wish that the professors were more available and more willing to help given the high demand of knowledge they require from undergraduates. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course were the lecture topics and the spread out workload. The weakness was the lack of guidance available for the individual research project. ",
            "\u00a0I think this is a really great class for all senior chem majors. You get to learn about some of the most recent advancements in the field which was super interesting and benifitial to me when thinking about future directions after I graduated. "

            "\u00a0This is a good chemistry elective to take if you are interested in chemical biology at all. It is very focused on experimental design and learning about experimental techniques that one can use in lab. At times, this was confusing because it wasn't always clear exactly how one would apply a technique to research, but overall the class was interesting and taught some important skills. Apparently the workload changes each year but for this semester there were four problem sets, one in-class midterm, an in-class final, and a research proposal/presentation. The amount of work never felt too bad but it was frustrating near the end to have a problem set, a research proposal, and a final all within a couple of weeks. I would definitely take the class if you're somewhat interested in the subject or if the other chemistry electives aren't appealing to you. ",
            "\u00a0A cool class, I'd probably recommend it.  It's a huge class for an elective, so you don't necessarily get the relationship with the professors that you would in other advanced courses, but Schepartz and Crawford are both great lecturers and always accessible if you want to dive deeper into any of the content.  The material is all super cool and super relevant for anybody planning on going into biochemical research.  I hope they improve the presentation system though, I feel like they dragged on for a while and we lost time that could've been spent learning interesting stuff. ",
            "\u00a0The course gives a great overview of topics in chemical biology and exposes you to various types of chemistry problems. Switching between lecturers, though, makes the class feel a bit disjointed. Also, be prepared for the class to be mostly undergrads. ",
            "\u00a0Would recommend -- great professors and interesting content ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend for someone with a strong chemistry background and interest in applying chemical experimental techniques to biology. This seems good for people who want to pursue research in the future. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class!! Great professors and a great subject. You will learn a lot. Pays off for sure. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to another student. I thought that the class was structured well, with a handful of problem sets that allowed students to explore the literature to tackle more interesting questions than typical on a chem or bio pset. The psets were well spaced out, with one handed out every few weeks, which made the workload of the class pretty bearable. Each student gave a presentation, which was for me the most stressful part of the class and the portion that I spent the largest amount of time on. However, I found completed presentation to be one of the most rewarding parts of the class. There was one issue with presentations in that each student was expected to give a presentation, and there were around 25 students, meaning that the last month was spent listening to student presentations as opposed to learning new material. The professors were both good lecturers, although Professor Crawford would rush through slides occasionally and spend a lot of time on the chalkboard. Professor Schepartz was one of the best parts of the class, and was a very good lecturer that was engaging while also explaining some of the deeper issues surrounding techniques that we covered in class. The exams and grading were both pretty reasonable and fair. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class!  Chemical biology is a hot topic right now, and extremely interesting, and pretty different from what you'll get in other classes (like biochem).  The class is becoming more undergrad-y (this was the first year it had a TA) and I suspect that'll continue, making it an even better option! ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would absolutely recommend this course! I learned  lot and the professors are fantastic. The workload is a bit sporadic the way the class is currently structured (there are 4 psets about every other week, but you only get them the week before so pset weeks you have a lot more work for this class. also the proposal took me 30+ hours but was concentrated between fall break and thanksgiving.), so just be aware of that when planning a schedule with this class in it. Even given the uneven workload though, I loved this class and it was definitely one of my favorite classes at Yale- I feel a lot more like a scientist after taking this class. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this class was fine, but you should just know what you are getting yourself into. The workload is less than most chemistry courses, but it's a graduate level class. A lot is expected from you, particularly for your research proposal, and the professors are not very willing to help you even though it's pretty difficult to come up with a novel research topic when you've never done chemical biology research. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to a student who works in a chemical biology lab or is interested in working in one. It is a very research methods-oriented class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This is a great elective to take. "
