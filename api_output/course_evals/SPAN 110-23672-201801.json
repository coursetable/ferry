            "\u00a0I enjoyed the course - good foundation to Spanish! Covered a lot of vocabulary. I thought there could have been more of an emphasis on reviewing past material instead of just doing one new topic every day, because it's easier to forget stuff by the end of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Teaching first level language is always going to be challenging and at times boring. I think the texbook was pretty good, I liked the speed of the course and the order in which we approached various skills/topics. \r\n\r\nMy professor's level of engagement, unfortunately, was pretty low, as was that of many of my classmates. It was hard to keep the class engaging five days a week. "

I took this with a background in French, so many of the concepts were familiar to me which did make it easier. Prof. Garca is really knowledgeable and accessible, and the course can be fast-paced at times but other than that it's a very manageable fifth course. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, it's important to know Spanish! And the class is not that challenging but gives you good building blocks for future study. "
