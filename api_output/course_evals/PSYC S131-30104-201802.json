            "\u00a0Affective science was deeply covered in this course, over insights from cognitive, social psychology and psychopathology. I appreciated the at times off tangent discussions that amounted to very deep insights on Dr Siemer's experiences. ",
            "\u00a0Psychology knowledge: human emotions, how to manage emotions ",
            "\u00a0I learned human emotion theories, aspects that forms emotions, and experimental evidence and methods. ",
            "\u00a0As a non-psychology student, it was interesting to be introduced to affective studies. What stood out most to me was how emotions could be measured and how self-report, although prone to subjectivity, is still the best measure of subjective emotion amidst many others. I've also seen how the study of human emotion is just taking off, and am interested to find out more about how this cna be translated into studies involving animal emotion and/or intelligence. ",

            "\u00a0The course taught the basics of human emotion while also facilitating thought and discussion amongst the students. However, it could be improved with more structure; some of the readings and related assignments could have been posted more ahead of time. ",
            "\u00a0The reading load was a little heavy, but reflected the instructors deep expertise in the field. There were some readings that I thought were less relevant and could have been left out for a more focused reading list.\r\n\r\nI greatly appreciated the great assistance given to us by close online feedback through the instructor's forum replies and spoken insights. The study guides were focused and extremely helpful in practicing for tests and narrowing the scope of my learning. ",
            "\u00a0Dr Siemer did make some mention of the weekly assigned readings during lectures, thus giving quick summaries of the key findings. \r\n\r\nHowever, it would have helped much more if he could have answered our discussion questions during the lectures, as that might offer more closure on the doubts we had while working on the readings. Would also have helped if he returned our mid-term papers and pointed out to us where we lost our marks. ",
            "\u00a0The course outline was not well organised. Nevertheless, the content was relatively easy to learn. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course because the material was highly intriguing. This course incorporated several studies on the psychology of emotion. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to self driven students who can dutifully follow the course structure. I would be hesitant to recommend this to anyone with no prior psychology background because it goes very deeply into scientific papers. ",

",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it but on the condition that the student is open-minded enough to learn independently, and also on the condition that assessments are done more transparently and according to the syllabus. "
