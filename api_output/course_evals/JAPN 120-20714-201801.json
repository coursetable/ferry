            "\u00a0All the teachers are excellent in their own way. While you will undoubtedly develop favorites, each sensei's personal teaching style is effective for learning grammar. The strength of this course is its structure. Very well-organized. The only issue I had is that sometimes the teachers will cover vocabulary or grammar structures that aren't in part A of a given lesson. Also, even though some of the homework assignments say you have to practice the CCs before you do the utilization, not all of them do, so sometimes you will struggle through the utilization until you realized that the necessary grammar structures for it are in the following day's CC.

            "\u00a0Of course! While it does have a lot of work and you must be willing to do that work on a daily basis, the sheer amount of skills you gain and the pace you gain them at is well worth it. While I felt that doing every single possible assignment (especially those that you don't hand it) was not feasible with my schedule this semester, I encourage you to do the daily drills and take the eavesdropping serious. Not doing so will really hurt your listening comprehension. The instructors are amazing and really care about their students. You can't go wrong with Japanese. ",
            "\u00a0i would definitely recommend if they have an interest in learning japanese and the culture. it is a great program with some of the most amazing faculty on the campus that really care about you and want you to learn. they are all easy to access and make themselves available to help you.
