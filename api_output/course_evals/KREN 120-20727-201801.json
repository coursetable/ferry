            "\u00a0My Korean skills vastly improved thanks to this course. The curriculum is well put together, well presented, and very practical. Professor Choi is an absolute dream and I feel lucky to have had her as my teacher. ",
            "\u00a0I learned even more grammar in L2, as expected. We did more singing which was interesting, to say the least. My section is great and interactive so the class was fun. ",
            "\u00a0Left the class a more successful and confident Korean language learner, has made me very excited for my future studies! ",
            "\u00a0In KREN 120 we learn more grammar structures, do readings about korean culture and history, and practice interpersonal conversation. I was able to become more confident in my speaking while learning new vocabulary. ",
            "\u00a0More practice with Korean ",
            "\u00a0I developed my writing, vocabulary, and comprehension skills. ",
            "\u00a0It was a lot of review from L1, but some new grammar concepts were introduced. ",
            "\u00a0Basic korean dialogue, writing and speaking practice. New knowledge of Korean culture as well. ",
            "\u00a0Continuation of basic Korean skills - especially improved speaking and listening abilities. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more Korean grammar and useful expressions and vocabulary. ",
            "\u00a0Vocabulary memorization \r\ngrammatical skills \r\nVideo editing skills [thanks to our projects] \r\nComprehension skills \r\nPublic speaking, to a degree ",
            "\u00a0I felt like this course really helped me refine my Korean language skills to the point where I can hold simple conversations. I feel confident I could navigate Korea based on the level of speaking I've attained from this class. ",
            "\u00a0This course allowed me to become more comfortable with the many grammar forms and concepts from L-1 and to practice Korean so that by the end of the semester, my speaking became more fluid and my listening skills improved immensely.  In addition to introducing new vocabulary and grammar, KREN 120 also provided an environment in which to practice those new language skills.  Essentially, KREN 120 is a continuation of the Korean language program, it reinforces what you have already learned, and it adds on to that with new language skills. "

            "\u00a0This class is very engaging, enjoyable, interesting, and effective. I'm honestly shocked at how much my language skills have improved in such a short amount of time. To be completely honest I cannot think of a way this course could be improved. ",
            "\u00a0The beginning was a lot of review of L1 which I suppose was helpful but maybe we could have learned more had we not done that. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: cultural readings and songs\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes class felt unorganized and disjointed. ",
            "\u00a0Korean 120 is definitely a step up from 110 but not an unexpected or unfair one. I felt like the pacing went well and learning was fun and casual. Sometimes instructions or expectations were hard to understand, due to conflicting or confusing language, though in the end the class probably came closer as a result. ",
            "\u00a0Well organized and taught but sometimes poor communication in terms of assignments, expectations, etc ",
            "\u00a0Honestly, the people in your class make it worthwhile. I had a great class and I learned a lot and it was very fun, but I can see how having a not-great class would make things average. ",
            "\u00a0There wasn't always as much talking and conversation as needed. ",
            "\u00a0It was a great environment to learn and practice Korean in a non-judgemental way. \r\nThe task handouts were very helpful.\r\nPerhaps assigning more prepared skits/dialogues with partners would be helpful to practice pronunciation and sentence making. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: A lot of repetition/practice on new grammar topics made them very easy to learn. Very fun and enjoyable class overall.\r\nWeaknesses: The class wasn't the most clear in terms of assignments we were supposed to complete. Also, although it can be stressful at times, I found that when we spoke/ answered questions in Korean to the entire class it was very rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0The course at first felt like a summary of L1 but this was actually very useful in building a strong foundation that we later built on. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\nclass structure facilitated camaraderie between students \r\nVery open, non-judgemental environment--I really appreciated that \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\nsome days felt more important than others. For example, on certain days, we'd learn a new grammar structure, but on other days, we dedicate the class to repeated what the teacher dictated. ",
            "\u00a0The main weakness was the lack of clarity in homework assignments. There would be the homework listed on the schedule, but often there were no other instructions given. This meant we had to guess what needed to be done almost every night which was often very frustrating. The strengths, though, were the classes themselves. Most days felt like we really learned and refined our Korean skills which was really awesome. ",
            "\u00a0With the exception of unit tests, concrete grades were very rare (we did receive daily quiz grades but because they tested new vocabulary sets each day, each quiz was self-contained).  There were absolutely no grades ever posted on Canvas, which made it very difficult to gauge how I was doing in the class, if I was improving, if I was falling behind, etc.  Additionally, the homework and assignment instructions were not always clear, and Professor Choi sometimes gave different instructions to each section.  But I should mention that there was a noticeable improvement in this as the semester progressed (I greatly appreciated the emails Professor Choi sent to clarify her instructions). And finally, the class was a bit large, especially when one considers that it is a language class.  Perhaps this could best be addressed by offering another section time or by expanding the department and hiring another language professor.  That being said, I think that the biggest strength of this course was the Professor teaching it.  I learned so much more this semester with Professor Choi because of her teaching style and the way that she organized the class (she emphasized learning content well over covering as much as possible).  Professor Choi also made sure to include Korean culture in the curriculum which made the course all the more interesting and fulfilling (learning about the culture of the language that you are learning).

            "\u00a0YES! The Korean department here at Yale is fantastic. The professors are kind, engaging, and knowledgable. Plus the language itself is very interesting and rewarding. I'd strongly encourage anyone at Yale to try out Korean because it's definitely been my favorite class. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. If you're thinking of taking Korean, do it. The professors are great and class is always fun. ",
            "\u00a0I think this class flows from 110 well while picking up the pace. I would recommend learning korean because Professor Choi is effective at making each class challenging and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Learning Korean has been an immensely rewarding experience, and that's coming from someone who absolutely sucks at foreign language study. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Do it even if you aren't interested in Korean culture or working in Korea! ",
            "\u00a0If you want to learn Korean you should take this. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Korean is an amazing language, it is very fun and beautiful and the class and the professor were great! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! You'll get to know your classmates really well and have a ton of great times together. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was very fun and I feel as though I learned a lot more Korean than I knew before. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would. Because we moved rather slowly, I feel pretty comfortable using certain grammar patterns in Korean, and I definitely made a lot of friends through this course. ",
            "\u00a0If you took L1 then you're forced to take L2, but material-wise, it's a great class. You really feel good coming out of the class in reference to your reading, writing, and speaking skills. Choi Sonsaengnim is a great professor but her teaching style is a little less relaxed than Lee Sonsaengnim. This is a great class to refine your language skills though. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student.  In fact, I would strongly encourage students to take it.  Learning Korean is so enjoyable, and the Professor teaching it makes the experience all the more fun!  More than likely, you just finished taking KREN 110.  So, take this course to continue learning Korean as well as to further practice and add on to your language skills.  Know that because we had already learned the basics in KREN 110, this semester was more about review and practice (ie. it was not as time-consuming and was much easier than learning Korean in the fall!). But if that hasnt convinced you to take the course, then take it so you can get to know the absolutely sensational character that is Professor Choi!  She is not only a truly fantastic language teacher, but she also wants to make sure that her students enjoy learning Korean (she is also very lenient and does not assign too much work).  With the singing along to Korean songs with my classmates on the weekly basis, Professor Choi's hilarious antics, and the friendly dynamic of of the class, this class was without a doubt the highlight of my day.
