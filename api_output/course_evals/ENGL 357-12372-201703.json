            "\u00a0FQT gives you a wide-ranging theoretical toolkit to think about and to study gender across an array of social contexts and time periods. Each week focuses on a different subset of the feminist and queer theoretical canon, like Black feminist thought or Italian Marxist-feminism, and provides an introduction to the world of theory on gender and sexuality.\r\n\r\nMy biggest take-away from this class was the content we read. The reading load is heavy, so you end the semester with a very solid lay of the feminist and queer theory landscape. I often found myself reading highly influential theorists that I'd frequently seen referenced in other classes at Yale. Having that background in this foundational work nicely contextualizes a lot of the less theoretical research I've read throughout my academic career and is very useful.\r\n\r\nThat being said, the class doesn't do a great job of teaching students how to read theory critically, which would've been a good skill to learn. We didn't receive a lot of instruction on how to read theory past the first week. In weeks where the readings were particularly long or dense, many of us just tried to get a good hold on what the writers were trying to say. I have a pretty solid background in theory from other classes, but friends who didn't definitely struggled with the more difficult material. Our seminar discussions, while interesting, were often unstructured or otherwise pretty superficial. I'd have like to see Professor Richards spend more time talking explicitly about what the harder writers were saying instead of letting us all circle around the issue with vague understandings of what actually happened. ",
            "\u00a0I developed my paper-writing and my critical reading skills. ",
            "\u00a0I feel my writing improved in this class from opportunities to try different styles and analysis. I appreciated Professor Richards' feedback on my writing, which helped me develop my voice. ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus was really good, and I got a lot out the process of doing the readings. ",
            "\u00a0We read seminar texts of feminist theory and queer theory. It is a WGSS junior seminar, and most of the people in the class will be very well attuned with the canon. ",
            "\u00a0Skills in analyzing critical theory, writing and reading skills, insight in to the development of queer, feminist, black feminist, and intersectional movements ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read theory better and I wrote some cool, challenging papers. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Richards does an amazing job of teaching the class how to break down and engage with dense texts, which then allows us to put these texts in conversation with each other. ",
            "\u00a0I think this class does what it says it will: gives a firm foundation and starts to explore more deeply feminist and queer theory in a historical way. Like many WGSS and esp theory classes, it teaches you to be a better thinker. I love Jill Richards. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: amazing readings, great classmates, Richards is a seminar leader worth having\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: often too much reading to really focus on any of it (but then again, it would be difficult to leave any of it out) ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is in the students and the material. Feminist and Queer Theory is required for junior WGSS majors, and they make up about half of the class. Hearing the thoughts of students who spend most of their Yale careers thinking about this type of literature is phenomenal, and it made for some great seminar discussions. There were also a number of other students who brought related--Philosophy, Sociology, Anthropology, ER&M--backgrounds that integrated very well. That being said, there seemed to be a visible gap in ability-level and comprehension between the half of the class that was already comfortable with theory and the half that wasn't. \r\n\r\nThe syllabus is also a huge strength. Every reading--whether you like the point being made or not--is fascinating and likely very influential in the field of gender and sexuality studies. You get a really good sense of the different strains of feminist and queer theory, as well as the history and development of the literature. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Jill Richards was probably the weakest part of the class. While she's a phenomenal professor, this class wasn't the right choice for her. In weeks where she was in her wheelhouse (queer theory, first-wave feminism, Italian Marxist-feminism), seminar discussions were structured and very informative. She explained the broad contours of those weeks' topics before discussion started and made sure that we both had a solid understanding of the arguments being made and were able to critique them. In many of the topics (Black feminist thought, for example), however, Professor Richards seemed to be less comfortable. Those weeks were far less productive because she didn't give extensive or insightful background and was unable to structure our discussions effectively. ",
            "\u00a0I would have appreciated more explanation of the texts and more guiding questions to help encourage discussion. The readings were tough, and it felt like lots of people didn't feel like they understood enough to talk. It was especially difficult in a class that was half WGSS majors and half newcomers. Would have been really helpful to have a more level playing field. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very interesting and well-taught. The readings were a little much sometimes but usually quite interesting, and class discussion was good. One thing I would consider is that the mix of WGSS majors and non-majors/people who had never taken a WGSS class before could make the conversation feel a bit redundant to majors. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the syllabus and the pairing of texts--it was exciting to see how different authors talked to each other. I also enjoyed the supportive and engaged classroom environment, as well ass Professor Richards' being very welcoming at office hours and helpful on paper topics.\r\n\r\nOne thing that could be better next time would be to make sure everyone is clear on a more theoretical text before applying it to a real-world situation or breaking into groups. Although I enjoyed both of these activities, it would have been helpful to spend a little longer in the group setting, diving into the concepts and making sure we all understood the text before applying it, on some of the more challenging texts. ",
            "\u00a0This course should have been taught by a different professor.  I had heard such phenomenal things about this course for years, so it was a disappointment to actually take the class only to realize that the professor didn't have a mastery of the material and the syllabus had been written by someone else.  The readings were great, but in class we only talked about maybe 1/3 of the ones that had been assigned, and those we did discuss I didn't feel like I learned much of anything about.  Additionally, all of the papers assigned were effectively English papers, despite the fact that this is the most important theory class in the entire WGSS major.  I found my ability to write as a theorist constrained by how much the class and assignments were formatted with an eye toward the English department, which was incredibly frustrating because I feel disadvantaged going into the beginning of my thesis next semester, both in terms of writing practice and in terms of theoretical knowledge.  This class had great potential and has been so good in the past, but the choice of instructor unfortunately did not hold up under the weight of the material. ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus is very very good. However, Jill Richards is not that knowlegeable about the subject matter and was not often very good at facilitating class discussion. There was an assumption that \"oh no one knows what this theory is about\" when the WGSS majors wanted to explore the topic in depth. She focused too much on current events instead of theory, which I felt stunted the conversation. There was also a focus on close reading that was odd for a theory class. Additionally, the mix of WGSS and non WGSS majors made the class dynamic hard to work with, because the non WGSS majors constantly held the class down. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Richards is a fantastic professor of english, and this is where the strengths of the course lay. She is very talented at encouraging students to improve their skills at close reading, and this allows us to comprehend very difficult texts more easily. I also think she did a great job of handling a class of such diverse academic backgrounds. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: GREAT overview of feminist and queer theory that pushes back against normative narratives while simultaneously filling us in on the foundational stuff. Really good feedback on writing. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Curriculum needs to be coordinated with prior Bodies and Pleasures/Globalizing Gender. There were a number of readings on the syllabus we as a group (the WGSS juniors, who all had to take this class and those classes) had already read. Off of that  I felt like we spent so much class time doing work that should've been done at home. The target group for this class has already taken multiple theory classes at this point and knows how to read a theoretical text  spending class-time going sentence by sentence felt way below the level most of us were used to working at and left us itching to actually debate and discuss the material in detail, which we never really got to do. Or like, we didn't need to try to connect things to contemporary issues to care  by virtue of dedicating our degree at Yale to this kind of stuff, we already care. Off of that  there were a handful of students in the class who had never taken a class in WGSS before / had never taken a theory class before. This is the class that's supposed to be our last core class before we go into thesis prep next semester, and having to spend it just explaining the concept of theory vs. praxis is such a drag and overall demoralizing to have to spend each class period defending the validity of theory / your entire major. ",
            "\u00a0Jill Richards is a wonderful, thoughtful prof who kept seminar varied, engaging, and tied to real stuff we all think is important. \r\n\r\nCool syllabus, I liked the history it presented (and how it didnt do it in waves) and was especially engaged with the kinship and queer theory readings (but maybe thats just me). \r\n\r\nAs a WGSS major, it was at time frustrating to have people in the class who had never take a. WGSS class before - this is late in our sequence and when others were just coming to convos weve had many times before, that could be a drag. Maybe there should be suggested prerequisites. ",
            "\u00a0Often, there was too much reading. We wouldn't have enough time to really talk about the readings before we had to move to the next in the interest of time. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Definitely would recommend for the readings alone. Discussion wasn't always perfect - sometimes one or two voices might take over - but you can learn as much from your classmates as you can from the texts. A good canonical WGSS class. If you're coming from a non-WGSS background, though, it might be a little more difficult to jump right in, since this is a required class for majors and they don't mess around. ",
            "\u00a0If you're a WGSS major, you have to take it. If you're not, think carefully about why you want to take this class before enrolling. This has the potential to be a great class IF AND ONLY IF you're already pretty comfortable in the world of social theory and gender studies AND you're willing to put in the time to do all of the (many) readings. This should not be the first WGSS class you take. I'd recommend Sex & Gender in Society if you're looking a good intro class. If you're not at least somewhat versed in gender theory already, the readings will probably be pretty difficult given how dense and long some of them are. You also really have to do the readings. Seminar discussions will be useless if you haven't, and there's no real way to BS your way through. \r\n\r\nThat being said, if you want to develop a solid theoretical toolkit to think about and to study gender and sexuality, this is the class for you. You cover a wide historical and ideological range of theorists, and it gives you a really solid lay of the land. If you've ever wanted to understand the references made to 'foundational works' in your other gender-related classes, this will help you get there. If you've ever wanted to know where concepts like \"intersectionality\" and \"emotional labor\" come from, take this class.\r\n\r\nAs a note, Jill Richards is an okay professor if you're dedicated to the subject matter, but there are definitely better people to teach FQT. Jill has a phenomenal reputation, but this class really didn't showcase her skills as an educator. Don't take this class just for her or you'll be disappointed. She's not a reason to avoid this class, though. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a lot of reading but definitely worth it. Take it if you're excited about reading a lot of theory, which can be quite dense, and in trying to parse through it in class. A lot of what we did was summarizing the readings, which I found very helpful but others found annoying. But the thing is, the readings are hard enough that spending significant time parsing them is quite helpful. ",
            "\u00a0A wonderful syllabus with which everyone should spend time. If you're at all interested in social justice, what intersectional feminism really is or how to smash the patriarchy, take this course. I found it inspiring and engaging. Some texts are hard, but you'll be proud of how much you learn at the end of the semester even if you never fully understand the most challenging texts. Take it, especially if it's with Prof Richards! She's great. ",
            "\u00a0Take it with a different professor. It's supposed to be an amazing class when it's taught by someone with a depth of knowledge in the field, and I'm extremely disappointed that the WGSS department let me down this year by appointing an English professor to teach the major's most foundational theory class. ",
            "\u00a0I had high expectations for the course, having heard really good things from other students and of Margaret Homans. The syllabus was really good; however, I didn't learn much from discussion section as some of the students had no background in the texts. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Whoever is teaching it (Professor Richards was great, def take it if she's teaching) this material is incredibly interesting and important. ",
            "\u00a0WGSS 340 is the required course for all juniors in the WGSS major, so if you're a WGSS major, you're going to take it, and also congrats on choosing the best major at Yale! If you're a non-major, if you have never taken a theory class before I would strongly caution against taking this class as your first WGSS class. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a fantastic introduction to feminist and queer theory. As someone not majoring in any of the departments under which the course is listed, I felt that it managed to be intellectually challenging but not overwhelming. Professor Richards was fantastic. I felt that she facilitated class discussion very well, steering the conversation to interesting passages, encouraging analysis, and ensuring that everyone had an input. I took the course because I wanted exposure to theoretical frameworks for analyzing many of the same issues I was examining in my own major, and it did not disappoint. If you have any interest in the course material, take it with Professor Richards! "
