            "\u00a0I think this was a good survey course of most issues in air pollution. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about certain pollutants and their sources. There was a lot of interesting policy brainstorming as well so we got some of the bigger picture. "

            "\u00a0This class has been my favourite I've taken so far at Yale. I found it really difficult but Prof. Drew and the TA, Reed, were incredibly helpful and understanding. I really liked how Drew makes the class as interactive as possible. I normally don't feel comfortable raising my hand to ask questions but the environment was really welcoming. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the teaching style and thought it was effective and appreciated the timeline of the course paper. I thought that the pre-class lectures were slightly less effective, but appreciated the base they gave to talk about the material in class time. ",
            "\u00a0I think that in class I learned a lot from discussion, but I wish it was a lot less qualitative of a class. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is in the group exercises where students are able to brainstorm different air pollution strategies based on the information that we learned in class. I think this is really interesting and gives you a taste of the applications of this type of knowledge. The weakness is that there is a lot of work that is poorly organized. Deadlines and descriptions for projects were always vague or unmentioned so sometimes things snuck up on us and we also didn't know what was expected of us. Also, it was unclear what would be on the exam. So a lot of us would study equations and processes and find out on the exam that small qualitative things that were mentioned only briefly, if at all, comprised a major portion of the exam. "

            "\u00a0Take this class! The professor and TA are great. I found it difficult so be prepared to put in a lot of work but worth it. ",
            "\u00a0Take it if you want to learn about air pollution science! The workload was kind  of high but the TF helped make it doable. I learned a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Professor Gentner is an amazing teacher who also very obviously cares about his students and helps them learn. The course material and class style were also very engaging. The course covers a lot of themes, not very in depth, which was expected for an introductory course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this as an elective if you are a chemical engineering major. I took both water quality and air pollution control and both courses were very different but both provided a lot of good info. This course was a lot less quantitative and there were many cases where most of the test problems were free response. There is less emphasis on solving numerical problems but more emphasis on determining what steps to take when taking on an air quality problem. Professor Gentner is great, but sometimes, his directions are vague. Also, solving the homework problems was difficult without the help of the TF. ",
            "\u00a0It's interesting to learn about if you're really interested in air pollution control. Drew gives you the chance to apply what you learn in class in really great discussions and strategy brainstorming sessions. However, the projects and deadlines are unclear and disorganized and it's sometimes difficult to know what is expected of you and when. There is also a lot of work. Weekly psets, exams, a final project (presentation and paper), and AirQuality Wiki page. "
