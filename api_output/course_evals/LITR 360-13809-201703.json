            "\u00a0This course is the first time I have taken a course at Yale that truly privileged the people's point of view rather than a top-down view of reality. I learned to think and see the world from the viewpoint of a people that are hardly ever considered. Moira is the best professor I have ever had. She knows how to make a class engaging and stimulating. Often we'd stay longer because we all cared so much about the material, and had a professor willing to truly engage with us, which is rare at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0This course gives an insight into intersection of culture and politics in the 60s and 70s in Latin American cinema. It is a fantastic course that traces various streams of film theory made manifest in the films you watch. What is the purpose of film in a politically oppressive society? What can it do? Must it always be a means open only to the middle and upper classes? ",
            "\u00a0I learned to analyze films, I learned about Latin America, I learned about the mid-20th century, I learned about ideology and propaganda (and how everything is one/both of those things, apparently), and I learned about aesthetics and politics, and the intersection of the two, and I learned about fiction and documentary, and also about the intersection of *those* too. And I learned aboutt he kind of films I like, and the kind of student/person/political agent I want to/should be. I learned so much in this class! ",
            "\u00a0Analysis of political films and documentary; a lot of historical background on material I was not at all familiar with. ",
            "\u00a0Wow, this was an INTENSE and amazing class. More than anything I gained a rich sense of the spirit of leftist movements in Latin America that peaked in the 1950's, 60's, and 70's. I expanded my personal definition of \"radical\" and \"leftist\", learned more about the way the Latin American makers and viewers of these films imagined their place in the world and in relation to the U.S., and also just learned more about the history of many different Latin American countries (we watched films from Uruguay, Mexico, Bolivia, Colombia, Brazil, Argentina, Peru, and others!). ",
            "\u00a0insight about what the classroom experience can be, the limits of politics and art, knowledge of revolutionary cinema, skills of critical engagement with the political landscape, and much more "

            "\u00a0This course is beautiful. Sure, at times I'd be busy with other classes and course work so the long films were a struggle, but always so so so worth it. I can't think of an improvement aside from maybe starting a little bit earlier so the films wouldn't end too late. ",
            "\u00a0The films and Professor Fradinger are without question the highlight of the course-- she knows and cares deeply about the subject, and her excitement is contagious. Discussion in seminar was at times sidetracked and took a while to return to more salient points, but because many students willingly continue the conversation after  hours, there is always a new perspective to be had. ",
            "\u00a0The films were so good, and the discussions were fantastic (and definitely made me appreciate even the films I didn't like, except for Mara Candelaria, obviously). The strengths of this course are Moira, Vanessa, the films, and the students; its weakness is that it cannot happen five times a week, instead of twice. ",
            "\u00a0Incredibly rich material in the course. I wished sometimes that discussions were more organized; part of this problem came from the fact that some of the members were grad students and others undergrads, and there were different reading expectations of grads / undergrads; often the materials from the reading didn't make their way into course discussions. Overall, however, seminars were illuminating. ",
            "\u00a0A great strength is that the people who tend to take this class and the professor are SO committed to the subject matter (specifically social issues in Latin America), so this class has a dedicated and passionate energy that is really the most you can ask for from a Yale course. One weakness that I actually benefitted from in this class is that there is a much greater emphasis on the film viewing than on the readings, which was awesome of course because it made this a more manageable class, but it also took away maybe from our seminar conversations. ",
            "\u00a0The course is structured perfectly - both the screening and discussion are highly intense and extremely intellectually challenging. Its made possible by the wisdom and kindness of Moira, a community of unique peers, and of course, the unique time period that the course investigates. "

            "\u00a0YES, take this class. Moira is amazing and you will learn so much. Truly engage with it, give it a chance, it will change your life. If you're latin american or latinx and have always found that courses at Yale teach Latin America as if we are some \"backwards\" people, you'll find in this class a community that sees our humanity and wants to celebrate and engage with it. You'll see amazing films, read revolutionary texts, and join a community like no other at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, especially if you are interested in Latin American politics. This ought to be requisite for political science, for it shows what was thought and viewed in the midst of Cuba and the rest of the Americas in the 60s. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Take this class! Please! You will likely hear from almost everyone who has taken Radical Cinemas of Latin America that it is the Best Class they've taken at Yale, and I wholeheartedly agree. The films can be long, and I definitely didn't love all of them, but some of them legitimately changed my life. A lot of them, too, are unseeable outside of this class. And the discussions (which often ran 1+ hours past 9) are some of the best I've ever had. My housemates made fun of me all of last semester for mentioning this class at least once a day, usually mroe--that's how much I thought about Radical Cinemas outside of class. I feel so lucky to have been a part of this wonderful community of people who care so much about the films, about justice, and even about hope (!!!). And Moira is the kindest, best professor you will ever meet. She knows so much, and cares so much about each of us, in a way that might honestly make me tear up if I start thinking about it too much. ",
            "\u00a0It's a very engaging class, and Moira has a lot of energy. It also is a large time commitment, and the films are worth it, but I don't recommend taking this as a fifth course. ",
            "\u00a0I would HIGHLY recommend this course to students who have some (even a small) background in Latin American studies or who are Latin American themselves. I think it might be hard to connect to the subject matter of the films if you don't have personal or academic experience to draw from, and we don't spend a lot of time in class going over the historical context of each film. ",
            "\u00a0Highly, highly recommend, to not just students interested in Latin America, but also politics and art in general. It pushes the boundary of what you think art can do, and one's political sensibility. The course is the epitome of the liberal arts experience- the study of a particular subject can inadvertently illuminate an in-depth investigation of something universal. "
