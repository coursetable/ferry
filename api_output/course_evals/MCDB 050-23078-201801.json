            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Kavathas is an absolutely wonderful professor who will do everything she can to see that you succeed in her course. I believe this is the only undergrad course she teaches, so take the opportunity to be taught by her while you still can! The course format was also a strength -- generally, it would be half lecture on a concept from immunology (very science-y), and half seminar-style discussion of the readings (that's where the social science people got their time to shine).\r\n Weaknesses: the workload fluctuates a lot from week to week, so you really need to stay on top of the syllabus. P-sets are pretty routine & uniform in length, but some weeks the reading is 5 pages and other weeks it's 100. Also, the lectures often made little sense to me as they were happening since they were pretty fast-paced, but Professor Kavathas provides a course booklet that explains everything & also recaps the lecture from the class before at the beginning of each class, so it's still possible to grasp if you don't understand it in the moment. Just don't do what I did and wait until the night before the midterm to read through the course booklet & comprehend everything. ",
