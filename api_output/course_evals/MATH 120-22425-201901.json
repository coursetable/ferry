            "\u00a0I learned how to apply previous calculus skills to three dimensions. The course builds well off of the previous calculus sequence at Yale and is much more applicable in terms if examples (by nature of it being in three dimensions). Topics include vectors, functions of two/three variables, extrema, planes, parametric surfaces, integration over multiple dimensions, vector and line integrals, and vector theorems. ",
            "\u00a0Mental yoga, as Brett called it <3 ",
            "\u00a0I developed a lot of of skills. \r\n\r\nI learned multiple types of integrals and new derivatives, and I also learned vector calculus. \r\n\r\nI learned how to think in 3 dimensions and even how to draw some functions in 3D. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about multivariable calculus for the first time, and solidified my previous calculus knowledge from high school and Math 115. My ability to visualize graphs, both in two and three dimensions, also improved, in addition to my understanding of vectors. I can safely say that I don't despise vectors anymore. ",
            "\u00a0Multivariable calculus teaches you to think in three dimensions, and functions in three dimensions (and/or more). The class definitely brings together everything you've learned about calculus thus far and caps off the sequence nicely. ",

The lectures were formatted well to facilitate learning and review important concepts before launching into new material. Exams were relatively clear content-wise; no surprises\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course is very fast-paced, especially towards the end. At some points I felt my head spinning; it is certainly easy to become overwhelmed. ",

You learn how a lot of the basic problem-solving tools in prior calculus classes are useful in various fields, such as physics. ",
