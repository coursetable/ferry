            "\u00a0Learned how American law intersects with public education, and the difficulties/boundaries in determining what is constitutionally appropriate when dealing with school and children. ",
            "\u00a0I have a lot more respect for school principals and administrators than I did when I was a high school student. Casebook had a lot of great realistic examples of things that could happen at a school and I was challenged repeatedly to apply cases we had discussed to figure out what as a principal I should do in response. \r\n\r\nAlso, first real law-type class with a casebook so I got a lot better at learning how to read decisions. ",
            "\u00a0I developed an overall understanding of the most notable cases and topics in education law, and built skills in reading legal cases and approaching problems from the perspective of a lawyer. ",

            "\u00a0I loved this class. I learned so much about how to read cases and how to apply previous cases to figure out how I would potentially rule if I were a judge. It really made me think and has helped prepare me for law school. ",
            "\u00a0Where to start? I learned so much in this coursehow to approach education law and analyze case literature was just the tip of the iceberg. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a tremendous amount about the diversity and depth of legal issues within education, and I also developed critical thinking skills related to assessing and evaluating judicial decisions. ",
            "\u00a0I got a glimpse of legal issues in education (e.g., desegregation, school finance, special education, discipline, search and seizure, free speech, religious freedom) and learned how courts apply broad legal principles to specific fact patterns in order to arrive at a decision. Reading seminal court cases also exposed me to how lawyers think and write. "

        [
            "\u00a0The course is very interesting and the subject matter is straightforward/in a narrowly focused sector, so that it was easy to focus my attention. There's a lot of reading, though, and I suppose it can't really be helped because it's a law class. ",
            "\u00a0I'd be curious to know what other students thought about the class size this term, since I believe that more students were taking the seminar than it is usually designed for. I don't have a reference point to compare to but did not find it particularly difficult to follow the course or get in an opinion when I had one. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: great readings, good flexibility with the essays/overall structure\r\nWeaknesses: the seminar sometimes felt a bit too large, which may have impeded conversation/participation ",
            "\u00a0More a lecture than a seminar, but Garfinkel is a great lecturer ",
            "\u00a0I wish the seminar had been a bit smaller -- there were a few too many people to have a really organic conversation ",
            "\u00a0proffesor garfinkel is a wealth of knowledge ",
            "\u00a0Judge Garfinkel is incredibly knowledgeable and wants to help his students however he can. He made the class a very enjoyable experience and helped me learn a lot. I also really liked the structure where we wrote 25 pages over the course of the semester whenever we wanted because it gave me flexibility to work around other due dates in other classes. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed listening to Professor Garfinkel talk about the history surrounding many of the court cases that we went over; it provided an added level of depth to the course material that you would never be able to get just by doing the readings. That being said, Black was a wonderful textbook, and I truly enjoyed the readings assigned from it, as well as the additional reading assignments on the syllabus. The only areas for improvement I could think of would be that there should be a bit more group discussion and that laptops shouldn't be allowed in class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Fascinating readings and Prof. Garfinkel is a kind and brilliant man. I also enjoyed the flexible assignment structure (submit 25 pages in any combination of papers by the end of the semester), but if youre not good at pacing yourself without deadlines, then maybe that structure is not for you. // Weaknesses: Prof. Garfinkel is not great at facilitating discussion and doesnt hold students accountable to doing the readings, so participation was lackluster and time moved really slowly in class. Also, the class was way too big and I wish it were smaller and more intimate. // Improvements: Make the class more rigorous so that class time is actually worthwhile and students are motivated to participate and engage with the material. Spend less time in class going over the basics of each case and more time on the discussion questions from the casebook, which are thought provoking and have greater potential to stimulate better conversations among students and Prof. Garfinkel. ",
            "\u00a0There are so many courses in a given week, and it is difficult to get through all the content. Some weeks, we were told which cases to focus on, which was helpful in preparing for class and in guiding our discussion. Also, I actually like the cold-calling style in discussion (and think it could be used more) because it keeps the class engaged and allows for everyone to speak. It can be a little nerve-wracking, but I think its a good learning moment, and makes people think about the problems more.  I think it would also be helpful to have a longer section at the beginning of the course about how to go about reading/analyzing cases. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend the course. Professor Garfinkel is amazing and super nice - he really wants everyone to have a great time learning the material. I took the course credit D, but the grading is a mix of participation and 25 pages of writing over the semester (you get to decide how many essays/how long each essay is), so I think it's totally doable. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked it. I have a lot more respect for school principals and administrators after taking the course than I did when I was a high school student. Their job is really hard. Casebook had a lot of great realistic examples of things that could happen at a school and I was challenged repeatedly to apply cases we had discussed to figure out what, if I were the principal in the situation, I could/should do in response. If I do too much in some cases, I could violate students' constitutional rights, but if I do too little in some cases, I could be liable for not addressing harassment in the classroom etc.  \r\n\r\nWrite 2-3 pages every week or so if you can and the total of 25 pages for the term will be no problem. This class is good for short responses to decisions you agreed/disagreed with or to tackling some of the problems. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! Great if you care about education, great if you care about the law, and even better if you care about the intersection between the two! ",
            "\u00a0This was a great class that introduced legal system basics in the context of education, giving us a means of looking at modern challenges in education through a legal lens.  The readings were mostly case-based and spanned a good variety of topics.  Judge Garfinkel is great and does a really good job facilitating discussion in class.  Would certainly recommend. ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested in law school or educational issues and civil rights, this is a great course to take! ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! If you are in education studies or are interested in law or both (or neither) its a really fascinating class!! ",
            "\u00a0must take ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This course is one of the best Ive taken at Yale; Professor Garfinkel really cares about his students and gives great feedback on assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Anyone with any interested in education and/or the law should take this class. You will learn so much and be in a relatively relaxed class with an amazing professor. ",
            "\u00a0YES without a doubt. Must-take at Yale, especially if you are interested in law and education studies. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this class if you can get in. Garfinkel is a wonderful teacher, and he conducts an engaging, though-provoking seminar. The readings are really interesting if you enjoy education or caselaw; the class would be great for someone looking to explore a new topic or looking to expand their knowledge of the legal field as it relates to education. ",
            "\u00a0It depends. While Im glad I took it for the exposure to legal thinking and writing, you could just as easily read seminal education cases online in your spare time instead of devoting a whole credit to a seminar in which class time & discussion are not particularly valuable nor do they enhance your understanding of the material very much. I dont feel like I walked away from the course with any concrete strategies or mental frameworks that I could apply to other situations in which I might have to read and analyze the law. So if you simply want exposure to a variety of legal issues related to education and have the self-discipline to do the readings even though you can totally get by in class without doing them, go ahead and take Ed Law. If youre looking for a more purposeful seminar with good discussions and clear takeaways, perhaps look elsewhere. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think this is a great course for anyone interested into going into education especially. It is interesting and important information. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting readings and intro to law. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a great introduction to legal concepts through an education lens. Judge Garfinkel is very relaxed and encouraging of students who have little to no legal background. "
