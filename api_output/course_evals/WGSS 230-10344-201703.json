            "\u00a0As a non-STEM student, I learned a lot in this class about the evolutionary perspective of studying people which I think will help me analyze things differently in the future and which I don't think I will get in any other of my undergraduate courses. I now also feel more comfortable reading scientific papers and also scrutinizing popular media articles that purport to present scientific findings. ",
            "\u00a0This is an exceptional, life-changing course that completely changed how I see myself and my body. ",
            "\u00a0I felt like I learned so much about myself and my body this semester. As a woman with some previous exposure to reproductive biology, I was blown away by the evolutionary side of everything, and loved watching birth videos, etc. More importantly, I loved the classroom community and Professor Valeggia. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to science!!! No for real though I learned how to read scientific materials and I also learned a lot about my own body!! I also learned a lot about anthropology as a field!! ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about women's reproductive biology with a bicultural perspective, from in utero to menopause. What's really special about this course is that you learn about the biology, but you also learn about cross cultural experiences with the transitional periods and have meaningful discussions about issues such as the orgasm gap, breastfeeding, and female cutting. ",
            "\u00a0From basic knowledge of female physiology and reproductive biology (that everyone should know) to breaking down evolutionary and biocultural hypotheses and studies, this rigorous course will help you understand all aspects of women's reproductive lives and gain a deeper appreciation for the ecological, biological, and cultural diversity of women's lives. ",
            "\u00a0As a female-bodied person, this class was an incomparable opportunity to engage with studies that speak to my own experiences. The course offers rather rigorous training in critical approaches to evolutionary biology, but it also offers a wonderful community for women to think about how past scientific standards have erased our experiences and insights, and how future avenues of research will better serve the needs of broader populations. ",
            "\u00a0A working foundation in topics related to women's health, evolutionary biology, anthropology, and reproductive science. Equally important, critical thinking skills when analyzing primary scientific research and popular science pieces that interpret them. ",
            "\u00a0I think this class is incredibly important for everyone at Yale, especially WGSS majors, who often skip the physical and move straight into the theoretical. I learned much more than I even imagined about the topic. ",
            "\u00a0I learned an incredible amount about the female reproductive biology, biocultural anthropology methods, and how to critically approach scientific literature. This class taught me how to strike a better balance between biology and society rather than seeing them as at cross purposes. ",
            "\u00a0So much! about the female body, menstruation, orgasms, lactation! Made me wonderful how amazing the feamel body is and led to lots of good cocktail conversation! ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me so much about women's reproductive lives, not only from a biological perspective, but also from a social and an evolutionary perspective as well. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a great understanding of women's reproductive health and why things occur the way they do in the female body. I learned so much about my own body.\r\n\r\nI also gained skills that allowed me to look at scientific papers with a more critical eye. ",
            "\u00a0This course fully engaged my curiosity and wonder from beginning to end! I loved everything we learned and how we learned itusing evolutionary theories to understand human phenomenons. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I wish that the goals of the course had been outlined a bit more clearly. When I was preparing for the two midterms, I was never sure of what was expected of me as we would read a lot of academic/scientific papers and then not even discuss all of them in class. It would have helped me to know what I was expected to learn, but I will say that this lack of guidance did motivate me to engage with the material more in order to make sense of the information being presented. ",
            "\u00a0This class is incredible -- Claudia is so kind and explains everything really well, going into the biosocial aspects of the class topics as well as the science itself. ",
            "\u00a0I think that our room for this year was not ideal, but other than that, I loved the community and the course content. Professor Valeggia was candid, caring, and incredibly well-versed in the subject matter. This course would have been so different with someone else. I also loved the final project opportunity; instead of just writing a paper, I felt like I had the ability to push myself beyond what I was comfortable with and really engage in the material in a new way. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: everything \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none, but do not cave to when people say you need to be clearer about what our grades are or what's on the midterms or what we're being graded on  I loved that this class didn't have me constantly consulting a rubric!! I genuinely felt that if I worked hard I would do well and that was fine and I think that's the way it should be! ",
            "\u00a0Overall, really wonderful class where I feel I learned loads of meaningful information (and perspectives) about my body and future experiences. Strengths: most readings were good and well curated, class material was well presented, and discussions were meaningfully led. Weakness: at times material felt rushed because we didn't have enough time to get through all of it (I think the class would benefit from being an hour and half or two hours twice a week), and the critiques felt poorly explained (instructions said use 5-7 sources in 2 pages, but also said to go in depth on one study/article... felt confusing -- maybe would have been nice to see an example). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: amazing professor and TA, good balance between lecture and discussion in class, supportive learning community, interesting readings\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: syllabus and grading aren't very clear, course is currently fairly back-loaded ",
            "\u00a0Really only strengths. Teaching staff were wonderful and approachable (though not at all push-overs) and students were made to feel that their insight was valuable and meaningful. I loved learning from others in this \"leminar\" format. The content was organized in a great way, too. \r\n\r\nI think the critical analyses could have been structured slightly differently. First of all, two pages is nowhere near enough to accomplish the task we were given. Furthermore, the first one could have benefitted from a mandatory coaching day where we workshopped ideas and got feedback from instructors. It was definitely more of a crash and burn endeavor for me, because I had never before written an essay using scientific sources. \r\n\r\nThe assessments, too, were graded on the way we phrased concepts, yet we were rarely corrected for incorrectly phrasing things in class. I think a discussion section would have been nice, although this class feels like enough work already for one credit. ",
            "\u00a0STRENGTHS:\r\n- Claudia is a wonderful and caring instructor and I would happily work with her again.\r\n- The self-designed final projects in a medium of our choice were an excellent way to conclude the course.\r\n- Enjoyable content in an understudied set of fields.\r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES:\r\n- I don't think the educational structure of the class was conducive to helping us understand the class beyond basic comprehension of the concepts. We would engage with each conceptual question or ID roughly once, per lecture, and then regurgitate those terms on the midterm exams. We did not have to wrestle with the concepts through reading responses and homework assignments, or through a study guide, which I believe would have made the class better off. Because of that, students tended to perform well in most areas besides the midterm exams, which, while fair, were tough (the class averaged an 85 on the first one), particularly because they asked conceptual questions we had not done all that much to practice answering. In the short-run, it seemed to be a benefit that the class had no submitted homework outside of two article critiques (no reading responses, no practice questions, etc., just readings). But in the end, I don't think that this structure helped us comprehend the material in a meaningful way. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this class are definitely how open Claudia is to discussion, collaboration, and personal sharing. I learned a lot from my classmates and from Claudia both, and I felt pretty comfortable talking in the class (though I did feel like there was a underlying assumption of preliminary education in the class that did not allow for people to speak who weren't that knowledgeable about a topic). It's a super interesting subject, and I think a lot of people could benefit from taking the course, and I think it should particularly be marketed to men in addition to women.\r\n\r\nSometimes the strength of a class can also be its weakness! I felt the conversation sometimes derailed Claudia's lecture, and so the lecture felt disjointed or I felt like I wasn't actually learning the content that was intended. The biology sometimes felt skimmed over, so my studying for tests frequently took the form of watching Kahn Academy videos beforehand, which I don't think I should have to resort to after two and a half hours of class time each week. At the same time, it felt odd to have a lecture in such an intimate setting, which allowed for a lot of conversation because technically the class seemed advertised as a seminar. I was a little confused as to whether the class is a seminar or a lecture, and maybe think the structure of the class could be changed to allow for a specific time to discuss or a specific time to get information to us. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the lecture/seminar combination style was very effective, and I know that I left with a lot of information. I felt, thought, that the lack of structure in the class meant that a tangent (that would also be full of important and interesting information!) was not the sort of content that was reflected in our tests. The journal critique assignment also did not make sense in the context of our class, and I wish it had more grounding. ",
            "\u00a0Phenomenal course! Wouldn't change a thing. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the structure and format of the class. I cant think of any improvements. ",
            "\u00a0It's amazing! strength is vibe of the class, lots of learning, weakness is that sometimes the science wasn't always clear. ",
            "\u00a0I cannot think of one weakness for this course. It was so well-taught, so engaging, and really one of the best classes I have yet to take at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: great discussion in class, high level of engagement with the professor, interesting presentations, relevant guest lecturers, incorporation of different media in the presentations \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: went through scientific background on women's reproductive health very quickly ",
            "\u00a0Weakness is that I don't know my participation and journal grades. Evaluation was vague throughout the course in general. Everything else was amazing! "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to someone else, STEM or not. I think that I got frustrated sometimes in this course because I felt that I was surrounded by anthro/pre-med people that just knew a lot more about the information than me and I often felt that I had nothing to contribute to the classroom environment, but this ended up being okay because participation was not a factor into our grade and while studying for the exams I realized how much I did REALLY learn throughout the semester. Also, Claudia is a great instructor who is always willing to help. ",
            "\u00a0I cannot recommend this class highly enough. TAKE IT! ",
            "\u00a0I totally would. If you can get in, take it! I would also say DO THE READINGS, not because you will be called out if you don't, but because I really tried to do the readings for the second half of the course and I felt like I got so much more out of it. Honestly they supplement lecture so well and they are really cool. This class is really cool. You should take it! ",
            "\u00a0If you can get in, take it. It will change your life. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!!! You learn so so much about the body, different cultural practices, and current research in reproductive health!! It feels like a class every human should take to better understand our bodies and experiences. Love the biocultural approach and Claudia is amazing! Just a class you absolutely look forward to going to twice a week! ",
            "\u00a0Amazing! The years of acclaim for the class are deserved. Claudia is hands down and undeniably the most incredible, caring, and genuine professor I have ever met and can ever expect to meet at Yale. She values her students' learning and emotional, mental, and physical wellbeing over traditional academics and grades (and makes that clear early on). I was expecting a greater emphasis on the science of reproduction, but I realize now the class is called evolutionary biology and not reproductive biology for good reason. A lot of scientific detail gets glossed over (which was sometimes frustrating since I wanted to learn more about reproductive biology), and the focus is much more so on evolutionary approaches to understanding women's reproductive lives. That material, however, is fascinating in its own right (e.g. reproductive ecology theory, and evolutionary theories to explain the female orgasm, menstruation, lactation, etc.). \r\n\r\nDue to the course's popularity, it's hard to get in if you're not a senior Anthro or WGSS major, but if you get in by lottery, this class is a must take. Everyone seemed to really love the class, and you get a chance to talk about anything and everything related to women's health for a whole semester. Although technically a lecture class, Claudia welcomes discussion and recognizes that everyone sharing their experiences is an important way of learning. The 1 hour 15 minute classes FLEW BY so fast every class, and whenever I looked at the time, it was always nearly the end of the class session already. This was undoubtedly the most enjoyable class I have ever taken at Yale in my seven semesters so far.\r\n\r\nIn terms of workload, there are two midterm exams (which I thought were fun to study for because of such interesting material), two scientific critiques (which may be the most challenging part of the class), no final exam, and a super fun and open-ended creative final project. There is also a journal writing component, where you journal independently outside of class to express reactions, responses, or stories related to women's reproductive lives. Claudia reads and responds to these weekly, and it is a fantastic way for her to learn about each and every single student. ",
            "\u00a0YES. Everyone should know this information! Whether you're an anthropology/WGSS major or an English major, this course has something to offer. It's interdisciplinary with a grounding in science that everyone can grasp. ",
            "\u00a0Take it!!! ",
            "\u00a0A great science credit on a set of topics that don't get enough exposure. I enjoyed working with Claudia--she's a wonderful and caring instructor--and I also appreciated how the course helped us not only to develop a body of knowledge on a specific topic but also to sharpen our critical thinking skills when reading primary scientific literature and dissecting how those scientific findings are (mis)represented in popular culture and popular science articles. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course in that the subject material is super interesting, especially considering how many things we as humans do that go in opposition to nature, or actually can be explained by evolutionary reasons. Claudia is a lovely teacher  though the grading is surprisingly tough. ",
            "\u00a0Yes it is a unique and really inciteful course. One of my favorites I have taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0This is a phenomenal class taught by an incredibly kind and caring professor. Claudia is one of the best professors at Yale who truly cares about the wellbeing of her students. Take this class if you get in. ",
            "\u00a0This is the perfect science course for a student with a social science background! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to every student. Every single person has something valuable to gain from this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would definitely recommend this course. Very eye-opening!! ",
