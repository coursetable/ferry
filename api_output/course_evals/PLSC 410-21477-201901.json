            "\u00a0I developed insight into theory and case studies of how protest movements form, what allows them to succeed, the kinds of change they make, and their ultimate fate as parts of institutions or disbanding. I also learned how to read more social science and talk about what different pieces and variables make up a protest. ",
            "\u00a0The seminar is a really interesting theoretical dive into how protests mobilize and develop, with particular attention paid to social media's role in 21st century politics. Useful to understand the multitude of factors that might change the success if a protest. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about protests in a political manner. ",
            "\u00a0This course brought to light the organization and capacity of social movements in the United States and beyond. ",
            "\u00a0Understanding of political protest theory and how it relates to current modes of protest. ",
            "\u00a0Learned some interesting stuff about current and past political protests. Strong emphasis on theoretical analysis. ",
            "\u00a0By taking this course, I acquired familiarity with the various theories that seek to explain why people protest. I also got to learn about various movements that I was previously unaware of. For example, Professor Hierro is extremely knowledgable on the matters of Catalonia and the Asamblea Nacional Catalana's desire to secede from Spain (which I had not known much about). "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I think a strength of the class was the readings, because I learned a lot from the many studies of protests in the U.S. (Black Lives Matter, Civil Rights Movement) and other countries internationally (Turkey, Catalonia, etc.). I also enjoyed the ways Professor Hierro took the time to engage us and was always open to feedback. She's a really passionate and friendly professor!\r\n\r\nA weakness was that the theory was hard to follow at times, but Professor Hierro always works hard to engage students with the material, so I believe this problem resolves itself. ",
            "\u00a0I thought it was a great course overall, Professor Hierro is awesome and keeps the topics really interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Prof Hierro really cares about this class and wants you to get a lot out of it. If the roster has lots of ppl who are truly interested, it can be great. Also not too much work.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes, the theory can feel a bit too removed from reality. Theory is important, but the focus should be on identifying and applying them to real world case studies. ",
            "\u00a0Professor does a great job of explaining course material ",
            "\u00a0The primary text for this course was very dense, and I think most people in the class did not have the required background knowledge to deeply engage with the text. However, most of the secondary, shorter readings were very accessible and helped generate fruitful class discussion. ",
            "\u00a0This course was well structured insofar as it focused on both theoretical and practical aspects of social movements that helped contextualized their presence. ",
            "\u00a0Intriguing readings and consistent feedback about class performance. Lots of pauses during class discussion, simultaneously rushing and going too slow? ",
            "\u00a0Slightly dry at times. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is Professor Hierro. While a soft-spoken individual, she is extremely kind and genuinely interested in her students' performance. At times, I felt bad that my peers did not seem too engaged with the course since it was evident that the topics really excited Professor Hierro and that she had a lot of information to share. That being said, I wish the material had been presented to us differently. For example, I was a bit confused as to why the syllabus was divided in two. In the first half, we learned about different movements and the ways in which they tied to one another. In the second half, we learned about the theories that sought to explain why people protest and mobilize. I wish we could have seen an intersection of these two halves since the latter part of the course was a bit dry and lacked real-life application. I also wish we could have had more time to discuss why political theory was necessary to explain the phenomena of political movements. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this to another student if they are interested not only in protests, but also in the theories that analyze and attempt to understand them. Students wanting to learn about both of those things would really enjoy the class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely would recommend any class that Professor Hierro is teaching. She is extremely knowledgable regarding Polisci theory and teaches in a discussion oriented manner that allows you to critically analyze. ",
            "\u00a0For sure! Not too much work at all, but be warned that how engaging it is will ultimately depend on the roster. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This was a solid course with the right amount of work. The readings were dense and challenging, but a great introduction to real political science research. Professor Hierro is a wonderful human and great discussion leader. I've never had a professor at Yale be so open to listening to and incorporating student feedback. I have full confidence that this already-solid course will continue to improve for years to come. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0This course is very interesting, especially in light of the present moment in which we are witnessing and are involved in many movement. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Interesting material to understand for general interactions with societal issues and modes of protest. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah, if you're into protests this could be interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if it were to be amended! Professor Hierro truly is a hidden gem at Yale. "
