            "\u00a0This course draws heavily on the commentary of many art history scholars, so instead of being primarily a survey course, we delved into many of the theoretical aspects of the movements we covered, using both primary and secondary sources. This class helped me develop my close reading skills in an art historical context, as well as gave me more experience reading dense, complex visual arguments. ",
            "\u00a0This class covers modern art from approximately 1880-1935. Centered on European and American artistic production. You will learn about the major artistic movements during this time and how they relate to the political and social milieu in which they occur. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the movements and trajectories of modern art in the early 20th century and how to look at individual works in their larger context. ",
            "\u00a0I learned not only how to perform a formal analysis of many works of modernist art, but also how the history of art is truly a history of the world. ",
            "\u00a0Relatively thorough survey of Modern art. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a well rounded view of modern art in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This course was organized by theme and movement as opposed to strictly chronologically, which I thought was a good and helpful way to organize it. sometimes it would make studying images more difficult, as they were never chronologically ordered, but the emphasis on evolution of concepts as opposed to time is much more relevant. \r\nThe lectures could be improved, I think. They are interesting, but the format and the lecture style is not particularly engrossing. ",
            "\u00a0This course wasn't a ton of work - you have to read a couple of articles for each discussion section to be able to participate. Other than that, one short paper, a midterm, a term paper (8ish pages), and a final exam. The material covered is really interesting and largely represents the chronological span of art history that people like to talk about and think about in popular culture. However, the professor made lectures way more complicated than they needed to be and made simple concepts very convoluted. He wasn't very clear on the distinct features of each artistic movement, and he wrote very wordy lectures that were hard to follow. The times that he went 'off script' were way more engaging than when he was reading from his notes. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength of this course was the quality of the teaching and the cohesion and interest value of the topic. The lectures were excellent.\r\n\r\nI would have liked more visits to the art gallery (looking at slides is just not the same), more involvement/feedback from the professor rather than the TA (especially if the class size stays small), and more guidance for the final paper--e.g. more discussion about what the expectations are for argument, structure, etc for an argument-based art history paper generally and for this class specifically, and a structured process for getting individualized feedback from the professor about developing a topic. Classes I've taken that have done those things for final papers have generally resulted in a much more fulfilling culmination to the class. ",
            "\u00a0Really engaging lectures and great supplementary readings. We should have gone to the Gallery more, though. ",
            "\u00a0I'd like to see more sections taught from the university collections! The modern galleries are real strengths of the Yale collection, and I'd have loved the chance to engage with them more. Additionally, I found reviewing the readings in section to be a somewhat remedial exercise. ",
            "\u00a0It was sometimes difficult to follow the readings without having had the lecture first, but because of the way sections were set up, there was no time to attend lectures first and then do the readings. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if one is looking for a modern art class, though with the caveat that unless one is very invested in the course, one will not get that much out of the class. To get a good understanding of the concept is to be invested in the theoretical readings, which can sometimes be really confusing and difficult to get through. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course since the material covered is incredibly interesting and quite relevant to life, if one plans to live a life that involves being cultured. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. It is well-organized and well-taught and covers an interesting combination of topics. The lectures are very clear, interesting, and engaging, although they are probably more accesible if you have some art history or visual analysis (e.g. film studies) background. The workload is pretty typical for an art history class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Modern art is an incredibly interesting period of art history, and one that I had no knowledge about going in. Professor Rosenberg's vast knowledge of the topic is clear throughout the course, and his ability to explain both artistic movements and the specifics of certain works themselves is amazing (he sometimes speeds through certain concepts though, which can prove difficult to follow). The workload is about the same as other art history classes  a short formal analysis, midterm, final, and final paper. Both the midterm and final were reasonable, a were the two papers. ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested in Modern Art, this is a great lecture. Rosenberg is a great lecturer and the discussion sections are great for understanding the material better and also getting to read some of the most influential scholarship about the pieces. ",
            "\u00a0If you think you may be interested in early twentieth century modern art, this class is for you. Not too large, not an excessive number of readings (although they could be dense at times), one short and one long paper, midterm and final. "
