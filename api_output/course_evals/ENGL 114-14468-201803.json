            "\u00a0I learned to write an academic argument that effectively integrates evidence and flows well from one point to the next. I also became more comfortable with the editing process than I was before taking the course. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to show more analysis than sunmary in my essays. I also learned how to connect two different complex pieces of literature. ",
            "\u00a0In this course I learned essential writing skills regarding structure, word choice, writing to an audience, communicating ideas in both a persuasive and narrative context, and creating dialogue between sources to communicate a point. The diversity of the writing assignments allowed me to explore different approaches to writing, from an persuasive research paper to an introspective memoir. The insightful class discussions were helpful in expanding my communication skills, allowing me to both listen to the ideas of my peers and share mine. Additionally, I learned about the major theme of the course--health, religion, and morality-- and how related it is to our every day lives, ranging from our perceptions of acts of 'pollution' to how we view vaccines. ",
            "\u00a0My close-reading, critical thinking, and academic writing ability improved significantly from the start of the course to the end. ",
            "\u00a0My writing definitely improved as a result of taking this course. We analyzed texts from a technical perspective but also stepped away to look for underlying themes, motives and warrants. I also learned how to write a research paper using Yale's resources. "

            "\u00a0This course has a good balance between discussion of the course topics (health, religion, and morality) and writing instruction. The editing process is also great for an introductory writing course because we had peer reviews and received feedback from the instructor after writing our first drafts, which gave me a better idea of what my strengths and weaknesses are as a writer and what to focus on in the future. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- easy and comfortable with sharing thoughts in class, lots of input from students ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The course was very organized and engaging. The content was interesting and insightful. I received constructive feedback and our professor ensured we had as many resources to succeed in the class, from office hours and a library search workshop day to hosting a short information session on the CTL's writing center. \r\n\r\nWeakness: I wish the course met three times/week instead of two for a shorter period of time. This would allow one day to be designated to discussing assigned readings, one day to be designated as a writing lesson day (learning all about the type of paper we will write), and the next day as a writing workshop day. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very effective in getting students to close-read academic publications that would otherwise seem too boring. Also, the frequent class discussions and written projects meant that one had to be engaged at all times. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Ringel-Ensley was organized and provided plenty of one-on-one instruction. I really enjoyed the texts we read in this course. I would not change anything significant about the course. ",
            "\u00a0All the assignments were well explained; however, there was a lack of explanation of writing techniques. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. It is a great introduction to how to write for college-level courses. It is also highly engaging because there are so many sections to choose from, each with a unique topic, so even if you don't consider yourself a strong writer or don't enjoy writing very much, you should be able to find a topic that you enjoy. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It is definitely one of the more interesting english 114 classes. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. The professor was very enthusiastic and the content of the course was fascinating. I feel as though I have earned a new perspective on how connected health, religion, and morality are after taking this course. I recommend the course to anyone who enjoys writing and is passionate about understanding morality and how it is influenced by perspective. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The topic is relevant and was interesting for everyone in our class. Everyone's writing seemed to improve as well. "
