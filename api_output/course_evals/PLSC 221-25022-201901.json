            "\u00a0Engaging with a rich body of literature on extremism, balancing scholarship with current events. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read a political science research paper efficiently and effectively. I learned how to engage critically with the news, and how to recognize and analyze the ways in which bias is transferred through the media. I gained a nuanced, but abundant understanding of terrorism and the processes by which radicalization occurs. ",
            "\u00a0I view into the nation's past and then what is happening today both in numbers and in trends. ",
            "\u00a0I better understood the recent resurgence of far-right extremists movements and violence and developed an in-depth yet wide variety of knowledge on white power movement, religious extremism, social media platforms, and so called \"lone\" wolves.  I learned about the political, historical, social, and psychological dynamics forming around this important topic. ",

            "\u00a0I gained a ton of knowledge about not only the history of extremism but also the theory and overlapping themes behind the subject. I also developed some ability in writing a research paper, as this was my first experience writing a college-level paper and it was definitely a new experience for me. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a better insight into political science as a subject and how it works. I learned that a lot of it is a social science and how political science research papers work and how one should go about writing one. I also learned a great deal about right wing extremism and why it is so difficult of a problem to solve in America today, and also the incorrect assumptions people make when they talk about terrorism and extremism in America.

            "\u00a0Great reading list and good structure to each class (readings, discussion, short videos, etc.) ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nThe seminar style is perfect, and class discussion was generally pretty engaging. We were able to incorporate and discuss worldwide events that were happening in real time. The readings were very interesting, and even the more dense ones were not too difficult to get through. Likewise, these more academic-style readings were supplemented with videos and more journalistic articles that made the information more accessible. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nSometimes certain weeks would be very reading heavy, while others were very light, creating an off-balance feeling at times. Likewise, the class discussion could get into ruts at times, with prolonged periods of silence. ",
            "\u00a0The course could be supplemented with even more multi-media use. Movie clips and documentary shorts help explain a lot. Even news videos. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Lotito is amazing, and his facilitated discussions were really the most rewarding part of the seminar. He was open to suggestions throughout the semester and organized our class sessions with helpful videos, background lectures, and discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Well planned out discussions and influence from external news sources ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - professor was excellent, interesting course material\r\nWeaknesses - I thought there was a disconnect between the research paper grading and rubric. ",
            "\u00a0The course included a wide range of readings which covered a large span of topics, theoretical texts, and case studies. All of the content was really interesting. I thought class discussion sometimes lacked, however, and would have benefitted from being more focused on the interesting readings. There seemed to be a disconnect between seminar, the readings, and the semester-long research paper. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the way the course was taught and structured, and I have no problems with it. I thought it was a good balance of discussion and outside resources like videos. ",
            "\u00a0I would have liked to have done more in class engagements with other forms of media, rather than only discussing the readings. The readings were fine, but sometimes I wanted to do something new. "

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! The topics--extremism and radicalization in their various forms--can be found interesting by pretty much anyone. Moreover, they are incredibly applicable to the world today, perhaps now more than ever. Taking this class has taught me how to view news regarding extremism and terrorism in a more critical lens, which I think is a skill that would be beneficial for anyone to obtain. Overall, the workload is not too bad, and the readings, though lengthy at times, are generally very interesting to read. ",
            "\u00a0I would. The seminar style is easy to become engaged with. The content is relevant and riveting. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning about the resurgence of far-right figures in the mainstream, the more recent occurrences of militant white-power groups, and the general workings of American extremism in comparison to Europe and the Middle East. ",

However, I strongly recommended the course to others who expressed interest in the subject. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student if they are interested in the topic. It really explores the ins and outs of American extremism and terrorism, and gives you a better insight. It also isnt too much work, other than the final paper. "
