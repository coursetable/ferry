            "\u00a0I learned about the wealth of cities.  I reevaluated my perspectives on urban planning, especially. ",
            "\u00a0In taking this class, I learned former Mayor DeStefano's approach to politics: an investment in social capital, cohesion, and mobility. I read texts on a wide array of policy areas (education, policing, immigration) and incorporated these texts into the above pillars. I also just learned a lot from observing DeStefano in his interactions with community members and approach to politics. ",
            "\u00a0This course offers students an incredible look into the history and current goings-on in the City of New Haven. So many Yale students are unfortunately unfamiliar with the city that they live in for four years. This course does a great job at exploring the history of the city, as well as asking students to think critically, and from perspectives other than their own, about problems facing this city, and what approaches can be taken to fix them. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about practical, on the ground policy from Professor DeStefano's experience. ",
            "\u00a0Although I came into the course with experience in urban politics and policy-making, this course made me think about broader ideas (and ideals) such as cohesion, legitimacy of institutions, and social capital in a familiar context. ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge of New Haven! It's so incredible. ",
            "\u00a0I learned Prof. DeStefanos theory of what makes cities great and how local politics can be used to effect change. I also learned about the history of New Haven and Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a ton about local governance and about both the powers and deficiencies of local governance. In addition, I felt that I obtained a decent amount of knowledge about different facets of urban policy including housing, policing, and town-gown relations. Ultimately, the knowledge seemed to be useful for any sort of career involving cities. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: varied readings, the perfect professor for the class, good field trip\r\nWeaknesses: strange atmosphere, discussions were sometimes too broad ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course was our field trip along Grand Avenue. I really enjoyed seeing our readings and lessons come to life in the span of one afternoon. A weakness was the unclear feedback on our papers and paper prompts. It was hard to understand what the Professor truly wanted, or what he would mark off for. I think this course could be improved with having final projects, rather than papers. ",
            "\u00a0I think this was a strong course. Sometimes the focus was more on cities in general than just New Haven, but I don't think that's a bad thing. ",
            "\u00a0Of course, this course's primary strength is its instructor. The Mayor is a great resource, and whether you're interested in getting involved in politics in New Haven or another city, you can learn a lot from him if you're paying attention and not trying to grind political axes. The readings were also interesting and generally cohesive, but the \"back-when-I-was\" stories were often the main attraction, and rightfully so. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Refreshing perspectives from a practitioner of politics rather than an ivory tower theorist of politics. The course made policymaking seem more realistic, digestible, and accessible. Prof. DeStefanos stories and life lessons were always interesting to listen to.\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the readings engaged with thorny issues at a superficial level, especially immigration and the new economy (we didnt really engage with counterarguments in either unit). I wish there were more readings that expressed skepticism and dissent so we could open up more robust discussions about how to anticipate and counter opposition, which is a key component of any political process but one I thought we neglected for rosier conversations. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Who better to learn from about cities and governing them than someone who was Mayor of New Haven for 20 years. Having Mayor DeStefano's personal experience and expertise was a tremendous asset to the course. I also think the syllabus covered a wide range of topics so I felt like the course was designed in a way that was suited to people with a wide breadth of interests. Finally, the field trip was one of the most fascinating days of class I've ever had at Yale.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The writing assignments did not offer enough room for someone to really insert their own thoughts as the prompts were too guided, I also think that while the readings were interesting and the topics discussed were interesting, the class discussion format wasn't great. Instead of going reading by reading and having the assigned student summarize it, it would have been nice to have had a more free flowing discussion as opposed to one that felt like we were checking boxes.

            "\u00a0Yes, anyone would be lucky to be in this class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student if they have not taken many other classes on New Haven. If you have taken lectures or written extensively on city politics, this class may be redundant. Shop and see if you like the style of the course and determine from there if you want a spot! ",
            "\u00a0I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to another student. Learning about the city we live in as Yale students is so incredibly important, but also very easy to never do in your time here. Additionally, learning about this city from a professor who spent many years of his life running it is a unique experience, not only to learn about New Haven, but to learn about governance in general. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It's much more practical, whereas a lot of courses I've taken in Political Science have been quite theoretical. The practical edge was a breath of fresh air. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, provided that the student has some kind of realistic outlook on policy-making in the United States. I can't imagine that those entering married to certain ideologies gained as much from the course as those willing to listen to the Mayor speak about compromise, politics, etc. That said, this course was a highlight of my term. ",
            "\u00a0YES YES YES. Everyone should take this course for the amazing professor and content. ",
            "\u00a0A very good course. I gained a deeper appreciation for the power of cities and using New Haven as a case study was a really fantastic way of learning about cities in general. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, Id recommend this course for any student interested in urban policy, which is often studied in the abstract and not discussed in the context of local politics. This course is valuable for its focus on how to define problems and organize people around solutions. Prof. DeStefano gives you some useful frameworks and political/life lessons that help break down big issues into tractable pieces. Whereas many policy-oriented courses focus on what should be done or what could be done given research and best practices, Prof. DeStefano asks you to think about the process of getting something donebut something that reflects the wishes of people on the ground, not people in seats of power. This course will make you a more humble, reflective, and pragmatic person. ",
            "\u00a0If you're at all interested in urban policy this is a must take course. It has its weaknesses, it might not be the most traditionally structured course, but Mayor DeStefano is a man worth listening to for a semester. You will feel like you've essentially signed up for 13 sermons from DeStefano, but they're good sermons and you come away feeling like you understand cities more than you did before. "
