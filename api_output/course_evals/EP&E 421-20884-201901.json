            "\u00a0I learned how to read and analyze legal texts cases, how to identify the main arguments and understand the motivations behind the court's decisions The class taught me a lot about the American legal system and ways to think about the ethical questions concerning freedom of speech, the role of race in the judicial system, wrongful convictions, ineffective legal counsel and other interesting issues. The class discussions challenged me to think more critically and from different perspectives and in different real life scenarios about difficult questions like the right to free speech. "

            "\u00a0Karen Goodrow is the primary strength of this class, and the content/experience she brings with her is the second strength. The one weakness of this course (to no fault of Goodrow) is that none of the content is contentious. The opportunity for discussion is relatively limited there is not a soul in the room that supports a sleeping public defense lawyer amidst trial. As such, a lot of the discussions were really just reviews of the case summaries we had read. Of course, while interesting, it kind of drug on. ",
            "\u00a0This was an excellent course and I do not have any suggestions for how it could be improved. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Karen is excellent class facilitator who validates everyone's contributions to class discussions; readings (for the most part) were easy to read and  fun to engage with; Karen pushed us to really explain where our beliefs come from. \r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes it felt that our discussions on \"ethics\" were based too much on predisposed opinion, rather than specifically the readings/something we learned from class. ",
            "\u00a0Karen is incredible and she runs a class like no other. sometimes i find it so grounded in the current justice system that it lacks a certain intellectual rigor in terms of legal ethics. If I had to search for an area to improve, it would be to elevate the rigor of the debates on legal ethics above that of moral intuition. ",
            "\u00a0This is a fantastic class with a great set of readings that gives you the perfect amount of material to debate during class time. Professor Goodrow is also an absolutely amazing professor who does an immaculate job of leading the course. ",
            "\u00a0This is an amazing course! The readings are always fascinating cases that highlight ethical questions or problems in the American judicial system. The class discussions, led by the incredibly knowledgeable, interesting, and kind Judge Goodrow, go deeply into the critical analysis and implications of the readings and inspired me ask myself deeper ethical questions as well. The class discussions are always animated, interesting and thought-provoking, I highly recommend this class! "

            "\u00a0I would, without a doubt, recommend this course to another student. Professor Goodrow is an absolute gem and the EP&E/PLSC departments are lucky to have her. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. TAKE THIS CLASS if you can get in. Karen is an absolute gem who really makes this class special. It's a wide-ranging survey of the law and ethical considerations about its enforcement. I believe Karen is removing most of the First Amendment discussions in future years so remaining topics will include wrongful convictions, challenges to the legal system, procedural failures, and reforms. Take this class just for Karen. She made the class so engaging and interesting and it was clear from every class session how much she cared. She made time on a Sunday to have lunch with the class and despite having a real job (a New Haven judge) made herself available to the class. Cannot emphasize enough how much you should take this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course. Karen is an excellent professor who not only makes all students feel heard, but has a lot to teach (which she seems to enjoy and have fun with). Papers are not difficult to write and are pretty straight forward. Discussions are always engaging and welcoming of different perspectives as well. ",
            "\u00a0YES! I you get the chance this is such a unique class. Don't take it for a dense analysis of legal precedent. This class offers an incredible chance to examine the justice system through the eyes of a Connecticut high judge. Papers are fun and challenging but its such a manageable and fulfilling class, ",
            "\u00a0If you are a student interested in the law or criminal justice this class is a must take. Professor Goodrow does a fantastic job of teaching the cases and imparting wisdom from her years of working with the innocence project and as a Connecticut judge. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to any student! It is an incredible opportunity to learn about the complex workings of the American judicial system, as well as being prompted to consider your own values and ethical responsibilities. Professor Goodrow is one of the best professors I have encountered at Yale - she shares fascinating knowledge from her experience as a public defender and working for the Innocence Project and always makes class discussions thought-provoking, unexpected and interesting.
