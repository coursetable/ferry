Some times they are quite beneficial (I.E Choosing a Mentor with Sam Katz) and other times they are not. \r\nI think this course would benefit a lot from being structured or designed by someone with a bioethics background as I think it was a space to discuss topics of interest to researchers but not necessarily a course that dove into the ethical implications and context of research in society. \r\nIt was beneficial in that it brought up topics relating to ethics and that were good to be aware of when going into academia. The way they were discussed though was in a forum style and less intellectual than I would have liked. ",
            "\u00a0The lecture on choosing a mentor was very helpful and should be given during orientation, before choosing rotations. \r\n\r\nThe lecture on grants/NIH procedures was also incredibly helpful. \r\n\r\nFinal paper was entirely unnecessary. ",
            "\u00a0I think debate should be facilitated better. Most of the classes the conversation was only facilitated by a few students and the professor took a passive role. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: the topics are not far away from our lives.\r\n\r\nWeakness: I actually don't know what the reaction paper is (it seems that not every lecturer ask questions during the class), it is might be helpful to indicate or explain it a little bit more in the beginning of the class.
