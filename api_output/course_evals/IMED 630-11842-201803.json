While it's easy to approach an issue from your own point of view, when you consider the alternative approaches, it becomes much more difficult. I feel this class allowed me to practice deliberating issues from multiple views to provide a more complete evaluation of the ethical problems being discussed. "

Any student studying in health sciences sections, whether medicine, public health, basic sciences, management, etc. needs to have an understanding of the ethical dilemmas he/she will face in school and beyond. This class was well designed to introduce these issues and help students analyze them within the appropriate framework. "
