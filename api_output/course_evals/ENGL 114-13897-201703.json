Also, I learned about a lot of really interesting contemporary and past social movements that I had never heard of before. ",

            "\u00a0I thought the readings for the course were interesting and well-selected. However, expectations for the course were not always made clear and concepts (problem, claim, warrants) were often explained in a confusing way. The readings held a lot of potential for exciting conversation but class discussions often fell short. ",
            "\u00a0I understand that this course is a writing seminar, but I did not think it focused enough on the topic of the course. It was titled \"What does protest look like?\" and although we had readings focused on protest, we never really discussed the content of the readings in class. It had good information on writing skills, but I found the class time to be weak in that we went in circles answering rather general questions instead of delving deep into questions of cause and effects of protests talked about in the readings. ",

            "\u00a0Professor was very unclear about everything. ",
            "\u00a0I think the topic of this class was fascinating and the autonomy we had over most of our paper topics was really nice. However, I feel like a lot of the class time got bogged down in arguing and analyzing the structures of papers which we never fully grasped. Paper structures weren't clearly explained and I think we all got lost in trying to name specific things that we didn't understand. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very well designed to help freshman become stronger writers. It is very well laid out, constantly working on papers really improved my writing technique.\r\n\r\nThe course's main weakness was Professor Moe. He was very confusing. The other students and I would often discuss how confusing he was and how little we got out of every class. After attending class and his office hours, we would usually leave more confused about terms like \"warrant\" or how to improve our papers than when we arrived. ",

Additionally, it did not really help with improving my writing as a student due to the poor feedback I received from my professor. ",
            "\u00a0I think with some changes relative to the strengths and weaknesses section I answered earlier, this would be a great class that I would definitely recommend. It's really interesting in theory but I think some changes in class structure would benefit the course a lot. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course, but not the professor. Professor Moe was a nightmare. Consistently writing papers probably improved my writing, Professor Moe did not. Definitely take the course to improve your writing, just steer clear of Professor Moe at all costs. ",
