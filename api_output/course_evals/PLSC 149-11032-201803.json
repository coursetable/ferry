            "\u00a0I believe ghis course have me a lot of insights, knowledge about many last and current big issues regarding sustainability ",
            "\u00a0I have become more aware of the issues impeding our transition to sustainable living. I also became aware of how our global economic system has produced unsustainable practices and how we need to either restructure it or use it to our advantage. ",
            "\u00a0You learn the basic overview of sustainability and energy policy. Learning the foundations of these arguments is probably the most unique thing about this course. ",
            "\u00a0This was my favorite course of the semester. I learned so much about sustainable development, from local to global issues. I learned about what has been done, what is happening, and what needs to get done in order to have a sustainable future. It made me question whether I wanted to change my prospective major to environmental studies, because the class was so well done and I felt like I was learning about what I could do and how it needs to get done. It spans a huge amount of information, from basic views of nature, the sciences, trade, governance, and business. ",
            "\u00a0More about sustainability and corporate sustainability. ",
            "\u00a0Great class describing the many aspects of sustainability in the current age. ",

            "\u00a0I really liked this course. It was a really good introduction to sustainability, and it really made me want to take more classes about environmentalism. ",
            "\u00a0I think the most important thing I learnd in this class is effective environmental communication and what makes people actually listen. I also learned about how economics can drive or detract from environmental work. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about environmental issues, policies, definitely shifted my political stance a little as I became more educated about the issue. Learned so much! ",
            "\u00a0I learned about how energy, policy, agriculture, and national and international politics impact sustainability ",
            "\u00a0This course gave us a broad overview of all of the major topics regarding sustainability, from international policy to circular economies to environmental justice. We learned more about barriers to addressing climate change in the US and beyond, and how to address them using an integrated approach. We learned more about the successes and failures of US environmental policy in the 20th century to discuss effective approaches to simultaneously consider energy, environment and economics in a 21st century approach. ",

            "\u00a0I learned how to write a policy memo, think critically about environmental issues in the broader picture, information on various topics surrounding sustainability (business, finance, water and air quality, importance of data, climate change, climate negotiations and communications, etc.), and clarified common misconceptions about environmental history / current environmental happenings. ",
            "\u00a0I learned some new perspectives on sustainability and how the issue is complex and can be approached from a variety of perspectives. We covered some of the issues surrounding communication, how to implement strategies, and the history of environmentalism in both the United States and in modern society more globally. ",

            "\u00a0I thought the structure of the lectures in this class was a weakness. Without any guidelines or powerpoint throughout the lectures, it was very hard to follow along for a full hour and fifteen minutes. I thought a strength was how willing the ta's were to answer questions about things we didn't understand in lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Prof Esty has a wealth of knowledge, but lectures lacked visuals that would have improved learning experience. ",
            "\u00a0The good Thing is that There are many key issues and topics discussed all throughout the semester giving the student a vast amount of topics about sustainability. Prof Esty is an excellent, knowledgeable and passionate about sustainability and is the best person to teach this course ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses\r\n- Professor Esty does not use any visual aid for his lectures, which makes the lectures hard to follow and studying extra hard\r\n- grade breakdown is not the best, in my opinion \r\n- class content is repetitive\r\n\r\nStrengths\r\n- Professor Esty is very knowledgable and experienced in this field ",
            "\u00a0It is repetitive. With such emphasis on policy, more instruction and possibly even focusing a few lectures on the crafting of policy memos and what to look for when reading policy would have been great. The strength is the small engaging lecture structure. ",
            "\u00a0Esty is a great man with lots of insight but a very dry lecturer. By the end of the semester only about 20% of the class showed up to class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: well taught, covers a huge amount of information. The workload isn't too heavy but does get the point across. \r\nWeaknesses: it can be tough that the lecture notes are only available during lecture, and not uploaded anywhere. My friend had to miss a couple due to being sick, and there's no other way to get notes besides relying on someone else. ",
            "\u00a0It was a great class, but I did not find the sections to be very useful. ",
            "\u00a0Few weaknesses, very good class. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: interesting lectures and topics, policy essays leave room for flexible planning and creative topics- being able to write a 4th was extremely helpful\r\nweaknesses: no slides - can be harder to keep track of information ",
            "\u00a0Fewer readings. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Esty is an interesting lecturer, policy essays are a helpful mode of learning to write, and Esty allows for student input during lectures which is generally rare. \r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the material was too basic (solar vs wind energy) and the class could get a bit repetitive. ",
            "\u00a0One weakness probably was that since it was a lecture and there were no visual aids or notes or anything, I'd tend to zone out sometimes. But otherwise, it was a really great and interesting course. ",
            "\u00a0The topics were interesting and esty is a very engaging and articulate lecturer. The course lacked structure and often felt repetitive. The homeworks also had little correlation to class discussions, so would often not be done. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very strong over all. Each lecture has a clear topic and purpose within the broader scope of sustainability, and links between lectures allow us to consider the relationships between these different concepts. I really liked the readings assigned for each lecture, and appreciated the opportunity to write 3 policy memos for any 3 lectures in the semester (with the option of doing a 4th). The structure of the class was very effective, and the discussion sections allowed us to review and become more articulate in the topics covered in class. I appreciated the interactivity Professor Esty created in class, and that he was truly able to make it a conversational lecture. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the content but I found it hard to be engaged in lecture. ",
            "\u00a0It is hard to tell what is important and what is a tangent. There isnt a lot of structure to the course. ",
            "\u00a0The class structure and Professor Esty are unbelievable.  The class is impeccably well-planned out with readings, lecture topics, and policy memo topics.  This structure does not change throughout and the TAs are really great about keeping us up to date on office hours, exam info, and any miscellaneous information.  Though the class is taught as a lecture (with no powerpoints/technology used by Prof. Esty--just him lecturing), I was so engaged with every single lecture.  Professor Esty asks lots of questions and encourages interaction with students.  He's so intelligent, well-rounded, insightful, and well-spoken--lectures are wonderful and genuinely interesting.  There is also prompt and thorough feedback and support from the TAs.  No weaknesses. ",

            "\u00a0It depends how interested they are in the subject of sustainability. If they are very curious about it, I feel it was a good overview class. However, I got pretty lost through the course of the semester with the course material. ",
            "\u00a0No, I think there are better EVST courses out there to take. However, if you already know about this topic and are super interested in it, you might enjoy this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the issue of sustainability is a global problem and this class is a good introduction into 1) becoming aware of it and 2) learning what can be done to combat it. ",
            "\u00a0If you have a desire to learn the basics in a low-stress environment, yes. Just study hard for the midterm and final, the graders tend to be. pretty tough on specifics of terms. ",
            "\u00a0It really is an interesting class but only take it if you're actually interested in sustainability. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course, because it has a little bit of everything. I think sustainable development is something everyone should learn about and this class does a fantastic job of covering it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in energy/economics/sustainability this class is a must. Esty is a terrific professor. ",
            "\u00a0Yes because the topics covered are exceedingly relevant as the 21st century progresses and we fail to see productive policy in reducing the impacts and danger of climate change. It's a good course for current events and for combining environmental concerns with economic growth models. The class is grounded in realistic solutions to some of the most challenging global problems. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think Esty gives some of the most interesting lectures in the Social Science department. He also has a lot of expertise in the field, and you learn a lot of valuable lessons about environmental communications and how economics can drive sustainability. Some of the material was pretty basic; however, he does a good job of proposing solutions--not just problems. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! However, I was wary coming into this course as a first year student with not too much background knowledge. It is supposed to be structured in a way that is accommodating to first years, but having this lack of prior knowledge made me feel unable to participate in lecture, which is a part of the grade. Not too big of a deal though. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The lectures were interesting and the class was not stressful. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to anyone seeking to become more knowledgeable about all of the different facets of sustainability, regardless of their academic interests or professional pursuits. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I loved learning this content and broad knowledge of sustainability. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely. ",
            "\u00a0By far my most favorite class at Yale.  Prof. Esty is absolutely wonderful--he has an intense presence in the classroom and sets expectations high with his assignments and exams but provides plenty of support along the way in order to prepare you to meet those expectations.  Start to finish, the class covers really interesting material--it's a broad scope but Prof. Esty presents the material well enough that you can get a deep understanding of the topic covered in any single class.  Really, really great analysis of sustainability in the 21st century, all mixed in with Esty's expertise and professional experiences.  Highly recommend! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. It helped re-frame how I think about sustainability and the roles of both governments and businesses in creating a greener future. ",
            "\u00a0Great discussion oriented course that is a good intro to topics -- note that it is not meant to be a strictly organized thing and taking it casually and with an open mind is fun "
