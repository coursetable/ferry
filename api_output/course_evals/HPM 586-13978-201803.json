Useful, important etc. \r\nProfessor Friedman's lectures are superb-- definitely among the best.\r\nThe biggest weakness of the course is the lack of feedback on the homework. For the math, the calculations do explain. But for the other questions where viewpoint\" was either right or wrong, even though the TA's were AWESOME. After asking the TA's a few times, I sort of gave up.  I got the \"that's a really good point\" or \"that makes sense\". \r\nThat said. Take this course. PERIOD. ",

Book is easy, class a bit harder, homework problems and exams very challenging. I would recommend it to everyone, and I will honestly miss this course next semester. \r\n\r\nWhat could be improved: I went back and relistened to The insurance stuff. Still confusing, the practice problems were way clearer. I have to say I do wish homework were a part of our grade, perhaps graded pass/fail like in epi. Thats bc I find this homework to be crucial to understanding but I find it hard to prioritize it against graded assignments for other courses. If graded pass fail, dont need to worry about academic integrity issue. ",

As someone without prior microecon experience, Prof Friedman was excellent in explaining concepts. The video recordings during the second half of the course really clarified concepts that were difficult to catch on-the-fly during class.\r\nFair quiz/test assessments, usually each with one \"do you really understand this stuff\" question.\r\nThe perfect amount of practice questions available during the second half of the course. Wish there were a few more earlier on.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lectures are quite fast-paced, requiring several repeat listens. ",

I really appreciate how Dr. Friedman used many healthcare examples because it helped put things into a relevant context. I think the strength of the class is how applicable it is to the creation of policies in conjunction to understanding market explanations in the media. This class has definitely shaped how I will think about my own life along with thinking about why policymakers think the way they do, especially those who claim to fiscal conservatives. The only weakness I can see is that it is only once a week: I think if it were twice a week, that'd be nice just so we could go a bit slower but if there could be recordings of the lectures from the beginning, that would also be incredibly helpful.

The quiz should either be taken a few weeks later or there should be another quiz. This way, students will know the material better. ",

The homework assignments are for the student's benefit to complete and are not collected nor graded. Attending section is the chance to go over lecture material homework assignments, and ask questions. ",

I would go to class, then watch the lectures again (mainly because the pace of class lectures is INCREDIBLY FAST! too fast almost...) \r\nThe book was good but not amazing/not as good as lecture and sections. Overall, the biggest weakness of this class is the pace, but the professor and TFs are cognizant and do their best to be available and helpful. I would urge that the classes are recorded from the start, not mid-semester. ",

She consistently tied in-class concepts back to public health so that we understood how the content we were learning actually applied to the real world. ",
            "\u00a0I think professor friedman is the best instructor we have at YSPH. I was shocked she hasnt won that award already . Every SINGLE thing she does and says to the class is well thought out and she tries really hard to balance the applied math part of things with fun and interesting activities relating to health. I have said no less than 100 times since this semester started,  wow, Abby should design all of the core classes.  I know it cant be challenging to make a dry and difficult subject worth learning and interesting (Cough biostatistics cough), but the effort she put into this class makes it so. \r\n\r\nOnly weakness I can think of is that I do kinda wish there was a set office hour. Sometimes I would love to drop by and get to know my professor, but making an appointment seems to formal for that. I feel like I have to do some kind of work (like read your paper) or have an academic problem to make an appointment, but if you had set office hours, I probably would drop by. ",

The questions from the textbook were frankly too conceptual and didn't help practice what we learned in class. I also noticed that some of the answer keys contained errors, so it would be great if they could be fixed. ",
            "\u00a0This course was highly theoretical, which makes sense for an intro course, but when we did go into examples, I felt like the liberal view was very well represented, and the conservative argument was diminished.  Which ultimately does us all a disservice.\r\n\r\nI really appreciate how much Dr. Friedman cares about us and our missions in life. ",

Appreciated her efforts to steer the large class towards collective understanding, being mindful of timing and steering away from superfluous/unrelated student questions during class. Commend her efforts during the second half of the course (after mid-term evals) to incorporate student feedback about recording coursework and ensuring that students had a good understanding of concepts throughout the fast-paced lectures. Initially spoke a little too quickly for my in-class understanding, but this was appropriately adjusted during the second half of the course. ",

            "\u00a0Dr. Friedman is one of my favorite professors of all time! The only economics class I've ever taken was in high school so I wasn't sure if I would do well in this class but Dr. Friedman is very clear when she speaks and whenever people are confused, she explains it in multiple ways to help clear up any concepts. I also really like how she structured the class because I think making the practice problems not for points made me feel more engaged because I was more interested in learning the material rather than just figuring out what the right answer was. I don't think she has any weaknesses! The class went a bit quick but that was understandable due to the amount of material and few hours of lecture time. ",

The problems in the problem sets did not always emphasise the critical learning points either. It would be helpful to have the answers to in the in-class problems included on the lecture slide-decks in order to make studying easier. ",

            "\u00a0Im not that interested economics, and often found the course tedious.  That being said, I feel like I have a very good understanding of microeconomics after this course, so it worked.  Recommend if you want a detailed, solid foundation of the basics.  Not my favorite class, but overall a success of a course. ",
            "\u00a0Provides excellent foundation - worthwhile course! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but be aware that the exams are challenging ",
            "\u00a0AP- fast-paced (for those without microecon experience) but very informative in teaching how to \"think\" econ as opposed to just memorize formulas. Excellent efforts by Prof Friedman to incorporate health-related examples. Can't stress how helpful the video recordings were in re-listening to Prof Friedman's explanations. ",
            "\u00a0It was a great class. I would highly recommend taking it even if you're not a health policy concentrator. ",
            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY. This course was one of my favorite courses that I've taken in my life. I think that it prepares people really well in terms of understanding what policymakers say, which makes this class extremely valuable for those who want to pursue government work. I would recommend it to people who have also taken a microeconomics course before because Dr. Friedman discussed these concepts in a health context and she also delves deeply into the Arrow 1963 paper that, I assume, most other classes wouldn't but is incredibly valuable for understanding the healthcare market. ",
            "\u00a0I would encourage every MPH student to take this course. Helped me to develop a new understanding of the health system. ",
            "\u00a0I would say that this course is challenging but it is one of the courses I have learned the most in. Information covered was highly relevant and I truly feel smarter and more capable of engaging in discussions about current events than I was prior to taking this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, although it was challenging, it is such an important course and the topics are truly relevant to my career trajectory. ",
            "\u00a0Very interesting, would highly recommend, I learned a lot and it is relevant to other courses/things I am interested in in the world ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. Despite being challenging, it was very useful to understanding how the U.S. market system functions at a household and firm level. It has made me think differently and not just in a public health way. ",
            "\u00a0I would 100% recommend this course to another student. This course provides you with the skills to understand and evaluate economic arguments as they relate to health policy on a broad range of issues. This definitely one of the most useful and interesting classes I have taken in my undergraduate and graduate education. ",
            "\u00a0I would summarize this course as an approachable introduction to microeconomics tailored to public health. I would definitely recommend it. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course for someone with little to no experience in economics and who is interested in building a strong foundation in the application of economics to healthcare. I would definitely recommend this to another student! ",
            "\u00a0Great. Will recommend ",
            "\u00a0This is a very fast paced, busy course with a lot of material, but as long as you pay attention during lecture, do the homework assignments, and attend section, you'll do great! ",
            "\u00a0Good course. It really pushes you to better understand the concepts. I would strongly recommend reading the book, otherwise it is easy to get lost. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend! Great class with wonderful concepts. ",
            "\u00a0good course, very interesting but need some econ background ",
            "\u00a0Learn the basics of microeconomics, what assumptions don't apply to the US Health Care System. Definitely recommend! ",
            "\u00a0Very accelerated. Somewhat difficult at times due to the amount necessary to synthesize, given the relatively small face time (once per week). ",
            "\u00a0Would recommend - good intro to Microecon. Great Professor. ",
            "\u00a0I have and would continue to recommend this course to other students! ",
            "\u00a0It was ok, economics is a tough subject, but I've used some of the concepts already. ",
            "\u00a0AP: A good introduction to microeconomics. I am not really sure how I will use this in my particular career but I did find it interesting from a general knowledge perspective and it certainly was a challenge. I  personally didn't enjoy the class environment. I would recommend getting a copy of the textbook, I found that really helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I walked in knowing practically nothing about microeconomics and walked out knowing SO MUCH more and feeling proud of what I know (despite maybe not fully understanding everything). This class was awesome and even though Econ has always been a little scary, Professor Friedman made it really interesting and manageable. It's a very fast paced course but incredibly worthwhile to put in the effort. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend it to a fellow student. As someone who has no background in economics, I found it to be a very good introduction to the subject while still being thorough. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting and necessary but not complicated topics not easy to digest without significant time spent outside of class and utilizing external materials. I resorted to YouTube because lectures were not very helpful in simplifying complicated concepts. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely instrumental course to understand challenges in healthcare. Highly recommend! "
