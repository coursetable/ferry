            "\u00a0I thought the course was well structured and the assignments were well designed to provide an overview of LGBTQ population health and areas for continued efforts. The material was most impactful when it was contextualized in real world events and political trends. Otherwise lectures felt more like a review of academic work and literature. I enjoyed classroom discussions, however I felt John didn't do the best job of reigning in the discussion and it sometimes seemed that folks in class were just talking, but not adding to the discussion at hand. ",
            "\u00a0I greatly appreciated the thought and care that was put into making this course a reality.  I feel like I have a deeper critical understanding of the health issues faced by the LGBTQ population and am able to raise questions that I had not been able to conceptualize before this semester. ",
            "\u00a0could be better organized. ",
            "\u00a0The assignments were interesting (didn't just feel like busy work), and the guest speakers were incredible. ",
            "\u00a0One of the best classes Ive taken ! ",
            "\u00a0I am SO glad this course was offered at YSPH! It was excellent, and I looked forward to it every week. I thought I was knowledgeable about LGBTQ health going into the course but realized I had so much to learn. Dr. Pachankis organized the class in a really interesting way and helped us to critically consider emerging LGBTQ health issues. I enjoyed how interdisciplinary the course was (students from several Yale schools), and liked every guest speaker. The workload was manageable and I found the variety of assignments (and assignments throughout the semester, rather than a giant final paper) to be conducive to learning. ",
            "\u00a0This course was great introduction to Public Health and as such I was well pleased. I would have apprecited more discussion of the topics. It was a bit lecture heavy, and did not always think it was necessary for me to do the reading before hand as such. ",
            "\u00a0Overall I very much enjoyed this course! The workload felt appropriate (about 4 readings a week and short writing assignments most weeks). I enjoyed the shorter assignments (news segment, policy memo, designing an intervention, etc.) as they allowed me to practice different writing styles and writing/presenting for different audiences. Also, I very much valued writing about the same LGBTQ health topic throughout the semester as this gave me the opportunity to become familiar with the body of literature on my chosen topic. \r\n\r\nClass discussions were always insightful and the classroom environment was respectful and engaging. Finally, I feel like I've come away with a wealth of knowledge about LGBTQ research methods, which made this class more than just topic-based. \r\n\r\nOne weakness was perhaps the emphasis on LGBTQ mental health. For me this was okay, but I know some of my peers wanted more focus on other health outcomes. ",
            "\u00a0This course was incredible, and not to mention a milestone for the University. ",
            "\u00a0This course allowed for a deep discussion of LGBTQ population health. Such discussion went beyond the typical conversation that happens in courses that have varying focus and part of that strength actually stems from it's weakness: most of the students in the class were LGBTQ themselves. This allowed (for the most part) students to speak freely from a place of deep passion and investment while typically not getting offended. I wish that courses here at YSPH could take note from this class and find ways to nurture conversations on difficult topics such as minority health disparities the same way that this course allowed.

            "\u00a0John is fantastic! I would ask him to please speak a little louder. I wear hearing aids and had a hard time hearing him sometimes.\r\n\r\nAlso, I wanted to hear more from John in terms of political beliefs, personal experiences, etc. Something to contextualize his work and lectures better. ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Pachankis is an outstanding professor.  His passion for this material is evident in the care he took in addressing as many topics as possible under the umbrella of the course topic.  He posed questions to the class that prompted us to think critically and question our previous understanding of experiences of the LGBTQ community. ",
            "\u00a0good lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0Clearly very knowledgable; I liked how he acknowledged student's perspectives and allowed everyone to ask questions as needed (never felt like he was shutting people down) ",
            "\u00a0Amazing, kind, approachable, knowledgeable, absolute sweetheart! John is the best ! ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Pachankis was great! I appreciate how much effort he put into creating the content for this course. The lectures were engaging and the grading was fair. He created a positive learning environment that we all looked forward to each week. It was great to be able to hear about his interesting and important LGBTQ research around the world. ",
            "\u00a0He did well and I appreciate his bringing in different experts. ",
            "\u00a0John is a great instructor! I learned so much from him about LGBTQ research methods and how to think about conducting research on the population. He always facilitated a welcoming and engaging classroom. Assignments were sometimes slow to be graded but I felt that I received helpful feedback. ",
            "\u00a0If John is teaching a course, take that course. You will learn so much. ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Pachankis encouraged discussion and multiple view points from students through out the semester, promoting discussion based on both lived experiences and academic literature. He supplied multiple guest lecturers who were also able to bring different sides of the story, which allowed an even more nuanced and authentic form of conversation. "

            "\u00a0Everyone should take it even if youre only remotely interested in health or lgbtq studies ! ",
            "\u00a0Take it!! It is a great survey course of LGBTQ health issues that was useful both to students who were new to the topic area and those who had studied it their whole careers. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it creates the groundworks of assessing the structural assessment of public health. ",
            "\u00a0If you are at all interested in LGBTQ health and research I would definitely recommend this class. You'll learn so much about LGBTQ mental health, LGBTQ research methods, and will become knowledgable on a specific topic within LGBTQ health throughout the short writing assignments. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this class to other students as it provides the type of discussions I expected to get out of graduate school. It made me rethink my personal identity and how it related to others and my profession, as well as what types of public health issues need immediate and long term focus. It allowed me to see the bigger picture of how research and interventions can interact with one another and the benefit of using both as a unit rather than as opposing factors. Further, it allowed me to feel a real sense of community as my fellow Yale students shared their complex narratives and their viewpoints on the academic literature that we read. Somehow, the material and class discussions made me feel heard and understood while expanding what I thought LGBTQ health could look like. "
