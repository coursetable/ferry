            "\u00a0I had never taken a linguistics class before, so I gained some general insight into what linguistics is, what type of problems do linguists think about, etc. The class was about more specific topics such as language change, but I feel like what I really gained from the class was a more general understanding of language and the evolution of language. ",
            "\u00a0It's a good course for someone who's not taken a linguistics class before, like me, because it introduces you to basic linguistics concepts without feeling too much like an introductory class. It's a great introduction to linguistics as a whole while teaching in-depth about historical linguistics. Lectures are pretty common-sense based. ",
            "\u00a0The course taught us to take a historical approach to linguistic questions. We studied changes in the sounds and semantics of words over time, as well as the anatomical and sociological foundations for language change. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how languages change over time in a general sense. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about many topics. The most were IPA and sound reconstruction and dialectal differences. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to reconstruct protolanguages and evaluate linguistics articles. ",
            "\u00a0I learned technical sound change concepts like lenition and apocope, which help track changes in languages over time. I sort of halfway learned IPA (the international phonetic alphabet) and the concepts of sounds like fricatives and affricates. I learned how linguists go about reconstructing proto (ancestor) languages from languages that exist today, plus some more details about language contact, how language can change, and various aspects of linguistics in general. ",
            "\u00a0Got a great intro into the field of linguistics as a whole, and it made it easy to decide whether this would be a subject Im interesting in perusing further. "

        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: Claire and Rikker are amazing! They are very friendly and seem to genuinely care about their students. Open to suggestions and want to share their research and experience in a way that will excite and interest the class. Assignments are very fair and open ended with the goal of getting people interested and engaged, rather than just having assignments just to have assignments.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Class seemed to run out of material by the last month or so, so a lot of class time was spent going over or discussing things that we had already talked about in my opinion, or seemed to be a bit just scrambling for topics. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - it's an excellent introduction to linguistics for someone who's never taken a course in it before (past evaluations differ on this, but Bowern's updated the course to make it clearer to those without a strong linguistic background).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - the final was much more intense than the rest of the course, almost blindsiding in comparison to a class with no tests and lenient grading. ",
            "\u00a0Good lectures supplemented by good readings. Outside sources make the content more interesting, and section is a fun chance to put our skills to use. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are sometimes long and boring but overall the professors are wonderful. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course would have been more interesting and understandable if more time in section was spent on reconstructions. I also would not mind learning more about accent differences. Though I understand there are some advantages to giving examples not in English, I found the examples that were in English far more understandable and rememberable. ",
            "\u00a0Fun writing assignments, and I enjoyed the flexibility of lecture topics and the instructor's willingness to answer questions in detail.\r\nSome lectures were mainly caveats about why a certain technique doesn't work. This was helpful for those of us planning to be linguists, but it could have been abbreviated for the sake of the kids just taking the course because they were interested in the history of languages. ",
            "\u00a0Claire and Rikker, who cotaught the course, are very, very knowledgeable about linguistics, and both put substantial effort into teaching the course. Claire is probably the world's foremost expert on northwestern Australian languages, and also knows a dizzying amount about pretty much any language you've heard of. So learning from them was great, and section with Rikker was fun (not sure why there are two 75 minute lectures and a section though - I think that's unnecessary and pretty unusual). As my first linguistics course, this class exposed me to more about how linguistics works. But I think a fundamental weakness of the class is there isn't a super clear agenda about what to learn. LING 112 tried to strike a balance between teaching complicated concepts and being an intro course, and I don't think that really worked. In particular, it would have been better to either go really in-depth on IPA (and related concepts like what's a fricative, affricate, etc.) or not learn it at all, rather than leave us with a slight taste that wasn't really complete and then sort of half-expect us to understand it later on. The topics toward the end felt a bit disconnected, and I wasn't sure exactly what I was supposed to be taking away from the course. A more coherent curriculum and set of goals/learning outcomes for the semester would definitely help. ",
            "\u00a0Potentially more feedback on written work, but in general the class was great. Fun, understating profs, useful office hours, and a generally curious and engaging atmosphere. "

            "\u00a0Yes! Great course if you have never taken a linguistics class before. I noticed myself actively thinking more about the language and words that I use in my everyday life, which was interesting. You will learn a lot of very interesting and insightful facts and see language in a different way as before. The workload is also very light and it's a writing credit! (Such an easy writing credit for a STEM major while being interesting at the same time). ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's a writing credit with less than ten pages of writing in the whole semester. Plus, it's genuinely interesting and both Bowern and Dockum are extremely well educated in the subject. ",
            "\u00a0If you're looking for a writing credit, you found it. Approximately 4 hours of writing throughout the entire semester, all of which could be done at the last minute without any stress. Section with Rikker Dockum is very doable, and lecture is skippable if you want. There's a final exam with a ~4 page note sheet~ allowed and therefore requires no effort. There's a 15% chance that a class will have something interesting that will make you say, \"Hm, that's cool!\" Otherwise, do not expect to get much out of this course. Professor Bowern is clearly smart and capable, but I'm not sure the lecture format is the best method to showcase these characteristics. ",
            "\u00a0If you're considering taking an intro linguistics class, this is a good one that goes into a lot of depth in one area while opening doors to many others. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you want to learn how languages change and evolve, this is a great class to take to gain a basis. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It is interesting, and is not a literature class and so is a good way to have a useful class that is a writing credit ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If youre looking for a writing credit or interested in different languages, youll really enjoy this course. I learned a lot and the workload isnt that heavy there isnt even a full essay ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this to anyone interested in language, geography, or anthropology. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend it if there were some changes, because while the concept and professors are cool, the implementation is not quite there yet. I think there needs to be more of a coherent agenda to the class, with specific concepts we learn about that we did not know before, and having things more connected rather than as a linguistic hodgepodge. More writing instruction would also be nice. I'm a bit hesitant to recommend the course in its current form, but I would also point out that Claire and Rikker are the types of people who will make a good faith effort to modify the course if there is a consistent theme across these reviews, so next year may be different. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah! If youre interested in linguistics, give it a shot. Claire is greatprobably the most understanding Yale prof Ive had, and genuinely loves her subject, so take it with her if possible. "
