            "\u00a0Awesome class! Loved the smaller class size which promoted a lot of good discussions. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed 576. I think the strengths of the course are how discussions are led in class. The flow of discussion is very natural and Professor Ndumele really helps the discussion along in the correct direction while also allowing us freedom to dictate what thoughts and specifics are engaged with. I don't really think there are any weaknesses. I think it could be improved by maybe incorporating more case studies as I really enjoyed that portion of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Great course! ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the case studies. It would be nice to focus more heavily on those! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Lectures are interesting and Chima is very engaging, the coursework isn't too heavy but is still enough to apply the material in a just way. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the case studies didn't really seem that relevant to the material and could've just been glanced over. ",
            "\u00a0I would say that this course is the best class I've taken at Yale in terms of bang for my buck--the workload was actually less than other classes, but I feel like I learned more than just about any other course I've had. As an HCM student, we didn't have a true capstone this year, but this class felt like the perfect culmination of the last two years of learning. From the theoretical frameworks discussed at the beginning of the semester to the more practical case discussions at the close, I feel much more prepared to engaged in conversations about health systems and possible reforms thanks to this class.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, the final assignment probably should have been individual, but given the many springtime obligations of second-years, I was very grateful that it was a group assignment. The data assignment was very reasonable, but I'm not sure it was much of a value add (though seeing different data source options was helpful). I also actually liked having the midterm as an excuse to review the theory-based first half of the semester.\r\n\r\nOne possible area for improvement is that I would find it helpful to have a slightly more organized Canvas page from the beginning of the semester. It's helpful to have all assignments and due dates visible from the start, as well as having the readings and slides labeled and filed by week. ",
            "\u00a0Fantastic course. I love how this course is class discussion based. ",
            "\u00a0The class was amazing mainly because it was taught by Chima. This year we had a much smaller class size than usual, which made the class a lot better and more engaging. I would have liked if we did more case studies since I feel like that's how I best learned and was able to grasp the material. ",
            "\u00a0I think some of the units were a little too similar, I think it would have also been nice to focus entire classes breaking down specific HC systems in different nations.  When I signed up I was really interested in socialized HC systems the US could look at, but we didn't learn much about that. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: Very engaging, knows his stuff, fun, sets realistic expectations, leads discussion well.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: could set better direction on the case studies and summarize key takeaways ",
            "\u00a0Professor Ndumele is very nice to his students. He raised questions or problems that encouraged us to think critically. Besides, he provided every student with helpful and timely feedback about the group project. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing professor! Chima is so funny and engaging, and makes the material interesting. He is also very laid back and approachable, which makes everyone feel comfortable participating. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Ndumele was great. He really allowed us the freedom of creating our own discussion and only guiding it. I think time management was a weakness from time to time as we spent a lot of time on discussion and relatively less on lecture slides. I think that was just an inevitable tradeoff with having free discussion though. ",

            "\u00a0Chima is a great professor who is very down to Earth which makes speaking in class very easy, which I very much appreciate because I feel like class is a conversation and not a lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Ndumele is probably the best discussion facilitator I have encountered at Yale. He simultaneously makes everyone feel comfortable participating in class and offering contrarian or uncertain ideas, but also pushes back and makes you defend your position and analyze the assumptions baked into it. Becky and Kaitlin were also fantastic, and there help, especially with specific assignments, was greatly appreciated. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent. I would not change anything. Professor Ndumele creates a fantastic learning environment, encourages discussion and debate, allows diverse viewpoints to be considered and pushes our assumptions in a great way. ",
            "\u00a0Chima is the funniest teacher at YSPH and is so incredibly chill. He made the class very relaxing and I never felt like I had to worry about it. He also was very receptive and response to students' opinions. In class, if someone said something interesting, he would challenge us to think about it further. He kept the class incredibly engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Chima has such great enthusiasm and knowledge. The way he ran the class encouraged a great deal of interesting discussion. The only thing I'd say is that the class wasn't very challenging and didn't push me too much. "

A lot of what was learned in class was fundamental theories of health care and while the material could be a bit abstract at some points, it definitely provides a base of understanding for practical application. ",
