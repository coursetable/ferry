            "\u00a0This course featured the longest paper I have ever written, and the focus on the final project throughout the semester was really helpful in getting me to learn how to research for and write a substantial piece of work in the humanities. On a week to week basis, the course also helped me understand the breadth of ways to approach feminist critiques of science by including a wide range of secondary texts. Primary textual analysis was most often conducted in class, and it was helpful to read these so closely as a group, especially for people who have not done substantial research in the history of science and medicine before. ",
            "\u00a0This course has taught me to think critically about how gender has been represented through science. I have learned how gender shapes scientific research, and how being critical of its role can lead to better scientific research. "

            "\u00a0The course was really effective at introducing students to a wide range of feminist critiques of science. The course readings focused on various scientific disciplines as well, and the diversity of interests within the class facilitated a successful seminar environment. Prof. Coen asked very insightful questions and provided clear and detailed explanations of scientific and historical concepts when necessary. It was helpful to have assigned drafts for the final paper, especially considering its length, but having these deadlines in the middle of breaks was inconvenient. Also, the course seemed a bit disjointed at times, in part because of its breadth. Perhaps finding some way to make it feel more like the class sessions and readings built on each other throughout the semester would have been helpful in at least providing more continuity to the themes. ",
            "\u00a0Readings were interesting, and I felt that the discussions were useful in unpacking what we had read. Furthermore, I think the workload was very manageable, and there was plenty of opportunity for feedback throughout the semester. Having the rough draft due weeks before the final draft was extremely useful, as it gave me time to consider the comments I received, and decide how to incorporate them into the final paper. "

            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0For anyone interested in either the history of science and medicine or feminist theory and especially for anyone interested in both, this class is excellent. The range of feminist critiques included structural and economic critiques of the systems that excluded women from science, Freudian critiques of gendered ideologies within science, critiques of the power relationships between scientists and test subjects, science as a tool for both reinforcing and challenging patriarchy, and other perspectives are considered. You have a lot of freedom in the final paper to explore any one of these criticisms within any science you choose. For STEM majors, it is a great class to learn about the ways in which your discipline may reinforce or reflect gendered systems of power and place your coursework and research in historical context. The standards for the drafts of the final paper are pretty flexible even if the extra deadlines are annoying, but I recommend you take them seriously because it will help to have the feedback when you go to write the final product. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student -- this is one of my favorite classes that I have taken in undergrad. The material was interesting, and gave me a lot to consider about how gender influences the way we receive scientific information. Professor Coen leads interesting discussions, and I appreciated that the final project was split into a few smaller steps, so that I could receive feedback along the way. "
