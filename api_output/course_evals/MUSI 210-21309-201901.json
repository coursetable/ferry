            "\u00a0Fundamentals of composition, some musical analysis, harmony and counterpoint, and a lot of random but fascinating musical tidbits from Nate. ",
            "\u00a0Learned more about classical compositions and music history ",
            "\u00a0Composition, theory, counterpoint ",
            "\u00a0In this course the species and counterpoint method for composing was introduced and this helped me learn the basics of composing. By learning this method, and studying many other classical compositions, we were able to begin composing our own music following that model. Another interesting thing that we were able to realize by studying the diverse pieces of music that we did was how subjective music is in how it's composed and how it's appreciated. ",
            "\u00a0Figured bass, counterpoint basics, learning to write for multiple instruments, how to write variations and minuets. ",
            "\u00a0I gained knowlede of figured bass, roman numeral analysis, and 18th century counterpoint. I gained practice composing and analyzing scores of music. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the basics of analyzing and composing baroque music. I learned about the features of counterpoint melodies, typical chord progressions, and typical song structures used in this period of music. ",
            "\u00a0My knowledge of 18th century music theory and composition was much increased. ",

            "\u00a0Strength: Prof. Adam. ",
            "\u00a0Enjoyable, interesting lectures, and a good introduction to music theory. I almost wish there was a little more homework to have given me more practice with figured bass and reduction. With almost no music theory background, I thought this was a very easy course. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very good overall. It was an interesting, engaging class, and it was taught in a very hands-on way. I learned a lot, but the class also never became super intense or stressful. There isn't anything I would change about it. ",

            "\u00a0Oh of course. It's a super fun course that gives you a broader understanding of music theory. "
