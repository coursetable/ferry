            "\u00a0This course offered a good balance between reflection on the purpose of our work as historians, generally speaking, and our work more specifically as Atlantic historians. The creation of new historical knowledge is not about the discovery of new sources so much as the implementation new means of analyzing well-known data-sets, the recontextualization of familiar material, and the importation of methods from other fields. Quite a lot of what we do involves \"interior design:\" we move bits of historical furniture around in order to make a harmonious or rational living space for our readers. Our shifting understanding of our field--we might now be reluctant to think of what we study as, in Charles Andrews's terms, a \"colonial period\"--changes the sort of questions we ask, and the syllabus was carefully planned to show how studies of slavery, environment, native history, and religion have shifted in emphasis over time. By far the most valuable aspect of the course, however, was the stimulus to go and explore the very rich archival material available to us right here in the Beinecke. I don't think it would be an exaggeration to say that a whole new world is open to me, now that I've cleared the initial, intimidating hurdle of ordering a box of manuscripts. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about how to write an article and about the different types of research questions historians can tackle. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about how to think about and approach a historical research project. This is not an easy or automatic task, and I was able to explore a different, more search-analytics dependent approach than the work I have done in the past. The course especially aided me in considering the various angles I might take as a historian, in sources, in theoretical framing, in audience, and so on. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Peterson structures the course as thorough historical training. You read important works on early America, are acquainted with their methods, and consider the development of the field. "

            "\u00a0This course differed slightly from other research seminars I've taken, in that we didn't actually discuss the process of writing and didn't read each other's papers. This had the advantage of removing the pressure to complete a draft before the end of term, though I think something is valuable is lost in stressing ideas and content over structure. We spend so much of our time thinking about the architecture of whole books that we rarely have the opportunity to sit with a single paragraph and talk about its construction. On the whole, however, having time programmed into the syllabus for research and writing was a very welcome innovation that made the semester considerably less stressful. ",
            "\u00a0Mark did a great job of facilitating discussions about readings and historiography. I wish that the course had focused more on the mechanics of writing a research paper since it was a research course. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the overall design was very good, differing usefully from the other research seminar that I have taken. The framework from Bernard Bailyn of manifest and latent history was especially thought provoking, I found, and will continue to affect the way I think about my research in the future. I also thought the presentation format and feedback was useful. As an independent research course much of the impetus was naturally on us, which I liked, as I felt it did not box me into a rigid topic, but allowed me room to explore where my intellectual interests and the sources drew me. ",
            "\u00a0I really appreciated the time devoted in the schedule to the paper preparation, I was able to come up with a project I was proud of. I really appreciated the structure of readings and projects. "

            "\u00a0Yes, especially for students studying early America and the Atlantic world ",
            "\u00a0Very much so. The course varied usefully in its approach from the other research seminar that I have taken. My comments as to the course rigor depend of course on the students approach to this kind of class. What matters most is your own drive and scholarly interest in the subject you end up exploring. Professor Peterson provides a helpful framework, advice, and examples for finding your own interests while pushing you outside of what youve done in the past, thus helping you truly grow. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!  I learned a lot and got to put those skills into practice. "
