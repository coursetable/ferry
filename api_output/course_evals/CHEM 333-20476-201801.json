            "\u00a0I learned SO much - we went through the basic principles of quantum mechanics from the ground up, using tons of interesting math (including stuff I'd never gotten a chance to really apply before, like imaginary numbers and differential equations - but don't worry if you don't know these things, you go over all of it in class), gaining insights about the world and proving all of the principles of chemistry I'd always been told to just accept. All of it was extremely well presented and very interesting, and I feel like I know so much more now than I did before I started this semester. ",
            "\u00a0This class had some truly difficult material, especially for me as a student whose interest has generally been on the more organic/chem. bio. side of the department. It was, however, truly meaningful and helpful to get a grip on the basic quantal foundation of so many of the phenomena the world is based on. Applying a rigorous mathematical and quantitative framework to these particle-level scenarios was challenging but rewarding. ",

It is a difficult subject to make engaging and this course did a great job with the subject matter at hand. ",

I learned how to evaluate Schrodinger's equation for various potential energies to determine the wave functions. And I learned how these wave functions can be used to understand the behavior or single particles, atoms, and molecules. \r\n\r\nFor statistical mechanics, I learned how quantum mechanics can be used to explain the behavior of large collections of molecules, and how this results in the various thermodynamic properties observed in the first semester.

            "\u00a0This course is incredibly difficult, and I think the pace should be slowed down a bit. The professor went way too fast on some topics that are integral in the field of quantum mechanics, but were not explained well enough. Even a little bit more time on a basic concept would have proved to be incredibly helpful in the long run. It is very interesting material, but incredibly difficult. ",
            "\u00a0The course is great if you take it with Zilm! I really appreciated the online lecture notes and Zilm's openness to questions! He really cares about his students and he cares that they are engaged in the course! ",
            "\u00a0CHEM 333 is a very hard class, and an extremely well-done one, which is an unfortunately rare combination. The material was consistently fascinating, it was always abundantly clear what we were expected to know, Prof. Zilm had incredible course notes, the TAs were a dream come true, and I came out of it knowing so much more than I went into it. My only complaint was that I felt that the 8:45am midterms and psets assigned on the same week as exams were a little bit extra, but it is a credit to this class that I didn't mind enough for me not to love it. Fantastic job to everyone involved, thank you for an incredibly interesting semester! ",
            "\u00a0One of the biggest weaknesses to me was how impersonal it felt. I wish the professor were more approachable, especially seeing as we are third-years in the major. Teaching it in a smaller classroom might help, or perhaps adding some demonstrations. If the lectures were a tiny bit more interactive the professor might actually learn our names (not just the students who ask questions a lot)! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Lecture notes are posted online, the accompanying textbook is useful, the workload is manageable, all homework is relevant to the material and exams, and lectures are clear.\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures focus heavily on derivations rather than examples of how to calculate relevant quantities. This causes the problem sets to be more difficult than necessary, because we rarely see examples of how to deal with those types of questions. ",
            "\u00a0The course moved a little fast at times and was very math-heavy on math that a lot of the students had never learned before. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Zilm is one of the best chemistry professors I've had here at Yale. The course is taught exceptionally well the way it is, and the notes he provides online are very clear and easy to follow. He also tests you on the material you've done in the homeworks and makes it easy to do well if you practice enough and put enough time into studying. ",
            "\u00a0The material is quite challenging and vast. There is a lot of stuff the class covers and can seem overwhelming sometimes. Classes often go over the fifty minute to one hour, which is a lot for 3 classes per week. The midterms vary massively in terms of difficulty (from midterms that are practically just based on practice problems and homework, to extremely difficult midterms that would be challenging even if it were a take-home). ",
            "\u00a0Pchem II with Professor Zilm was one of my favorite classes this semester! I would highly recommend the class to chemistry majors and anyone interesting in understanding some of the weird quantum effects of chemistry. The lectures were presented very well, with Zilm writing on the blackboard, supplemented by diagrams on slides. Professor Zilm generally explained the concepts very well, though the lectures on spin-orbit coupling and statistical mechanics were a bit confusing. Lecture handouts were also immensely useful for reviewing your notes and making sure you understand what's going on. Homework is kind of long (5-7+ hours a week) though very useful for reinforcing the concepts in class. Section was also very useful for clarifying any questions from lecture and doing more practice. TAs did a WONDERFUL job posting thorough answer keys to the homework. Exams were very fair and mostly based off the homework. Overall, a very fun and rewarding class! ",
            "\u00a0The professor and TAs were great and very available to provide help. I also liked that Professor Zilm always posted his notes before class. I think the material is, by nature, very hard and I thought the class did a good job of covering a lot of ground in a way that facilitated student understanding. However, there were times where I felt the professor was moving a little too quickly, and I was unable to follow his reasoning. I wish that the course was a little slower and covered certain topics in more detail, but at the same time, going slower would make it impossible to cover as much content. Overall, I think the course was very good and provided a good overview of both quantum and statistical mechanics. ",
            "\u00a0While being an introductory course to quantum chemistry, this course covered most topics in fine mathematical detail, even more so that the text did. I found this extremely helpful, not least because it became clear that many physical results came from the math. I developed an appreciation for derivation from first principles, and for the utility of math and modelling to describe systems. The course was also structured such that knowledge from former topics were important for later topics - on one hand, this made perfect logical sense; on the other, it would not be ideal to miss a lecture.\r\n\r\nThe course could be improved by providing more problem set-like practice problems; many problems on the study guides and exams requested replications of derivations in the notes; perhaps there could be more problems that require further application. ",
            "\u00a0Super fast paced, but I minded that less than the fact that it was often hard to connect the math to the physical - I think the course was taught a little too much from a mathematical perspective with the physical repercussions thrown on, and it would have been nice to have a little of the other way. ",
            "\u00a0I felt this course took a little too mathematical of an approach, and the physical repercussions were left a little to the wayside.  Some more understanding of what it all meant would be really nice. ",
            "\u00a0This course was wonderfully taught- the material was difficult but reasonably paced, and exams and homeworks were generally fair. Having the online course notes was really helpful so that if we went fast in class I could go back later and review the material. Zilm is a great teacher and the TAs were great- it really felt like I learned a lot about a very intimidating field! The only improvement I would suggest would be having more flexible pset dues dates (Ie not always due on Monday). Some weeks we had a pset and a midterm which was a lot, and other times we didn't cover the material for a large portion of the pset until the Friday class with the pset due on Monday, which created a quick turnaround. ",
            "\u00a0This is a fantastic course.  As someone who was a bit worried about taking it, I am surprised and happy to say this was my favorite course this semester.  Professor Zilm is fantastic and really cares about the students learning the material.  The TAs were incredible and some of the best I have had at Yale.  The material was extremely accessible if you put the effort in, which is awesome given that this course typically scares a lot of Yale students. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Lecture notes are good, class is very well organized\r\nWeaknesses: Sections are not that meaningful. Feedback on exams is nonexistent (could we have an answer key?).  Prof. Zilm spends too much time deriving equations and using math that he doesn't expect us to know on the exams. The math is cool, but it's not a good use of time to spend, for example, 20 minutes deriving the Bohr atom wave equation using power series when most of the class has never seen that math before and will not be required to ever derive anything like it (we can always just look at the lecture notes if we are curious). ",
            "\u00a0This course is very well organized, and Professor Zilm gives you everything you need to be successful. The material however is simply very challenging and difficult to understand. ",
            "\u00a0This class is just kind of painful. There is a lot of ugly math and repetition. More example problems with solutions would have been helpful. I think it would have been useful to see worked out problems to get an idea of how to approach different types of problems. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very organized in its introduction of new material, connections between each lecture, and explanations by both the professor and the TA's. Considering how a lot of the material taught are rather obscure to first-time learners of quantum, I thought this course was taught well to ensure that with enough effort we could follow the many discoveries and calculations that led to the current understandings of chemistry.

            "\u00a0I dropped this class last year when Vaccaro was teaching it, Zilm is so much better! Take it with him he is a wonderful man and teacher! ",
            "\u00a0If you really like chemistry, are reasonably good at math, and are willing to put in a lot of time, Pchem II with Professor Zilm can be one of the most rewarding classes you will ever take (and, even if it is still challenging, it is not as absurdly difficult as I have heard it is with Vaccaro). I almost didn't take this class, because I didn't have to for my major and didn't particularly like Pchem I, but I could not be more happy that I ended up taking it. I learned so much, and I feel like this class was the doorway to an entire world of science that no one would ever teach me before - now I really want to take more quantum mechanics! You will explain why all of the things you learned in earlier chemistry classes are true, which I think is incredibly cool. My only caveat is that this class does not have a lot of chill; there are three midterms and a final, psets every week (including when you have exams), and midterms started early before class. But the fact that I was never bitter about any of this just goes to show how interesting and well organized this class was. Highly recommended! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it if they were a chemistry major, but if you aren't there may be better classes that also cover quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics. I am not certain, though. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. The workload is rather light, and the examinations are straightforward. Exams are based on the lecture notes, problem sets, and study questions, so there are no tricks. To do well on the problem sets and actually learn how to approach them, though, you should attend every TA office hour session. Although the material is daunting, Professor Zilm makes it easily accessible and understandable. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to ChemE and Chem majors only. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Physical chemistry and cool and makes a lot of the wishy-washy things in gen chem make more sense (or at least give them a better grounding) ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take it with Professor Zilm! He's good at explaining and he always posts his notes (I would recommend reading them before class!). The exams are very fair and Professor Zilm wants you to do well! This is definitely a fairly difficult course and requires some knowledge of physics, multi-variable calculus, differential equations, and linear algebra (and chemistry, of course). That being said, Professor Zilm will explain everything you need to know in class, you just might have to study a little more if you've never been exposed to the material before. If you work hard, you will do well! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This course helped me fully grasp the main concepts in quantum mechanics, and may prove useful for more advanced chemistry classes. ",
            "\u00a0You'll be taking it only if you have to, but it's a cool course anyways. ",
            "\u00a0Cool course for chemistry- and physics-interested people, but otherwise you'll probably find it too hard to be nice. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Don't be scared of quantum mechanics- its really interesting and Zilm and the TAs do a great job teaching this fascinating subject. It is a decent amount of work but there's very little busywork and the class is well organized and paced. ",
            "\u00a0If Professor Zilm is teaching this course-- take it!! If you are like me and find general chemistry frustrating because of the lack of depth, this course will answer so many questions (for example how the periodic table got its shape, etc from a quantum perspective).  If you have to take this course -- take it with Professor Zilm.  If you don't have to take this course, but like math, chemistry, and physics -- I would recommend taking  this course. It won't be easy, but it will incredibly rewarding if you put the time into it. ",
            "\u00a0PChem II is very different form PChem I. It dives into the world of quantum chemistry, which is much more math/physics driven and require a solid foundation in both. That being said, the class is fair to those who are not innately great at math by requiring knowledge of the more simple derivations and being more conceptual.  Would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in the less biological side of chemistry. ",
            "\u00a0Solid nope. But chances are that you probably have to take this class. I personally do not like pchem as a subject, but this semester of pchem is definitely worse than the last semester. The problem sets take a long time and are hard to figure out. If you really like quantum and wave equations, this is the class for you. Otherwise, good luck. "
