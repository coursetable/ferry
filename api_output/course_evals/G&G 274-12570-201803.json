First we did a lot of unit conversions, and then we did a lot of random statistics (like what percent of what kind of use is from which fuel source), then we did a lot of boring earth science that nobody in the energy industry cares about, then we did some basic stuff on emissions and climate change. The last parts were the most interesting, but the lecture style was so boring that I don't think people learned as much as they could have. So I feel utterly disappointed by what I learned in what is a core course for the G&G major. This course is full of athletes, and rightly so: this is not to dis the athletes, because I know how busy your schedules are, but clearly this course is a gut science, so if you are looking to learn things, go elsewhere.

            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Oristaglio is very kind and often available for extra help. \r\nWeaknesses: The lectures were quite disparate from the material tested on problem sets and lectures, which made me wonder why lecture attendance is mandatory. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: well I guess for the most part the problem sets aren't too difficult. And you get 75 minutes twice a week to stare at whatever you want on your computer. Oristaglio is very nice, fair, and good at responding to emails and answering questions. I do think he cares, I just think the course is ineffective. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lecture style is very dry and boring. This is why everyone is staring at their computers instead of paying attention. The material in class was not really related to the problem sets, nor (apparently) to the exams, so there was little reason to pay attention. Therefore, the entirely of my learning from the course came from teaching myself the material for the problem sets and the exams.\r\n\r\nCourse material is uninteresting. I did not really want a geology lecture, I wanted to learn about fossil fuels. I think the curriculum could be made better by scaling way back the earth science side (give us a primer, but this isn't a structural geology or mineralogy course) and then teaching us more about how the energy actually works. How do the power plants work? How big are the turbines and how does their turning generate power? How is this power transmitted to the grid? What is the grid? What is the efficiency per mile? Where do they put power plants and why? As thrilled as I am to try to remember in which geologic period the most oil came to the trap or whatever (I don't even know), why not make this a useful course about how energy works? Either that, or rename it to make it an actual geology course. Ron Smith teaches in renewable energy about the stuff I've mentioned above (like how do we calculate energy output per wind or hydro turbine based on its size and flow rate of the air/water?)... perhaps taking some pages from his book would improve the curriculum. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures can be a bit dry as they are very science and history based. That could be improved ",

            "\u00a0This was a good class overall, maybe just to have the TA's more involved would improve things but overall everyone had enough access to resources. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: not a lot of work. 6 pets due every week and a half (office hours are helpful for these), a midterm, and final\r\nweakness: sometimes the lectures were boring, also everyone in the class had A/A- so they made the final exam impossible. Might've been the hardest test I've taken at yale ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very interesting subject material, professor loves the topic and cares very much about his students. Oristaglio is very accommodating and fun to talk to during OH\r\nWeaknesses: student engagement is very low...this class has the reputation of being a gut, so most people just don't pay attention in lecture (attendance is mandatory) and then waste review session time asking silly questions ",

You won't really go into much detail about anything, but this is an interesting and engaging introductory class. The lectures mirrored, as closely as reasonably possible, the assigned work, the midterm and final were fair assessments of what we had learned, and overall this was a very fair course in which if you put in the work, you would receive a good and fair grade in return. ",
            "\u00a0This is a really relevant and interesting course. However, the material doesn't seem to follow a very logical progression and the problem sets, lectures, and exams are all vastly different. None of them seem to relate to the other. Lectures are somewhat interesting, workload is fairly light. It's an enjoyable course. ",

            "\u00a0While I generally liked the course and enjoyed completing most of the psets, lectures were not very interesting. Professor Oristaglio is so sweet but is also a fairly dry lecturer, reading off the lecture slides and providing little of his own commentary. It was all too easy to open my computer and do homework for other classes during lecture because I knew I could get the same information by looking at the lecture slides when he posted them on Canvas later. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are that Professor Oristaglio is very kind and gave extensions a bunch of times. Weaknesses are that the class is located way too far away and attendance is mandatory - it does account for 5% of the grade though. However, students would come to lecture and then just do other stuff on their laptops. ",
            "\u00a0The problem sets were interesting and taught me a lot.  The tests seemed unpredictable and difficult to study for.  Also, grades took forever so it was hard to know if you needed to adjust your effort between this and your other courses. ",

            "\u00a0The class touches on some interesting topics. However the course is too broad of a survey. I was often confused by what material was important and what wasn't during lectures. This made studying for the final especially difficult. The problem sets didn't really match up with the big, important concepts that eventually showed up on the final. The course, mainly the psets and lectures, needs to be pared down and better tailored to the really important material. ",

And certainly not if you're doing it for energy studies, unless you're really into geology (but at a pretty elementary level and with a lot of boring stuff mixed in and with really boring lectures). If you are a G&G major, I imagine you'd be incredibly disappointed by how little you're learn in what is a core course for the major. And if you're just looking for a science credit, then I guess this isn't the worst option since it's like not a huge onslaught of work, but please please consider taking something in which you'll learn literally something (it would be a pity not to for this much money per course, and didn't you come here to learn something?), because I don't think I'll remember much at all from this course--I could probably have learned everything I did in a two-hour condensed lecture. Oristaglio is very nice, but he's an unengaging lecturer, attention during lectures was staggeringly low, and the topics were not interesting to anyone--not energy enough for energy scholars and not hard-core geology enough for G&G majors. This course needs to pick one of those sides and then double down on it (and if it goes the geology route, please rename it, because here I thought I would be learning about how energy works and not just about rock formations). I guess right now it feels most directly targeted toward those taking it as a gut science, which in my opinion is pitiful--very inconsiderate of those trying to actually learn something about the subject and to get any sort of value for their tuition.

If you're looking for an easy science credit....I thought this course was relatively straightforward, but student engagement is very low, so finding a pset squad may be difficult if you're not taking it with friends who are also engaged with the material. The grades are not curved (93+ for an A), and grading gets stricter as the semester goes on. Problem sets are long, and sometimes frustrating, I liked some of them more than others, but there is something to be learned from each of them. If you've got no interest in the material itself, I'm sure you can find other easy science classes. ",
