            "\u00a0Over the course of the semester I developed a much deeper understanding of identity and identification as objects of historical inquiry in the early modern period. Our seminar led me to see the instability of previous assumptions I have made regarding the existence of identity and its construction. Furthermore, this was the first seminar I have ever taken via teleconference-- therefore it was very helpful in acclimating me to working in this sort of learning environment with a widely international group.

            "\u00a0This course was exceptional in that it offered us the opportunity to take part in a graduate student conference in Pisa, Italy. I have never encountered or taken part in another course at Yale that gives participants the opportunity to hone their skills in this type of conference/seminar scenario. It is a very different and thought-provoking task to prepare a final paper for broad readership of peers and senior scholars (discussants), rather than solely the professor who is leading the seminar. In this light, I feel the seminar's unique structure helped participants build a skill-set that we very rarely touch upon or rehearse in graduate coursework-- i.e. conference participation, crafting a paper for wider readership, dealing with the realities of jetlag and public speaking. "

            "\u00a0Yes, definitely, because the assigned readings could have resonance for graduate students working across a wide range of subfields. Furthermore, the opportunity to participate in a graduate student conference at the SNS in Pisa was a fantastic opportunity to hone one's skills as a researcher/presenter. "
