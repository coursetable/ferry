            "\u00a0An excellent introduction, for me, to the field of Urban History. Developed the skill of producing an article-length paper in a condensed period of time, and gained insight into how historians produce their literature. ",
            "\u00a0This course allowed me to try my hand at urban historical research. Through this course I learned about the field of urban history, the ways in which scholars write about urban history, as well as the journals in which such work is published. Because it was a research seminar, I also learned how to conduct my own archival and legal research, and what resources Yale and other special collections might have. ",
            "\u00a0Learned how to talk about a text emphasizing chronology in conjunction with key concepts. Learned how to do archival research, how to look for an appropriate journal and the steps needed to prepare for submission. "

        [
            "\u00a0The course is broken down into three sections. The first is a reading period, where students are introduced to the trajectory and current status of U. S. urban history; the second is a research period, where students are introduced to the variety of research resources available at Yale (Manuscripts and Archives, the Law Library, GSI mapping tools, etc.; the final is a writing period, where seminar sessions are used to workshop each students paper.\r\n\r\nThis course prepares students to produce high level papers and gives them time to do the appropriate research. The writing period can feel a little crampedin that it seems too short. But I think most people generally feel short on time any time they produce a serious article. ",
            "\u00a0I think the strength of this course is also the weakness: while I appreciated the opportunity to conduct primary research, it was also quite time-consuming and stressful to be doing it alongside coursework. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were inviting class discussions and a variety of readings that intersected with different areas under banner of urban history. Clear step-by-step process over the semester made writing the paper seem very doable. Really appreciated the meetings with the various librarians. Small class size was a strength also.\r\n\r\nThis isn't really a weakness, but I wonder if the readings at the beginning of class should be articles rather than books? Since we are writing article-length essays, I think it would have helped to have a few more examples than just the one class session. "

            "\u00a0This course is designed for PhD students, but I took the course as a student in the combined BA/MA program in history. It was  wonderful opportunity for me, but it was understandably really intense.\r\n\r\nI would still encourage individuals in a similar situation to go for it, but be aware it will take a lot of time and effort.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you are simultaneously part of a varsity sports team, you should know that your practice schedule will likely preclude you from doing as much primary research as you would like to produce your paper in the way you envisioned it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes -- this course is really helpful for those interested in doing US urban history! ",
            "\u00a0Yes-especially for others, like myself, who did not have much experience doing this kind of research before. I felt like I learned really fundamental skills for research while also being introduced to a major genre of U.S. history. "
