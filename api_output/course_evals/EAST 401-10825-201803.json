            "\u00a0I really enjoyed learning about Korean history and loved the class! ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to evaluate films critically and in the historical context they belong in. I also learned how to structure and write a history paper and improved my reading and critical analysis skills. ",
            "\u00a0This course changed the way I looked at films. Situating a story historically and considering the implications of gender representation were skills I learned from this class. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This is effectively a course about representations of Gender in Modern Korean cinema, but a great omission of the course are any works by non-male directors, and no films with any representation of LGBT individuals in Korea at all (with the exception of a few toss away jokes in comedies). While I learned a great deal of shifting mainstream representations and conceptions of womanhood, the scope of the class feels too narrow. ",
            "\u00a0The strength was that the course was very interactive! ",
            "\u00a0I think a strength was the facilitation and space to have meaningful discussion, that enhanced my learning. I wish there had been more structured lectures to highlight the important parts of texts, especially when they might have been complicated or confusing. ",
            "\u00a0This courses material was very interesting. Discussion would have benefitted from more talk of the reading and not just the movie and perhaps a bit more structure from the instructor would have kept the conversation moving. "

            "\u00a0Anyone interested in learning about film analysis with gender studies should take this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would! It was challenging at first but very rewarding and intellectually exciting. It also taught me a lot about both history and important pop culture and film moments in Korea, which I appreciated. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to all Yale students interested in film and Korea. I had no prior knowledge of Korean history and I have never considered gender representation this critically. I would encourage more guys to take this class. I was the only one in my seminar and never felt it and I feel better having taken it. "
