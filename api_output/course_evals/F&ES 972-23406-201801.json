Unfortunately, our client project was not as successful as prior EPC experiences, though this was in no way a reflection on the EPC course or instructors. In fact, both Lisa and Josh were fantastic in guiding us through a difficult process. "

The project supervisor for the course was helpful and supportive, and the guest lectures I attended were excellent. ",
            "\u00a0Very well. The project description was a bit advanced for the actual work though. It was written by a staffperson in the client organization whose expertise was well-beyond that of our point person, and indeed the level at which the project would ultimately be conducted (due to the lack of a baseline assessment). However, we were able to find a middle ground that worked for everyone. ",

I think the instructors do their best to vet projects, however, it might be helpful to better communicate what work needs to be done by the client in advance of the clinic. I feel like many of the clients sign up to have their project selected, but haven't done the requisite planning and groundwork to actually manage a clinical team or groundtruth the project's assumptions.
