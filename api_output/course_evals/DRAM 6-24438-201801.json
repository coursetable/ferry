In my experience, a time I saw them work well, they were planned for moments where the professor knew there was typically some confusion. The professor had a pretty good idea of where confusion would happen, so instead of letting the students flock into discussion sections with the same question, he would quickly address them in lecture. The professor I have in mind would also throw out \"monkey bar\" questions---questions that were designed to move the lecture along, usually factoid in nature. ",

",
            "\u00a0There was little to no discussion during the lecture portions of class, which I guess is in theory the point of lecture but shouldn't be the point of learning theater history. Often discussion, which was always amazing, wouldn't address some of the topics discussed in class so some questions would just never go answered. ",

            "\u00a0Dear Paul, \r\nThis is Danilo Gambini. I checked the \"decline\" box in all the questions because it makes more sense to me to write without a frame. \r\nIt was very clear to me the amount of passion, work and dedication you put into this class, the preparation of the material and the constant revision of the subjects - including EDI, a preoccupation that appears and have to be honed (at least for the next few years) while we struggle as a society to make the world more just.\r\nThe structure of the class is very clear as is all of its components, and it is very effective as an academic course. So, I would have no complaints there.\r\n\r\nMy question is specifically about us having such structure in this program. Most of us are here coming from artistic careers and decided to take a time to lapidate our artistry. Very few of us have any academic interest, and those who have (the dramaturges mostly) do not take this class.\r\nSo, most of this investment you put into this whole course, ends up washing down the drain of our over-busy brains. \r\nWhat I would see as a class that could inspire our hearts, clash our contemporary beliefs with ancient ones, ignite ideas - ends up being a sequence of bureaucratically taking exams that, I am so sorry to say, are a high-school-type-of-worry instead of an artistic torment (the only worry I find useful to have at this point of my life).\r\nWhat I would say is that - of course, this is my very own opinion - the classes structures should not change at all. But the evaluation system could be a device of artistic ignition. Maybe a paper could be: propose one of the plays we had to read for the semester for a regional theater production,or the cab even, or design costumes and set for one of them, or create an avant-garde movement nowadays and make a manifesto, or imagine how a shakespeare play would have been staged back then... well, you know what I mean!  \r\nThis semester short paper was an example of this kind of evaluation, and I found myself much more invested in exploring the play, which ended up with me contacting the playwright, having a skype meeting with him and securing the rights for another one of his plays to produce at the cab next year. Such artistic explorations in your class could not only inform and inspire our time here, but open new paths for our careers - something that I truly believe does not happen when our efforts are on memorizing names, dates, or short sentences that explain vaguely and superficially concepts that sometimes we do not understand at all.  \r\nMost of all, this reply of mine is my resistance to make any aspect of theater dull. Exams are the apex of dullness for me. The very concept of having a \"right way\" or \"right answer\" goes deeply against what I believe the soul of our art form is: there is no right or wrong, there is only life. Whatever happens on stage - and on life - just IS. If we do not establish something as right, the wrong is impossible. \r\nI truly believe that by de-academicizing the structure of grading  you could make your class a much more powerful tool that the students could use directly in their artistic praxis. \r\n\r\nI hope you don't find this reply too aggressive. This is not my intention. I probably only have strong feelings about this because I also really enjoyed the classes and wished I could have had more artistic outcomes from it. \r\n\r\nHave a great summer!\r\nDanilo ",
