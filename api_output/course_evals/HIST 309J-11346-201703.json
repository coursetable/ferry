            "\u00a0EAST309J is a good class. It focuses on the history of memory and objects that remember the past. There are about three texts to read each week. It helped me get a sense of a very specific field of history where Prof. Ho specializes, the history of memory and monuments. In terms of workload, you need to submit a weekly blog post and throughout the semester you will need to co-lead the discussion with one or two other classmates. ",
            "\u00a0This class required a lot of in-depth reading because we had to complete weekly blog post and rotate being discussion leaders. I think I develop skills to craft questions, even if they weren't great, and try to engage peers in conversations, even though it barely worked. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about Chinese history through more artistic lenses. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how the rich history and culture of China has been adopted, appropriated, interpreted and preserved in modern China. The course's wide approach, not only touching on political projects but also architecture, art, exhibitions and other subjects, greatly expanded the scope of our understanding on the matter. The course also focused on writing and helped improve students' own writing skills, with the last class reserved for a workshop for our final paper. ",
            "\u00a0I began to develop  a theoretical understanding of memory studies and refined my understanding of modern Chinese history through reading a series of highly engaging monographs on how history, memory, and the past interplayed to influence China today. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0It was a good class. Prof. Ho assigns good texts and asked for students to be engaged with the material by requiring that we submit blog entries. I also thought everyone in the class had had an exposure to Chinese history or was interested in the field, so that made for a good class. ",
            "\u00a0Weakness: I think the weekly question/discussion leaders made the conversation too forced and faux academic. I actually learned relatively little from my peers because it felt like everyone was trying too hard to impress the instructor. \r\n\r\nStrength: People were really friendly and willing to help each other. For the most part, the instructor let us have conversations and didn't try to dominate with her knowledge (which is common for a lot of Yale prof) ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the readings for this course and thought that they were very well chosen. The syllabus is also carefully crafted for us to reflect on key themes/questions related to the readings each week. However, I felt like the discussion questions were often not very helpful/focused and would have preferred if the discussions weren't centered around trying to fit into the scope of the questions. I also thought that sometimes discussions got sidetracked and it took too long for us as a class to bring it back to focus. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed learning a new approach to studying Chinese history, but because the course covers a large span of time, I didn't have an extremely firm grasp on any part of it. ",
            "\u00a0The course was really unique in that it focused not on the state-led, political \"uses\" of the past as the title may suggest, but covered various subjects and actors in the process of adopting the historical resources of China. Although at first this was a struggle since I did not have any background in some of the content discussed, ultimately I feel like I learned greatly from these challenges. The focus on improving our writing also helped immensely, as we were able to work on our prose and arguments on topics of our interest while getting direct feedback from our professor. The use of diverse sources, ranging from typical history papers to ethnography, biography, and even lantern slides from the Art Library, allowed me to move beyond my traditional scope of sources I use for research and start incorporating new types of sources. ",
            "\u00a0The readings aren't too structured and it's sometimes hard to determine exactly what the flow of course material is. ",
            "\u00a0The course is fortunate to have professor Ho as an instructor: prof. Ho is extremely kind and knowledgeable. The course material is meaningful and something every history major should at least get to know a bit about (even if someone has no interest in Chinese history, the focus on memory and history in the course is still very relevant for other fields of historical and sociological inquiry). "

        [
            "\u00a0This was an excellent course, Professor Ho is a very engaging and interesting Professor and you will definitely learn a lot. However, you should bear in mind that this class is heavily based on being able to work independently. Professor Ho has a pretty hands-off approach to teaching and, while she is definitely there to answer questions and help out, she will depend on you working independently to achieve most of the aims of the course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to another student, because Prof. Ho is a caring professor, selects good texts and engages students with the topics. ",
            "\u00a0If you are into Chinese history and architecture, yes. If not, it might not be the best course because it is such a narrow topic that if you were just taking it not because it was your passion, it gets boring and hard to focus in. it is just a really niche topic. Professor is great. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Professor Ho is incredibly helpful and the course material is really cool. I do think however that it expects a certain level of background knowledge because we don't do a historical overview for the different periods of Chinese history in the twentieth century. ",
            "\u00a0It depends if you're interested in unconventional history studying. If you are looking for a straight history class, you might not like this one. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to students that are interested in learning more about modern China and its relation to history, or research in the field of Chinese history in general. The topics covered may not be those in a typical history seminar since it uses sources from fields like architecture and anthropology, but I ultimately learned greatly from this approach. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend the course to another student for all the above reasons I just touched on (professor, course material, reading, and the final assignment). However, I would say that it would be helpful if we got a bit more feedback on the small assignments along the way: I found myself a little stressed throughout the course about how I was performing. Also, Professor Ho (being the wonderfully supportive professor she is) does not really intervene when someone poses a potentially misleading point. I think the good intentions of this practice nevertheless can make discussions seem a little disorienting, especially in the earlier sessions of the class. However, the class really got more cohesive later on in the term and I enjoyed every session discussion tremendously. "
