            "\u00a0I learned a lot of general techniques that are commonly used in chemical biology classes, but they generally were isolated to adding fluorphores onto proteins.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am definitely more familiar with the vocabulary of my field, and have the mental tools to design complex experiments now. ",

            "\u00a0It seemed like there may have been some disconnect between the two professors that made the course seem less organized. For example, one would be unsure if the other professor had gone through a certain topic. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: It was a great course! It was interesting and well-taught.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class was team-taught by two professors, and they didn't always seem to be on the same page about assignments, homework, and exams. I think a few hours of organization throughout the semester would have smoothed things over a bit more. ",
            "\u00a0The research proposal was a great assignment; I really enjoyed writing it. I was a little daunting at first when choosing a topic, but it's essentially license to just delve into any research problem of your choice and be creative, which I thought was fun. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- All-star professors covering broadly applicable topics in great detail.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- Not the best planning of the team-taught lectures relative to one another. As much as I enjoyed my personal project, giving up almost 3 weeks of the semester to listen to students present is a bit arduous and boring. I would rather hear the professors cover more topics. \r\n\r\nThus, shift presentations to be out of class, or limit the class size. Also, that was an unreasonable number of papers to read and even the most dedicated students quickly fell behind. You need to select ~ 1 paper a week which is amazing, and leave the rest as references. No one has time to read 10 papers a week, where 2 are Reviews. ",
