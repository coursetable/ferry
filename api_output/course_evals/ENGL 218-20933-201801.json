            "\u00a0I gained a broader conception of the scope of literary pursuits in the 17th century. The course covered topics such as religion, feminism, scientific progress, and slavery, and Professor Rogers handled all of these with great care, humor, and insight. ",
            "\u00a0I think one of the most important skills I learned was how to approach language that seems archaic and esoteric, and, most importantly, to recognize the universal (and at times relatable!) thoughts and understandings behind the texts. I learned how to argue with texts and not merely accept what was on the page, and I also learned how to present my observations in a clear way. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a broader knowledge of 17th century texts, and a deeper understanding of the metaphysics of this period. ",
            "\u00a0This course prepares you to read good writing, including weird writing. Some of the stuff we were assigned to read is strange, but you'll get comfortable with (or at least capable of) making sense of these stories and poems  and even enjoying them  even though they sometimes seem to bear little resemblance to contemporary creative writing. You'll gain skills in making connections between authors of the period. On that note, it was kind of cool to enter a body of literature form an era I knew nothing about, and then emerge from the semester comfortable with reading utopian fiction, theories of science, and early novel-esque travel narratives. It's also just a really enjoyable class, and a very approachable seminar experience! ",
            "\u00a0I was exposed to several authors I had never heard of, all of whom were an absolute pleasure to read. I gained a much greater appreciation for 17th-century literature and all its wildness. I became a better reader and a better writer. All in all, this was a tremendous course. ",
            "\u00a0Better writing skills, more open attitude to reading difficult texts. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about some lovely and crazy works of literature that I would never have otherwise had the chance to read, and the close reading skills that most English classes work on building ",
            "\u00a0This course provides a very varied view of 17th century literature, from poetry, to proto-novels, to religious or political allegories, to scientific articles (and more). You will read big names like Donne, Herbert, Dryden, and some largely unknown authors, as well. The 17th century was a nebulous time literarily, bridging the gap between Renaissance and modern literature. You will read some great works and a fair number of strange and baffling works that you otherwise may never have read. This course will expose you to the wealth of literature that came out of the 17th century--there was a lot more there than just Milton.\r\nThe course meets once a week and you will have a few hours of reading for each class, often including some secondary sources. Because you may have whole prose works to cover per class, you should pay closest attention to the passages/questions that Professor Rogers highlights, and when he doesn't specify, be ready to discuss passages you felt were particularly notable. ",
            "\u00a0Fascinating course with amazing material - you'll become better at reading and interpreting the metaphysical poets, analyzing the details of their literature and how their worldviews were constructed. Hands down one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0This has honestly been the most entertaining, insightful, and thoroughly enjoyable course I've taken here at Yale so far.  Throughout the semester, I've been continually challenged by the authors, who (with some prodding) unlock vast vistas of human thought and grapple with fundamental issues that in our present day seem both real and of another age. The 17th century was a wild time, and in the works that we've read - whether in the efforts of John Wilkins to create an entire artificial language, in John Donne's superfluous 1st anniversary poem, in Francis Bacon's call to consider the true ends of knowledge, or in Margeret Cavendish's invention of a whole new world - we see the passionate, intense and bewildering attempts of people trying to make statements and pose questions of who we are and how we relate to the world, to governments, to God, down to our own mind and senses.\r\nThis whole semester, for me, was a journey in discovering the intricate power and beauty of language - how it really relates us to the world, how it is used to create works of art, and how it relates to time and posterity. Because to think of reading these works, four centuries after they were written, is to consider in quiet awe the sense of posterity in Thomas Browne's Urne Burial... \r\n\r\nSo really, I think I come out of it with a greater appreciation of the world than before. It's been fun! ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to engage critically with less traditional texts without dismissing their merit. I developed a strong sense of understanding of common themes in 17th century literature and how these themes relate to past and current works of literature. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the many types of literature in the seventeenth century. I saw firsthand all the different critiques that could be made on a subject. "

        [
            "\u00a0Our class discussions were riveting, and Professor Rogers did a great job of making everyone feel validated and heard. I loved the texts we read, but at times I feel that--due to their length--we were not able to address some of the most pertinent issues of the text. I also think that at times the class was a bit too student-driven, though I understand that it was a seminar and student discussions are crucial. I would have loved to have heard more of Professor Rogers' thoughts about the texts. ",
            "\u00a0The course should provide more accompanying biographical and historical information to accompany the texts. Often, the texts were discussed in a vacuum, and students said ridiculous things about them, because they had no knowledge of the period. Also, I think the course should be moved to a level 300 or 400 seminar, and there should be some prerequisites. ",
            "\u00a0I was impressed by the range of texts that were chosen: a mix of spiritual poetry in different veins, debaucherous utopia narratives, theories of science, and many more. It helped me gain a more thorough appreciation of the 17th century as a time as culturally complex as our own! The class discussions were great (and occasionally included enjoyable student presentations), and assignments were well-paced and, coupled with Professor Rogers' generous help with our thought process, genuinely helpful to my understanding of the texts. ",
            "\u00a0This is a phenomenal course. The syllabus is lovely, and wild. It includes a great variety of authors and genres, as well as literary criticism, which was very helpful to read. The weekly readings were very manageable and highly interesting. The papers were fun to write. Class discussion was excellent. Wouldn't have changed a thing about this course. ",
            "\u00a0A great class with interesting readings, but sometimes difficult readings! Generally very good. ",
            "\u00a0Theres a great selection of readings, Professor Rogers leads discussion in delightful directions, the papers are fun to writeI had a blast! ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is the range of literary forms and topics covered. Professor Rogers is very knowledgable about these authors and this period, so office hours are also fruitful for further discussion of questions you have about the text. \r\nI found it helpful when Professor Rogers posted on Canvas that week's discussion questions/passages of interest, so that I could know ahead of time what I should focus on and prepare in a more in-depth way for discussion.\r\nI would have liked more time to be spent on the most notable authors, especially Herbert and Dryden. We didn't read Dryden's poetry (only a verse play), so I feel like we missed out on his best work. Some weeks felt like we were struggling to come up with more things to discuss (perhaps because the students weren't very engaged by a certain text), while other weeks, it felt like we would benefit from another week studying that author. ",
            "\u00a0There are only strengths: Professor Rogers is an amazing lecturer with a delightful sense of humor. He was great at balancing giving background information and directing discussion. The course material is fascinating, with many books centering around utopias and fantasies. I looked forward to this class every week. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Rogers.  This course explores a lot! It was fascinating to be a part of a conversation that was always infused with his tremendous enthusiasm, one that incorporated everyone's thoughts but at the same time was almost imperceptibly guided to a greater understanding. At least that's how I felt.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None? ",
            "\u00a0This class has opened my eyes to the amazing world of 17th Century English Literature. I am fascinated by the marvelous range of books that we read. Because these works are from quite a long time ago, the writing style is very different. And so each work expanded my conception of what writing could be like, or used to be like. We read dictionaries, we read works that tried to comment human existence throughout history, we read a philosophical treatise with an attached fantastic world. I would love to read more paired philosophy and fiction! This course broadened my mind to the myriad products of human imagination. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Absolutely - the material is not always the most interesting or easy to read, but the class discussions are always engaging and the larger themes of the course are relevant both for the major and for overall understanding of the 17th century. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I was initially intimidated by the thought of reading works from the seventeenth-century; however, I found them to be engaging, moving, and at times even hilarious. I think that it is easy to dismiss these works, some of which are relatively unknown, but it was truly worth it to read and discuss them. ",
            "\u00a0A survey of 17th century literature (except for Milton and Shakespeare). Professor Rogers is a very astute reader, though he leads section with too soft a hand. If you want depth, you're better off taking an independent study with Rogers or another 17th century professor. If you want a relatively laid-back, 2-paper class with a friendly classroom atmosphere and access to one of Yale's best scholars, take this class. Ultimately, I realized that my problems with this class came down to the students, not the teaching or the material. There were maybe two other serious English majors in this seminar, and aside from their generally on-the-mark comments, very little of what was said in class was interesting or observant. It often felt like nobody had any idea what the 17th century was, or had even taken the time to do the reading week to week. Rogers was lenient, and listened to their rambling nonsensical statements, but I could tell he was as frustrated by the lack of intellectual engagement as I was. ",
            "\u00a0definitely! Professor Rogers makes the material so enriching. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend this to anyone who wants a solid, fun seminar experience. It involves reading admittedly difficult texts, but in a very supportive and low-key environment, and so it may be an especially good precursor to senior seminars for those studying English or other humanities. Also, you'll just laugh a lot. ",
            "\u00a0A really interesting reading list, though at times, I felt like the class was a little all over the place and I'm not sure what I took away from the discussions. Still, worth it for the experience of discussing texts you probably wouldn't read for any other course here. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely. I loved this course. I could not recommend this course highly enough. If you enjoy literature, this is the course for you! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this if you have any interest in the topic, or if you want the chance to take a seminar with an AMAZING professor who will enjoy every minute of teaching. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone. English majors who are looking for a fairly painless pre-1800 will appreciate this course for it's more interesting reading list and lively discussion. Additionally, anyone interested in debating wild ideas about religion, science, politics, and race should take this course. It is tons of fun, not least of all because Professor Rogers is a gem. He is so kind and knowledgeable, yet despite all of his qualifications, he sometimes seems as flabbergasted as the rest of us at the works we read. I appreciated his honesty and it helped me to feel free to explore new ideas without the fear of being seen as \"dumb\" by my other classmates. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Great reading and a great Professorwhat more do you want? ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend it because Professor Rogers will help you approach texts that seem otherwise daunting or strange in order to derive something meaningful from them. Most of these texts are under-read and under-studied, yet most were extremely influential in their time and have continued to influence authors throughout the modern period. It will make you a broader-minded reader of literature and help you discover authors who really interest you and whom otherwise you likely would not have read. ",
            "\u00a0Would highly recommend: the workload wasn't too bad and getting to read literature for homework is always the best. Professor Rogers is an amazing lecturer with a delightful sense of humor. He was great at balancing giving background information and directing discussion. The course material is fascinating, with many books centering around utopias and fantasies. I looked forward to this class every week. ",
            "\u00a0Don't know much about 17th century English literature? Me neither, when I started. Don't worry, because this is one of the (scratch that, THE) best seminar I've had the opportunity to take at Yale, due to John Rogers & Co. Here's what you're signing up for:\r\n- you read a different author every week! Poetry, plays, court plays, utopias, essays, gardens, fantastic new worlds, hidden agendas, languages, and the 17th century, it's all here\r\n- Tuesday mornings in which you leave class feeling awed by the details of these 17th century works, much more inspired and knowledgeable than when you came in\r\n- essays in which you can explore anything you want (with prompts for the undecided_ ",
            "\u00a0I cannot stress how much I enjoyed this course. John Rogers is an excellent professor who engages carefully and thoughtfully with students' ideas. I found his approach of applying pressure to students' points to be effective because the pressure was always just the right amount. He didn't press students too much or let them get away with frivolous points. He's extremely encouraging which made the entire experience enjoyable and rewarding. I strove to do better because he wanted us to excel as scholars in the field. ",
            "\u00a0This course is amazing! Please take it! You will be pushed to expand your view of literature as you explore various documents of writing from quite some time ago, by people with some quite different worldviews that still remain relevant. If anything take it for the awesome syllabus and wonderful discussion led by the fantastic Professor Rogers! "
