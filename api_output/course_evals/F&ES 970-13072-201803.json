I also learned about litigation techniques for various environmental law topics via guest speakers. The class was interesting and informative as well as practical in building skills for real-world application. ",

            "\u00a0As a law student, I had expectations for a clinic course that were much different than what the EPC embodies. EPC applies a much greater hands-off approach than my previous clinic experiences, and I am not sure that is a good approach. Greater oversight and better student assignment for certain projects should be incorporated into the process. ",

            "\u00a0I think some of my proposed improvements are already underway for Spring 2019, such as more integration of forestry and law students. I thought another weakness was the faculty advising. Our group meetings with our faculty advisors ended up being essentially time wasted. It was one thing that our advisor was not particularly knowledgeable about our topic, but moreover didn't review our deliverables before our meetings or really offer any tangible guidance at all over the semester. ",
            "\u00a0The course offers great projects and clients with whom to work for a semester. It could be improved by greater oversight during the student assignment process and throughout the semester to ensure projects are meeting their targets. I also think seminar could be structured a bit differently to encourage greater student involvement and more meetings among groups and with supervisors. ",
            "\u00a0Breadth of projects was excellent but there were serious issues with the level of commitment in our group that could have been mitigated by a formalized mid-semester peer evaluation/check-in. "
