            "\u00a0I learned a ton about experimental design and scientific communication, and I was reminded of the humanity in science and medicine. ",
            "\u00a0This class isn't necessarily about the science you actually do -- though we had a pretty comprehensive overview of cell biology techniques including size exclusion chromatography, Western blotting, and immunoprecipitation. It's much more about thinking like a scientist. You learn the motivations for the techniques and how to plan experiments, read primary literature, and listen to prospective Yale professors giving \"job talks\" at MCDB seminars. This is an incredibly valuable skill for any scientist. ",
            "\u00a0I gained greater insight into a variety of cell biology techniques as well as how to present on a scientific paper. ",
            "\u00a0I developed an immense understanding of the purpose and functionality of important experiments in the field of cellular biology. Through learning about these experiments and techniques from classmates, giving a presentation myself to others, and actually doing these assays to solve problems, I became much more comfortable with how to craft an approach to solving a problem in cellular biology. ",
            "\u00a0This class taught us how to think like scientists when it comes to answering research questions through the use of cell bio techniques. We also developed our teamwork skills, since the class grew very close together, and Dr. Wolenski's passion inspires us to continue being involved with research and science. ",
            "\u00a0This class is insightful and will teach you life skills in addition to cell bio techniques. The greatest class in the MCDB major and it will prepare you for a future in med school and grad school. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about different techniques in cell biology, and how to give a presentation. ",
            "\u00a0Cell bio lab techniques ",
            "\u00a0I learned many new lab techniques as well as valuable presentation skills. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to communicate experiment results and think more critically about data. We all had to give a chalk talk explaining a concept, which taught me how to present scientific ideas. Also, I learned so many lab techniques. The students in this class, Dr. Wolenski, and Renee truly worked as a team to learn together, which is something unique in a STEM class. This class was so supportive and fun to attend every Monday and Wednesday. I feel a lot more confident about research and discussing biology concepts now. ",
            "\u00a0I learned practical lab techniques as well as how to optimize procedures. Through the chalk talk I learned how to prepare for this type of presentation and improved my confidence in teaching and responding to questions. I also gained insight about microscopy, of which I had little prior experience. ",
            "\u00a0You learn techniques for creating columns, passing cells and running gels. ",
            "\u00a0In this course I learned a variety of experimental techniques relevant to cell biology. More specifically in this course we learned about cell culture, wound healing, fluorescent microscopy, gel filtration chromatography,  dissections, immunoprecipitation, and how to give chalk talks (short lecture explanations on scientific topics). ",
            "\u00a0There was so much that I learned in this course, and one of the most important concepts was how to be a good scientist, not only in terms of good technique but in knowing why we are doing each experiment and interpreting our results. I learned to give chalk talks. From the seminars we attended, I learned how to give a successful presentation on scientific works. ",
            "\u00a0This course made me grow as a scientist more than any other course I have taken at Yale. Everything about this class stuck with me. Not just the types of experiments, but the way we approach scientific problems. This class was inherently very collaborative and our class got very close by the end of the semester. One of my main takeaways from this class is that I learned how to communicate scientific ideas (even research that wasnt mine) in a way that was clear and understandable. This class made me both a better scientist and a better person, and that is all thanks to Dr. Wolenski and our two wonderful TAs. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: Community, community, community. Dr. Wolenski prioritizes the well-being of his students above almost everything else, and it really creates a positive classroom environment, which is so rare in a department--and a lab requirement within that department at that--that most people dread. He demonstrates how much he cares about his students so regularly that it's easy to take for granted, from constant offers to write rec letters to great guest speakers to lots and lots of ice cream breaks. There are no lab reports because there is a mutual understanding that there are better ways to assess one's success in lab like cooperation. The chalk talk was a fun and meaningful exercise is synthesizing complicated scientific topics and concentrating them down to a five minute presentation. On the whole, the course is designed to be low stress and high impact, which I really appreciated.\r\nWeaknesses: Dr. Wolenski is prone to rambling about topics both related and entirely unrelated to the course, which, although it works to foster the community I so appreciated, often made me feel like lab could've been much more efficient. In a lab that meets twice a week, that makes a relatively big difference. Additionally, and I want to be as empathetic as I can with this critique of a very well-meaning straight white man, Dr. Wolenski regularly made comments I'd consider microagressions--from glorifying hypermasculinity to exoticizing students of color to conflating addiction with criminality, these comments often made me slightly tense and uncomfortable. Dr. Wolenski is an authority figure with a great reputation (and he deserves it), but that made it difficult to speak up, which is why I'm doing so here. ",
            "\u00a0Really no weaknesses to speak of (besides that science doesn't always cooperate, and you're not guaranteed to end up with pretty data at the end). Strengths: everything. Wolenski is one of the few science professors at Yale who seems to genuinely care about teaching and the well-being and intellectual development of his students, and that care shows in the classroom experience. The guest speakers were always super interesting, and though it was slightly geared toward pre-meds, the material covered in lab and by the guest speakers was engaging and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0It was very clear that Prof. Wolenski really cared about us and our learning -- however at times the labs felt a little unstructured, and I think I would have appreciated to have a clearer idea what was going to be done every lab (but that is also me being inflexible). ",
            "\u00a0No weaknesses to this course. It was worth every second of my time and I enjoyed showing up every single time. Dr. Wolenski is incredible and just wants us to succeed and to learn for real. No gimmicks, no nonsense, just to really learn this stuff and appreciate it. Please dont change a thing! ",
            "\u00a0This class is the best, most enjoyable class I have taken at Yale and there is not one thing I would change. The strengths include the student presentations (chalk and job talks) as well as guest speakers but the absolute best part of the class is Dr. Wolenski and his unmatched energy and passion. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are professor wolenski and the TAs absolutely are brilliant you will learn how to be a scientist from them! LIFE IS GOOD! ",
            "\u00a0A major strength of the course was the teaching -- Professor Wolenski and Renee were wonderful. The community was great, as was the experience of giving a presentation. I would have liked to spend less time listening to speakers and more going into the science and doing the techniques, though. ",
            "\u00a0One of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Absolutely fantastic lab, you learn so much and have so much fun. The students get really close (ayyy gels that bind), and the guest speakers provide incredible insight as to careers in biology research, medicine and industry. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Dr. Wolenski is such a supportive, engaging, funny, knowledgeable, and kind professor. He always chooses such nice and supportive TA's for this class too. The chalk talks were helpful to teach us how to present biology concepts and answer difficult questions on the spot. The labs we did were engaging and taught us important techniques, and allowed us to practice analyzing data. Dr. Wolenski also invited many guest speakers to our class (med students to talk about med school apps, dean of yale med's md/phD program, biotech people, etc). Our TA's and him also brought in so much food for us to feast on throughout the semester. We also went on such a fun and wholesome hike in Guilford to celebrate the last day of class-- it was so refreshing and was one of my favorite memories from Yale. Everyone in this class became a family and I know we will have many reunions in the future. This has been my favorite class at Yale! ",
            "\u00a0The class was tightly knit and we gained a lot through cooperation, which is the greatest strength of this course. Sometimes, I think we could have made more productive use of time but overall it was a great course. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: The level of attention on students is unparalleled. As previous years have stated, the class is so well taught. The class creates a collaborative atmosphere and one that encourages students to help each other. There was hardly any exams, and I thought that allowed students to feel they could focus on the labs themselves and not feeling pressured to memorize everything. The best part of the class was the job talk and chalk talks. Being able to attend these talks, but then give them ourselves really showed me how science is like. ",
            "\u00a0This class is amazing and I don't know how it could improve. I hope that in the upcoming years it has the same amount of resources so that future students get to perform all of the experiments and practice all of the techniques from this year. The techniques learned in this class are actually relevant to those done in real lab settings and absolutely essential to learn from someone with Wolenski's expertise. ",
            "\u00a0I cant think of any weaknesses of this course, only strengths. I very much appreciate that the course emphasized how to be a good scientist and how to effectively communicate what we know. I learned about and performed numerous techniques utilized in cell biology research. Preparing for and giving the chalk talk taught me to think critically about scientific papers and how to relay their information without the help of figures. The atmosphere of the course really promoted personal growth as a scientist, especially from the constructive feedback from fellow students, Dr. Wolenski, Rene, and Don. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this class is that all the work we did directly helped us become better scientists. The Chalk Talks and Job Talks were very intensive to prepare for and to deliver, and probably among the hardest work Ive had to do for a science class at Yale. Feedback was received immediately on the spot, and it was always constructive. There are no lab reports that take a long time to write with little benefit to the student. Instead, all of the learning takes place in the classroom. All science labs should be like this one! The class is highly interactive and engaging. Another one of the strengths is that Dr. Wolenski brings in many diverse guest speakers that share their insight into life after college and science as it is today. We also went to two large conferences at Yale as a class, which was really wonderful. While we worked very hard in class, there was always a ton of food and festivity rewarding our efforts. The time always flew by, and it would be 6pm before we knew it. Its hard to think of a single thing that could improve about this class! "

            "\u00a0Yes--can't imagine a better way to fulfill your lab requirement! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. If you're reading this review and you're an MCDB major, email Wolenski now and get on the waiting list. Easily the best science class I've taken at Yale and it's not even close. ",
            "\u00a0I loved attending this course every day. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This is a great MCDB lab and you will have a lot of fun. ",
            "\u00a0If you managed to get yourself into this class, you simply cannot pass up taking it. You NEED to experience what this class has to offer and the bonds you form with the other people in the class. ",
            "\u00a0I would 100% recommend this course to another student, especially if they are interested in biology and/or research. This class teaches you a lot of useful techniques as well as what questions to ask when it comes to answering a research question. ",
            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!!! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is definitely the best lab in MCDB. You may know the techniques if you already work in a lab, and 10 hours is a lot, but it is manageable. ",
            "\u00a0100%. Just know you have to email Dr. Wolenski in your first two years to get in the class (seriously, its that popular) ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This was different than any other course I had taken at Yale. It was very hands on and collaborative. The whole class really became one team. Everyone helped everyone to learn and practice important lab techniques. Dr. Wolenski is very caring and experienced as a professor, and just a great human being. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Get in the lab with Wolenski and watch your class become a family. Yes, you'll spend ~10 hours in here a week, but it's 100 p worth the investment, because you'll leave with 1) improved lab skills, 2) better public speaking skills, 3) life skills, and 4) a lab family ",
            "\u00a0This has been my favorite class at Yale! You have to email Dr. Wolenski 18 months in advance because this class is that amazing and everyone wants to take it. I learned so many important skills from this class while having fun. It's such a supportive learning environment and is a great way to fulfill your lab requirement for MCDB. We're in lab for about 8-10 hours per week, which can be tiring, but I loved every minute of it. Plus, we don't have that much homework outside of class, other than studying for a quiz and analyzing data now and then, so this accounts for the long hours of class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! You have to sign up ahead of time but if you can get in it's a great lab! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This is the best class I have taken at Yale, and the best class in MCDB by a landslide. The hours might seem a little intimidating but time flies in this course and when you are actually learning from a professor that cultivates a rich learning environment. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class! This is my favorite class at Yale! Dr. Wolenski, Rene, and Don are very passionate about science, and their passion really brings about an atmosphere of cohesiveness and excitement to our class. Every Mondays and Wednesdays, I look forward to spending 5+ hours in MCDB 344 and time flies by very quickly in this class. Email Dr. Wolenski ASAP because there is a long wait-list to be in this lab class! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, one-million times over. This is without a doubt the best class I have taken at Yale. If you're an MCDB major, this lab outcompetes all the other labs by a long shot. It does take a considerable amount of time out of your week, but so will any of the other labs necessary for the B.S. in MCDB. "
