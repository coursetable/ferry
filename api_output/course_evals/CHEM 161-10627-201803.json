            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n - Sapling practice problems/problem sets: It helped me learn the material, and some of the problems were similar to the test.\r\n- Discussion section: Having us work together in small groups to solve problems was very helpful. It was engaging, and the problems were usually challenging, but it was a good low stakes environment to practice. The quizzes could be hard, but they aren't worth much, and you get points for participating basically. The only issue I had was that section was too short, and it ALWAYS ran over the assigned time. Also, the students had way too many questions for 1 TF to handle by herself, poor Coraline.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- The cost: I had the pleasure (heavy sarcasm) of taking this course right as they decided to change the textbook edition, so I couldn't get a used edition from upperclassmen. I had to buy a brand new book and it was really expensive. Also, Sapling is a good resource, but it's $40 a semester! It's ridiculous to pay that much money just for the ability to turn in your homework. \r\n- Homework discussions: Useless. Since there are 300ish people in this class, you can't have any sort of meaningful discussion. And having to make a post 3 times a week just felt excessive to me. \r\n- Lectures: Lecture was 3 times a week, which is a lot! Generally I didn't feel a lot of motivation to go. Usually I did not receive very much new insight. Reducing lecture to 2 times a week or just getting rid of it altogether would've been more helpful. I personally feel like the class would've been more engaging and more conducive to learning it was less lecture-style and more discussion section-style. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course is its repetition of content in different ways. The readings, problems, sections and then psets ensured that I learnt the materials. I also found it useful to go through practice problems during lecture, because this is how we are tested. Most of the demonstrations are engaging, but I would suggest that it is not necessary to have a demonstration if it does not enhance our understanding. I also think that the class should start at 10:30 as indicated on CourseSearch. It would enable us to get through everything and also leave at 11:20 if we have a class directly after chemistry. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I think the set up of the course is very good for learning. I really benefited from the practice problems on Sapling as well as the course instruction by the professor. I think the grading system was fair as well. Additionally, Holland had some pretty fun incentives and prizes throughout the semester that kept the class engaging and fun. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There was supposed to be this great focus on collaboration and working together, but I feel like this idea was actually lost throughout the course. Some of the other TFs that I would go to their section instead, they made everyone work alone and did not encourage collaboration. Additionally, I feel like topics were rushed at the end of the semester. ",

            "\u00a0I thought that sometimes the course content was not as clear as it should be, like when learning VSEPR there should have been 3D modeling because I had a hard time visualizing 3D concepts. Sometimes the tests were not graded fairly, like when I lost 12 points off a test question for misbalancing 1 equation. ",
            "\u00a0As far as introductory lectures go, I thought it was taught very well. It was engaging and helpful, and there was a good mixture of self accountability and communal support. I liked having multiple chances on the sapling homeworks. I felt like that motivated me to continue trying to solve the problems without looking at the hints or at online resources for help. One weakness was that the excel sheet for homework was incorrect many times, so sometimes I thought there was no homework when there was... ",
            "\u00a0The course is very demanding. The structure has time sensitive assignments that keep you engaged with chemistry all the time. Sometimes the lectures stray from the topics in the book, which is okay because I understand a professor wants to keep things interesting. However, too many tangents can disengage the students. ",
            "\u00a0The in-class demonstrations were very helpful and engaging. Also, I thought the problem sets and practice problems accurately reflected the material being covered and helped me understand the concepts. One thing that I would improve on was the consistency of information. There were a few times where we got emails clarifying certain topics that were not explained correctly during the lecture. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths: Dr. Huynh is one of the best teachers I have had so far at Yale.  He is extremely clear and really wants to help his students.  The problem sets on Sapling were very worthwhile in better understanding the material.  The peer tutors are also very good.\r\n\r\nThe weaknesses:  The misconception that Chemistry should be taught as a discussion or a seminar is an unfortunate aspect of this course.  The time that Prof. Holland spent giving us his teaching philosophy was a good indication of how useless lecture was going to be.  The focus on \"fun\" science and real world application is not at all useful to grasping the material. I wish that professor Holland had focused more on the content of the book.  Although student are supposed to be familiar with the material from doing the readings, if the material is not reinforced and explained in class, there is no purpose in attending class. ",
            "\u00a0weakness: practice exams were much easier than actual exam. also, section worksheets, they didn't give us the answers to the problems so we couldn't know if what we were doing was right or not, and we were to take a quiz on the material in the last five min of section. just be mindful of that.

The sections and pre-lecture questions were helpful.\r\n\r\nI felt like the discussions before lectures weren't completely necessary, especially with other pre-lecture material. I also felt like the learning was heavily dependent on reading. Also, the Sapling questions were fine, but weren't always similar to exam questions. ",

            "\u00a0I feel that class time could be used a lot more efficiently, although it might be at the cost of cutting back on demos. \r\n\r\nMy main complaint is how the discussion sections are run. Sometimes, no one in our group would know how to do a certain problem and although our TA could guide us, she couldn't out-right show up step by step how to do the problem. This meant that sometimes I would leave the session being unsure about whether I really understood how to do a problem. However, after the session, she was more than happy to go over any questions we had. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of this course was the amount of practice problems available to students. There were numerous practice exams to try before each hour-long exam, and countless problems from the book / Sapling problem sets / Sapling practice problems to learn from. I knew (more or less) what kinds of information Professor Holland wanted us to know because of all the various types of practice available. Another strength of this course is the sheer number and availability of office hours. There are literally so many times and places you can meet with a TF / instructor / peer tutor to help you. \r\n\r\nOne weakness of this course was that lectures were not always useful. Sometimes we focused on things in lecture that were not going to be on the exam - I didn't really see the point of this. Demos in class were fun but not always instructive. ",
            "\u00a0MIOY HUNYH WAS THE STRENGTH OF THIS COURSE!!! Officially, he was the preceptor of the class, but I learned so much from him. He was very friendly with students and always was more than willing to answer questions. Make friends with Mioy and ask him questions throughout the term. He's incredible. ",

            "\u00a0I am personally not a fan of the flipped classroom. The lectures sometimes provided information relevant to students, but most of the time I thought they lacked important information.\r\n\r\nA lot of the information presented in lectures, however, was very interesting, which helped with engagement. ",
            "\u00a0I think that Prof. Holland's lectures were quite engaging and generally clearly conveyed topics covered in the textbook. (I also appreciated that they were available on Canvas.) The weekly quizzes in discussion section were a useful way to have feedback on many different topics. Sometimes, though, I felt that too much time was spent on simpler issues and less time on more confusing ones; perhaps being able to focus some lectures based on feedback regarding what topics were most confusing in the reading would be helpful, though it might be hard to pull off. Also, I disliked the Reflection questions that weren't particularly relevant to reading or class and required internet research into random topics  I felt that they didn't add to my understanding and were a bit of a waste of time. ",
            "\u00a0Not a very engaging course, but there were A LOT of resources to help. The live experiments every class were very fun and helped solidify our understanding of what was being taught in lecture. ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus moves very fast, and sometimes a lot of studying has to be done at home to learn things and keep up with what's going on. Also the discussion section was not very helpful because the TFs were not allowed to give us the answers to the worksheets which I I did not find useful. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were honestly the extra resources/review sessions that Dr. Huynh provided to help the students understand the material beyond the required readings and the lectures. I also thought the Sapling p-set were good practice, but they didn't reflect how the actual exam questions tested the material at all, so I'd count that as a weakness.  I found the reflection questions more confusing than helpful in interacting with the readings. I wish clicker questions in class more reflected what would appear on the exams. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are streaming it live. I also found that the course had many opportunities for practice problems that reflected the material on the exam.\r\n\r\nIn the future, I think that Prof. Holland's lectures should more accurately reflect the relevant material. The textbook reading would often not fully be covered during lecture, and so it was difficult to distinguish relevant from inconsequential information. Too much of the class time was taken up by going over reflections or by applications to the real world that while interesting did not further my understanding of the material. ",

            "\u00a0More focus could be put on harder concepts. ",
            "\u00a0Well lecture was kinda a huge waste of time, I thought. I think a more robust use of the chalkboards, and less of the slideshow presentations, would be wildly helpful. Additionally, explaining concepts in class, like before giving examples, would be awesome. ",
            "\u00a0The readings are much more helpful than lectures. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the Sapling system, which is used for pre-lecture practice quizzes (which I found useful because it actually encouraged me to do the pre-lecture readings) and psets. Sapling was great for psets because it gave you 4 tries on every question, ensuring that you didn't lose points for making a dumb arithmetical error, and also helping you to gain greater understand by fixing your mistakes. Lecture wasn't the most useful thing, but I always went because Holland is a pretty good professor who does a good job of covering the material and explaining it in different ways that might make more sense than the way it's explained in the textbook. Although lectures are recorded and livestreamed, I would highly recommend going to lecture because you'll be way more focused on the material than if you sit in your suite and watch it. ",

",
            "\u00a0The course is interesting and relatively easy to understand, however, the course lacks an engaging element that encourages people to come to lecture. While having the lecture recorded and posted online was helpful, it discouraged many people from being present in class. ",

            "\u00a0I think a big strength of the course is that it is designed for students to succeed. I'm not a freshman, but I know it is a course very popular with that class, and it's clear why. Teachers are always available, there are a plethora of peer tutoring opportunities, and classes are recorded for later access. In general, the class is well structured for success. \r\nI think one of the larger weaknesses in the class is the way assignments are structured. It's not the worst, but having several assignments a night that each have to be turned in on different websites at different times of the day is complicated (and could certainly be streamlined). ",
            "\u00a0The lecture component is horrible. It's no wonder students stop going by two weeks in. Lectures often review the simplest concepts, while assessments do not. It is super frustrating to feel like your time is being wasted in a lecture, when it could be super helpful to review confusing concepts. I think a good remedy would be to switch to two 1 hr 30minute lectures instead of the three 55 minute lectures. There is also an insane disparity in the quality of TAs (which I guess is true of most courses, but especially true of gen chem). One of the TA's literally helps teach the class, while others barely seem to have a grasp on course content. This makes it frustrating when some TA's send out insanely detailed study guides while others do literally nothing to prepare students for their exams. ",

Dr. Mioy was by far the best TF because he provided his students with study guides, powerpoint, and tons of office hours. On top of that, he was helping to write the exams! This gave his students a HUGE advantage and the rest of us who weren't in his section a disadvantage. Because of this, I believe that grades should be curved based on the discussion sections. ",

They greatly lowered my final mark since I constantly forgot about them. I would much rather 2 p-sets be assigned every week in their place or a longer p-set. I feel that my mark will not reflect my performance on the midterms and final, but is instead determined too much by my participation. in the end I know the material, and can show my competency. this was a product of the time and work put in, yet the reflections were irrelevant and determined far too much of my final grade.

The demonstrations in each lecture kept me curious and helped me to better understand the concepts that we were learning.

I knew the general concepts and processes, however, I did not have adequate time to show my understanding. ",
            "\u00a0This course is (in theory) formatted and spaced out well, but the reality for most students is that we struggled to keep up with the nightly textbook readings, and then ended up trying to cram hundreds of pages of information the week before the  3 exams. The problem sets and nightly problems were helpful, but they were so easy that you usually didn't even need to do the reading to solve them (likewise with the non-specific nature of the canvas discussions). The problems sets, and especially the format of the lectures was not representative of the difficulty of exam problems. One strength of the class is that you can drop the lowest exam score (which I think is really important for students, and especially first-years struggling to understand the work required of them for this class).  \r\nThe general attitude surrounding this class is that you take it because you have to, not because you want to. I think that Professor Holland tried his best to bring a sense of excitement towards the subject material, but he had his work cut out for him. ",

Additionally being able to drop one is definitely a plus. The course could be improved through an elimination of the sort of flipped classroom agenda. A lot of the information is difficult to understand and if it were actually taught during class rather than just using abstract examples to try and relate the concepts to the students, everyone would benefit.

Everything imaginable was provided to help students succeed in this class: peer tutors, recordings of each lecture, and a PhD instructor who offered tutoring sessions every week 4 hours a week, just to name a few. I'd also say that the course was fair; if you put in the work, you got the grade you deserved. No frills. Weaknesses, sadly, were the lectures. Although Prof. Holland is a wonderful cheerleader for chemistry and knows how to inspire his students or make them laugh, he teaches in a somewhat hand-wavy, over-assuming way and rarely explained fundamental concepts thoroughly. This is problematic because although this was a quantitive reasoning class, the most difficult problems on exams required excellent conceptual footing and most students came into the students with little foundational knowledge. When Dr. Huynh lectured, it was like learning from a classmate who \"got it;\" he clearly understood the struggles of beginning chemistry students and explained concepts as if students had never, ever seen them before. He also \"got into the weeds\" and solved problems on the chalkboard, not only hard questions but easy ones as well. This is fantastic! I think that for lectures about topics such as moles or the history of chemistry, Prof. Holland cannot be beat, but Dr. Huynh would have been much, much appreciated on days when the most confusing topics were being introduced such as MO theory and crystal packing.

The class could be improved by having notes like Mioys available to the entire class. In addition, it would be helpful if more class time could be spent discussing and explaining new topics in more detail instead of watching demos. I found the sapling problems sets useful, and perhaps doing more practice like those problems instead of written reflections would be helpful. ",

One of the main weaknesses of this course was the way the exams were scheduled. We always were given a week after the material for an exam was finished to study and complete practice exams before the scheduled exam date. Although we were given this extra time, we were still moving forward learning material for the next exam. This meant that by the time we were taking an exam, some of the material we were tested on was learned even before we took the previous exam.

Going to lecture is not necessary to learn the information, and honestly sometimes stressed me out because Prof Holland often rushed through the lecture notes and I ended up feeling badly when people would start to leave early (to be fair, he often went over time) when he was trying to include the fun little demo that he promises at the beginning of each full class meeting/lecture. \r\nI was also frustrated by the fact that we kept moving on with material so that by the time one of the three Midterms came, the content that was on the test would be stuff we learned at least a month ago.

The weekly sessions were not very helpful since all fo the Was conduct them differently, thus I think some student were more engaged in the class if their TA was better with engaging students during the weekly discussions. I had both experiences: one where the TA allowed the students to work independently and another who forced students to collaborate in groups by making each group write their answers on the board with a justification. The latter was infinitely more beneficial for learning. It also made asking questions and making mistakes less intimidating and improved my overall retention of the material. ",

The most useful part of the lectures, for me, were the practice test questions during which I could brainstorm procedures and solutions with my classmates, but, unfortunately, there were not as many practice questions as I would have liked. I wanted more! Furthermore, I did not find the pre-class reflections particularly useful. ",

It was also very helpful that all of the lectures were live-streamed and recorded. Discussion sections were a really good way to get extra practice and further explanation on all of the material. A weakness  of this course is the number of exams, because I felt we had too many midterms. I fell like having less midterms would give us more opportunity to really focus on the information presented class rather than always having to scramble to study for the next exam, so it was harder to give a lot of attention to the newer, more difficult concepts talked about in lecture.

Additionally, the problem sets and practice problems felt useless  to the course and many times were all simply busy work with no purpose to retain knowledge. I appreciated that the material was broken down into sections as to not overwhelm but rather perfect each subject at hand; however, the way the exam was written, I felt did NOT coincide with the way material was taught for the majority of lectures. Lecture was more conceptual, so I focused on conceptual facts like what is an atom?, the exam was more qualitative like how many atoms are in X amount of moles of Y metal with weight of Z and dissolved in X at time Y and pressure Z. I felt this gap was meant to be closed in section but my section was not fruitful at all so I could not see that THAT was what I had to put my focus on, which I feel was completely an injustice to the students because of course those with good teaching fellows grasped this idea. Had I KNOWN the exams were set up in this manner I would've performed better in the course, and I did after i knew that's how this class \"worked\". And overall this class was meant and set up to address students with very little to no background in chemistry but there is no way someone could've gotten a perfect score without prior AP chemistry background, and I know this because several of my peers admitted they took this class as an \"easier\" option despite having taken AP chemistry and the higher level chemistry courses. The grading, the teaching style, the way the material was shown: THROW IT ALL AWAY and start over please. Also, there should be restrictions on the type of calculators allowed on tests because i think some very privileged people here have very nice calculators that can do more than just crunch numbers.

A weakness of this course was the disconnect between the lecture and the material. Often, I would walk out of lecture thinking I understood, but when I read the textbook and did the problem sets, I had no idea what was happening. I think bridging this gap would increase the level of comprehension in the course. "
