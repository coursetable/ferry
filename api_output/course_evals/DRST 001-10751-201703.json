            "\u00a0This class gave me a very particular set of tools for reading books, both closely and broadly. I'm a much more careful thoughtful reader now than I was before. I think I also believe, now, that close and careful reading of texts is more engaging than passive modes of reading, and I'm glad of that.\r\n\r\nAlso, my writing has improved massively. This professor is really good at diagnosing the patterns particular to your writing and helping you fix them. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me to comprehend the ambiguity in the literary texts of the Western tradition. I also noticed how many themes re-emerged across the texts we read, and I came to realize that the reason a tradition is taught on its own is for the sake of the coherence brought by those unifying themes. ",
            "\u00a0Through this course I gained a broad understanding of many seminal literary texts\r\nof the western tradition and I improved my ability to analyze those texts to extract\r\ntheir meaning. It was candidly very exciting to see intertextual connections\r\nbetween each work, to see how each author draws inspiration from or seeks to\r\noutdo previous authors. In terms of skills, I learned how to not only read quickly to\r\nunderstand broad themes and plot structures, but also to read closely a small\r\npassage and understand how it pertains to a work as a whole. This class was\r\nespecially meaningful to me because it not only expanded my understanding of how\r\nliterature provides insights into human nature, but it did so in a cohesive structure\r\nthat allowed me to understand how tradition develops. ",
            "\u00a0This was the most difficult but the most rewarding class I have taken in my life. The rigorous seminar discussions, weekly reading responses, and papers were all challenging, but even more enjoyable because I could see my exponential improvement as a writer, reader, and thinker. In particular, I found the reading responses fundamental to my intellectual growth this term. I saw these as opportunities to write mini-essays and engage with parts of the text and sharpen my analytical skills. I am deeply grateful to Directed Studies and especially Professor Slanski for her constant desire to help me improve! ",
            "\u00a0I gained a knowledge of themes in the early half of the western literary canon and developed skills of close reading and writing of literary analysis. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to make a tight, coherent, and modest argument. The class really emphasized drawing insight from both broad swaths of information and close readings of passages, and that felt really valuable. ",
            "\u00a0I gained an understanding of the classical tradition of literature and a method for analyzing it. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to truly appreciate literature at the most microscopic level, which revealed all its intricacies and style and insight in broader understanding. ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge of a variety of themes that wove themselves throughout the poetry of antiquity, the ability to read a text very closely and draw incredible insights from a small portion of the text, improved writing/close analysis abilities ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to develop my close reading skills to address a larger theme or question within the work. Many of our papers focused on drawing the connections between different  texts and examining the ways in which an author adopted and changed another's work. However, I realized that it was not sufficient just to make these connections, but I needed to take my analysis further to say something original.  I learned that feeling discomfort or disconnect in a text can be a good thing and the most rewarding questions were those within that grey area. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the themes of Western literature that have been around since the Greeks, and continue to be important today! "

            "\u00a0You know how a government can be strong because its constitution is well-constructed or because its ruler is virtuous? Or it can be both, and that's the best kind, the virtuous ruler guarding the laws, enacting and upholding and supplementing them, and also being subject to them in ways that are useful? This class is like that third situation. The curriculum is strong and well-constructed; the material suggests lots of parallels and insights all on its own. And Professor Slanski makes it compelling, draws connections you wouldn't see coming, and -- maybe most importantly -- teaches your brain to do things you didn't believe it could. Weaknesses (?): it probably won't do great favors to your GPA. But was that ever the point, really? ",
            "\u00a0As with other DS courses, this class had a heavy reading workload, but it was definitely manageable, and, if you set aside enough time, the texts we read can be very enjoyable. The biggest weakness of this course is that we don't spend much time discussing each text, even though there may be a lot to say. As a consequence, we may spend one whole class section taking about a relatively insignificant portion of a text and fail to grapple with its core meaning/purpose. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Slanski did an incredible job of focussing discussion on small\r\nportions of text that spoke to broader themes about the books. This teaching style\r\nnot only gave our discussions direction, but it helped us practice the same analytical skills that we used to write our papers. Professor Slanski also balanced encouraging student voices with challenging thoughts that aren't rooted in the text. Every one of the students in Professor Slanski's class was challenged in a way that they probably hadn't been previously, and I strongly believe that every student grew as a writer, thinker, and a human being throughout the course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I have no complaints at all about how this course was taught. The only difficulties I had with this course were due to my own external factors of having taken on a tough course load that made it difficult to keep up with the reading. One might cite the rapid reading pace as a weakness, but at the end of the day I'd say it's more of a strength because we received a broad overview of many books while also being able to dive deeply into the ones we were most interested in. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this course and would not change it. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of this course was the instructor. Professor Slanski was engaging, thoughtful, and warm; challenging the class to work harder and delve deep into the texts we were reading. She led us through the most intellectually stimulating discussions I have had at Yale so far. Expectations were always clear and lessons were always well directed. Professor Slanski made sure to provide every student with individual time for feedback and workshops on our papers. As for weaknesses, grading on our papers could have been somewhat faster. ",
            "\u00a0I think that Slanski was a really strong presence, and was able to guide us towards really insightful and valuable discussions. A lot of my friends, though, felt really unhappy in their Lit sections. It seems like this course is really dependent on the quality/style of the individual teacher. That could be somehow improved. ",
            "\u00a0We could have spent less  time on the books ",
            "\u00a0The course is all around great, and I don't know enough about literature to judge whether or not the book selections were valuable. At times, however, it did seem that we moved too fast to fully appreciate the works, getting more of a light overview than a real dissection. But to move slower would be to cover less material, so I don't know what should be done. ",
            "\u00a0One of the benefits of reading works within a tradition is that you can recognize the way in which the authors interact with one another. I can't imagine reading the Aeneid without first reading the Iliad or Odyssey nor reading Dante's Inferno without reading the Aeneid. The works are meant to be read together, and the experience is richer because of the connections. Although the reading may seem daunting, the reward is worth it. ",
            "\u00a0Fabulous syllabus, fabulous professors, small classes, and lots of resources and extra activities! I can't overstate how much I loved this class. "

            "\u00a0Yeah: it'll make you smarter. ",
            "\u00a0DS Literature is what you'd expect it to be. If you're interested in the classics of Western literature (i.e. from ancient Greece and up until the beginning of the Christian age), I would recommend you take this course. Be prepared, however, to spend time reading and writing, since the essays can be very time-consuming. If you're determined enough, you will see your writing improve over the course of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Yes--so long as you are genuinely interested in the books and you have the time and motivation to keep up with the readings and papers. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I have already told my close friends to take this course in the spring. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I was intellectually stimulated and challenged to push myself and my ideas about the texts we were reading. It was a hard class, but I was always having loads of fun. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I would recommend to any DSer that they do all they can to get into this section. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend this class to anyone interested in getting an in depth look at classic works of literature. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I have taken literature courses all my life but have never really appreciated it. This is the first course in which I've really learned to enjoy what I read, and that's as valuable if not more valuable than what I learned about Western thought in the process. ",
            "\u00a0Kathryn Slanski is incredible in every way. She adroitly guides every seminar, pushing students to make insightful comments (and expelling bullshit) while hitting key themes and providing deeply reflective observations of her own. I came to Yale to be in classes and seminars like that of Professor Slanski. She will push you to read more closely than you ever have before and will help your writing develop as well as any freshman english seminar could. She gives extensive feedback, edits every line of every paper, and meets in person to discuss papers after she gives them back. If you are placed into her class, do everything in your power to stay there; if you are not in her class, do everything in your power to get into it. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. I finally understood the purpose of DS and reading works within a tradition. Without reading the Iliad and Odyssey, I would never have understood the Aeneid and without reading the Aeneid, I would not have have understood Dante's Divine Comedy. I not only have a greater appreciation for the works but for Directed Studies as a whole. ",
            "\u00a0This class is amazing. Professor Slanski is the best teacher I've ever had, hands down. She constantly asks you to question your assumptions, and to recognize discomforts in the texts, which make your readings much more valuable, nuanced, and frankly fun! She is fabulous at leading section discussions, especially since the class sizes in DS are so small. I can't recommend this class enough-- it really changed my semester! "
