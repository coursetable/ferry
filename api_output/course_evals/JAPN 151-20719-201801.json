            "\u00a0yes! because the class is so small you really practice your speaking ",
            "\u00a0Taking L5 classes is worth the effort in keeping and refining your Japanese. All of the Japanese senseis are amazing instructors and great conversationalists. Sometimes the reading, kanji amount, and homework sheets can be excessive but the conversations you have in class are engaging and really fun! It's definitely a \"you get out what you put in class.\" A small classroom setting with more one-on-one help from the senseis in improving your Japnese is also a plus. "
