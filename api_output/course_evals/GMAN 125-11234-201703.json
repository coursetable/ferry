            "\u00a0I learned a lot in the class. I have a solid foundational understanding of the German language. Towards the end of the semester I was even starting to feel rather comfortable both speaking and writing in German. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this was a very fun and engaging course. The (almost) two hours every morning seemed to fly by. Seeing my classmates every day made us grow closer together, and we all learned a lot of German a lot faster than anyone thought we would. Our class even participated in a full blown German play this semester only having started learning the language in August! ",
            "\u00a0So many. I have learned some real German. I have a grasp particularly of German grammar. ",
            "\u00a0The course teaches fundamental German grammar structures and vocabulary, with some work in German culture. ",
            "\u00a0I entered the course with no knowledge of German. Throughout the course I developed a large vocabulary and a strong grammatical understanding that stands me in good stead for learning German in the future. "

        [
            "\u00a0This course moves really quickly and that can be overwhelming. Also, this course is not structured around taking notes. i wish we would take more notes so I would have this resource to look to when studying for tests or doing homework or simply reviewing. As of now the speed of the class means that I need to remember almost everything and there's not time for writing information down. I wish we could also vary the work a little more but I don't know how feasible that is given that we have so much material to get through. Although I like our textbook, textbook activities at 10 am become tiresome. \r\n\r\nThe main strength of this class is the you are totally immersed in German. Patrick does a really good job of truly only speaking German. It is amazing. Also, you will learn a ton and it is really rewarding to progress through a language so quickly. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this course was pretty well structured. We cover a lot of material throughout the course, but that is expected of an intensive beginner language course. Every course has room for improvement, but this one was overall pretty great. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course. I wish we did some more informal speaking in classthat would be helpful for me. The amount and variety of the homework seemed appropriate. The management of the class was very good, and we are usually able to stay on task for the full course of the class. ",
            "\u00a0The course, despite its two credits, did not feel like \"work;\" I viewed it more as an extracurricular I did for enjoyment. This is the way to learn German- there is an adequate amount of homework each night, and progress is efficient. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very well structured and organised.  The grading was fair and the teaching excellent, however the online assessments could have been better managed. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student who was interesting in learning German. This is a fast-paced, supportive, fun environment. As long as the student is willing to put in work and is comfortable with covering a lot of material very quickly, I would absolutely recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend Intensive German I to any student who wants to learn the language. With this course, you'll undoubtedly get a great start in learning German and it will be a significant part of your semester. It's a commitment, but it's worth it. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely- if you wish to learn German, take the intensive track. Patrick is a great instructor and the textbook is enjoyable. You'll form a community with your classmates in a way not conducive in a normal track. ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn a new language at Yale. "
