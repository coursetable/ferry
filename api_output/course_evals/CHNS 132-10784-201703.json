            "\u00a0Learned lots of characters, improved speaking, learned grammar patterns ",

            "\u00a0Lots of characters, speaking proficiency has gone up. Also have learned a bit about Chinese history and culture. Helpful vocabulary! ",
            "\u00a0I drastically improved my Chinese speaking abilities while learning to read and write about 400 Chinese characters for the first time! ",
            "\u00a0Developed Mandarin reading, writing, speaking skills. Improved pronounciation ",
            "\u00a0I greatly improved my Chinese reading, writing, listening, and speaking abilities. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: great organization, passionate faculty, reasonable tests and assignments\r\nWeaknesses: classes could get a bit dull at time with grammar drills; maybe use varied formats instead of just lecturing with students repeating the grammar patterns ",
            "\u00a0The small class size created a warm atmosphere where every student felt comfortable making mistakes. The acceleration of the pace of the class felt natural.\r\n\r\nI would have liked more time to review and discuss the feedback on tests. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The professors are absolutely wonderful. It's clear that they love teaching, love their students, and know what they're talking about. CHNS132 covers a lot of material at a good pace.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course feels a little repetitive at times, but I guess that's just the nature of the material/way you have to teach it. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the course, and have the highest praise for the two instructors and my classmates. I would love for the grading, however, to be done in a clearer manner. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the class was excellent, but the one thing I would say is that I wish we spent more time reading and writing in class rather than at home. We work a lot on speaking and grammar, but much of that is intuitive for speakers. However, I understand that everyones needs are different, and I think the teachers do an excellent job of addressing everyones strengths and weaknesses, as everyone comes in with drastically different levels of language skill and cultural knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0Lots of opportunities to practice speaking in class. \r\n\r\nLecture sometimes moves too fast to take effective notes on grammar.\r\nDidn't get to know other students much outside of class. ",
            "\u00a0This is a fantastic course that really improves your Chinese skills. I think it moved a little fast towards the end. I think the initial pace was very good. "

            "\u00a0Definitely! I think the class is well organized to help heritage speakers improve speaking, writing, and reading skills. ",
            "\u00a0I would; this course challenged me to be more conscious toward a language I had taken for granted. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Take it if you've grown up around the language, but don't know how to read or write. The teachers do a great job of building from the ground up. It might be extremely hard in the beginning, but it gets easier as the semester goes on. ",
            "\u00a0You should be prepared to work in the class, but the teachers are more than fair, and honestly, this is a fun class: come in with that attitude, and you will certainly enjoy it. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This class is fantastic for students who have a working speaking knowledge of Chinese, but want to further their written and reading skills. A lot of culture is taught in this class as well. The teachers are encouraging, and they allow students to learn in a low-pressure environment. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely would recommend if you are a heritage learner who wants to improve their Chinese but has a weak background in reading/writing/speaking. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to a student who is serious about improving their Chinese and already has some Chinese proficiency. "
