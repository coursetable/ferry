            "\u00a0The choice of materials is good, and is rigorous. It would be better if more examples, and sample solutions are provided. ",
            "\u00a0The course is outstanding. The lectures truly do a great job of balancing accessibility and rigor. The downside is that the expectation of doing the math on the assignments feels a little disconnected from the instruction (though the connections are clearly there for us to make). I think Prof. Lafferty should keep teaching it exactly as he does, but the course would benefit from a weekly section that focused on math and coding. ",

In this course, I generally left it until the last day or two, because when I worked on it early, I'd check PIazza and find out there were different corrections to the problems, or explanations of the best way to do it, or clarifications on what they asked for. So it felt like it was most efficient to wait until near the end fo do the assignment, because when it was first posted they were still figuring it out. ",

It's a little shocking to me that so many people are getting an introduction to this topic without being told how badly data science can be and is being misused. ",

            "\u00a0As stated about, this was easily my most fun course this semester.  The instructor did a fabulous job with making the material (both in class and on the assignments) relatable and engaging.\r\n\r\nMy only issue is that the doing of the PSets very strongly relied on one's mastery of RStudio.  While none of the actual concepts in the course were terribly difficult, it would take me hours to get the programming correct.  In effect, this was as much an \"RStudio\" class as a Machine Learning class.  \r\n\r\nNevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed it! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - Assignment based evaluation; Unique nature of assignments; Not returning solutions as they get passed on to next year; faculty's expertise and in-depth understanding; applied nature of the course (rather than theoretical)\r\nWeaknesses - None ",
