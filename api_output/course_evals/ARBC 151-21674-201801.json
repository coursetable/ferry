            "\u00a0I think primarily I became a more adept reader and critical analyzer of Arabic language materials, especially literary materials. Of course, we also worked on our speaking and writing skills, so there was definite improvement there. ",
            "\u00a0Improved critical analysis of Arabic literary texts and themes. Improved complex writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0The quality of teaching we received from Professor Elbousty was phenomenal. He knew his stuff extremely well and always came to class very prepared to deliver the material. What is amazing is that he loves to see our progress by tracking our journal entries. He goes well beyond what is required from a professor and always has his doors open for all students. The feedback we receive from him is always detailed and the constructive nature of them allows you to identify what you need to work more on! He worked tirelessly to ensure that we all understood the details and vocabulary associated with the pieces we read. He taught us the power of interpretation where certain pieces of literature could be analyzed in a plethora of ways. It is amazing how creative he is and we all really enjoyed the writing workshop he set up for us. By the end of it, we were able to roughly write our own poems! Professor Elbousty is with no doubt the best languages Professor at Yale and he is someone who makes you look forward to every single class. He also knows the art of teaching languages really well and follows a unique philosophy which is based on reading and writing, as opposed to focusing on the intricate and tedious grammatical structures. ",
            "\u00a0My overall Arabic fluency has dramatically increased, with Professor Elbousty focusing equally on reading, writing, and speaking. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my Arabic reading skills. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Too much reading, not enough speaking. More speaking practice would have made this class more valuable. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strength of the course is engaging not just with the language but the cultures of writers from various Arab countries, men and women. We were encouraged to put the readings in their sociopolitical contexts and used different lenses, from Marxism to feminism, to analyze them. I maintain that the only weakness in the course is one that is shared among all language courses--what you put into them is what you get out. The more seriously you take the texts (e.g., researching words you don't know), participate in class discussions, and write in your journal, the more fruits your efforts will bear. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Bousty remains to be the best Arabic teacher I have ever had even after having lived in several Arab countries. Every single class this semester was delivered with his full passion and even when he is having a bad day, you cannot see it!! Professor Elbousty's main aim always is to ensure that we fully understood the material before moving on. Unlike other classes where teachers try to cram as much content into the semester, Professor Elbousty's flexible teaching manner sets him apart from all the other instructors I have had at Yale. Moreover, what makes him stand is that he is a well-regarded intellectual in the field and is known for his research. He should continue delivering literature classes since that is what he does best. Throughout the year, he always made references to Bakhtin and other literary figures to place the material we learn in context. He is a moving encyclopedia of Arabic Literature and is one of the most favorite professors amongst students! ",
            "\u00a0This course was one of my favorite courses Ive taken at Yale, and I would not hesitate to take another class with Professor Elbousty. I have no recommendations for improvement as the class is perfect as it is. ",
            "\u00a0I hated the material, but I enjoyed the Professor. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0If you want to learn Arabic and, perhaps more important, about the rich cultures it calls home, then you absolutely should take this course. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! Great way to improve Arabic language skills and explore important social themes. ",
            "\u00a0This course is different from any other course since it puts all your skills into practice and that is how you learn best. We all improved dramatically throughout the semester because you are always practicing the language in a natural manner, where the priority is reading and writing as opposed to learning unnecessary grammatical rules. In addition, Professor Elbousty teaches the content in an extremely engaging manner and you get so much out of every class. The feedback you receive throughout this course is very clear and constructive. It was my favorite class this semester since you read a variety of literature from across the whole Arab World. The amazing part is also that Professor Elbousty has met nearly all of these literary figures and has direct access to them if needed. The emphasis is not on examination, which is great and gives you the chance to improve your language skills in a stress-free environment! ",
            "\u00a0I feel that this course is absolutely necessary for any student of Arabic in order to refine their fluency and and learn more about Arabic authors and literature. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to other students because the Professor was extremely warm and kind. "
