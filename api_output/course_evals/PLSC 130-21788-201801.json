            "\u00a0I really didn't learn much at all. The class teaches mostly self-evident theories that are not intellectually engaging or stimulating. I \"learned\" how to write a policy memo, but honestly their guidelines just made my writing worse, more repetitive and clunky. ",

            "\u00a0The lectures could be less monotonous and not just cover the exact same things as the books, because then it's all repetitive. ",
            "\u00a0LOTS of readings, but they were all high quality at least - was just a massive amount of my time and something to be aware of going in.\r\nWish I had gotten better feedback on my response memos. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: their is some class discussion despite the lecture size, which was really nice. Debs also encourages all viewpoints, which is admirable. Weakness: where to begin? The readings are bland, long, and summarized in the slides. In lecture, Professor Debs reads directly from the slides, so there is no point in attending class, except for participation, which is 10% of the grade. Debs also is the worst lecturer I have had at Yale, by far. He is a really nice guy, but talks in monotone, just reads from the slides, and goes extremely slowly. Even the TA's were on the email, ESPN, reading the paper, and on their phones the whole class. The TA's also provided good comments on my writing, but were terrible at offering advice beforehand. For a reading response due in 2 days, I met with a TA who told me he'd email me some ideas, except he hadn't done the reading yet! Predictably, he never sent me those ideas. ",
            "\u00a0The lecture could be more interactive and less monotonous. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of the material was interesting and topical, but most of it could be gleaned by doing the readings (or even just a small portion of them). This is a shame because the professor and the TF's are clearly extremely knowledgeable and engaged in the subject and can add great value. Also the grading system of the course is completely illogical. Some coursework (the debate statement in particular) required 5x as much work as other graded work and had the same weighting. ",
            "\u00a0The class is very labor-intensive, but well-structured, and with excellent instruction. It's tough but fair. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: you learn a LOT, become familiar with the relevant authors, literature, actors, policy debates, and history concerning nuclear weapons. Prof. Debs is very clear in his lectures, which are pretty interesting, and is also great to talk to in OH (I recommend going, you can talk about extensions/further applications of course material, or other security-related things in general). At the end of each lecture there is about 15-20 minute discussion, wherein Debs has some guiding questions and then asks for thoughts from the class (participation is 10%). There is also a UNSC crisis simulation and two debates. Overall great class, only weakness is some weeks had a bit too much reading, but this only becomes a problem if 1) you actually do readings or 2) you fall behind ",
            "\u00a0Liked the Q and A. Sometimes I felt we were just summarizing readingson class though. ",
            "\u00a0One of the weaknesses of the course was the time of day that it was taught--I had trouble staying awake.  However, this is of course not the fault of the course but just a product of scheduling.  Another thing that I found a little bit difficult was how all of the assignments were staggered.  It was more difficult to plan my semester at the outset since everyone turned in assignments at a different time.  One of the other difficult things was the grading of the writing assignments.  It took me a while to understand what exactly was being asked of us during the assignments.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed the readings, and I found professor Debs very knowledgeable. I also enjoyed the fact that though it was a lecture, we were asked to participate and discuss what we thought. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the class discussion, as well as the simulations we did. ",
            "\u00a0Very interesting and I liked the simulations. Videos throughout the lecture especially kept me engaged. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths\r\n- very responsive and helpful TA's and professor that care about their individual students despite it being a lecture\r\n- organized in uploading materials electronically and creating a schedule for the course\r\n- ample readings\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n- repetitive class content\r\n- teaching style was mundane ",
            "\u00a0The course covers very interesting material, the TAs are great, the lectures aren't always the most captivating but Prof. Debs is great if you get to talk to him. ",
            "\u00a0This class was excellent. I think it is sufficiently comprehensive and focused on the parts of the nuclear question that I believe to be most important. I believe that one way it can be improved is by focusing more on \"fringe\" opinions regarding nuclear weapons. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Lectures were informative, well structured, and concise.\r\nWeaknesses: Discussion questions were sometimes difficult to follow\r\nSuggestions: Send students a list of specific questions to think about while doing readings. "

            "\u00a0DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. The readings are boring, classes are even duller, and there is lots of work. This class has singlehandedly made me not want to be a political science major. I entered this class quite interested in the material, but the tedious and uninteresting lectures have totally turned me off from this subject. Debs also is the worst lecturer I have had at Yale, by far. He is a genuinely nice guy, but talks in monotone, just reads from the slides, and goes extremely slowly. Even the TA's were on the email, ESPN, reading the paper, and on their phones the whole class. They were also totally unhelpful when I met with them, offering to email me some essay ideas and then never actually following through. What a boring waste of time and effort, especially for a subject that I thought would be so interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. It can help inform students on a very important topic on which internal politics, diplomacy and international relations hinge. ",
            "\u00a0Probably not. I would recommend other students read the professor's book, but i'm not sure what value taking the course adds relative to other IR courses. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It's very demanding but you learn a lot. Strong interest probably required. Not a casual class. ",
            "\u00a0Yea. Debs is great. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student.  I found it to be very enlightening and helpful in understanding key issues surrounding diplomacy and nuclear weapons.  Professor Debs really knows his stuff, and he facilitates a good discussion.  This was a good class. ",

            "\u00a0Yes if they are interested in nuclear politics. ",
            "\u00a0If you are at all interested in international relations, this is a must-take class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Nuclear weapons have revolutionised international politics for a long time. It is important to understand the complexities of the most dangerous weapons known to man. "
