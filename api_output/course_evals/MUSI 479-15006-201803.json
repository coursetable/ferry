            "\u00a0I gained a broad understanding of some canons of feminist theory, and learned how to apply these theories in discussions about popular culture! ",
            "\u00a0The knowledge that I gained from this course is not quantifiable. It was an extremely comprehensive survey of both the history of feminism (over the past ~50 years) and the critical analysis of pop music, which is often ignored in favor of The Canon. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about feminist pop music movements I hadn't heard of before. "

        [
            "\u00a0The class, I believe, worked very well, especially considering that it was in its first larval instar this term. Discussions were riveting, students were engaged, and a variety of pedagogical methods were employed. ",
            "\u00a0The class allowed us discuss what we felt most compelled to discuss; she didn't ask us any cookie cutter questions that have specific answers. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strength of this course was its framing. In being framed as a survey of different popular musics and the feminist politics held therein, this course was able to engage with a great range of experiences of different women of different backgrounds. In turn, it succeeded in allowing and encouraging students to critically engage with a range of ideas of feminism as well as the lives and experiences of women, generally. Moreover, the critical texts used to engage with the music were incredibly broad and gave a range of insights to thinking through feminism as a concept. \r\n\r\nThe major weakness of the course was the inclusion of certain weeks of topics which yielded few particularly productive insights in the class discussions, where time could have been allotted to discuss topics across multiple weeks. "

            "\u00a0Yes! This class involved challenging readings and really fruitful discussions that informed how I look at pop culture. I looked forward to this course every week, even though it meant having a five-minute lunch on Wednesdays. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course. Not only is it one of those rare music courses that doesn't buttress The Canon, but it's also invaluable for its introduction to a variety of feminist movements that were deeply entrenched in the music of their time. These are two topics that weave together wonderfully to leave you with a lasting critical view of the media you consume. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course; it's interesting and relevant to how we analyze current pop culture phenomena. The workload's not that bad, and you're given a lot of flexibility when it comes to topics for the papers. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to other students as its survey structure allows a very strong introduction to feminist theory. "
