            "\u00a0I learned that reading literature is not solely about the text itself but also should take into account the various contexts of the works and should engage with some of the other, relevant forms of art from the period. ",
            "\u00a0Lots of info about various realms of art and literature, interdisciplinary look at works. ",
            "\u00a0This was the best class ",
            "\u00a0This course equips students with a new way to understand modernism, and how domesticity, and women, the home, and craftwork fit in with or challenged mainstream modernism. In essence, it gives a more nuanced and complete understanding of Modernism, while providing the crucial space to examine one's own views of childhood, home, and gender. ",
            "\u00a0I was exposed to a wide range of texts which really broadened my horizons (we watched Russian silent films, British Post Office propaganda, read children's books, and an excerpt from Kotik Letaev (that book is crazy)) and led to talk seriously and deeply about the larger meaning of the physical aspects (furniture, home decor) as well as the more intangible aspects (familial relationships, conceptions of childhood) that make up the home. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I thought the class took a great approach to a topic that is found in most modernist works but is rarely discussed or emphasized. I think at times the syllabus seemed a little unstructured, but for the most part I walked away feeling that I had been exposed to a mix of widely-acclaimed works and lesser known works, all of which contributed to my understanding of the concepts of domesticity. ",
            "\u00a0It was highly enjoyable and enlightening to be exposed to the concepts in the class from so many different angles. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of reading, but really wonderful discussions and not much work outside of the reading. ",
            "\u00a0This course was fantastic.  It had a reasonable reading load with very interesting and varied readings, a very engaged and enthusiastic professor, and the magic of a great group of students.  As improvement, I might only suggest that more context be offered prior to units in which such historical information might be really necessary (for example, I know next to nothing about the Russian Revolution, and this seemed important to know more about in order to fully appreciate the readings surrounding it). ",
            "\u00a0The strength lies with Prof. Trumpener's expansive knowledge and her ability to foster student learning during seminar discussion. The texts are also quite diverse, and the themes from each one are nicely reflected or elaborated upon by the student presentations on any subject of their choice. It was nice that this course also included a trip to the museum and various movies -- in a way, the class was like a little feast of modernist and domestic delight.\r\n\r\nThe weakness is that there is not enough time given to discuss each text as much as one would want, focusing on a theme or two from each text, as opposed to close reading. Finally, some student presentations could take up a lot of time, leaving little time for text discussion. ",
            "\u00a0I wish this course met more than once a week. The texts were amazing and very often sparked some good conversation, but it felt hard to remain engaged with the topic over the period of a week and it often felt we had too many texts to discuss in one day which sometimes led to frustration or too much reading for one day so breaking it up would help a lot. ",
            "\u00a0The course pays close attention to an often ignored aspect of art, life, and history in a really valuable way. Classes were best when we were given the opportunity to really delve into a single book or text and examine the domestic spaces of it. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend taking this class. The syllabus has some really great books and plays that everyone should read. There are also some relatively obscure works that turned out to be surprisingly enjoyable. Katie Trumpener is a great discussion leader and makes it easy to participate, and she's extremely smart and kind. I would be wary about taking this class only if you already have a busy course load. This was my fifth class, which meant that I sometimes found myself pushing off the reading until the last minute, and that was easy to do since it met only once a week. It's not that this class is particularly difficult or work-heavy, but these books deserve to be read well, and if you don't have time to do it, you won't get that much out of the class. But that probably goes without saying. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to any student who would like to expand their understanding of modernism and domesticity to not only literature but also to films, architecture, and works of art that grapple with these same themes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Trumpener is lovely and empowers her students, and this class is a beautiful and uncommon mix of disciples that come together to give a fuller picture of the ways in which modernism and domesticity are explored and expressed. ",
            "\u00a0you have to! ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this class, even as a stem major among english and lit majors. It stretched me but never felt unapproachable. The syllabus was broad and interesting and I enjoyed doing the reading every week. Class discussions were elucidating. Overall, an interesting class that Im glad I took. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student.  I loved it and its material was such a departure from everything else that I'd studied that it was really refreshing and fascinating.  I've never found myself a big fan of modernism, but I certainly have a much greater appreciation now for what it was working to achieve and the concerns with which it contended.  I really enjoyed how the course contained such a variety of texts and the way in which student presentations wove additional mediums into the conversation--theater, art, design, etc. I think the class would benefit from going to the YUAG as a group, rather than sending students there independently--I found myself wanting to stand in front of the modernist objects Professor Trumpener asked us to consider with the rest of the class because they were so rich and interesting.  I looked forward to this class and its readings every week, and I really recommend it--for both women AND men (our class, perhaps unsurprisingly, given the relationship of women to the domestic, was all female, but I imagine it would have been very interesting to have male perspectives in the room as well).  Guys--this material is so rich, and important, and we really need your voices in this conversation, too.  Don't let the word \"domesticity\" scare you away from some really meaningful discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course provides a unique lens through which to examine modernism. The texts are quite enjoyable, and while a few are well-known, several seem quite obscure and very much challenge and broaden your horizons. The course also does a great job of looking at a mainstream literary tradition through the eyes of underrepresented women and other cultures not typically represented. Beyond that, Prof. Trumpener is so knowledgeable and very much cares about her students, that it is a real treat to take her class. After taking this, one cannot stop but think about gender, childhood, and homes in a new light. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to someone who loves literature and is interested in discussing issues of the home. The name of the course seems slightly confusing/boring but do not be fooled! The reading list is great and so is Professor Trumpener, it was a really interesting course and a great time. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this course if you can. Fascinating subject matter and Prof. Trumpener is truly a delight, extremely knowledgeable and one of the few professors at Yale who will always value your contributions to discussion. "
