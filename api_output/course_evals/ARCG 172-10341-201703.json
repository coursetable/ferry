            "\u00a0This introduction course provided me with a basic understanding of the field of archaeology. I learned what archaeology really is, how it is used, and the importance of the field. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the basic tenants of archaeology as a science, how to correctly implement these, and how pseuodarchaeologists manipulate these ideas. I also learned how to analyze scientific research and data. We applied these ideas by looking at numerous examples of archaeological hoaxes. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the history of archaeology, the types of science involved in archaeology, research design, and the various tools, processes, and techniques that different archaeologists use. I also learned how to distinguish between archaeological hoaxes/pseudoarchaeology and legitimate archaeology. ",
            "\u00a0This is both an excellent introduction to the field of archaeology (and just how cool real science is) and an exercise in critical thinking and challenging man-made fictions. Not just about science, this course challenges you to think broadly about the cultural, political, and psychological nature of truth and fantasy in archaeology. ",
            "\u00a0How archeology is so important to our interpretation of history and the implicit biases we see in archeology and history telling ",
            "\u00a0I learned about what makes good archaeological research, and what factors enable fraudulent archaeology to succeed. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the scientific foundation of archaeology and specific investigative techniques. ",
            "\u00a0I developed the skills to use archaeological methods to discern myth from fact when analyzing remains from the past. ",
            "\u00a0Learned how to distinguish between a hoax and facts in the context of archaeology but these skills can be applied in all areas of life. Gained understanding of the methodology of archaeology. Gained hands on exposure to archaeological technology too. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to absorb more information just by listening and taking less notes. I now understand you do not have to take a lot of notes to be successful in a class. "

        [
            "\u00a0It was very hard to study for the mid-term with the slides given because of the lack of detail on the slides. I wish I had taken more detailed notes. ",
            "\u00a0It was a very good class and i enjoyed it a lot. Maybe a bit more information in lecture slides would be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that Professor Honeychurch might be one of the most excitable, enthusiastic professors on this campus, which is awesome. The other major strength is the packaging of the course. By making it about Hoaxes and Myths, a simple introductory archaeology course now has an incredible branding on top of it, making it even more engaging. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very interesting. The teaching was top notch, the textbooks were good (although the Feder was far more interesting), and the topics were very cool. Overall, the class was an appropriate amount of work, the labs were engaging, and the teaching was superb. ",
            "\u00a0This course was really interesting/exciting all the way through. Lectures were entertaining and there were a lot of interesting and diverse labs. I learned a lot of new information throughout the semester.\r\n\r\nI think this class could be improved by weaving the lectures and readings tighter. A good chunk of the info needed for the exams came from the readings, but I don't feel like we discussed them that much in class (e.g. stuff about the Garbage Project, the Good Mound, bone shape, etc.). ",
            "\u00a0Honeychurch is so fun and makes you want to learn about archeology. The case studies are really interesting for the most part and almost anyone will enjoy the class if you go to class - the lecture is the best part ",
            "\u00a0Great lectures and labs! The assessments didn't feel quite targeted at information we had learned-- some questions on the midterm were very detail oriented, and the take home final being 3 essays (after we also had a final essay) felt excessive. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Honeychurch is very charismatic and a great lecturer. The course could benefit from a more solid organization. The fifteen pages of writing requirement for the final was too much. ",
            "\u00a0I liked that this course presented the material through hoax case studies. That made it really interesting! A weakness of the course was that there was sometimes a mismatch between the assigned reading and what was presented in lecture. We would read about something and Prof Honeychurch would present on something different that we couldnt neccesssrily read about outside of lecture.\r\n\r\nThe course was offered at a terrible time slot and 8-10 pages is not a short paper. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very engaging with very interesting readings. I find no weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0I loved everything about this class. While, at times, the readings could be tedious, I always found some level of interest in each. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent lectures! It was so engaging and I came away from this semester with such a greater knowledge and understating of archeology after entering as a novice. It was very end-loaded as far as work was considered. "

            "\u00a0Yes. It was a great intro to archaeology, delivered in a fun and entertaining way! ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely! Prof. Honeychurch is the most engaging lecturer ive ever had. His class is never boring. ",
            "\u00a0If you have any affinity for cool stuff like archaeology go for it, especially if you like shows like Ancient Aliens or documentaries about Atlantis. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This course was extremely fun and interesting without being too overwhelming. ",
            "\u00a0I would 100% recommend this course. The work load is reasonable and the topics are fascinating. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a lot of fun. Professor Honeychurch is an amazing and enthusiastic lecturer and the content of the class itself can be amusing as well as insightful. You learn about different hoaxes throughout the semester, but the real focus of the class is on how legitimate archaeology is done (e.g. research design, carbon dating, etc.). As part of this, the class has semi-optional labs involving everything from mapping an archaeological site to making stone tools. The content itself is not difficult to learn and you can cruise through a lot of the semester pretty easily, but be aware that the work for this class can be pretty significant at certain times (e.g. 2 8-10 page essays, a lot of content to study for the midterm, potentially long final). I would totally recommend this course to anyone who might be interested. ",
            "\u00a0YES TAKE THIS CLASS I COULD NOT LOVE IT MORE ",
            "\u00a0Take this course! It's a great introduction to archaeology, regardless of whether you're interested in archaeology as a major or are just looking for an interesting 5th class. Professor Honeychurch is incredibly engaging and the labs and reading are interesting. There are two short papers, but other than that the workload is pretty low. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Take this it is so fun and you will appreciate archeology and its techniques. The labs are also super cool but easy - they only boost your grade and you get to learn about the coolest things (cuneiform deciphering, bone archeology, etc.) ",
            "\u00a0This class is a lot of fun, and you learn some cool stuff. Honeychurch is an engaging lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0I really really enjoyed coming to this class and listening to Honeychurch lecture. All of the cases we discussed in class were really interesting and when you participate in discussion the class is very fun. Not to big of a workload and if you show up and do the work you can probably get an A.  You will have to do some writing for the class -2 page papers and a long final (but it was take-home!) but overall it was worth it and not too terrible. ",
            "\u00a0This was a great intro arch classfor anthro majors who need to complete their intro survey courses. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Professor Honeychurch is so engaging and enthusiastic about what he teaches. The content is interesting. The labs are fantastic. Take this course! You won't regret it. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this class to others because, even though there was quite a lot of writing involved, I found the material so interesting and the professor so engaging that it did not matter as much to me. "
