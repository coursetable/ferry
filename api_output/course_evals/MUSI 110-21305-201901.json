            "\u00a0I went into this class barely knowing how to read music (at a very, very base level), and now I can compose music in four parts and identify triads, seventh chords, intervals, and other harmonic and structural elements. I find myself analyzing in my head the music that I listen to now. ",
            "\u00a0I normally don't write anything for evaluations, but I feel like this class really warranted it. This was the first course I have taken, albeit on a subject I was already interested in, where I have consistently looked forward to doing almost every assignment and to learning more! I plan on keeping the knowledge I got from this course over analyzing complex tonal and harmonic patterns and styles for the rest of my life and applying it to my guitar playing. I have already noticed that my interest in playing original stuff on guitar has shot up for the first time in a LONG time. This class was exactly what I needed, and I could not have asked for a more kind, engaging, and helpful professor than Pippa! ",
            "\u00a0Composition! ",
            "\u00a0You learn the basics of music theory: key signatures, pitches, intervals, scales, chords, periods, cadences, etc. As you do this, you develop your ability to sing and play the piano, which is hard but rewarding. It certainly deepened my love of music. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Mostly all strengths! If Pippa Ovenden is teaching it, try to take it with her. The only weakness is that sometimes the homework can get VERY repetitive and cause some slight eye strain, especially in the earlier part of the semester. It begins to calm down after the halfway point in the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I honestly think the work structure of the course was perfect in that it touched on everything, made us apply our knowledge, and didn't make any one thing too stressful - the way classes should be. It facilitated my active interest and engagement with assignments. Too many professors in other subjects really don't realize how the anxiety of a single test worth 35%-50% of one's grade really takes any genuine interest and desire to learn out of the equation. ",
            "\u00a0Some music theory knowledge was superfluous ",
            "\u00a0I think it is exactly what it needs to be. Maybe one exercise where you get to analyze popular music that you like would be fun. "

            "\u00a0Take this course, no matter if you've never read music in your life. You'll leave having so much new knowledge of music theory. And learning the material is a lot of fun! It's one of the few classes at Yale I always looked forward to going to. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. See my response for #1. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! ",
            "\u00a0Yes if you haven't taken music theory before. "
