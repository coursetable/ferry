            "\u00a0Very informative on epidemiological methods. Problem sets are very useful in applying concepts learned in class. Really liked how discussion sessions were set up to review information learned that week and go over practice problems that are similar to homework problems ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the class. I think it connected with epidemiology 1 very well, which gave us a good transition and foundation of the deeper concepts. However, I don't really see the point of discussion session since it was repeating the class materials and the TF sometimes were not able to give good answers to questions we had. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I learned A TON in this class. Way more than in Epi I and I really feel like I have a good foundation of Epi. The teacher and TA's prepare you well and it's easy to do well in the class if you're willing to put in the work. \r\nLimitations: Work load is a lot, but it's a graduate level class so that is expected. ",
            "\u00a0This course did an excellent job at reviewing content in Epi I while adding to it and providing more context. However, much of the material covered in this course was already covered in Epi I. The material could have been expanded upon more and covered more advanced epi topics. ",
            "\u00a0Epi is not my cup of tea, and the lecture format of the course was often dry, but the discussion sections were very helpful and the assignments and exams were always fair. Overall it was a great course and I learned a lot. ",
            "\u00a0It wasn't my favorite course. Honestly, I stopped going to class maybe a month into the semester because I could teach myself the material at home and get the same results on tests and quizes. \r\n\r\nAgain, I wish the lectures weren't just read to us off a powerpoint. There must be a stronger way of conveying material. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course was overall very good. I felt that the beginning was a bit too much of a review from last semester because everyone who is in EPI 2 had to have taken EPI 1 so there wasn't really a need for review. I would have liked to have dived more into the depths of the new material earlier on in the course. I also have heard from previous students that their EPI2 course focused much more on reading and interpreting papers. While I thought the problem sets we had were great review of the material, I would have also liked some practical application as well (I know we had one assignment where we read a paper and interpreted but others would have been good practice too). I also liked that the problem sets were graded....they were good practice and they took a little pressure off of the exams. ",
            "\u00a0Great. A lot of work but very useful to learn basic epidemiological techniques. \r\n\r\nStrengths: students gain a thorough working knowledge of study design, analytical methods and applicability. \r\n\r\nWeakness: 1) Homeworks have too strict grading scheme and do not allow for much flexibility. Students spend too much time trying to get the correct answer rather than understanding the material fully. This class is so important especially to PHD students taking qualifying exams. \r\n\r\n2) The lectures should be recorded and available to students out of class because students use them to review and study for class exams as well as qualifying exams.\r\n3) Discussion sessions should also be recorded or perhaps conducted as an online course via Zoom, allowing students the flexibility to participate when out of town. Specially because PhD students are constantly attending conferences or conducting field work and having flexibility on Fridays allows for multi-tasking while still fulfilling course requirements. ",
            "\u00a0Didn't gain much from the lectures. Slides were confusing and often it was hard to follow along. Homework assignments were difficult but great preparation for the exams. Discussion sections were extremely helpful. ",
            "\u00a0This course is definitely one of the more challenging ones I've taken. However, as much as I struggled, it was clear that the course was extremely well organized, thorough, and helpful. The lectures were well and clearly organized, the readings posted well in advance, and the objectives and expectations made clear. I think that grading the homework was a good decision and definitely meant I put much more thought and work into it than I did in Epi 1. The workload was heavy, with several exams, but the material is complex and quantitative so I think that was probably important. ",
            "\u00a0strength: very clear instruction ",
            "\u00a0the strengths of the course is how structured the lectures were delivered and the content was clear. the homework were also helpful in solidifying the concepts taught from the course. ",
            "\u00a0Could have focused on more of a nuanced understanding - it was a little redundant with Epi I, course instructors should confer to prevent overlap. ",
            "\u00a0The material was typical epi work. I appreciated that the homework assignments were actually graded and were weighted heavier (compared to Epi I last semester). Since they were graded I spent much more time on them and I feel like I learned so much more because of that. I liked the TA sections every Friday because they actually pertained to the homework and included examples that really helped me understand the material. ",
            "\u00a0Epi really doesn't come naturally to me, which might skew my perception. Professor Ma was nice and a good lecturer, but the weekly problem sets were tough for me and I didn't find the lectures to be very clear. ",
            "\u00a0This should not be a required course for SBS concentration. ",
            "\u00a0The course is difficult, but if you put the necessary work in outside of class and pay attention in lecture, it is completely manageable.  I came away from the course with a much deeper understanding of epidemiology concepts than I got during the first semester. ",
            "\u00a0Some dull material but overall not bad. Usually presented in a good way and included real world examples, which was helpful. Problem sets were long and took a substantial amount of time but were really helpful in prepping for exams. Exams are extremely fair and straightforward, so if you know your stuff you'll do well, which is how it should be. ",
            "\u00a0Given the subject matter, I thought this was a great class.  It expanded upon concepts introduced in Epi I and delved more into the theories and assumptions behind epidemiological principles.  Can't think of any way to improve upon what is already an excellent class. ",
            "\u00a0After having taken Epi 1 with Harvey, I thought that there was no way epidemiology could possibly have been taught in a worse way.  I, however, was proven wrong.  The lectures were worthless because the slides never had clear information and I can't think of a single time a relevant, clear example was used.  Going to class and reading the slides honestly only confused me more.  If I thought I understood a concept, I was confused about it by the end of going over the slides.  After two semesters of epidemiology, I cannot claim to honestly know anything about epidemiology.  This class was incredibly disappointing. ",
            "\u00a0I thoroughly enjoyed this class despite it being one of the more challenging that I have taken. The course material was presented well - clearly and always within the context of how the concepts could be applied to real research. Both lectures and sections provided great opportunities for learning. Homework assignments clearly related to lectures while providing opportunities to further explore topics. All of the exams were very fair and reflective of what we had learned. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures aren't as streamlined as the discussion sections. I felt like I'm learning more in a discussion section I'm half the time, but that might very well be how it was intended to be in the first place. ",
            "\u00a0It wasn't a bad course, just seemed like epi 1, just more complicated and more work. Weaknesses were definitely the lectures. They weren't engaging and the slides weren't even close to being easy to understand. I really feel this needs to change. And its not just epi. This place needs better TEACHERS. People that actually teach, not just read slides. I feel like I am getting ripped off because I am going into thousands of dollars of debt to get a subpar education. Please fix this going forward. ",
            "\u00a0My one complaint is how CDE focused the course is.  I do understand that the course is in the CDE department, but it is the only Epi II option.  Many EMD students also take the course; both CDE and EMD make up the school's epidemiology programs.  I find it very disappointing that there is not either an EMD Epi II course or more balance between CDE and EMD in the course.  The majority of the examples were chronic disease related, which does not align with the interests of all students.  It led to me finding the class to be less interesting and feel less useful as I could only see these methods applying to chronic diseases.  There was also focus on long term epi research methods and no acute epi methods, such as what would be utilized in an outbreak setting.  It is true that Epi II is optional for EMD students, but in reality, many of us want to pursue epi carers that require additional coursework in epidemiology that we cannot get from strictly taking EMD electives that are not strictly epidemiology foundations focused.  I think the class would benefit from more microbial disease examples and methods to appeal to more students.  \r\n\r\nDr. Ma has asked for opinions on graded homework.  I did not mind graded homework, as it did lead me to put more time into it.  However, instead of a grade out of 100%, perhaps H, HP, P, or F grades could be followed.  This would still encourage students to work hard to earn H grades on homework and thus gain an understanding of the material, but it would take away the stress of a few numeric points.  I believe that, while completing homework, students are still learning.  If a student clearly worked hard on the assignment and did well on the majority of the assignment, an H grade is deserved.  Students do stress about the difference between number grades, and loosing a handful of points while still learning can be discouraging.  I believe moving to an H HP P F grading system rather than numeric would be helpful.  Also, it would be helpful to receive an answer key to assignments.  There would be times where I would be studying for an exam, see that I lost a few points on a homework assignment, but not really understand why.  It would be very helpful to see suggested answers.\r\n\r\nOverall this class was tough, but Dr. Ma made it very fair.  Exams were a consistent with what student's should have expected for the most part, and the homework, discussion session practice problems, and lecture notes did adequately prepare students. ",
            "\u00a0I LEARNED SO MUCH \r\n\r\nTHIS COURSE TAUGHT ME HOW TO BE A GOOD EPIDEMIOLOGIST WITH INTEGRITY AND GRIT \r\n\r\nTHE MATERIAL IS LIKE EPI I BUT NUANCED AND ACTUALLY USEFUL AND MEANINGFUL ",
            "\u00a0Epi II with Professor Ma was a wonderful experience! She teaches well and truly cares about her students. Although the problem sets were graded (unlike Epi I), they were all extremely fair and the weekly discussion sections prepared students very well. The exams were similar to the homework assignments so there were no nasty surprises. Overall, I learned a lot and feel more confident conducting my own epidemiology research in the future. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n- applied basic information from Epidemiology I to take it a step further\r\n- Used real world examples\r\n- Challenging\r\n- Professor Ma is amazing!!\r\n- TF's are extremely helpful\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- some discrepancies between the TF's communication to students ",

            "\u00a0Really liked the course. It's a lot of work but worth it. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - weekly, graded homework assignments; compassionate and articulate professor who focuses on main concepts. Weaknesses - PowerPoint lecture slide organization - sometimes difficult to follow and make sense of, especially when reviewing for homework and exams. ",
            "\u00a0More detailed explanations of epidemiological study design. Very practical. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped to solidify important epidemiological concepts and reinforced concepts taught in other classes. That said, I often felt like I had to work extra-hard to actually figure out which concepts we were supposed to be learning. Often, it felt that instructor and the TFs avoided giving us information in favor of having us figure things out on our own. This could have been effective, except that we also rarely got sufficient feedback on assignments, leaving me in the dark frequently about why I was marked incorrectly on problems and never really learning the material as well as I could have if instruction had focused more on student learning than preventing plagiarism.\r\n\r\nWhile I think the class was well-structured overall, I do think there were some lectures that felt like unnecessary additions (e.g., health systems research) as well as some that felt like advertisements of other courses (e.g., qualitative methods, meta-analysis). I might have appreciated these more if I hadn't felt like some of the other lectures had been rushed and some concepts not explained as fully as they should have been. ",
            "\u00a0The lecture slides weren't always intuitive, but discussion sections were most critical for learning the material. Maybe it's because it was the 2nd or 3rd time I was engaging with the material, but I definitely felt supported curriculum-wise throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0The course has provided much useful knowledge for students to understand the principles of Epidemiology, the discussion section and the homework all help you to better understand the knowledge from the class. ",
            "\u00a0I think the principles were there, but it would have been more helpful to teach the materials through more relevant examples that are more applicable/interesting/engaging for the students. Not every student is a interested in going into epi research, and it would be helpful and much appreciated if some of the lessons incorporated health policy/social behavioral sciences/environmental health- this would create more engaging lectures but also illustrate how epi is broadly applicable to many public health fields. ",
            "\u00a0I loved discussion. It was a great way to synthesize the information in lecture. ",
            "\u00a0A strength was the clarity of the oral presentation of material. The homeworks were somewhat helpful in learning as well.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses include redundancy with Epi I, undetailed and sometimes unclear slides , and monotonous tone overall that triggered complete disinterest in the material for me. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent. One of the best classes I have taken so far at the school of public health. ",
            "\u00a0strengths are the instructor- she was wonderful. I think the textbook may be a weakness just because we didn't use it frequently and sometimes things were explained differently in the book than in class, and Dr. Ma would tell us to ignore the book explanation. There is really no need to invest in the textbook- you can learn everything through lectures or online. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n-Homework really shows the applicability of topics from lecture\r\n-Wide range of epi topics covered\r\nWeakness:\r\n-While it draws on Epi I, there were some disagreements in opinion between the two semesters ",

            "\u00a0lots of content but clarified in regards to Epi I ",
            "\u00a0I have really good feedback to give for this course, because the professor and TF's were super great and knowledgeable. They truly cared about students. A strength of this course is compared to Epi I, students knew what to expect on tests. Tests were fair. Also, problems sets were after discussion sections and were graded which made students learn better. A weakness of this course is just that the material is dry to begin with and some classes were pretty dry. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Dr. Ma!!! Also, the supplemental instruction from the TFs was phenomenal. I loved that the homework assignments were individually graded instead of graded for participation. Also the course never reinforced racial or other sociodemographic stereotypes. Examples in class were appropriate and sensitive. ",

            "\u00a0The instructor was very clear and helpful, however I would have loved some more practical application of what we learned in class beyond problem sets. Reading articles to identify some of the principles or designing our own studies would have been helpful ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot and even though the problem sets took time they were extremely helpful for learning the material ",
            "\u00a0Overall, this class was very challenging for me as I felt very shaky of my knowledge of epidemiology after last semester. However, I learned a great deal of information and really was able to understand it this semester. The strengths of the course lie in the breadth of topics covered and in Dr. Ma's teaching style, which I very much enjoyed. A weakness in my experience was the Friday discussion sections. I did not learn much from my TF and spent much time at office hours with other TFs getting my head around the material. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very similar to Fall 2017 Epi I, which was both helpful and redundant. Epi I was particularly confusing with it being Professor Harvey's first time instructing. So having the opportunity to re-learn similar concepts from a new perspective was helpful in solidifying the material. Assignments and exams were fair, and it really made sense after this semester. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- I thought the course did a good job expanding on topics that we learned about in Epi 1. The homework sets were extremely helpful when preparing for the exams. Exams were challenging, but very fair. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses- I thought some of the lectures (particularly those on methodology and health outcomes) were not useful as we were not tested on them and we did not cover them in our discussion section. ",

            "\u00a0I love how the topics are inter-related to each other and to what was learned in Epi1. \r\nimprovements: the slides could have had white background instead of dark-colored background. ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Ma is fantastic -- very available for help. I think the lecture slides were confusing, but clarified in discussion slides. For exams, I mainly studied discussion slides. Lecture wasn't too helpful for me. The TF's were very available and that really helped. I also liked how the HW was graded -- made me look more diligently at the slides and learn as I go. ",

The lectures were easy to understand and refer to after class and while completing the homework assignments. The homework assignments were sometimes challenging in the amount and application of the information we learned in class, but office hours and review of the lectures made the assignments more approachable. It would have been preferable for the lectures to be recorded, but them not being recorded did not substantially affect my understanding of the material or study techniques. "

At times, it felt like learning wasn't the point, but instead we were supposed to regurgitate information from the slides verbatim.

Ultimately, this meant that I spent less time trying to understand the concepts and more time trying to remember which words were acceptable and which ones weren't.\r\n\r\nI think that the focus on preventing plagiarism detracted from student learning, which is a shame because this course could be so much better if students actually were provided with the tools to learn.

            "\u00a0This course is very excellent and essential for future work relating to Epidemiology, you will gain deeper understanding of the principles of this subject after all the classes, homework and discussion section for this course. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a repeat of Epi I with a slightly higher difficulty and higher level concepts, however the main ideas were exactly the same. The lectures were NOT engaging and I learned the most out of TA sessions and office hours. If you have to take this course, you have to take this course... But if you do not have to take this course I would consider learning about this material online yourself (BU has a great public health free online modules site), and then spending your time taking another course that may be more relevant and useful to you. ",
            "\u00a0It's a requirement, but it's not too bad. ",
            "\u00a0A partial repeat of Epi I with a few add-ones. The amount of new material does not nearly merit an entire semester-long course. Would not recommend. ",
            "\u00a0Very educational and helpful. It is extremely applicable to real life epidemiology and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Dr. Ma is an exceptional professor. ",
            "\u00a0Recommended - just don't invest in the text book its not necessary ",
            "\u00a0epi 2 is worth taking for a deeper understanding and application of epidemiology. ",

            "\u00a0Highly recommend for anyone completing an MPH, the way to truly build an Epi foundation. ",
            "\u00a0challenging but worthwhile ",
            "\u00a0Epi II is not for everyone. It is a difficult course that requires you to push yourself in order to understand its concepts. However, students who push themselves are rewarded by gaining critical thinking skills and the ability to understand research concepts. The professor and TF's are fantastic. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend! Epi 2 came more naturally to me than Epi 1 because we were challenged to recognize the flaws in epi study designs instead of taking them as truth. ",
            "\u00a0Expansion of epidemiology I. I would recommend this course because I found it helpful when it reinforced Epi1 learning. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would, because the concepts covered in this course are important to understand as a future public health professional, and the structure of this course will help you accomplish that. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend taking this course. Despite it being required for me, I am very glad I was made to take it because I learned so much this semester. It is very challenging and will require a lot of hard work but it is ultimately worth it. ",
            "\u00a0Overall it was a good course, but depending on how the curriculum is broken up next year, it may be redundant to what is taught in Epi I -- it really depends on your interests. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course because I feel as though the topics learned in Epi 2 will make me better prepared for a career in the public health field. This course forces you to think critically, and allows you to explore different approaches to answering the same question. ",
            "\u00a0This course was essential in improving my skill as an epidemiologist and learned a great deal in this class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to the students, because I think the concepts taught in this class is essential for epidemiology study. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course to a fellow student. I think students needed to spend a lot of outside class time absorbing the plethora of material. Overall, the info was well organized in the discussion slides and that's how I learned the material. Dr. Ma is a queen -- so kind and available to all students and really wants us to succeed. Very important class for all future public health professionals. ",
            "\u00a0I wouldnt necessarily recommend it- at least with Dr. Ma but what can you do - its required ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class! Challenging, but in a good way. ",
            "\u00a0Epi II (at least when taught by Dr. Ma) was actually a great reinforcer of the material from Epi I and on to of that, it focused a lot on the reasoning behind different methods and baseline assumptions. I would definitely recommend it if you want to strengthen your understanding of epi! ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course. The materials provide a solid foundation of epi and Dr. Ma is a wonderful instructor. ",
            "\u00a0Would recommend Epi-2 taught by Dr. Ma. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are willing to put in the work ",
            "\u00a0This course covered the main principles in epidemiology that will be useful for a career in public health and epidemiology. The material delved further into concepts introduced in the first semester of principles of epidemiology. I would recommend this course to students who do not have a background in public health and/or epidemiology or need to brush up on important concepts, especially if taught by Dr. Ma because she does well to explain the concepts in an understandable way. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student who is looking to understand and be able to apply common epidemiological concepts in research and practice realms. The course gives a broad overview of many concepts while also being able to discuss them specifically in their relation to others. I have already and will continue to refer to the lecture slides and notes from this class when discussing and applying the concepts covered. "
