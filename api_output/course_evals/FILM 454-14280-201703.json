            "\u00a0Wow. This class was transformative in a plethora of ways. Going in, I didn't know much at all about the material, but I'm leaving not only with more knowledge and experience but also more conviction and a greater sense of intention and purpose. ",
            "\u00a0this felt like a global affairs class. weekly we were talking about the various political issues happening in real time ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write a journalism article. I became connected with a community of Yale activists and writers and creators I will continue to work with even once I graduate. I was reminded of my privelege, and reminded that no matter what the person next to you is doing to try to fool themselves, whether they be applying for Grand Stategy, or Marshall or Truman, we are all lost, trying to do what we can to make some sort of positive impact on the world. ",
            "\u00a0There is so much I learned about this class. I dont know how to even articulate it in words. This is a class I will never forget. ",
            "\u00a0THE most integrative course you can take at Yale. Learn to interview refugees amd to write about them. Learn about political systems and institution who bash put those fleeing. Learn about personal stories. Learn to care. ",
            "\u00a0It's pretty difficult to succinctly summarize what I learned in this course. In terms of skills, I learned how to write a profile and think about how story shapes the arc of a piece. In terms of knowledge, I gained knowledge on the Greek refugee crisis. For insights, most of them are related to what I saw personally in Greece--how the UNHCR/international governments are bureaucratic messes, how privileged we were to be students at an elite university who could come and leave, and the like. ",
            "\u00a0This class intimately shaped my understanding not only of refugee issues but also academia and knowledge production more broadly. We gained an in depth understanding of different types of scholarship, from anthropology to journalism to advocacy, and some of the relevant tools and frameworks used in each. I gained new insights into the importance of good storytelling across all writing, and particularly the possibility of good, conscious storytelling to subvert normative narratives and to be transformative. I also gained an analysis of the current refugee crisis in Greece framed in the broader processes of militarism, border-making, xenophobia, and international apathy that have shaped it. And what it might look like to write about such a complex issue, while being conscious of audience and political context. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a force. It challenged me to think in ways that I had not thought before and it presented me with material that fundamentally made me think differently about the way that I approach my studies and my professional life and frankly my life. \r\n\r\nI developed insights into how to do journalism in the most ethical way possible. I developed insights into the challenges of communicating stories, of listening to stories or trying to be an engaged witness to things that are happening in the world.\r\n\r\nFundamentally it made me, more than any other class I have taken, think about the way that the struggles happening in the United States are connected to struggles happening elsewhere in the world. It made me think about the United States' role in making those struggles for freedom or justice or simply just being able to live, more difficult. The class challenged my understanding of the way to provide aid to people in need. And perhaps more importantly made me reformulate the way that I understand \"need\" and the humanity of people more broadly. \r\n\r\nI learned tangible skills in writing a journalistic piece. I learned about filming, taking and editing videos, constructing a narrative, editing that narrative and doing it all over again. \r\n\r\nOn a content level, I learned about a subject refugees and the situation in Greece and other places that I had not heard about or learned about before.

            "\u00a0The writing workshop aspect of this course provided an excellent way to engage with professors and also fellow classmates. The opportunity to travel to Greece, where we experienced (to some extent) what life was like in a variety of refugee camps was also extremely insightful. Though a short trip over October break, this lived experience was impactful in a way that academic theory and films related to the refugee experience could never be. It was a truly transformative experience for many of us. Unlike most study abroad courses, the course had several class meetings after the return to New Haven, which allowed time for a deeper level of processing than had the course ended in Greece. I think more time Greece would have been useful, but am thankful that we were able to go at all. ",
            "\u00a0The course offered a wide variety of materials through which we could study the subject matter. The trip was a transformative experience. I have never and probably never will have another experience like it. ",
            "\u00a0the organization of the class is very  unique. the two professors went back and forth with each other before inviting students into thr conversation.\r\nthe trip to Greece was intense. there was not much time after the trip to process all that happened there which left some with visible emotional trauma.\r\nbut overall, its a really great class to take and it makes you a lot more compassionate about whats happening in the world. ",
            "\u00a0This course honestly changed my life. Strengths: you get a life changing experience reporting 12 hours a day for 7 days in the refugee camps in lesbos,Greece. You become friends with a journalist that is top in his field, Jake Halpern, who will become your mentor for the rest of the semester and for the rest of your life, probably. His advice is priceless. You also get access to Zareena Grewal, the best professor at Yale. While she can be a bit of a loose cannon, Zareena has a great heart and really cares about her students. You can go to her office hours and talk to her about anything and she will sit and engage with you for hours. She's anti-grand strategy and Imperialism at Yale and she  is the fastest reader I've ever met and one of the smartest people I've ever met. Weaknesses: this should be a year long course so the material you collect over the first semester can be published next semester. Also, the trip was kind of traumatizing and while that made us really close as a class (it felt like we'd gone through a war together) the transition back into Yale life immediately  after the trip was really difficult. For the most part it was productively difficult and productively traumatizing in that it made me question the status quo, but Maybe make it be over spring break instead? ",
            "\u00a0Overall just an absolutely amazing course. It's biggest strength is in the teamwork between Jake, Zareena, and Randa. The only weakness was some of the organization. ",
            "\u00a0Incredible faculty readings discussions exercises outside of class. Weakness: sometimes faculty talk more in siscussions ",
            "\u00a0Perhaps better integration of readings into class\r\n\r\nStrengths - everything else ",
            "\u00a0This is also a complicated question which I am not sure I can do justice. This might be a personal preference, but in terms of weaknesses, I saw a major weakness of this course as its lack of a coherent focus in the syllabus upon the issues most prominently affecting the Greek refugee crisis or texts that would later inform our written work.  . While the first assignment for everyone was a profile, we read very few profiles--perhaps only one of the books we read could be considered as writing in the style of the profile. While I understand arguments both for and against the type of syllabus this course ultimately had, given that the entire point of the class was to produce something from the material gathered in Greece, very little material actually was studied that directly went towards preparing such a final product. A second weakness of this course would perhaps be the fact that it attempted to perhaps take on too much in the span of a semester--particularly concerning the trip to Greece. The class was part seminar, part workshop, part lecture, part field based work which ended up meaning a lot of areas were covered, but never with enough time as one would've hoped. ",
            "\u00a0The class was very strong on the whole. There was a strong commitment to building to a common understanding. The class was ambitious and fast-paced, and the opportunity to go to Greece and learn from people there was incredible. The political analysis of the class operated at a very high level, spanning geography, scale, history, and the personal, though it was somewhat muddled at times and shaped by several large contradictions.\r\n\r\nOur two professors are brilliant, deep thinkers, and open with their thoughts and feelings. The productive, academic tension between the two of them was a strength of the class, but there were weak moments where their voices eclipsed all others. I would have loved to hear more from my classmates, particularly towards the end of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I don't know if this course could be repeated, but if it could I think it would be great. We traveled to Greece because of some stroke of luck and our Professor's genius. The trip made what we were learning so fundamentally different, that it transformed the entire class. What had been words on a page were made real in a way that no one could imagine. The professor didn't pull any punches and we were right in the thick of things in Athens and Lesbos, Greece. Without those experiences the class would have been successful. Each of us would have learned skills, and done journalism and thought about the ethics, but the trip made it so that each student had faces and people they shook hands with that they left to come back to the castle of Yale. Each of us had to grapple with what we were doing, why we were doing it, how we were doing it, and those experiences and the questions that came out of it meant and continue to mean more than anything a book or a teacher or a discussion could ever produce. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes peer class discussion was overlooked as both professors enjoyed to debate the topics at hand. I wish students had more time to add their input as the semester wore on especially following the trip to Greece. "

            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course if it is offered again! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely will but do book a session or multiple sessions of therapy after the Greece trip ",
            "\u00a0YES ",
            "\u00a0I dont think this course will be offered again- it was a once in a lifetime opportunity. But if it is- take it! ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. ",
            "\u00a0If you dont try to get into this class, you dummmmbbbb. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but I don't think the class, or the experience of the class, will take place again\r\n\r\nWe learned with our teachers, so they would teach it differently the next time\r\n\r\nAnd maybe not go on the same trip, or any trip ",
            "\u00a0This question is difficult to answer. It's unclear whether this course will ever be offered again, but if it is, it's best that you know the following. Your trip to Greece will be greatly affected by whom your group leader is. What went down on the trip could be its own review - it suffices to say that it was perhaps the most powerful and most traumatic experience for me of the entire year. You will live another lifetime during the week you're there. But that means coming back to Yale is incredibly, incredibly difficult. Most everyone in the group was dealing with some form of first/second hand trauma when they got back, but we all basically had less than 24 hours between landing in NY and going to class again. There was little foresight/planning on the part of Professor Grewal to help students with this transition. If you have a semester that is already intense, or you yourself are dealing with any type of mental health issues, I would be very careful about going on the trip--at the very least, I would interrogate Professor Grewal about how she plans on getting 20+ students Deans Excuses/extensions, if there will be trauma training, and the like. Focusing more on the content of the course itself, Professor Grewal generally does things spontaneously which means that the syllabus will likely change 3-4 times throughout the semester. She is a very specific type of Professor--so if you find you don't like her style, it's best not to take this course. In general, she tends to lecture more than give students a chance to speak in seminar. The texts are interesting, but not necessarily anything that will help you understand what happened in Greece. Professor Halpern does his best to get students a chance to workshop on their assigned day, but that didn't always happen. Most of the time it felt as if the class was featuring Zareena's thoughts with some intermission from Jake, and handful of student comments. Perhaps the most frustrating and disappointing aspect of this course is that it didn't - at least in this iteration - allow students to produce anything that actually would be shared with the public in a way that is meaningful --which everyone who comes back feels some form of an obligation to do. Professor Grewal imagines that most students will continue their projects beyond the class, but if it is ever offered as a course again, ask whether there is a second semester class which will also be offered. If there isn't, then the trip is just refugee tourism. If you are actually interested in learning about refugees with a professor who will treat the issue with the thought and respect it deserves, I would suggest taking Professor Tran's course, Intro to Critical Refugee Studies. Speak to others who were in this class, however, if this course is offered again as everyone has very different takes on what happened. As a heads up, Professor Grewal ran some type of border simulation to get into the class during shopping period --which should never happen again. If it does, report it. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend taking this class or one like it! Particularly if youre looking for a dynamic, constantly-changing classroom experience, are willing to change and adapt, and are interested in HOW refugee narratives are constructed, used, and weaponized. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY! Zareena and Jake make an excellent pair. There was learning happening in an academic sense as well as on deeply personal levels. "
