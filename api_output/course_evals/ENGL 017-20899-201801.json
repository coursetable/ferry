            "\u00a0This class will make you a much better writer while also making you a more critical thinker and reader ",
            "\u00a0Kastan really teaches you a completely new way to read, and you learn to think about the most minute details in ways you never thought possible. ",
            "\u00a0How to read SHAKESPEARE ",
            "\u00a0By taking this course I learned about Shakespeare's Major Tragedies, the context in which they were wrote, and the impact they have on the audiences who read them. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Kastan is an incredible professor! I learned how to speak comfortably about my ideas in front of my peers. I learned how to closely analyze Shakespearean texts. I also learned about the history surrounding Shakespearean texts. ",
            "\u00a0How to read incredibly closely and analyze text with the utmost detail ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read Shakespeare at the level of the syntax, how to think about the plot and characters on a larger scale, how to write, and how to appreciate the delicacy of Shakespeare's work. ",
            "\u00a0This course teaches you to read Shakespeare with increased attention and with a different mode of thinking. It is incredibly rewarding to read Shakespeare now with a new mentality. Professor Kastan is an amazing professor who is kind, thoughtful, and intelligent. He pushes his students to do their best work. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more in this course than I have in any other English class. I gained much greater insight into the importance of differing editions of Shakespeare's plays, participated in captivating discussions about his plays, and strengthened my writing and literary analysis skills. ",
            "\u00a0This course completely changed the way I read and write academically. Since we only read four plays, we were able to discuss and uncover an incredible amount of detail about the nuances of each play's language, which was a super rewarding experience. ",
            "\u00a0This course was undoubtedly the best I have taken at Yale so far. I learned a lot about the historical context and circumstances in which Shakespeares four major tragedies (Hamlet, Othello, King Lear and Macbeth) were written. The focus of our conversations was not on the plot of the plays, but in the language within them that makes them so powerful. We closely examined the variations between the different versions of the plays, and looked at the ways in which Shakespeare attempted to transcend the limits of the English language. We discussed these works both as plays to be read and performed, analyzing the differences between the two and how the language may have been shaped by the various individuals involved in its production: not only Shakespeare himself, but also the editors, actors, and publishers. This course also taught me to read all over again, slowly, attentively, and enjoyably, and think critically along the way as to why the words on the page are the way they are. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Kastan is amazing! He is truly interesting and does force you to consider new viewpoints. The workload of the class makes it possible to focus more on developing critical reading skills instead of working to complete work\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Professor Kastan does lecture quite a bit which can make it hard to get into a discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Reading four plays is nice - you get to spend a lot of time on very few plays. Professor Kastan tends to spend a decent amount of time in class lecturing, which can be nice but sometimes a little frustrating, as there is so much to talk about when reading the plays. The feedback I got on my essay was the most critical assessment of my writing ever, and Professor Kastan really cares about helping you learn and improve. ",
            "\u00a0This course is perfect. Professor Kastan is brilliant, engaging, funny, and the direction of the class is always a surprise. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Kastan is an absolutely incredible professor. He is at the top of his field and has such great knowledge of the plays it is truly a pleasure to learn from him. The class is a bit lectureish, but there is plenty of opportunity for engagement. Not much can be improved ",
            "\u00a0Professor Kastan is incredibly knowledgeable about Shakespeare. He is so insightful and so eloquent in the way he speaks. However, at times I felt that his course was more of a lecture than a seminar. Students did not have as large of an opportunity to speak as I expected. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Kastan brings so many enlightening perspectives to the table and is really good at nudging interesting topics toward lively discussion among the students. ",
            "\u00a0I loved everything about this course. The only improvement I can think of would be the fact that we don't have an idea of our grade until the very end of the course. ",
            "\u00a0The course was absolutely incredible, and Professor Kastan is a gifted professor. He made it a focus of the class to make us smarter by discussing with one another, and prioritized enjoying and appreciating the material rather than worry about grades. The blog posts always had fascinating prompts, ones that pushed us outside our comfort zones, and motivated us to think creatively and write to dazzle. The essay prompts were particularly interesting, and they pushed the boundaries of what traditional papers look like. For instance, the first paper asked us to examine and research the words in six lines of Hamlet (whose meanings have broader implications for the play), and the last asked us to write papers about Macbeth as a group (as almost all writing is inherently cooperative). I loved that we got to see the original publications of the plays in the Beinecke - the 1608 Quartos and the 1623 Folios, and that we were able to flip through the pages and think about the reasons for the formats on the page. This class was wonderful, I was always excited when coming to class and inspired when leaving, and I cant think of any way that it could be better. I can only hope that future first-years will have the tremendous privilege to take his seminar in the future. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely. Take any seminar you can with Professor Kastan. He's the kind of professor who just genuinely cares about you, and understands that most people in this freshman seminar aren't English majors. You really do get to think about tiny details in the plays in such fascinating and deep ways, and Kastan will always have astounding bits of knowledge to impart on you. Take any opportunity you can get coffee with Kastan and talk about life - he's a great person who wants to understand who you are. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Kastan is fantastic. Besides being one of the foremost experts on Shakespeare in the world, hes an incredible, down-to-Earth, funny individual. He really opened up my eyes to the way that Shakespeare may have been originally presented and can offer a level of insight into the material rarely provided in any course. ",

            "\u00a0Yes; if you want to experience the intellectual energy of a Yale English course without the intimidation and flood of reading, Prof. Kastan's class is the one to take. Kastan makes reading Shakespeare a playful adventure. He is full of wit, charisma, sass, and coffee, and is willing to share all of those things with his students.
