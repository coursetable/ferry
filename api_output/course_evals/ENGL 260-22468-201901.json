            "\u00a0My ability to compare works across different time periods improved dramatically in this course by analyzing Shakespeare and contemporary poetry with similar styles and techniques. ",
            "\u00a0In the course, we learned to read poetry from very different eras in conversation with one another with a focus on poetic technique that we could apply to our own work. We also learned the skills of a strong poetic recitation. "

            "\u00a0This course was put together very well. Each week we focused on a certain theme in Shakespeare's work. I felt that I got pretty good feedback from Professor Chapman about my work. ",
            "\u00a0I found the class pretty disorganized and intellectually superficial. The creative writing/literature hybrid was a joke: we had one day of workshop in which all 18 or so students got, like, five minutes of feedback, and otherwise all of our discussion was about the literature studies side of things. The syllabus consisted of mostly contextless excerpts from Shakespeare's plays and (in my opinion) tangentially related contemporary poems, plus a few full plays later in the semester. Ultimately, I don't feel like the class delved very deeply into Shakespeare or the work he's influenced. The class would be improved by either increasing the creative writing component or scrapping it entirely, using a better-edited syllabus where the connections between craft elements are more clear, and having a less chaotic schedule of assignments (due dates and requirements frequently fluctuated). ",
            "\u00a0I think this course sets out to accomplish something very interesting in its attempts to draw connections between new poets and Shakespeare. Sometimes, this connection really clicked! Other times, it really didn't. Professor Chapman's attempt to unite all poets back to Shakespeare felt like kind of a thesis in itself--one that I'm not sure fully convinced me. The connections, nevertheless, allowed me to see both poets in a new and inventive way. I also loved how directly Professor Chapman has connected reading and writing in this class. I feel as if I have left this class with so much inspiration. \r\n\r\nI think the course can be improved in the following ways: \r\n- having the class meet twice a week and assigning less work for each class\r\n- maintaining the journal exercises and equal emphasis on both creative writing and reading. Also checking the journals at the end of the semester to continue holding people accountable for their work. \r\n- having more organized discussions about the work\r\n- allowing more time on Shakespeare and finding more structured ways of discussing it. \r\n- making the class smaller! This way, workshops can be more intimate and fruitful and Professor Chapman could feel more available. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course for people at all interested in Shakespeare. The comparison between Shakespeare's work and contemporary poetry was so fascinating. The fact that it's a hybrid English class - literature or creative writing credit - is also great for people who take a lot of CW courses and need to fulfill Lit credits for the English major because it incorporates both writing poetry and literary analysis. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course! Fascinating pairing of Shakespeare with contemporary poets, really interesting to dive into the craft. Chapman is stellar, smart, sweet, kind, and so incredibly helpful in all parts of the learning experience. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class. Professor Chapman is brilliant and passionate about poetry in an infectious and enlivening way, and the connections forged in class between Shakespeare and more contemporary poets are neither obvious nor tenuous. The intellectual challenge of this class is just right: it will likely force you outside of your comfort zone, but in a thoroughly exciting way. I feel that this is one of the best classes on poetry I've taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I don't recommend it. There are better Shakespeare courses, and there are better poetry writing courses. I took it for the Renaissance requirement under the English major, thinking it would interest me more than the more traditional Shakespeare classes, but I think that was a mistake. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend a revised version of this course to another student, for sure! ",
            "\u00a0Fantastic reading list, fantastic professor. Highly recommend. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely - Yale needs more hybrid creative/scholarly classes like this! "
