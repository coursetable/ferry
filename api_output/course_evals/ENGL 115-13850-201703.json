            "\u00a0I learned so much about how to improve my writing skills and think about literature in an analytical way. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how to analyze literature and how to write at a college level. ",
            "\u00a0In this course, I strengthened both my reading and my writing skills. Reading a variety of literary texts closely and in the context of literary theory, I developed a loose understanding of why we choose to read what we choose to read, why we love the literature we love. ",
            "\u00a0Wow I actually learned how to write. I thought I knew how to write, but I did NOT. I was told the 115's were basically AP Literature but in college, and I had an easy time in that class in high school. However, before this class I had only really written those \"3 paragraph\" essays. Here I learned how to make each idea build off of the next in a logical way that strengthened my essay. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how to write a college-level essay which develops an argument, but at the same time, gained insight into the criteria by which we judge books. We read great literature, discussed what made it great, and explored whether books have the ability to make us better people. ",
            "\u00a0I developed skills for writing college essays such as structuring an argument, writing introductions, and writing clear sentences. ",

            "\u00a0This course allows students to strengthen writing skills immensely. I now feel much more prepared to approach writing essays for the rest of my Yale career. Through instructor and peer feedback on essays, as well as lessons and in-class exercises about writing skills throughout the semester, students are given the opportunity to grow in their writing. The in-class discussions were also very engaging and intriguing--they had just the right balance of structure and freedom to explore topics. The one (tiny) weakness was that the nightly reading responses were sometimes posted kind of late, so it would be helpful to post them earlier if students want to get ahead on reading. Overall, this course has been wonderful. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: excellent and deep class discussions, great feedback from the professor on essays, interesting readings\r\nWeaknesses: while the professor provided excellent feedback on essays, it would have been helpful to know what he was looking for from the outset. At times it was frustrating, putting in such a high level of effort and still getting sub-par grades. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this seminar are its syllabus and writing conferences. The syllabus engaged with a wide variety of texts and the classroom discussion engaged with a variety of learning styles. Each class was different, and that kept me excited! Additionally, I found the drafting and editing process for the class assignments to be very productive, especially meeting with Professor Wepler. I wouldn't change anything about this course! ",
            "\u00a0I've said this before, but I like the reading responses even though they are a pain in the ass. I honestly think that they do a good job of keeping people honest (myself included!) and therefore heighten the level of discussion. ",
            "\u00a0One of the strengths of this course is that I felt I greatly improved my writing-- and have been able to apply new strategies in other courses-- but I also learned new ways of thinking about books, and read great books themselves, which kept the seminars from getting too repetitive or dry. The readings can be a lot of work, but they're mostly enjoyable, and the level of work for the course is not over what I could handle. I do think one thing to improve would be more writing lessons before we wrote our first essay, since for that essay, it was by far the weakest of the ones I wrote in this course, and I didn't feel totally prepared. But overall, this was an excellent course and I'm glad I took it. ",
            "\u00a0This class greatly improves your writing and you receive lots of feedback from the professor and other students. The reading list is diverse. Although this is a literature seminar, not much class time is devoted to analysis of the literature. Discussion is limited to writing and very controlled by the professor. "

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I took it in my freshman fall, and it laid the groundwork for writing skills that will help me throughout my college years. Professor Wepler encourages students to go above and beyond the writing level that we came to Yale with, and I have felt my writing skills improve throughout the semester. The class topic is also very interesting, especially for lovers of literature. We had countless class discussions that broadened the way I think about and approach literature. The reading can be a lot at times, and this course definitely requires a strong commitment to improving your writing, but it is a must-take if you are a lover of both reading and writing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This course was an awesome intellectual challenge and I really appreciate all that I learned. I feel that I am a deeper thinker now. ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this class to another student. Not only does this class teach you about how to write more effectively and how to better structure your arguments, but it also is engaging in that the class periods are used to get into interesting themes of the texts that we read and how they are viewed by the different members of the class. I really is a conversation between the different class members and how each person views the work in a unique way. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student! It's my favorite class I've taken at Yale so far. I thought the content of the course was incredibly interesting, and Professor Wepler's enthusiasm and knowledge were infectious. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! I nearly chickened out when I saw the \"Only amazing papers get A's\" tagline on the syllabus, but I implore you to take this class as you will improve so much in your writing--other courses become a snap. I really feel like I ditched high school writing and learned to write at a higher level. I am a big supporter of skills over content, and although I already don't remember all the exact characters in Ms. Dalloway-- my writing style is forever improved. \r\n\r\nI think seminars are where we learn the most and Ryan (wow I get such a kick out of calling adults by their first name you don't even know) is such a wonderful professor! Meetings with him between my draft and final paper significantly heightened and improved my essays. He is an absolute gem, and I have learned so much from him. ",
            "\u00a0If you're looking for a course with a great professor which vastly improves your writing skills, I'd suggest this one. It's a good deal of work, and it's not easy to get an A, but intellectually it was very interesting and I got great feedback on my writing. ",
