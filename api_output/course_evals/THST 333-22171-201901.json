            "\u00a0Learning a lot about Stephen Sondheim, what his lyrics mean, how his music explicates the lyrics. Learning some about how musical theater construction works. Fun class but also kinda boring at times. sometimes songs are just good and you don't have to intellectualize or academize it... ",
            "\u00a0It's a great introduction to / in depth analysis of everything Sondheim. You'll learn a lot about his shows and life. It's also heavily discussion based, so you'll develop skills forming/articulating your opinions about the material. ",
            "\u00a0Best class at Yale. You get to analyze the work of Sondheim from so many angles and learn to explore different modes of analysis on fantastic material. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about Sondheim, obviously, but also about the levels of storytelling in musical theater and the larger impacts of musical theater in reflecting and advancing culture. ",
            "\u00a0A great understanding of Sondheim to discussion with my colleagues and the readings that were done. ",
            "\u00a0I gained knowledge of each individual Sondheim show in depth. I also learned skills in how to analyze large bodies of work at one time. Sometimes we would be looking at multiple shows at a time. In addition, I learned a ton about sondheims approach to character development and I gained a much better understanding of how to effectively analyze lyrics and songwriting. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about how to think about the creation and reception of Sondheims musicals and musical theater at large. On a more granular level, I left the course with so much more knowledge about the technical and theoretical aspects of music and theater that I knew little about. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the innovations of Sondheims American musical theater and gained new knowledge on how to approach writing a musical, analyzing an already existing show/score, and crafting psychologically complex characters. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the history of Stephen Sondheim's influence on the American Musical Theater Tradition. I learned the about the social, musical, historical, and biographical contexts behind Sondheim's large body of work, and I developed insights into the lasting impact of Sondheim's work on contemporary musical theater. ",
            "\u00a0So many! I deeply enjoyed taking this course, and feel it broadened my knowledge of musical theatre writing as well as the Sondheim canon. I have a much better sense of both how a Sondheim musical is made, and what kind of man Sondheim needed to be to make such musicals. ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge of Sondehim ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to sustain an investigation in the many works of Stephen Sondheim and analyze how certain themes, tactics, and concepts play out in various ways through his work. The class is an in-depth and comprehensive look at a limited amount of material.  I feel that I developed a real specialty or expertise about it through the coursework and lectures. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: stephen sondheim is a genius\r\nWeaknesses: I get kinda bored reading this stuff about the construction of his songs and things like that. it just gets kinda tedious. ",
            "\u00a0The class is insanely well run. It moves at a fast pace and Dan never skips a beat. The material is also very engaging, but there's no real reason to keep up with the readings as long as you're somewhat familiar with the shows going into class. ",
            "\u00a0The survey section of the course was wonderful. My only suggestion was that the second paper prompt was vague and difficult to figure out in only 2 pages. ",
            "\u00a0I think the strengths were that all the conversations were truly guided by all the questions on the sheet and that the readings were all utilized in all the conversations. Some of the weaknesses is that a lot of the conversation relied on comparison to R&H that required more previous knowledge than those assigned--I know it may have been recommended in the syllabus, but providing more guidance on how to understand the precedent for Sondheim would be better. ",
            "\u00a0This is one of the better courses I took during my time at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course include that it is divided in a good way to learn the material then analyze Sondheims work. However, the second part of this (the analysis) became disorganized because we would jump around show to show to show with each sentence every class which made it hard to follow. The course is also confusingly structured in that it is kind of a lecture and seminar hybrid. Although that could definitely be a good point of this class for some. ",
            "\u00a0I thoroughly enjoyed in-class discussions. Everyone was engaged and given the chance to participate/share their thoughts. Reading/listening assignments were heavy at times but always very intriguing, enlightening, and directly related to the weekly discussion topics. I think the planning for classes with student discussion leaders could be more well organized/elucidated up front so students know exactly what to expect. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Dan is the best professor you will ever get at Yale. The listening homework is fun, and the readings are relevant. Class discussions are always chill and full of great video clips from Sondheim himself. You get to see a show in New York for free!\r\nWeaknesses: Lot of work week to week (sometimes 3 musicals for listening, and then 40+ pages of reading.) The classes are very dense, Dan attempts to include a ton of discussion topics in under 2 hours. ",
            "\u00a0I felt that this course was very well put together. As is the nature of a class where student participation can direct or redirect the topic of conversation, I sometimes felt that we got a bit off track, but the Professor did a good job of steering us back on course. ",
            "\u00a0Lots of music! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: engaging and insightful instructor; marvelous readings, interviews, and clips; in-depth study of a limited amount of material; fun!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: no comments "

            "\u00a0I'd recommend it if you like musical theater and also getting into the nitty gritty of every show sondheim has ever written. it's a lot. also there's a bunch of writing to do, and if you don't know all that much about music, it gets a lil meh. ",
            "\u00a0If you are a musical theater person in any sense, definitely take the course. Dan is wonderful and you'll likely be taking it with a majority of other theater people. So its great for learning the material and also keeping yourself visible in the Shen world / keeping up friendships and connections. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Best class at Yale. Everyone should take this if you have even a remote interest in Sondheim. Your analytical strengths will serve you well, and you will be encouraged to engage with material in exciting new ways. 10/10. ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this to anyone who is interested in musical theater at all! Even as someone who was just interested and not a theater or music major, it significantly deepened my understanding of musical theater and of storytelling in general. The conversations were greatly stimulating and Prof. Egan really makes this class excellent because he cares about bringing in everyone's individual skills and interests into the class. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I've recommended it to my colleagues in theater management who are also fans of musicals as a way to enhance our training. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to someone who wants to gain an appreciation of Sondheims work and doesnt have a fully formed opinion on his work yet. I didnt and I feel that this course gave me a much stronger point of view on what I enjoy and appreciate about Sondheim and then, therefore, musical theater in general. ",
            "\u00a0Yes 100% if you truly love talking about musical theater. It can be a bit daunting if you are not as familiar with musical theater, but you will learn so much and its worth it. ",
            "\u00a0Anyone interested in pursuing/exploring musical theater in any capacity should take this class. The class will completely change the way you approach theater-making and give you so many intellectual tools that you can apply to all your future theatrical endeavors. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you are a musical theater fan, you should take this class to learn about the history of one of MT's greatest composers. If you aren't a musical theater fan, this class might go over your head. Take Dan's fall semester class first! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely and I already have! ",
            "\u00a0If they like Sondheim ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely.  If you are interested in the American musical, this class offers a comprehensive look at the works of one of its greatest contributors.  We approach SS's work from many angles and try to understand it in terms of music, lyrics, book, storytelling, theater making, commercialism, biography, criticism, popular culture, etc. "
