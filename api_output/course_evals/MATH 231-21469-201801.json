            "\u00a0Linear algebra, multi-variable calculus, whatever Pat likes. Proof based math, arguing from definitions that may seem weird. ",
            "\u00a0YES Pat is great! ",
            "\u00a0This course builds on the linear algebra and real analysis introduced in MATH 230, in order to construct and develop vector calculus. In the beginning of the term, the study of linear algebra, almost complete from MATH 230, is properly finished. Then, the course turns to the derivative operator and discusses multivariable calculus. You will learn integration and differentiation in Euclidean space, the inverse and implicit function theorems, and then, in the final few weeks, an introduction to differential geometry, namely calculus on manifolds and differential forms. The course, above all other things, teaches you to love math, for its beauty, for its simplicity, and for its necessity. It also teaches you that, regardless of your preparation prior to the course, you really can do well in college mathematics. It builds confidence. It assumes you know nothing and shows you that you can learn everything. Even if you missed MATH 230, if you have studied something similar (like MATH 225), I would strongly recommend you consider taking MATH 231, on the basis of my experience in this course. You'll continue to learn how to prove things. You'll learn how to recognize truth and the various roads to it. This is a cool course. You should give it a try. Or at least, you should talk to the instructor. ",
            "\u00a0It would be a huge understatement to say we learned \"Vector Calculus and Linear Algebra\". This class is an intro to the world of pure mathematics, and you pretty much learn a bit about everything (ex. Topology, graph theory, real analysis, etc.). Super fun class. ",
            "\u00a0I developed not only skills in linear algebra and vector calculus, but also discrete, topology, analysis and graph theory. This class gave me the opportunity to experience a wide range of mathematical topics. ",
            "\u00a0Math 230 and 231 was definitely an all encompassing class and the problem sets are a lot of work but also mean that you end up learning so much. My proof writing skills, my ability to just do math were definitely improved in this class. ",

            "\u00a0Most importantly, I continued to develop my proof-writing skills in this course. Besides this, I learned a great deal of important mathematics that will be important to future courses & work here in math. This course also forced me to learn good time-management skills in terms of long-term assignments due to its demanding courseload. ",

            "\u00a0I learned how to write rigorous proofs and how to understand topics like differentiability, integrability, continuity, etc. in a very abstract way. This is class is a natural continuation of 230, so if you really liked this semester then you'll also really like this semester. I thought the 231 topics were less new, especially for people who have taken multivariable calculus before, but you get a really solid understanding of it when you come out of the class. ",
            "\u00a0This knowledge gained in this course can, broadly speaking, be broken down into a few categories:\r\n\r\nMathematical Topics: In 230/231, you'll cover a wide array of different parts of mathematics. Although the course is billed as Vector Calc and Linear Algebra, that's a far too restrictive name for it. In addition to covering linear algebra (up through Caley-Hamilon, spectral theorem, spectral mapping theorem, diagonalizability, Schur decomposition, Graham-Schmidt and projects, inner product spaces, Hessian matrices, rank-nullity, so much else, and vector calculus (div, grad, curl and all that, total and partial differentiability, Lagrange multipliers, Darboux integration, the FTC and Stoke's/Green's/Div theorems [everything covered in MATH 120]), you'll also cover topics in Analysis (Banach/Brouwer fixed point theorems, compactness, measure theory, Taylor series & analytic functions, uniform and pointwise convergence applications, contractions, integration on manifolds, differential forms, parameterizations and more), Topology (topological spaces, homeomorphisms, manifolds, orientability), Graph Theory (Moore graphs, adjacency matrices, random walks, coloring), Discrete Math & Computer Science (probabilistic combinatorics, proof of the central limit theorem, random matrices), Number Theory, and a lot I'm probably forgetting. You'll walk away with a good introductory background in so many different areas of math, and a really solid foundation in Calc, Linear Algebra, and Real Analysis.\r\n\r\nMathematical Maturity: For most people, 231 is the second time they've ever constructed proofs (230 being the first). Whereas in 230, the goal was usually  \"prove in sufficient detail why this topic is true\", in 231 it becomes \"Look at all these tools we've already built! What can we build with them? What do they imply?\" You'll learn to cover new topics faster and to make connections across different areas of knowledge to see why theorems are true. 231 gives students the chance to see how mathematicians work. This will involve hitting walls with your understanding and pushing through, which is very valuable.\r\n\r\nWork Ethic: This isn't an easy course. You will spend many, many hours over the course of the semester working on psets and studying for exams. At the beginning of 230, I spent far longer on psets than I did at the end of 231 (several hours every day vs several hours on one or two days), which is largely a result of 1) getting better at math, and 2) getting better about working smarter rather than just harder (hard work is still very much required). This class teaches you how to balance a hard workload, and it also teaches you how to work collaboratively. If you finish this course without having spent a lot of time in the math lounge working with other people, you've sorely missed out. This is not a \"go it along, every man for himself\" kind of deal. You will form great friendships with the people you work on psets with, and you learn how to bounce ideas off of one another.\r\n\r\nFinally, this course gives you a real appreciation for math in general. It is a good exposure to what the rest of the math major will entail, and you'll meet upperclassmen, graduates, and professors who will all help you though the course of it. For many, this is the first time we encounter real math, instead of just computation. ",

In many ways, it throws you into the water and challenges you to learn how to swimbut in light of this, Pat is very devoted to his students, and was really good about offering various forms of support and guidance. As a result, I see math in an entirely different light than before 230/231.  We certainly learned a lot of content, from linear algebra to analysis to many many other random tidbits; however, more importantly, I feel like I have grown significantly as a problem-solver and mathematician. I think this sequence offers a really powerful foundation of knowledge and skills to tackle all sorts of math problems. ",

            "\u00a0Great course. Fun problems. But difficult. Expect to spend time. ",
            "\u00a0This course is among the best I have taken at Yale College. It is a community. The problem set structure keeps you engaged and develops the ideas presented in lecture far beyond their immediate scope. Assessments, meanwhile, tended to carefully follow the textbook, the lectures, and the syllabus. This balance is important for illustrating both the generality and expansive nature of mathematics, while also keeping the course focused. The instructor's goal, I feel, was to use problem sets to show us how interconnected mathematics is. Problem sets drew questions from across the various disciplines within mathematics, but were always tied together by the topic presented in lecture. Homework assignments were self-contained in this regard: you learned on the problem sets and what you learned was for its own sake. These assignments helped explain how incredibly general and powerful the ideas presented in lecture actually are. This system was a great strength of the class. ",
            "\u00a0The linear algebra felt scattered, especially in 230, but Pat recovered in 231 with the linear algebra. Everything after that, however, felt disorganized and scatter brained, and poorly presented. I didn't get nearly as much out of 231 as I did 230, and I wish he hadn't changed his teaching style so dramatically from 230. Pat needs to sit down and reconceptualize how to teach 231 (as well as start linear algebra in 230) so that next year is better and clearer. ",
            "\u00a0The course was rigorous but also enjoyable. The workload is a lot which can be overwhelming and stressful but it is most definitely worth it. ",
            "\u00a0I think the one thing this class could benefit from is a little more organisation. Sometimes I felt a little lost with where we were material wise and I felt like we were jumping from topic to topic. ",
            "\u00a0The pace of this course, the rigor, and the assignment structure and content are all strengths. I felt prepared for everything that came up, and I feel like the assignments helped me digest the material. I feel like the course might've been paced a little better. It felt like the information at the end was kind of crammed in. ",
            "\u00a0It was a very well done course. I liked the collaboration. ",
            "\u00a0One strength of this course is the well-developed support system available to students in terms of peer tutor groups, a teaching fellow, and a very available professor. \r\n\r\nOne weakness of this course, however, is the lack of student idea development in class. I feel as if in an effort to cover a huge amount of material, we weren't given a lot of time in class to fully comprehend &follow the material being presented in class sometimes. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: the absolute best class I've taken so far at Yale. The absolute best Math class I've taken in life.\r\nWeakness: sometimes it seems that the class is a little unstructured. But just be patient. ",
            "\u00a0The course was a bit disorganized, but overall it introduced me to a lot of cool topics related to calculus, analysis, and linear algebra mainly but also graph theory, probability, discrete math, and number theory. My understanding of mathematics as a proof-based field expanded greatly ",
            "\u00a0-very well structured, especially for first-years\r\n-great professor who cares about his students\r\n-very fair grading system\r\n-sometimes kind of went all over the place\r\n-office hours were always during one of my other commitments ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- Pat is such a fun and engaging professor. He makes the class what it is, and I wouldn't have taken it without him\r\nWeaknesses- the level at which students enter the class is very different, so in order to keep the class and the psets interesting for everyone, sometimes I feel like he'd toss out information that only some people in the class would understand, or put problems on the pset that would be much easier if you had some other knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the flexibility in the curriculum, though that might work for everyone or with other professors. But I enjoyed that Pat felt comfortable enough to explore mathematical tangents with us if they arose. ",
            "\u00a0The course is so much fun to be in thanks to Pat's passion and the cool material! Challenging but fun psets, collaborative environment, fair grading. 231 was a bit more disorganized than 230, but in some ways not as hugely taxing, which was nice. ",
            "\u00a0This class was overall very enjoyable and challenging, and I definitely grew much more as a mathematician in this class than I have ever before. This class teaches you how to write rigorous proofs and how to think about interesting problems in an abstract way. Pat does a fantastic job of making sure all of his students are on the right track. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course are numerous. It is a really fun course, even though it is hard work, so I felt very encouraged to continue working hard and learning more as the semester went on. I love how much ground we cover in just two semesters (really it's impossible to describe this course without bringing in 230), and I'm so glad this course goes beyond just \"Vector Calculus and Linear Algebra\". The collaborative nature of the course is fantastic; the math lounge is a great environment and the fact that we are encouraged to work together rather than alone is one of the best features of this class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course would benefit greatly from some continuity from year to year. Because this was Devlin's first time teaching it, we had to start from ground zero in figuring out what was going to be taught when. Although the progression of the course was great, it would have been nice to know what topics we would cover from week to week. If at all possible, it would be fantastic to have a single tenured faculty member always teach this course, since it would provide so much clarity and stability from year to year. Additionally, the lack of instructor provided notes made it difficult to really follow along, and the fact that the textbook was accessory to the course rather than an integral part didn't help (to be clear, I'm not advocating for a stricter following of the textbook at all, just that having notes would mitigate the need for one; the creative freedom given to the instructor is absolutely necessary to making this course great). I do wish the course was just a bit more rigorous, something comparable to Math 55 @ Harvard or the Intro Honors Analysis sequence at Princeton. While 230/231 teaches us a lot, I can't help but wish I knew more at the end of the year. One step in this direction would be to have more well thought out section, rather than peer-tutor sessions that weren't all that helpful. I think a required section, with fewer students per section, would improve the speed with which we processed the material along with our understanding of it. ",
            "\u00a0The course could be improved by having a set curriculum and making sure everything is gotten to and taught. Too many times, I believe, there were tangents and diversions that took away from the necessary learning aspects. ",
            "\u00a0231 lost a lot of focus it seemed. Sometimes showing up to class was not worth it. We seemed to take a 4-week long tangent from the material in the course, and occasionally what we were doing in class had nothing to do with the problem sets. ",
            "\u00a0fun but a little slow ",
            "\u00a0Pat's the best. ",
            "\u00a0I thought it was an extremely productive class in lectures because Pat was very engaging, and made the class both enjoyable and intellectually stimulating. I can't think of any way the class could be improved. ",
            "\u00a0This is a solid introductory math course for well prepared first years. The rigor of the course (and resulting long problem sets) mean that it is a big time commitment, but the material is never overly challenging. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very engaging and gave me a very accurate picture of what it's like to be a mathematician. It was very challenging but fulfilling. I felt like it became a bit disorganized towards the end but besides that it was superb. ",
            "\u00a0Pat is a very dynamic teacher, and along with the TA and peer tutors, all teachers involved were caring and devoted to the students. One great strength of the course is how collaboration is strongly encouragedthe coursework at times is nearly impossible for the average bear if you go at it alone, and working with classmates allows allows you to learn new ways of thinking creatively and form some lasting friendships in the process. I feel very lucky to have gotten to take 230/231 with Pat; however, I think the progression of material could have been a little bit more smoothly-connected and better-timed. (Lucky for those shopping in 2018-19, as Pat will be back to teach it a second time!) The only other improvement I might consider for the class is a different perspective on linear algebra. A lot of the focus was on matrices (partly due to the way the textbook is laid out, I think), and I wish we had spent more time thinking about things from more intuitive perspectives. ",
            "\u00a0the course does not have enough structure. the syllabus does not follow a clear path or trajectory, which is important in understanding and learning mathematics, especially as a foundation. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Material was generally well taught, lectures engaging, problem sets were effective at reinforcing concepts and were very interesting. \r\nWeaknesses: Lectures sometimes could have been better organized, would have been nice if we covered differential forms, Stokes theorem, etc more fully. ",
            "\u00a0Difficult problem sets are both a strength and a weakness; there should be slightly more focus put into teaching during class. Also, problem set grading and feedback was both slow and unclear. ",

Pat's problem sets are also really flexible; there are only a few required problems each week, and then you can pick and choose the rest of the problems from a list of optional problems. Take this class!!! ",

If yes, you really, really should take the course. Don't worry too much about \"is it too hard\" (no) or \"am I smart enough\" (you are), this course presumes basically zero knowledge of advanced mathematics. As in, you spend the first few weeks proving things like 1 > 0, and that addition works the way you think it does, and stuff like that. One thing that really differentiates this class from 120 is the sense of community it fosters. I'm really good friends with so many people from this class, by virtue of how well we got to know one another working on psets and the like. It's not uncommon for us all to go out to lunch (Pat comes with us often!) and I had such a good time being in the course. You'll also be really proud of how much you've accomplished over the course of 2 semesters. Looking at the first pset and comparing it to the last pset is really amazing, and you just learn so so much and develop a good sense of mathematical maturity. Since you've likely already taken 230, you probably know what you're getting in to, so if you enjoyed 230 you should 100% take 231. If you didn't maybe don't, that's okay. Also note that your performance is not necessarily the same between the two; I did far better on the 231 final than on 230 final, so don't think that If you were just doing okay in 230 then you won't pass 231. Additionally, I found the workload in 231 to be a little less than 230, although the topics themselves became more complex and interesting.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, if you have a chance to take this course (or really any course) with Pat Devlin, do it. He's a phenomenal teacher, the best I have ever seen, and it is absolutely worth your time to take a class from him. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's a good introduction to mathematics at a University level. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to another student unless they were already familiar with the material (but then why would they take the course?) or if they had a burning passion for mathematics and truly know what \"mathematics\" in college is. ",
            "\u00a0yeah pretty solid course ",
            "\u00a0If you are committed to math, take it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - it was one of the best math classes I have ever taken, and since it is a pre-requisite to many STEM related majors, I thought it was one of the best way to get into math at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is a good math course. The material is interesting and the professor is engaging and committed to the students. His lectures did get appreciably worse compared to 230 (lack of direction, etc.) but he is still much better than others in the math department. ",
            "\u00a0I would strongly recommend this course to a student who is willing to work hard and has a genuine interest in math. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another studentif they are interested in learning more about math and willing to accept the heavy courseload. For me, the average problem set for 230 took ~20 hours, and 231 was a bit less. (Others were faster; your mileage may vary.) However, if you're willing to dive in, the work is rewarding and well worth the time. Pat is a supportive, fun, engaging professor, and that's the main reason I chose to stick with 230 after trying the first pset. If you're still reading this, shop this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. You learn a lot of math and Pat is really cool. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Greatly enhances mathematical maturity; also, Pat covers a lot of material that is slightly relevant but very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Only take if pursuing a pure math major. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It is a fantastic course (taken with 230) for anyone at all interested in math or the math major. It really helps you discover what you like about math, kicks your ass while you're at it, but you get a lot out of it. :) ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Great introduction to math proofs. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. As a double major in Physics and either Computer Science or Mathematics, I found this course to be an essential proof based mathematics course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! As long as youre willing to put in the work, this course (230 and 231) is a great way to jump into proof-based math, without too much background needed. The professor works hard to help you, and the community that I found in the class was great. "
