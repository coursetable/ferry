            "\u00a0The course schedule is well organized. Quizzes in every week could push us to grasp what we have learned. The class is small so that everyone has the opportunity to speak and receive the feedback from the lecturer.\r\nIf time permits, it also helps to review a whole passage after we have decoded each sentence, so that we could apprehend the general idea more clearly.

            "\u00a0It depends on the major of the student. If he/she is interested in Indian culture, literature, and religions, I will recommend this course to him/her. Although many students think it's too hard to study Sanskrit, in class I think it is hard but interesting. And it was useful when I listened to some lectures on comparative studies between different translations of Sanskrit sutras. ",
            "\u00a0Sanskrit is a beautiful language, a good start to learn ancient Indian philosophy. "
