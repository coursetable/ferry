However, the time was short to be able and advance on that. \r\nWe also learned how to make our own prints, which was really helpful... ",

            "\u00a0No. I believe that Yale has much to offer. However, this is an extremely expensive course to be provided only two classes a week and 3 hour each. Its very little time to improve something, to actually acknowledge the content that is being presented in class and there is a lot missing to it because everything has very short time to be seen. ",
