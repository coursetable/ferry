            "\u00a0This was a great class that taught us the basic vocabulary and grammatical structures of Modern Standard Arabic. We learnt a great deal of formal Arabic - writing, reading, listening and speaking - as well as some Levantine Arabic (Shaami). The class was rather focused on grammar and vocabulary, but I think it has left us with strong fundamentals. ",
            "\u00a0After learning the Arabic script, we focused on writing and reading Modern Standard Arabic and listening and speaking in the Shaami (Levantine) dialect. ",
            "\u00a0Bt taking this course, I learned the basic fundamentals of Arabic including the alphabet and numbers. The class focused on Modern Standard Arabic for writing and reading, and the Shaami dialect for speaking and listening. I also learned how to describe my family, foods, major, basic information about me, along with the past, present, and future tenses. ",
            "\u00a0Over the course of only one semester, I have gone from knowing not a single word of Arabic to being able to speak, listen, read, and write about various topics including things such as school, work, food, family, the weather, etc. I have gained knowledge of not only formal Arabic, but also of the Levantine dialect that is understood in many Arabic-speaking countries. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the Arabic alphabet and beginner grammar and vocabulary. I'm now able to hold a simple conversation with a native speaker of Levantine Arabic. ",
            "\u00a0My knowledge of Arabic grew immensely in this class. I now have an elementary knowledge of speaking, writing, and reading Arabic. ",
            "\u00a0Introductory Arabic  MSA (written and spoken) and Shaami (spoken). High-intensity work ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much in this course! Within the first few weeks we had learned the arabic alphabet and were practicing writing and reading. I learned how to write and read Modern Standard Arabic and how to speak the Shaami dialect. "

            "\u00a0The size of the class was pretty big (17 students) so we didn't get as much individualized attention as we could have, but Elham still did a fantastic job of engaging everyone in the class. It would be nice to receive feedback on all the homework (she frequently returns homework with instructions to self-check) but the feedback we receive on the most important assignments is thorough. There also wasn't a very strong emphasis on speaking shaami throughout the course, even though half of the midterm and final required shaami usage. We had skits and presentations every Friday with the TAs during which we were given the option (but not required) to use shaami-- in the future, mandatory usage of shaami would better prepare students for the midterm and final. \r\nElham and the TAs make themselves extremely available to students and manage to keep everyone in the class engaged. They even hosted a study abroad panel for students interested in taking their language acquisition to the next level (I don't know of any other language professors who did the same thing). Moreover, Elham is understanding and will take it easy on you if you're sick, have a tight schedule and might be late to class, etc. (as long as you communicate clearly about your situation). ",
            "\u00a0Ustaaza Elham puts a great deal of effort into the class, structuring it very carefully and pushing us all to learn well. The outline for the next two weeks was always ready in advance, and meeting daily ensured that we learnt intensively. We always learnt with a clear structure in mind and the daily assignments ensured we internalized the material. It was a little fast-paced, but definitely needed to be so.\r\nClass sizes were a little big this year, so we missed out on some more personal attention that we would probably have benefited from. And this has nothing to do with the teacher, but MSA with Al-Kitaab has it oddities- we learn a lot of useless diplomatic language instead of more useful everyday phrases. That said, Elham did do her best to teach us the latter too!\r\nMaybe one way to improve the course would be to hire a grader (or multiple) since Elham often had to correct 40-odd sets of HW a day and hence couldn't always keep up with feedback) ",
            "\u00a0I found that the course was well-paced and enjoyable. It's a lot of work, but I learned a lot and was amazed by the end at how much I'd learned in just a semester. The assignments are worthwhile and I felt that I received good feedback. ",
            "\u00a0One strength of the course is that Elham provides clear feedback about every aspect of learning Arabic, so you quickly know what are your weak points. Her office hours are the perfect time to get clarification on something and see that she truly cares about your advancement in the language. One weakness, in my case, was the large class size, which reduced the feedback we would receive on reading and listening assignments. If it's possible in your schedule, choose a small class size to receive the most feedback. Also, speaking skills were only really practiced on Fridays, so more practice with the Shaami dialect would be beneficial. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Elham does an amazing job of maintaining an extraordinarily fast pace while also making sure that every student remains on track and is not falling behind. The course is also set up so that students have relatively balanced exposure to MSA and the Shaami dialect. There is really good incorporation of reading, writing, listening, and speaking.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Grading is very delayed as I believe the professor does all of it. It would be helpful to have feedback in a more timely fashion, instead of waiting weeks for assignment and test grades and comments to be returned. ",
            "\u00a0The only downside of this class was that it was way too overcrowded for a language class. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this class was it taught me a great amount of Arabic. A weakness was the way in which I learned frequently came from forced memorization late at night. This class was my largest academic commitment of the year, and while I understand that as a 1.5 credit class this is to be expected to an extent, the workload was such that it frequently crowded out my other academics as I simply did not have enough time to produce satisfactory work in both this class and others. Additionally, while I also understand the need to move quickly in a beginner class, the workload and structure seemed designed to dissuade beginners from pursuing it. This was disappointing to me as someone who entered the class with a passion for the language who ultimately found themselves discouraged from taking an additional semester due to the stress this class brought me. An attempt to balance workload with greater breathing space in my opinion would be greatly appreciated. ",
            "\u00a0The grading structure is strict and a little unfair. Theres little room for feedback on things that are worth a lot ",
            "\u00a0This was an excellent course in terms of pace and assignment diversity and distribution. I wouldn't change anything. I liked the text book and the online resources as well. ",
            "\u00a0The class is designed to facilitate a learning of the language and that certainly happens. One weakness was that my section was a little larger but Elham did a great job working around this. ",
            "\u00a0The class did take up a lot of time (50 mins of class and ~3 hrs homework) per day, but that might be necessary for L1. The textbook doesn't seem the most systematic (ex. we learn words like \"united nations\" before basic conversation), but I don't know whether there is a preferable option. Additionally, Yale might look into making more sections of L1 Arabic due to rising interest in the language, as the sections were larger than the teacher would have liked\r\n\r\nStrengths include the frequent drilling and spoken practice along with the variety of types of assignments (vocabulary memorization, spoken, written, etc.). The regularity of testing was also appreciated, and my teacher (Elham Alkasimi) was incredible ",
            "\u00a0This course packs in a lot of material and is definitely challenging, but it is not overwhelming because Elham and the TAs are very accessible and the class is designed so that you practice the material a lot. Another strength of the class is that all of the students are very supportive of each other. I also like how we are learning a dialect alongside MSA and how Elham places a huge emphasis on speaking because that is a very helpful skill. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone who wants to attain fluency in Arabic. Elham is an amazing professor and will work you hard, but you will make a ton of progress by the end of the semester and it will be immensely satisfying to be able to (somewhat) maintain a conversation after only 4 months of instruction. I made a ton of friends in my class that I know will be with me throughout my Yale career and had so much fun writing skits, speaking with my classmates outside of class, etc. That said, if you aren't actively interested in learning Arabic and just want to fulfill a language requirement, this is not the class for you. The workload is intense and attendance counts toward your grade, so skipping class is not an option (if you did miss just one class, you would fall so, SO far behind). ",
            "\u00a0The class was overall great, but I think the workload was overwhelming sometimes. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Ustaaza Elham is a wonderful teacher and really pushed you to work hard and learn well. If you are considering taking this course, know that you are lucky to have it taught by Elham. Take it! ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested in learning Arabic and you're willing to put in the work, I would definitely recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely, if you put in the work. Arabic is not a gut language in any sense. It honestly feels like you're learning two languages at once by learning both Modern Standard Arabic and Shaami. However, it's a beautiful transition from being completely confused about the language to having a conversation with a native speaker at the end of the semester. Most of the workload is concentrated at the first two months of the semester, and afterward, it dies down to a reasonable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I would definitely recommend this course even though it was an incredible amount of work. It is structured in a very effective manner and the professor is amazing. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to learn Arabic, Professor Elhams class is the right one for you. ",
            "\u00a0This course would be manageable and enjoyable had it been the only class I took. Had I been able to devote the three hours a day to homework I was told to do on the syllabus as well as have additional time to study for tests, prep for speaking assignments and revise corrected work this class would be a great learning environment. As it stands however, I was regularly kept up to the early morning trying to finish assignments, the eight exams which were part of this course meant that the majority of weeks I was studying for a test or evaluation of some sort in addition to homework and weekly speaking assignments. At times these evaluations would overlap, or fall immediately after a break. The daily workload of this course took a toll on my mental and physical well-being. This was difficult as I genuinely enjoyed learning the language and did appreciate what I learned, however the process of assimilating the information from class often felt forced and painful at times. I would not recommend this class unless you foresee yourself having a significant amount of time on your hands or have already a level of familiarity or faculty with the language. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely recommend this course. I didn't know a word of Arabic and now I can have conversations with my family members who are native speakers. Professor Alkasimi is incredible - she really cares about her students learning the language. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if they are committed to learning the language and not just looking to fill the requirement. ",
            "\u00a0If that student is willing to put in the high time commitment, I definitely would recommend this course, as it seems to be an efficient way of learning Arabic ",
            "\u00a0Yes you will learn so much Arabic. "
