            "\u00a0Strengths: Does immerse you in the language \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class went to quickly to truly understand all the grammar concepts. Grading very highly depends on what section you are placed in. There is a lot of busy work and there is no need for this class to be 3.5 hours long ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are Profesora Ame Cividanes and also a focus on Spanish speaking and understanding. There were fewer reading assignments and more oral activities which I appreciated. Profesora Cividanes is extremely and approachable albeit no the greatest at explaining concepts.\r\nThe biggest weakness of this course is Profesora Terry Seymour. Profesora Seymour is a very hard grader while also not really teaching concepts well. Sitting in her class for so long was very difficult because she does not contain her energy at all for the three and a half hour long class which becomes overwhelming. In general, the teaching quality of both profesoras is subpar. Neither really focused on helping us understand the grammar concepts and basically assumed that we came in knowing them. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- material presented in a very understandable way and professors always explained very clearly.\r\nWeaknesses- course went kind of quickly, sometimes it was hard to absorb grammar lessons before moving onto the next one ",
            "\u00a0I thought this course was wonderful and I only am bringing up strengths and weaknesses so this course can be improved. \r\n\r\nStrengths: All the instructors did a FANTASTIC job making sure we were culturally immersed and were able to experience Spanish culture outside of the classroom. I felt the workload was fair and the class exercises (though tedious at times) were very helpful to practicing speaking. I thought the idea of going to Madrid was incredibly generous and I am so thankful to YSS for allowing this trip to happen. It was also SO incredibly well planned (as were other excursions) and I am happy that the instructors, CIDE, and YSS organized it and facilitated the excursions. I wish that in Madrid we were able to talk a bit more about the significance of the places we were visiting. We went in one large group and I think that was why it was so hard to talk about the places we saw. \r\n\r\nI also want to say the food was incredible and seriously cannot express enough how generous the program was for making the experience so well rounded. The host family I stayed with was wonderful and because we did not have too much homework, I felt that I could spend time with them. \r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I didn't like that we rushed through Pamplona and also did not have much time to explore San Sebastian. I also wish that when we went on excursions the professors were more strict about the language pledge. It was so hard to keep up talking in Spanish and while I wanted to use only Spanish, it's hard to keep it up when every other person is speaking in Spanish because they assume that it's okay to be using English. While it is on us to be using Spanish, I do think the teachers should be more encouraging and holding us accountable (e.g. losing points for speaking English). \r\n \r\nI also felt my L4 class (Cividanes and Seymour) could have done better with getting our grades back in an efficient manner. This would not be a problem, but it is frustrating when the other class gets their's way before us. However, I will L4 was better than L3 in terms of getting grades back in good time. \r\n\r\nAlso in terms of logistics: I wish before leaving Spain we at least talked more about the typical daily life in Spain because I felt like I would not have been as shocked had I known basic things (e.g. what to expect about living with a host family, how to handle some situations that might arise if the host family isn't feeding us enough, etc.) \r\n\r\nI also wished that the last week of the program was restructured. I think we should have the final at least a day before the farewell lunch so that we can appreciate our last class and day in Spain without stress of studying for the final. I also felt that having a composition, oral presentation, and exam all in the same week was a lot and certainly okay in New Haven when we are still in the US, but not the greatest idea when we are in Spain and should be taking in the remaining time we have being immersed in the daily life. ",
            "\u00a0It was a really good course for learning Spanish since I could focus on the Spanish completely. However, I don't think participation should have been graded as strictly because it discouraged people from speaking in class as much. It would have also helped to go over some of the verb tenses and grammar a little more slowly because there really wasn't enough time to assimilate the information. I could have also used a little more feedback on errors I made or what I needed to work on. However, overall the teachers were great and most of the activities we did really helped me learn Spanish ",
            "\u00a0Great course! Timing was a bit complicated with the month in Spain, I gave details to the teachers already. "

            "\u00a0Yes if one would like to learn Spanish ",
            "\u00a0If you need to complete your language credit/want to take L4, the Bilbao study abroad program is definitely a good option. I feel like we did a lot less work than the average L4 class because we only had four weeks of actually teaching. However, I will say that the program is very intense and you should come into the program prepared to put in work. A lot of work needs to be done outside of class because very little in terms of teaching is actually done in class. ",

            "\u00a0YES. I cannot stress enough how confident I feel speaking in Spanish now. I feel that my attitude about Spanish changed a lot because of this experience specifically and I hope that others also take advantage of this. ",
