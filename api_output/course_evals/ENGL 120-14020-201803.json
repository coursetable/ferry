            "\u00a0My writing improved drastically through this course, especially as it relates to experimenting with organization and crafting powerful sentences. Because this class is dedicated to personal essays, I gained a lot of clarity surrounding my life experiences by writing about them. ",
            "\u00a0I learned that writing can be a myriad of things: an outlet, a challenge, an opportunity. I learned critical reading skills and editing skills, and learned how to engage with my own mind and thinking in a new way. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write a creative nonfiction essay, as skill I had never tested before. With Shifra's help, I learned how to analyze the strategies writers employ in their essays, and how to translate those strategies in my own writing. I learned how to think on the page as I am writing, and how to take risks in my essays. ",
            "\u00a0This class is really liberating and exciting, particularly for students who have never written creative non-fiction before. I may have an unpopular opinion here, but I wish I would have waited to take it until at least my second semester at Yale. I felt like I wasn't able to fully appreciate 120 as everyone talked about it because I was still adjusting to the reality of Yale courses and what it means to be a student here. I really wanted to get a better sense of what English courses at this school are like, and I'm not sure 120 was representative in the way I had expected it to be. This is not to say that I didn't enjoy the class, but it seemed like students who weren't in their first semester had a healthier perspective (and thus better experience) going in, and were also able to have a greater appreciation of the class for what it is. ",
            "\u00a0I not only developed a lot of new literary strategies throughout the course, but I also was able to get a real passion for English and writing that I never had before. I learned a lot about essay structuring and how different words are used and paragraphs arranged to make essay writing effective. More importantly, I learned a lot about the beauty of the essay, of the English essay, and I was finally able to utilize these realizations in my own writing. I attained a new appreciation for English that I didn't have before. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read texts critically for craft and to approach great writing not just with marvel but with a critical eye that can distill the different techniques the writer used and then incorporate it in my own writing. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to read critically, to use what Ive read for my own essays, how to discuss writings in class, and how to write a good essay. This class made me realize how much I love essay writing and helped me improve as a writer, technically and beyond that. ",
            "\u00a0I was completely unfamiliar with the genre of creative nonfiction prior to the course. Now, having taken this course, I have not only been able to crank out a few essays of which I am pretty proud, but also I feel confident in saying that I have developed into a better writer. One major thing I've garnered from this course is confidence in my own writing abilities. I have become much more adventurous with my work (due to the variety of texts we read during the semester) and have learned so many different tactics with which to approach the essay. ",
            "\u00a0My writing improved immeasurably by taking this course. This class taught me how to think  about my writing in a completely new and critical way. I learned strategies that I will continue to use whenever I write in the future. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write! Especially how to tease out the underlying themes from my essays and revisit them from different angles as the semester progressed. I learned how to be more honest with myself on the page. ",
            "\u00a0This course focused on reading essays in order to write better essays. I think I improved in both areas. As a reader I learned how to appreciate nonfiction essays and generally improved my understanding of how the large scale structure of a piece contributed to its overall function. As a writer this was my first taste of non-academic writing in the context of school and I really learned a lot about how essays work. The major lessons I learned throughout the 5 different units we did (personal essay, thing essay, place essay, book essay, and event essay) were a) an essay is an exploration not an argument b) how to intersperse narrative or description with explicit commentary and c) how to make shifts of subject or perspective without losing the essays coherence among other things. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about myself and the therapeutic nature of personal writing. I think meeting Shifra was one of the most important parts of my semester because she is just an incredibly caring, interested, and reflective professor and person. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read constructively and take note of techniques that I wanted to try myself. I love the diversity of the essays we read and opportunity to experiment with different voices and constructions. English 120 also taught me how to become a better editor and refine my writing through multiple drafts. I also learned to think before I began writing. A sentence can sound witty or lyrical, but at the end of the day, it has to say something. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: The professor. Shifra is such a caring and enthusiastic instructor. If you aren't already, she will make you excited about the readings. The class community is also a huge strength. The small class size, the workshop element, and personal nature of the writing all contributed to close bond between all of us by the end. \r\n\r\nWeakness: Can't think of any. ",
            "\u00a0Strenghts: Shifra as a person. I personally needed to feel comfortable in order to succeed more than I needed structure, and Shifra provided that space to be creative that I needed. Also, my classmates were incredible. It was so fun to get to know them through their writing.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes I felt that I wanted more opportunity to get to know my classmates because doing workshops on their essays felt like strange, tangential insights into their lives without ever truly getting to know them. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The professor--Shifra is amazing! The style of having a couple days of readings before a workshop makes it very easy to think of ideas for the rough draft and apply the writers' strategies to our own essays. The seminar style of class provides for really productive discussions. Weaknesses: Sometimes the advice/comments given for essays are extremely vague. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths -- many wonderful articles and materials on the syllabus, lots of direct attention, and Shifra deeply cares about her students. Weaknesses -- the prompts often felt very broad and abstract, and though the syllabus says they would be clarified in class, the articles were rarely direct models after the first or second essay; it was often hard for me to envision what the kind of essay Shifra described would look like until after I had written my first draft and read other people's workshopped essays, which was frustrating, and I was often unsure of the exact \"skills\" she wanted us to learn with each unit. ",
            "\u00a0Some strengths in the course is that the course is very well taught and very well structured. I felt that the works chosen to read for the class were very effective and all of the work is very well spaced out. You might feel that there isn't enough writing, and I feel that is a downfall to the course, but the readings do really provide a structure that make the class worth attending. ",
            "\u00a0I believe this course did a great job in teaching us how to writer personally about a great array of topics, how to look at professional essays and incorporate those writers techniques into my own essaies, and I learned the power of revision and how to do proper ones through this course. However, I wish in this course that we read texts for meaning as well as craft. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: I really enjoyed Shifras method of discussion in class; she let the students guide the talk and asked guiding questions tailored to our talk. I liked the readings and the workload for the essays was high at times but definitely manageable and worth it. ",
            "\u00a0I love how the course is structuredso that we constantly read some of the best essays in the genre and dissect these essays and what makes them tick collectively as a class. I think the time we are allotted to draft then finalize our essays is exactly enough and I greatly appreciated the workshopping process integrated into the course. I also loved each essay assignmentI loved how they were open-ended enough for us to be as creative as we wanted, but structured enough for us to inspire us to approach our work in novel ways.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness of the course is that sometimes, class discussions felt too dragged-out and maybe even a little unproductive. ",
            "\u00a0The students and the discussions in this class were definitely strengths of this course. The students were engaged and incredibly committed to this class, and the course allowed for workshops and readings of student writing. This was particularly helpful in learning tools to use in my own writing, and the discussions we had were fascinating and often kept me thinking for the rest of the day. ",
            "\u00a0Pretty much all strengths. I loved the workshopping aspect of the course, the readings were well selected, and discussion was well focused on craft. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of this course: great chance to get feedback from professor and other students, 5 essays give a lot of practice writing, the readings are interesting and usually helpful, small class size fosters great discussions.\r\nWeaknesses of this course: the system for peer feedback outside of class was not always clear. ",
            "\u00a0Shifra is the strength. Classes and one on one meetings felt a little like therapy sessions. I learned so much about myself and about humans. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this course. The essays we read were incredible, and I really benefited from the workshops in which I learned to become a better editor for other students' work and refine my own. I would recommend this class to any student who wants to try his or her hand at the modern essay. A wonderful opportunity to write with professors who are devoted to the craft. "

        [
            "\u00a0I can't recommend this class highly enough! It has been the highlight of my semester. Most of the essays we look to as models are fantastic pieces of writing that you will be glad to have read. Absolutely take this class as an opportunity to do a kind of writing (creative non fiction) that you probably won't get exposed to anywhere else, but will help your academic writing. Shifra is an amazing instructor, and you will be able to appreciate how unique and brilliant your classmates are. This is the perfect course to take as a freshman, because the essays allow you to slow down and reflect on your past and present, which can be cathartic. If you're looking for the quintessential liberal arts seminar experience, this is it. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Shifra was incredibly thought-provoking and was understanding of scenarios when students needed extra time or help. Furthermore, she was willing to experiment and explore with each person's work, and was clearly invested in both our work and our humanity. This class was a highlight. ",
            "\u00a0I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to another student! I feel like my writing has improved so much in just one semester, and I have written about topics I would have never thought I would. Truly, it has made me into a much more confident writer and thinker. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course if students read over the syllabus in advance and are ready to do some (often emotionally heavy) work in self-exploration and analysis. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would fully recommend this course to another student because it changed how I saw English and writing. ",
            "\u00a0I would reccomend this course to a student who wants to churn out a lot of material, learn how to read critically for craft, write personally, and learn how to revise effectively. However, I wouldnt recommend this course to a student who wants to read texts to get at their meaning and analyze their subtexts. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I have recommended it to a lot of my friends because I truly believe English 120 will help us grow as writers. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It was a lot of work, and was at times frustrating, but I enjoyed every minute in class, and truly learned so much about writing and thinking critically. This is an essential class for any student looking to gain skill and confidence in writing. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This class is worth taking no matter your writing or grade level. The structure forces you to practice regularly and revisit your work again and again. ",
            "\u00a0English 120 should be a required course for every student at Yale. It's kind of like vegetablesin the moment when you're drafting and revising it might not feel so great, but you'll be so glad you took the class in the end. I have a newfound appreciation for writing and a better sense of what I want to do with my life. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course. It is a fantastic chance to expand from writing academic essays! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, no question. And take it with Shifra, you won't regret it. ",
            "\u00a0TAKE ENGLISH 120 (and take it with Shifra)!  I became both a better writer and a better editor. Shifra was a wonderful 120 professor and really invested time and effort into her students. I am very grateful for her guidance and mentorship. Also, she brings candy to class. Would highly recommend to any student interested in writing. "
