            "\u00a0Improved almost all facets of my Spanish, especially my speaking and writing abilities. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped a lot with my grammar, fluency, and just ameliorating my ability to think quickly and hold a conversation in spanish. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of grammatical and writing skills in Spanish, way more than I anticipated in fact. My . overall communication in Spanish, including writing, reading, and speaking, were all improved as well given that there was great variety in the types of assignments assigned. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to improve my oral communication skills and be more confident in what I say (both in Spanish and generally). I also reviewed (and learned) grammar that was not covered thoroughly in high school Spanish. Finally, I learned to listen more carefully to what other people are saying and respond in an appropriate manner. ",
            "\u00a0My fluency greatly improved in this course (in terms of reading, writing, listening, and speaking). There was a lot of focus on grammar, which was very helpful. Reading longer pieces in Spanish became much easier in this course. ",
            "\u00a0I strengthened my writing, reading, and oral skills in spanish ",
            "\u00a0I didn't learn many new grammar concepts after taking AP Spanish, but I got to practice speaking a lot and using natural expressions in both my speech and writing. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: Fantastic focus on speaking during class. It was exactly as advertised  a class designed to help you hone your speaking and writing abilities. Out of the 50 minutes of each class, we would spend about 30 minutes of it speaking. Prof. Seymour is also an excellent instructor and helped me refine my grammar while both speaking and writing.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The only complaint I have about this class is that there's too much busywork. It was so much busywork, in fact, that I seldom had the time to read over Prof. Seymour's (invaluable) feedback on my writing assignments because there was just. so. much. Compared to its strengths, it's not a big deal, but it's something that could be improved (and the professors seemed to acknowledge it too by giving us at least a few extensions on assignments). ",
            "\u00a0A strength is that this course is extremely well structured. I knew from the first day every assignment I would have for the year and would always know what needed to be done for each class. The class was small and offered a good space to be able to speak spanish for almost the entire time. The assignments were varied enough that I always felt I was doing something different and improving a different aspect of my spanish. ",
            "\u00a0Since the class is not curved, all the learning lies upon yourself and I think that is essential for facilitating a comfortable learning environment. Also, since there are so many assignments, if you have a bad day and bomb one of them, it won't affect your grade overall. I liked the improvisation dialogues and I think there should be more of them. ",
            "\u00a0The course had strong instruction and followed the syllabus. However, there is such a thing as a course that is too structured. Every day there was a new assignment that seemed unconnected to the rest and fairly distant from class discussion. The workload of the syllabus is not distributed equally; some weeks we had maybe 30 minutes of work a night, others would be 3 hours. We never peer-reviewed or discussed our compositions in class; instead, we just turned in tedious assignment after tedious assignment. As a result, the reading, writing, and speaking portions of the class felt completely separate from one anotherdisappointing for a class billed as \"Advanced Oral and Written Communication in Spanish.\" I think more class-wide discussion that didn't depend so much on textbook questions would improve this class, as well as removing some unimportant content from the syllabusinstead, focus on depth, especially if students are reading a novel. ",
            "\u00a0The course is well-designed to improve fluency. The workload is very high and particularly essay heavy. I feel that some of the essays could be replaced with more video orals to improve fluency in speaking. ",
            "\u00a0this class includes a lot of busy work, which at the end is beneficial because of how much you have to speak and produce in spanish. however, i thought the grading was arbitrary and we didnt receive much helpful personal instruction. moreover, many of the topics we didnt go into in depth enough to learn anything about or find any significant meanin ",
            "\u00a0A lot of the homework was tedious but I definitely improved my speaking and writing abilities and gained more confidence after not having taken a Spanish class in a couple of years. "

        [
            "\u00a0Absolutely. If you want to improve your speaking abilities, this one's a no-brainer. What I did not expect, however, is that I'd be leaving the class with vastly improved writing abilities and grammatical intuition, which I've come to realize is almost just as important. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I am happy I chose this course to fulfill my spanish requirement. I knew I wanted a class in which I would have the opportunity to better my speaking ability, and this was the perfect on to do that. ",
            "\u00a0I would I would just warn them that the workload can be overwhelming at times, but there is a set syllabus so there aren't really any \"surprises\" in terms of the workload. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course as a first L5 Spanish course to take, especially if you've taken time off since the last Spanish class you took. This course helps everyone come in on the same page, and then takes everyone a step further. ",
            "\u00a0In its current formulation, I would not recommend this course to another student. My Spanish did not improve much and I felt like it even got worse. From the start, I felt like our section of the course (all first-years) was treated like an afterthought. Because the course was oversubscribed, the Spanish Department gave priority to upperclassmen shopping it, but promised they would create a new section of the course that had not been planned originally for younger students. We were made aware of this fairly late in shopping period, so it was too late to look for other options for L5 credit. I was grateful for a spot in the course, but the result was that none of the first years had a chance to learn from older, sometimes more experienced students in what was (for many) their first Spanish course at Yale. Moreover, throughout the whole course, there was a disconnect between the professor and the syllabus. They had to consult it frequently and didn't seem to know about upcoming assignments until the day of or the day before. Being in class added little to the course; I could have read the syllabus and learned just as much. I don't think this was the professor's fault, but rather a totally foreseeable problem if a department decides to create a new course at the last minute. There seemed to be more systemic problems with the syllabus anyway: the pacing was so bad, (with a major uptick in work piled onto a two-week period) that every section had to move the deadline of the final paper draft to the next week. Often, we read short stories and other excerpts of text outside of class and barely discussed themthen they would appear on tests, quizzes, and evaluations. In general, I think this course would be better served by emphasizing greater depth rather than trying to throw as much content as it can at the students. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a very good fit for students who are interested in quickly improving fluency in all areas. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend for keeping up/practicing a conversational level of spanish "
