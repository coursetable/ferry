            "\u00a0Derek Feng is a dedicated and patient instructor who truly wanted the class to learn. The lectures and problem sets were great, though the tests were tricky and required you to really know the material well and read the questions carefully. ",
            "\u00a0Derek can go a bit fast during lectures, although he does pause for questions. It can be hard to follow or comprehend some topics.\r\n\r\nThe homework assignments are reasonable and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting material, engaging psets, Derek was a very low-key and relaxed professor, peer tutor office hours were every day (!!) and always super helpful. // Weaknesses: this is hard material. no doubt. expect to spend between 10-20 hours on psets (there are 6-7 of them throughout the term) -- but you come out the other side a better programmer and a better statistician. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The course covers a wide range of basic knowledge of statistical learning algorithms.\r\nWeaknesses: The format of lectures are not very well organized. The course covers a lot of math proof and deduction, but these parts are not in the course materials. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the psets are well structured so that you are really learning how to implement the methods. There is enough guidance on the psets, though, that they are definitely doable. Also there is no final exam, just a midterm, and most of the grade is based on the psets which is nice since you put so much work into the psets.\r\nWeaknesses: this class teaches difficult material and the theory behind it was not always very clear. Also if you aren't good at coding in R, it is going to be really tough to learn the material and learn to code at the same time. ",
            "\u00a0The lecturer wasn't very good at keeping the class engaged and didn't really use the time in class effectively (e.g. class always started late, lots of fumbling with the projector, explaining notation, etc). We spent a lot of the class learning pretty old and outdated techniques, and I would have liked to spend more of the class learning more updated and standard material. We also spent a lot of time discussing and using word embeddings and language models, whereas I would have been more interested to learn about image detection and classification. Overall, it seems like the material taught in this class is lagging behind similar courses taught at peer institutions. ",

            "\u00a0Weaknesses: teacher (no tea no shade, just saying that the 2 lectures given by John Lafferty were a lot better than Derek Feng's, don't @ me though). Also the structure of the class was weird (no final, 6 psets which counted for 70% of the grade... lmfao). Lectures were not engaging.\r\n\r\nAlso, the TAs were sometimes flaky and would constantly change their weekly office hour times, also some TAs were just not knowledgeable ",
            "\u00a0This is a pretty well designed course to be honest. No complaints. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of this course is the problem sets. They are all quite long, but you get tons of experience with real data sets and machine learning. The midterm was also MUCH more reasonable this semester since it focused on knowledge and understanding, rather than theory and math.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of this course is the instruction. In the first half of the semester, I could understand Professor Feng's lectures, but starting with PCA, everything stopped making sense. He did try to give us intuition for each of the machine learning techniques we learned, but I feel that the lectures could've been less confusing if he didn't throw around a bunch of equations that we ultimately didn't really need to know. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the selection of topics and feel like I have some more understanding of the key concepts in machine learning (ie trade-off between bias and variance, training error vs testing error, etc). However, I feel like this course occupied a strange place mathematically where it didn't go deep enough to give me a deep understanding of the theory behind the methods (ie this wasn't a mathematical machine learning class) and yet we still spent a long time going over the mathematical derivations in class.\r\n (but had too many topics to cover any one in depth). The mathematical problems on the problem sets were kept fairly simple (ie one step in a derivation) but didn't really increase my understanding. The midterm was kept much harder/more theoretical and had fairly low grades overall (average a 47 out of 70) as we hadn't gone deeply enough in class or in the problem sets into the theory to get a true understanding. As for the problem sets, they were helpful in practical terms (ie getting acquainted with machine learning packages in R) yet we never discussed that coding in class (the class would be really hard for someone who hadn't coded in R before and relied on independently reading documentation on packages). So I would recommend this class further examining what it is (ie whether theoretical or applied) as currently it tries to do both but doesn't do either as well as they could. I also did find that while Derek was a really nice professor, his explanations were kind of difficult to understand and that he didn't have as many examples as he could have (ie he got halfway through an example in class, never finished it, and then the topic appeared on the midterm). His hints during office hours could also be slightly challenging to understand, and grading on problem sets was fairly slow (ie it took around a month to get the final two problem sets back). So I think the course could definitely have been better organized to maximize student understanding. ",
            "\u00a0The psets were challenging but interesting and I think more interactive coding in class or more interactive examples would have been helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is in the problem sets - they are doable and teach you a lot about the methods being used. The weakness of the course is that it is in R. I feel like python would have been more useful and less frustrating. ",
            "\u00a0strength: homework assignments are customized for the purpose of practicing, which is helpful.\r\nweakness: the syllabus said the there would be an assignment every 10 days, however, it's actually 8 days. As one assignment in, the next one just comes out, which is too intensive for students like me who don't only need to take many courses but also have to do independent researches. The lecturer is fine, but the slides provided to the students are very confusing, making the content hard to understand. Actually, the ideas we've learned shouldn't be very challenging because every time I had a problem, I just turned to the book \"Introduction to statistical learning\" and got a very good understanding. However, the book doesn't cover all the things we talked in the class, which means for quite much of the time, we could only rely on the slides, and got very confused. This was not necessary and was a waste of time. Please make sure that the students are always provided with some good materials after class because the lectures are not enough and the slides are only setting up obstacles to understanding what we are learning. And the result is spending a lot of unnecessary time on pointless exploration. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures difficult to understand, could walk through more simple overview before diving into the complicated theory. Overall, well taught and good course though. Python psets would definitely be a plus. ",
            "\u00a0Strength is amount of HW, weakness is that professor is not really capable of teaching and time management ",
            "\u00a0The course was, in general, not that well organized or taught. Because of the broad range of topics covered, it felt like we didn't ever get to a full explanation of anything. Since the problem sets were mostly about implementing a machine learning topic, the class material wasn't that necessary to doing the problem sets. The exams/quizes were very challenging and well written, but I wish the course had just followed a traditional structure: 1 or 2 midterms and a final exam. Instead, there was a single exam placed like 3 weeks before the end of the semester. This meant that we didn't need to learn the class material after the exams. Because of the difficulty in trying to do both the math and the implementation, I felt that we didn't really accomplish either very effectively. Maybe splitting the class into a concepts/math course and a implementation course would be better for accomplishing the two goals. ",
            "\u00a0The topics are very interesting and relevant today. It would help if we stuck to the schedule, rather than us having to keep wondering when the psets would be released and due (since after the second pset, the dates would always be pushed back), and so that we can cover all the material including the last pset. Also would really appreciate having the deeper math/derivations uploaded rather than only writing on the board, to help us focus on understanding during class and reviewing after class ",
            "\u00a0Work load is higher than normal, but Derek is a great instructor and he makes the class very interesting ",
            "\u00a0The course was very helpful to learn through lecture and R and have TAs and the professor to learn. The strengths are the extra notes and slides to expand on earlier skills required to catch up for the course. Then the course does a great job of crawl walk run with handling and analyzing data. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I liked the problem sets they were difficult and time-consuming, but I felt like I learned a lot from them. Lots of help hours offered from the TA and ULAs, which were super helpful.\r\nWeaknesses: I would've liked spending more time on the stuff in the second half of the course (text analysis) and to actually spend time with neural networks. It also would've been nice to incorporate using Python in the class (since that seems to be more of the industry standard) rather than exclusively using R. ",
            "\u00a0If you religiously do all the readings and go to class, you will become more familiar with various standard Machine Learning techniques which are a jumping point for the more state-of-the-art techniques in use in industry/academia today. The problem sets are well designed and feature a nice mix of theory and practical implementations of the ideas we learnt in class.\r\n\r\nI felt that the lectures and accompanying slides were insufficient in helping me understand the concepts covered. I often had to reach back to the text book (which is excellent), but it did not cover any of the material we learnt in the second half of the course. It would be nice if we were assigned a text book that covered these concepts, or received handouts that more intuitively explained the things we learnt in class.  It would also be nice if we had a problem set on neural networks, since we only went through it in class. Lastly, as CS major I would prefer if the problem sets had been in Python rather than R, since that seems to be more widely used in industry. ",
            "\u00a0The course has great problem sets that really force you to understand what is going on and how to apply the theories you've learned. Professor Feng's lectures lacked conviction and often wandered, making them difficult to follow. "

On the one hand, it's interesting and important content, and there aren't many other machine learning classes at Yale. On the other hand, I found Derek to be a confusing lecturer, the course to be slightly disorganized, and that we spent time on the theory but went over it too quickly for me to say that I personally have a deep theoretical/conceptual understanding of any of these methods. I'm hoping that splitting this course into S&DS 355 and S&DS 365 next year helps to resolve some of those issues though (ie and that S&DS 355 goes over more of the details of the coding implementation while 365 slows down with the theory to the point where it's actually more understandable). However, you should be careful when shopping courses to ensure that is the case. ",

If you're like me, definitely take it if you are interested in statistical techniques and are willing to put in the work. I daresay almost 50% of the class ended up taking it Credit/D because the grades on the first quiz were brutal, but grading on the whole was pretty fair.\r\n\r\nIf you already have a significant stats background and experience programming in R, then the workload will be much lighter, though that also means you can delve deeper into the techniques we learn in class.
