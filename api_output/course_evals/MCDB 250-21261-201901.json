            "\u00a0Strengths: the exams were fair, the review sessions were helpful, the professors/TAs listened to use when we said we wanted to use Piazza to ask questions\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: because there were so many lecturers (almost every class session has a different one), I felt like it was a little disjointed. I think the professors need to communicate with each other more because sometimes they kept repeating the same things over and over again or they didn't know how much we'd learned and had to keep asking us \"have you learned this?\" ",
            "\u00a0Just a truly great course. The exams can be a little tricky so study really hard for them but other than that theres no work for the class. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the material was interesting. I also liked how every lecture was from a different professor, as it allowed for more diverse teaching backgrounds and information. ",
            "\u00a0It was clear that many profs didnt update the slides from years past. In many cases, this was especially egregious (demographic data only from 2008, for example)\r\n\r\nThere was a highly variable instructor quality. The first test was also pretty hard considering that some of the professors didnt do as good of a job. also, some professors got to ask more questions on exams per lecture, which felt unfair.\r\n\r\nI thought it was ridiculous that we had to attend an extra section if we were an MCDB major. #1, this was not on the syllabus, which was an absurd oversight. #2, how did we get the same credit for putting in a lot more work? #3, the times were incredibly inconvenient (7pm on Monday and Tuesday) and there was no variability, so a lot of us had to miss senior events and things like that because of poor planning. ",
            "\u00a0The tests were pretty challenging and often required knowledge of very nit picky details. It would be nice to have some other assignments to factor into your grade as opposed to just three big exams. I did appreciate the exams being non-cumulative but they were still pretty difficult. I also liked having a new lecturer every class and most of them were pretty good. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: many interesting lectures accessible to people from a variety of backgrounds (biology, public health, non-STEM). Professors who specialize in the particular topic of the day give the lectures. I liked that lessons were applicable to everyday life.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some of the guest instructors were not good lecturers. I understand the desire to have speakers who are (in many cases) very well known for their contributions to a particular topic, but if they can't put together a presentation that is suitable for undergraduates new to the field, I'd rather have a different teacher explain the material to us. Additionally, after the first exam, it seemed that biology took a backseat in the course--I think a greater emphasis on mechanisms would be helpful. Moreover, exams were multiple choice, which I didn't feel really tested student knowledge in-depth. It would be nice to have TAs for the course who actually specialize in reproductive biology instead of those who work in other areas of biology who may not know this course's material as well. ",
            "\u00a0great material, difference in quality between lecturers, some redundancy ",
            "\u00a0I liked having different lecturers, but it was challenging to adjust to a new teaching style three times a week. Some of the lecturers were more interesting than others. ",
            "\u00a0I think that overall the lecturing format with new teachers each time lecturing on their subject of interest was great. I do think that some of the professors were much weaker than others. The HPA and Sexual response lectures were particularly weak. \r\nI thought that the subject matter was fascinating. ",
            "\u00a0A strength is that the content was extremely interesting, and it was nice to have some themes (e.g. cycle of estrogen/progesterone in women) to come back to throughout the course. A weakness is that some professors didn't seem prepared or weren't the clearest lecturersit would be a good idea to have student feedback at the end of the course for this aspect to modify the speaker list slightly from year to year. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Outside of (three) midterms, absolutely zero work. Enjoyable and digestible material overall. Some professors were great. Weaknesses: Some professors were really not great. Midterms were very petty - you were expected to memorise every last detail of the most obscure slides. Biggest weakness were the TAs, they were really useless and lead the most pointless review sessions. Absolutely no indication of how the class is graded also (which is worrisome given that the averages are generally fairly high). ",
            "\u00a0It was very disorganized. There was no common thread between lectures with a lot of detailed excess information that made it hard to parse through what was relevant and not. The discussion section, although interesting, provided did not help to reinforce the key concepts in class. Instead of reviewing papers, an overview of the weekly information would be much more helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Having the course taught by many different lecturers was at times great, but overall inconsistent and left me feeling unsatisfied. ",
            "\u00a0This course needs to be improved. It is very incoherent, and the lectures are not linked together well at all, since they are ALL taught by guest lecturers. There are literally no tools given for you to succeed. The TAs in the class also have no idea what they are doing. Overall a very poorly organized and taught course. ",
            "\u00a0I felt that the number of professors, while engaging, made it difficult to have consistent conversations particularly around gender and sexuality - at times, the language lecturers used felt transphobic and alienating. ",
            "\u00a0I found it difficult to have so many different lecturers, many of whom seemed to be presenting on slide shows and materials that they themselves had not prepared, and therefore were not as effective as teaching to others. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: very disorganized, lecturers varied in quality, very hard to predict how to study for exams because the questions are compiled by so many different people\r\nStrengths: only three exams/chill class ",
            "\u00a0This course is extremely relevant and super engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: There were some really great lecturers that outweighed the bad ones that we had. Also, I think the exams were relatively fair. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Requiring sections for MCDB majors is a weakness of this course because the engagement with the material really varies across the class and because people had to manage both studying for the midterm and reading extra papers during midterm weeks, this placed added stress on students. Often times, discussion lagged in section because the papers and sometimes the TA was not engaged in the material. ",
            "\u00a0Terribly disjointed lectures, a different faculty member for almost every lecture, a lot of overlapping repetitive material, half of the faculty seem to have no bearing on public speaking and lecturing whatsoever. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is that there is no work outside of the three midterms, so it's a relatively stress-free STEM class with really interesting content. The course could be improved by having more consistency across guest speakers (a lot of material was repeated), and by having practice exams/review terms available. Some of the questions on the test were also poorly worded and were not clearly taught in the lecture. For a class in which your grade is entirely based on how you do on three midterms, this can be really frustrating. ",
            "\u00a0Ensure that all the speakers have current slides uploaded before class. Try to encourage the professors to include more information on the slides rather than just speaking everything to the class. It can be hard for students to keep up and retain all the information. Also, be more forthcoming about how grading works and how the class works in general. ",
            "\u00a0strength: interesting and informative topics, learning about yourself, having experts in different fields \r\nweakness: lack of uniformity across lectures (due to different teaching styles) ",
            "\u00a0One weakness is that, at times, it seemed as though the lectures were not well-coordinated with each other and covered overlapping material in different ways. One strength is that it was interesting getting perspectives from various different lecturers. ",
            "\u00a0The content itself was fascinating but there was high variability in the quality of lecturer. Some lectures were fabulous (ex: Professor Kankel) and others were disorganized and unfocused (ex: Professor Ratner). This made it hard to engage with the material each day. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this was a great course! I loved hearing different lecturers speak in their areas of expertise. Overall this was a ton of fun, and I learned a lot! ",
            "\u00a0I think the strength of this class is that the powerpoints are uploaded to canvas, but I think there is an issue with tag teaming to teach the class. Way too much material gets crammed into 1 lecture day and in to the entire semester, there is little time to be engaged and ask questions, and not all the professors are equally good at teaching. ",
            "\u00a0The professors teaching the different lectures do not coordinate, so there is a lot of overlap of material and not a good understanding of what the students have already been taught. ",
            "\u00a0Difficult to take notes because you have to deal with a different lecturer every class. At the same time, it's nice to learn from people who have devoted their lives to the focused area that they teach in their specific lecture. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed that some of the lecturers incorporated clinical relevance to the biology that we were learning.\r\nOne weakness was that I felt that the midterms emphasized concepts that, while they were on the slides, were less heavily emphasized by the lecturers. Additionally, in the beginning  of the semester, it was difficult to follow along at times because we had different lecturers every class, but I thought that as lectures progressed, it was easier to piece together the concepts we were learning from previous lectures. ",
            "\u00a0I think that there was a bit of dissonance given that nearly each lecture was taught by someone else. One strength was that the topics did connect but the various lecturers weren't aware of what others already taught us, which made it redundant at times. ",
            "\u00a0Strength - multiple professors who were genuinely passionate about the specific topics they were teaching, nice TAs\r\nWeakness - a lot of information and it wasn't that clear what we needed to know for the tests ",
            "\u00a0I like that there are several professors for the class but I think that sections can be handled a little more effectively. While I appreciate the book club style section, I think we would have benefitted from a section where we went over the material from class. ",
            "\u00a0I didn't like that there were different lecturers. ",
            "\u00a0I think it was nice that some lecturers re-emphasized central components of the course that had already been taught, but there could have been more continuity/organization among the various lecturers. ",

            "\u00a0The course covers a lot of interesting topics. One weakness would be that it can be a bit repetitive at times. Also, there is a mandatory section for majors, but the information in the papers isn't specifically on tests in a detailed manner so it just felt like a waste of time. "

It was disorganized, the exams questions were arbitrary, important concepts were not represented on the multiple choice exams, and it wasn't clear how to best study for the exams.
