            "\u00a0I learned how multidimensional Unamuno was as an author, politician, poet, philosopher and so many other roles. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a huge amount about Miguel de Unamuno, who I knew literally nothing about before. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I thought this class gave me some really critical tools as far as what it means to connect an individual to the work that they've done. Learning about Miguel de Unamuno as a person and seeing the parallels between him and the myriad of works that he did was really intriguing. The engagement was fantastic, allowing my spanish speaking skills to improve, as well as my writing. Furthermore, I feel like I know more about Spain, Spanish literature and its trends, and above analyzing various types of literature- from plays to poems to novels. ",
            "\u00a0This is a fabulous Spanish class for developing all four language skills--speaking, listening, reading, and writing. You read two full-length novels, a short play, poetry, and a number of primary and secondary sources, then have extensive discussions about them in class. I learned SO much about Unamuno and his work! He is an entirely fascinating author and has so many interesting novels and books of poetry that I'm sure it's difficult to even pick what will be in this class. While the reading may be challenging at first for people who haven't read novels in Spanish before, you definitely improve a whole lot over the course of the semester. Professor Harkema is also one of the few professors in the Spanish department who actually runs her lit classes like a seminar, so there's an expectation of participation which allows everyone to really practice their speaking skills. Great way to develop/keep up your Spanish! ",
            "\u00a0Great analysis of Unamuno's works with reference to historical and personal life context ",
            "\u00a0This was the first course I have taken that has focused on a single individual. I found it an interesting way of thinking and analyzing contributions. Also for the first time I conducted research and wrote papers in a foreign language. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the small class size and diversity of assignments--it kept the class entertaining and engaging in a variety of different ways. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this course and its classroom style. It was nice to have a real seminar experience with a Spanish course since they tend towards lectures. It really was an amazing course. Funnily, I think this is the rare case of a course where I loved everything about it, except what we were actually learning. By the end I was a little meh on Unamuno, but obviously when a course is devoted to one person that's a risk. One suggestion would be, I would have loved to have read one more of his novels maybe as a substitute for some of the ending news coverage of him (the last few weeks felt a little bit like an epilogue for the rest of the course). ",
            "\u00a0I don't think I can find a weakness in this course. I think we got a very holistic view of Unamuno and were able to learn about him and his work in a multitude of ways. I found each class to be very engaging and insightful, and one where I learned a ton from my classmates. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: We had some really interesting conversations in class. Professor Harkema is extremely knowledgeable about Unamuno and thus had a lot of interesting things to say, but gave the students a ton of time to talk as well. The selection of readings is excellent. There were opportunities to develop every aspect of your Spanish ability. Luis and Prof. Harkema both made themselves very available during the semester if you needed help.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I'm not sure how I felt about the class presentations--I think they would be better if they were based on research as opposed to a single article. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting readings, good engagement in class time, workload efficiently spread out\r\nWeaknesse: NONE ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - exceptionally well organized. Looking at Unamuno through his \"faces\" was very helpful for me to think about and form opinions of this person I really had no exposure to before. Discussions and papers were stimulating and exposed me to ideas I would otherwise never have come across.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses/improvements - can't think of much! As others brought up, it may be helpful to include some more perspectives critical of Unamuno. "

        [
            "\u00a0I would strongly recommend this class! I came in having only ever read \"San Manuel Bueno, martir\" (which I loved) and learned to love Unamuno's work even more afterwards. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course as a great academic course, while also warning that it might be a good idea to make sure you really love Unamuno first. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you have a background in Spanish literature, want to improve your reading comprehension and speaking skills, and like learning about things within a historical and cultural context, this is the class for you! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Unamuno is a wonderful author and it's really worth delving into his work. Beyond that, Prof. Harkema is a great professor and helps everyone develop their Spanish skills. The workload is very reasonable, with two 3-4 page papers, 1 presentation, and a final 10-12 page paper. ",
            "\u00a0YES. Amazing instructor and material. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This is a language course that will teach you much more than just language skills. The material would be interesting even if taught in English, I think, plus you will use/improve your Spanish. "
