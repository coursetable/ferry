However, in other ways, the class did not meet my expectations. I expected more exposure to quantitative analysis, and the basic math we did was not what I had in mind coming into the class. I also expected to have the chance to more explicitly explore the data and information used in the examples given in lectures, but I realize that might be challenging without learning more specifically about the analytical tools.

            "\u00a0The course could have been more cohesive in the order in which the lectures were arranged. ",
            "\u00a0topics are incredibly interesting. But the class felt disorganized and the assignments irrelevant. ",
            "\u00a0Having guest lecturers was a huge strength. However, weaknesses included a general lack of organization, poor TF staff (assignments didn't use proper grammar and changed assignment requirements shortly before the deadline), professors were not good at lecturing and teaching the course material, and the final assignment was poorly constructed (not being able to get data from clients and having only 6 weeks to complete the assignment resulted in a superficial end product). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: solid lineup of guest speakers. Robert Klee in particular provided a great (and highly engaging) example of how industrial ecology can be applied in professional practice.  \r\nThe majority of classes were dry and theoretical, and would benefit from pulling in case studies, policy memos, or other methods (eg. small group discussions) for engaging actively in the material. Term projects could have been a chance to do this, but started too late to be maximally meaningful. ",
            "\u00a0The course provided a good overview of the challenges inherent in industrial ecology and the role it can play in helping us understand environmental problems and identifying potential solutions. However, there were a number of things that were frustrating in the class. Many of the lectures felt extremely abstract and high-level, so at times it was difficult to really grasp what the point of the lecture was and to understand the examples. I also felt that the assignments were not a great reflection of the concepts in class and, for the most part, did not feel demanding enough for a graduate-level course. I think if the assignments involved more examples and asked us to explore the issues in more detail, it would have helped us better understand the concepts. The coffee LCA assignment was a good assignment, but I was surprised that several of the others were so minimal because they didn't seem to provide much reinforcement of the class concepts. The group project that I was involved also seemed not as thoroughly conceived as it could have been. The organization we worked with did not seem like they had a good idea of what they wanted us to do and did not end up providing much information. We were forced to take the project in a different and ultimately less interesting direction than the initial project scope had been outlined. In terms of the debates, I thought the topics were all interesting, but the structure of the debates made them almost always devolve into an argument that more often than not was uncomfortable to watch and participate it (especially during the Q&A section). I wonder if there's a better way to structure them to make them more organized, productive and genial? ",
            "\u00a0The course effectively provides a broad overview of many topics in industrial ecology. There were many guest lecturers, which added variety to the class and invited in more perspectives. Additionally, there were in-class debates about different policy issues that relate to industrial ecology, which were informative as well. The main area where the course could be improved was in the group project component, which took up about half of the class time. First of all, the projects could have been introduced earlier in the course to allow for more time. Second, each project should have been vetted to identify whether or not the client would be able to provide adequate data to allow students to actually apply industrial ecology tools, rather than have to make broad estimations and remain in the theoretical realm. ",
            "\u00a0S: Guest speakers. All the guests were amazing and super interesting\r\nW:  the topics were covered very superficially and was hard to digest the concepts. ",
            "\u00a0I though that it was a good overview of the field which appeals to a wide audience. For those of us with a background in the sciences, it did not fell thorough and did not give a firm understanding of technique and method around some of the analytical tools such as material flow analysis. ",
            "\u00a0Weakness: The homework was simultaneously not challenging (MFAs) or not reflective of anything learned in class (critical reading review and debates). The only homework that was appropriate was the LCA assessment which took time, but required the students to read the document. The final project had little guidance on how to work as a team and what the expected deliverables were. The companies were poorly vetted for their ability to provide useful data - so the expectation on both the corporate and student end seemed mismatched. I try to gage the expected level of output by the instructions given, previous grading rigor and the time given to perform the assignment. The time given to this assignment was very long, but lacked everything else which would have indicated that they expected any original work. \r\n\r\nWho came up with the debates? Why were we graded on presentation skills when they weren't taught in class. While a noble cause, why is memorizing a dynamic speech important for industrial ecology? \r\n\r\nWhy did we have to do a critical reading review? What was the point of that and how does it relate to industrial ecology? No mention of this and we had to do it really early on in the course when we hadn't really read too much about the topic to develop our own opinions on the topic.\r\n\r\nFinal Project: This was embarrassing to do with my team. We were not prepared to deal with a client and manage expectations. After the poor engagement with the class my teammates were brainwashed into thinking there were like zero expectations for them for the project. I hope they are right given the produce we had to collectively turn in. I'm blaming this on the class rather than my teammates because I don't want to think that FES accepted a bunch of academic loafs and regurgitates. I think this is what this class does to people. The expectations all over this class were completely mismatched. ",
            "\u00a0the Class was interesting but if the department wants to retain students it should make the intro class a bit more engaging, lectures less randomized and introduce the group project earlier in the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are lots of good lecturers, some of whom are the pioneers in the field. Biggest weakness was that there was no clear head of the class. I imagine Marion was this last year, and organization of the class suffered this year from a lack of clear leadership. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strength of this class is it offers an opportunity for students to work with an actual client and help them to deal with industrial waste problems. Although it was very time-consuming and stressful, the whole process was very rewarding and I truly learned a lot from it. A weakness of this class is that the lecture is slightly too theoretical that we did not know how to actually incorporate the knowledge in class into our projects. ",
            "\u00a0The most beneficial aspect of the class was the final project, which allowed us to work in teams on practical application of industrial ecology concepts to a real-world situation. However, apart from this, the class consisted of dry lectures and little discussion of required readings or practical applications of industrial ecology concepts. It could be massively improved by inviting more outside speakers to introduce how they handle industrial ecology-related challenges in their careers, and by changing the teaching style to force students into active learning -- e.g. small group discussions, class discussions, interactive modules, etc. "
