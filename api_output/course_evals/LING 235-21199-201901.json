            "\u00a0We talked about OT. So much OT. I was skeptical at first when the syllabus said we'd only be working in OT for a full semester, but OT really just has that much to offer... until the last week of class when you see what all OT can't do...\r\nWe also got to make a novel OT analysis for an alternation and language of our choice. "

What happened in grad group is a mystery to the undergrad, kinda wish I knew what was going on sometimes but I guessed I never asked either. I suppose it didn't affect me in the end. "
