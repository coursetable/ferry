            "\u00a0I learned about how to think critically and engage with political protest theory, which was really cool. I was also pushed much more towards trying to evaluate things in a polisci framework, which I hadn't been familiar with before. ",
            "\u00a0One thing in particular that I have particularly learned with interest is the rate of success of non-violent actions, as well as determining the factors that lead to non-violent actions success or failures. The course has provided me a greater scope of insights on political protests with the large part of class discussion and lecture on non-violence that are able to help me understand a cause-effect relationship in nonviolent movements. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: really thoughtfully organized and structured! Lots of cool information that was well-delivered. Really great analysis and really thoughtfully taught.\r\nWeaknesses: the powerpoints could be a little dry. The discussion sometimes got out of hand--I think the professor could more often cut in and steer the conversation back to the topic/ask people who didn't speak as much to speak.\r\nImprovements: maybe more small group activities? Or leaving the classroom more for activities. We got kind of stir-crazy, I think. ",
            "\u00a0While it may not particularly spark as a concern for most students, some terms during lectures are hard for me to understand, even with a definition provided. It could be that I have not have as much experience with political science and/or law as others within the course, but it would be great if some terms and/or diagrams can be explained in more detail, such as providing an example on how to use them. I also definitely dont mind in class debates, but sometimes if they were to be getting out of hands, I would appreciate to move on and save the topic for either at break or after the course has ended.

            "\u00a0Definitely! Professor Hierro is a phenomenal professor and person. As long as you're willing to put in the work and contribute in class, you'll get a lot out of it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it to political science majors or people who wish to proceed in this path, as I feel like this course teaches some of the most fundamental but also interesting aspects of political science, that is to understand the logics and effects of political protests, and how a protest can be successful, etc. However, given some readings and lectures (e.g. Theory of Protests) being rather technical, while I would definitely still recommend the course to students that have experiences with technical readings and lectures, some students (e.g. many highschool students) I wouldnt recommend them to attend, as there are perhaps less to learn for them.
