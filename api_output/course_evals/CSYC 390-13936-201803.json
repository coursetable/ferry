            "\u00a0I learnt a lot about the processes regulating sleep and the amount of variation in these processes between different people. The \"mystery\" surrounding so many elements of sleep such as dreaming has led to a huge number of interesting theories about the role and processes of different sleep stages. It is fascinating how many different sleep disorders there are and how contemporary doctors and policy makers are only beginning to understand the importance of sleep. I now know how much sleep I need and when I should be going to bed and waking up. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about science and culture of sleep. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of the material reenforced what I already knew about sleep (i.e. that it's important and that not sleeping is a bad idea), but I can now articulate the specific mechanics of sleep and give examples (in the lab and in real life) that prove the dangers of sleep deprivation. I also learned about different kinds of sleep disorders and strategies to improve my own sleep health. ",
            "\u00a0BY FAR ONE OF MY FAVORITE CLASSES I'VE EVER TAKEN AT YALE- learned so much about the brain and our body and the underlying factors  that lead to our sleep patterns and other global health issues. ",
            "\u00a0Learned so much about sleep ",
            "\u00a0The science behind sleep and how to create a healthier sleep schedule ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the science behind sleep and it made me consider my own sleep habits at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0\"The Mystery of Sleep\" was an incredibly rich educational experience. I learned a tremendous amount from the coursenot only about sleep science and sleep health, but also about the way scientific knowledge is produced. Our weekly exploration of scientific papers and journal articles gave me a newfound appreciation of the development of sleep science, the key moments in sleep research, and the art of scientific inquiry itself (i.e. study designs, research limitations, etc.); I was excited to learn how much our understanding of sleep has improved over the past few decades, but also how much is left to be uncovered. Through our essay assignments, I also gained experience in communicating scientific principles/research through writing--an undervalued, but important skill.\r\n\r\nMy favorite topics from the semester include: sleep in philosophy, art, and literature, the acute and chronic effects of sleep deprivation, sleep and dreams, sleep disorders, and sleep and public health. ",
            "\u00a0Insight into the importance of sleep in cognition and mental health: will definitely apply this knowledge in daily life and future as college student. Extremely important lessons learned, and recommend sleep hygiene studies to all students. Also learned about diagnosing sleep disorders such as insomnia and narcolepsy. Read scientific papers. ",
            "\u00a0This course was an awesome introduction to sleep science, and a great blend of both the more technical elements of the discipline as well as the political/social/cultural aspects. You therefore learn to view sleep from both a scientific lens, but also from the perspectives of art, literature, politics, and public health. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much from this class, and I realized just how much there is to know and incorporate into our culture about proper sleep hygiene! We honestly do not talk about sleep enough, and I keep telling all of my friends and family back home that I think this is one of the best classes I have ever taken just because it is so applicable to my life (and to everyones lives really). ",
            "\u00a0Excellent professor, deeply caring, ensures students get the material "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The course provides accessible information about sleep but could be made less repetitive in the material covered. The same information was covered across multiple class meetings. Student presentations were largely unnecessary, as the same information was covered in lecture by the professors. Perhaps different information could be covered by the assigned student discussions. ",
            "\u00a0It's an excellent course, very interesting and very approachable for a non-science major. Perhaps we could be given a more academic paper topic than \"Write something creative\" - it was a fun assignment but also I think it would be fun trying to address a scientific issue surrounding sleep from the research we've done. ",
            "\u00a0The professors were amazing, the class was extremely engaging, and I loved the setup (professor lecture followed by student presentation). It was a great chance to be creative on papers and project. I do not see how it could improve, I really liked it how it was. ",
            "\u00a0This course was interesting especially the field trip that we took to the sleep lab! I do wish that we had spent more time in class having discussions rather than just listening to lecture style material though. ",
            "\u00a0I feel like this course should be a lecture. The vast majority of class time was spent listening to a speaker presenting anyway, with only a few minutes spent on Q&A (\"discussion\"). The class was oversubscribed and extremely difficult to get into, yet I don't see much reason to keep it a seminar when so many more people could benefit from the curriculum. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- incredibly engaging professors, and content, guest speakers \r\nWeakness- none ",
            "\u00a0This class is great, but learning about sleep once it is dark out is kind of a challenge. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - content\r\nWeakness - structure, exams ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very interesting, loved the idea of a science seminar, and the teaching was great. \r\nWeaknesses: no clear feedback to know how to do better (mostly on essays), no description of what they want for assignments, tests harder than what I felt prepared for. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n-I thought the itinerary was well-structured and that the scientific papers were effectively incorporated into the course \r\n-I really liked the mix of assignments (2 exams, 2 papers, 1 class presentation, and 1 final project). Combined, the assignments allowed us to explore different aspects of sleep science and pursue the sleep-related topics we were most interested in.\r\n-I particularly enjoyed the creative final assignment; I had a lot of fun with the research & presentation. I was also super impressed with the projects of my classmates.\r\n-The guest lectures and trip to the Yale Sleep Clinic were both highlights.\r\n\r\nSuggestions for Improvement (very few):\r\n-I wish there had been more of an opportutniy to build a sense of class camaraderie. Perhaps we could have had a class dinner and/or similar community-building events. Other seminars I've been a part of have organized such gatherings, and to positive effect.\r\n-Perhaps this is my bias as a history major, but I would have loved to know more about the historical trajectory of sleep science research (including the major scientists, key discoveries, etc.). While some of this information was communicated in different lectures throughout the semester, it would have been neat to have a lecture that presents a wholistic narrative of the development of the sleep science field. Something worth considering for future iterations of the course. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very interesting and applicable. The visit to the sleep lab and the hands on examination of polysomnography was great! The breadth of the course was great encompassing sleep in art and literature as well as scientific understanding of sleep and dreams.\r\nCould be improved with more hands-on visits/ experiments including personal sleep diaries. I appreciated the encouragement of creative projects. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were fascinating, organized, and well-delivered. I thought the student presentations were also an excellent way to facilitate student engagement. I do not have many suggestions as to how the course could be improved; I really thought it was superbly executed. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the structure of the class where the lecture would be first and then the student discussion. It made me very engaged for the long class period, and there were many times we ran out of time, rather than the other way around! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- Accessible material, engaging lectures \r\nWeaknesses- Perhaps getting more student engagement "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0As a non-science major, I loved this class. Not only has sleep been something that has always greatly interested me, but it was fantastic to learn about it in a small seminar environment and to discover some of the bizarre processes that go on in our brains! It is a very manageable class - but you get out what you put in, and the readings do give some very interesting insight into sleep. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I loved this class, and it was so engaging. It was a great atmosphere and set up to learn about sleep. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, a good science credit for non science majors too. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. As a humanities person, It was nice to be able to fulfill an SC requirement with a class I could apply to my everyday life. The subject matter was interesting, and though I found the readings to be tedious at times, they were, for the most part, accessible to someone from a non-STEM background. ",
            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY- a great science credit that will keep you engaged and excited to learn every semester. ",
            "\u00a0YES ",
            "\u00a0If you need a science credit, otherwise I would not recommend it ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was very interesting! I would just suggest to meet with the professors outside of class about assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would highly recommend the Mystery of Sleep to another student. It was a terrific course, particularly for humanities majors on the hunt for a science credit. The lectures were clear and engaging, the readings were interesting, and the workload (2 short papers, 2 quizzes, 1 class presentation, and 1 final project) was manageable. In addition, Professors Kryger and Baddam are both excellent instructors and warm, genuine human beings. They are really dedicated to the course and to all of the students. I not only learned a tremendous amount about sleep science, but also gained a newfound appreciation for the importance of sleep to our health and happiness. My sleep habits improved markedly over the course of the semester, which I look forward to maintaining in the decades ahead. In sum, an excellent course. Highly, highly recommended. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. An excellent way to learn about the science of sleep, especially if not familiar with scientific analysis and study. ",
            "\u00a0Fascinating foray into the science, politics, and social implications of sleep health. Absolutely recommend. Professors Kryger and Baddam are phenomenal: always willing to provide feedback and advice, and extremely dedicated to their students and the course material. Sleep science is also an enthralling subject in itself; I was particularly absorbed by the public health implications of sleep, as sleep is too often framed as an individual endeavor, rather than a society-wide one. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I think everyone should take this course. Especially students since all of us were so sleep-deprived in high school and then being in any high-stress environment can also impede on your sleep quality/quantity. Opening up more opportunities to have conversations about the priority of sleep and how its absence has real socioeconomic consequences might make us as a society more apt later in life to build an environment that promotes better sleep quality for everyone. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially if you need a science credit! "
