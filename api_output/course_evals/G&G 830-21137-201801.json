            "\u00a0This course allowed me to develop a practical knowledge of the uses of isotopes in geological sciences.  This course also allowed me to understand the best ways to read and discuss scientific papers. ",
            "\u00a0This course was exactly what I wanted and provided me with a great overview of the major topics of paleoclimate studies and how isotopes are used to study them. I feel like we got to cover a good breadth of events while also getting to delve deep into each one, learning a lot about them. This was a major strength of the course - Alan was very good at choosing papers that gave us a good picture of what the big questions are in the field and what the procedures or techniques are for addressing them. I think I gained good knowledge both of isotope systems and paleoclimate events, but I also really appreciated all the practice I got at reading dense scientific papers and trying to distill them down to their most important points; I think reading scientific literature has become easier for me as a result of taking this course, which is great and a very helpful outcome of this class.

            "\u00a0The best part of the course is Prof. Rooney.  He is clearly an expert in the material he teaches and his ability to convey this knowledge made the class enjoyable and informative.  He chose papers which reflected current lines of scientific inquiry and were of interest to the group of students.  The class depended very much on his ability to lead a discussion on the paper topics and he did not disappoint.\r\n\r\nThe class would have been better with perhaps a review session or a class session which would tie to together some of the overarching isotope systems of the semester.  This would have created perhaps more context for the papers we read.  Listing the papers on the syllabus would have been nice.  I would have been able to better allocate time.  So weeks had papers which were really long, while others were short.  Knowing the paper topics further in advance (as opposed to one week) would have allowed me to organize my reading better. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were Alan's knowledge and his knack for picking out good papers. I felt like all of them were very relevant and interesting and good cumulatively at giving us a sense of what the big questions are in this field and how people are addressing them. The papers were also well-selected for being scientifically rigorous and robust without being so dense or advanced as to be inaccessible to us students. I can't think of any big weaknesses to this class - maybe I could say Alan should be more confident and shouldn't be so hard on himself. Just because we're quiet in class doesn't mean we're not enjoying this class or not taking it seriously; and when we do fail to read the papers in time for class or stuff like that, he shouldn't take it personally! That's just normal for students sometimes. It doesn't mean he or his class is bad. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: reading summary and paper discussion in class is very helpful. "

            "\u00a0This course was an excellent exploration of geologic isotopes.  This course requires a background in chemistry and geology.  This is definitely a class where effort and work are reflected in how much you understand the material.  It is a great course if you're prepared to do the readings.  Without doing the readings before the meeting, you would be unable to follow or participate.  The course is taught by the wonderful Alan Rooney, who is an expert isotope chemist and uses the system you learn about in his research.  His expertise drives the class forward and his ability to understand the methods and scientific reasoning of the papers make everything easier to learn and understand.  The course will also have grad students and undergrads (and when they want post-docs will show up).  This shouldn't scare away any undergrads, however.  The students who take this course need a background in the subject, but not an intimate understanding. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely. If you want to know what the major climate events in Earth's past have been, what the major questions are in the field of paleoclimatology, or how people use isotopes to study these things, you will definitely leave this class feeling satisfied in these regards. It is kind of a lot of work to work your way through three scientific papers a week and distill these dense things down into short summaries (usually 30-40 pages a week I'd say); I spent several (definitely >6, often up to 10) hours on this class a week, but I appreciated the practice of reading scientific writing - I genuinely felt like it had become easier for me by the end of the semester. This might be easier though for people with a strong background in geology or chemistry, or if you were a grad student. Regardless, I'm definitely glad I took this class and I would say it was an important class in my geology degree. Definitely glad I took it and would recommend! ",
            "\u00a0This course provides a comprehensive introduction to Earth climate provided that you have some geochemistry or geology background. "
