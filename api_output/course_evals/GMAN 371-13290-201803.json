            "\u00a0Kafka is approachable only insofar as he confuses you and strikes discomfort, if not dread, in your heart. This class had a particular, experimental way of reading Kafka in conversation and in iterations through philosophy and in translation. The class was especially valuable in the focus it gave to writing about the texts of the course. ",
            "\u00a0I found myself engaged with literature in a way in which I hadn't before.  The class to me was about use rather than interpretation -- what can literature do?  Kafka was an obvious and thrilling choice for the task.  The writing was also an exercise which I had not been accustomed to.  Close reading in the sense of teasing out the \"doing\" of the text is a difficult task.  Though, I don't believe I have ever had such a positive space to facilitate that task.  Each step of the writing process felt like another step, another trial to test and prod, seeing what works and what does not.  The space to \"try\" things out in essay-writing is essential; I haven't had that before. ",
            "\u00a0This class allowed me to delve into several of Kafka's key texts, in conjunction with a wide array of philosophers who wrote about him, from Blanchot and Derrida to Deleuze and Guattari. The class armed me with the resources not only to interpret Kafka, who is historically-difficult-to-interpret, but also to see how philosophers engage with him and add to him with their works. This class was a mix between a literature and philosophy class, which allowed us to be more creative with to our approaches of analysis. We also crossed different genres: from film adaptations of Kafka to graphic novels, which encouraged us to think about genre and medium. ",
            "\u00a0Lots of insight into Kafka, his works, and philosophical aspects that can be found within them (eg existentialism, the self, the absurd, etc). Workshop helped teach us how to give better feedback. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Perhaps a clearer agenda by Professor Campe will enable discussion to become more productive sooner in the hour. It tended to be the case that the class discussed some perplexing aspect or a particular interpretation for slightly too long, at the cost of a bigger-picture investigation of Kafka's project or the responding philosopher's or translation's idea.The position papers were a very good shift from traditional canvas posting and comments, for it required a focus attempt by each student to read and think about each other's writing, which was then taken up as serious secondary engagement with the week's text. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very strong in respect to the structure -- the discussions and position papers were a solid ground from which to explicate the texts we had been reading.  I also think the layout of assignments (in general) was well-thought out.  The paper felt like something which had been adequately worked up to and given the time and space to mature.  One of the weaknesses was within that writing process: feedback.  Because it really depended on the amount of time one partner had put in, not to mention prior experience with constructive feedback, the work load was really not always balanced.  I'm not sure how to remedy that because the feedback process was helpful and I think in general is a great thing to do in this kind of an essay-writing class, though maybe there could be more clear guidelines (like there were in the last round) to facilitate the process.  Again, it might just have to do with a disparity in the level of engagement and/or prior experience with the task.  Depending on the group there could be better or worse experiences, so there isn't really a clear or immediate remedy. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Max, our TA, had an approach to our writing that was unique and incredibly helpful. We had multiple writing workshops that allowed us to linger with the writing processes, and that gave our ideas space to move and grow. We also provided each other with peer feedback, which was so helpful and heartwarming, as it gave us the chance to help our peers write their best possible essays, while it also meant we had more feedback to work with. The syllabus was also a strength, I enjoyed the variety of readings we had. To improve: It would have been helpful if we had received our grades throughout the semester, as supposed to just at the end, as this would give us all a better sense of how we were doing, and where exactly our weak or strong spots were. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this was a great course. It was a good mix of philosophy and literature. Another strength was that the readings were always a reasonable amount, which meant that most people had always done them and there were productive discussions. This class was unique because we began developing our final papers quite early in the semester, and we were supported in developing it, so it wasnt something you did by yourself right that the end, which was a great strength of the course. Since we were being graded on a lot of small assignments, it might have been useful to get our grades immediately instead of cumulatively at the end, so that we would know what to work on. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The texts and discussisons for this class were always the highlight of my week. Professor Campe is great and is always happy to listen the everyone's ideas. I never found any of the topics on the syllabus particularly boring so the discussion was always engaging and niteresting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The assignment and gradedistributions were consistently disorganized and confusing. Throughout the semester we only ever got positive feedback from the Professor and TF, so that after classes ended and they uploaded all the assignments on to Canvas at once, I was susprised that I was doing much worse than I thought, as no one had ever given me any feedback or criticisms until then, when it was too late to doing anything about it. \r\n\r\nI imagine that these small but very important issues will probably be fixed for the next iteration of the class, so that it will hopefully be nothing but strengths by then.

            "\u00a0Certainly! It is not entirely about Kafka, and is all the better for it for the sake of Kafka. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend to another student if they are willing to put in the work of thoroughly reading the texts and thinking hard.  If you are not interested in continental philosophy or Kafka, then clearly this would not be the class to take.  But if either of those things are compelling, then this class satisfies a large area of interest which is not covered by most other classes within Yale College. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you're interested to read Kafka in conjunction with a variety of philosophers. This class offers the philosophy major a chance to explore many continental philosophers we don't often read in the philosophy department. The special element of writing workshops also gives this class an extra edge, and would probably help you become a better writer and provider of feedback, which is something many Yale writing classes do not quite emphasize. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend the course to anyone interested in Kafka, or interested learning to to use philosophy to understand literature and the world. ",
