            "\u00a0The course provided an overview of the field of household finance. I learned about important facts and theories about how households make financial decisions and gained valuable insight about avenues for further research in the field. I also learned a lot about conducting empirical economic research. "

            "\u00a0I enjoyed the structure of the course, which involved taking a deep dive into impactful and/or recent papers in household finance each class. This structure was conducive to learning about the theory and empirical facts of the household finance literature. It was also conducive to, more generally, learning about the process of doing empirical economic research, in thinking about the strengths and weakness of the approaches of the various papers that we covered in the course. The assignments (a referee report and a paper comparing different papers with contradictory results to the same question) were also well structured to learn about how to think deeply about empirical work. "

            "\u00a0Yes. Household finance is an important (and growing) field in economics and finance, and the course provides a strong survey of the field and valuable insights into research questions to ask. The course also provided insights into how to do empirical economic research. "
