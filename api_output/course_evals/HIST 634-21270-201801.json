            "\u00a0Thorough treatment of the historiography on key issues in early modern European econ history. Also learned about historical method and best approaches for framing and writing my own work. A really valuable experience. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a huge help in understanding New Institutional Economics. The focus on reading foundational texts was essential, and not something you get in every course (where reading lists are often focused on newer literature). ",
            "\u00a0As someone fairly unfamiliar with economic history, I gained very valuable insights into both past and current discussions in the field, and a very strong grasp of the historiographic material. Because we read texts that were both foundational and contemporary, I learned how  certain ideas persisted or were resurrected in the scholarship. It also helped me think critically about using statistics, graphs, and figures in my own historical work. ",
            "\u00a0I got a very effective introduction to the cutting edge of economic history in this period, a good appreciation of the longer-term trends in historical and sociological thought on it, and some excellent ideas on how to blend intellectual, economic and legal history. ",
            "\u00a0I occasionally rode my bike to this class. Over time, I thought it would be cool to learn to ride without hands. I had tried this as a kid, but fell and knocked out my front teeth on my first attempt (baby teeth, phew). This class gave me the kind of motivation and confidence in my own abilities that I needed to \"get back on the horse,\" or in this case, bike. Now, with the semester behind me, I can ride my bike for long periods as well as make turns without touching the handlebars. I hope to take this new-found self-belief and apply it to every area of my life. ",
            "\u00a0This class was particularly useful to me for several reasons. Prior to enrolment, I was unfamiliar with the literature on early modern European economics. This course allowed me to submerge myself in past and current historical debates treating the economy and society of early modern Europe. Throughout the semester I was able to apply the ideas and texts covered in this course to topics in other courses. The assignments in this class allowed to me work on abilities as a reviewer (of literature, conferences, workshops etc). ",

            "\u00a0This was one of the best courses I have taken in terms of structure and quality of class discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Its strengths are the chronological range of the historiography that we read, the clear and well-structured way in which the influences and intellectual genealogy of the authors was shown, and the clarity with which it was able to tackle theoretical frameworks. If I were to suggest an improvement, it would be to set slightly more authors each week and read them slightly less thoroughly to get a broader sense of the field (though please keep detailed reading of Tonnies and Weber!) ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: All of them \r\nWeaknesses: None. It's rude of you to even ask. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very well organized. The readings provided a comprehensive overview of changes in thought that have occurred in the field and assignments were useful opportunities to develop better writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0course was fantastic - good choice of materials and delivery, nothing to be improved. "

            "\u00a0Yes. Such a comprehensive and helpful reading list, and Francesca is a WONDERFUL professor. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially as a way to expand your interests in an engaging way. ",
            "\u00a0Certainly, especially for anyone wanting to improve their integration of theoretical/conceptual frameworks and empirical work. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, working with Trivellato will make for a growing experience for any student. Given her departure from the department, my recommendation would be rather hollow. In case the topic comes up in conversation in lieu of a recommendation I will be sure to gloat about the fact that I had the opportunity to be in her classroom, while poor \"Another Student\" did not. Sorry \"Another,\" but maybe you shouldn't have padded your schedule with all of those directed reading courses. ",
