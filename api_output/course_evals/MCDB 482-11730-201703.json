            "\u00a0I improved my ability to thoroughly read scientific papers. I increased my knowledge of many cell signaling pathways. And I learned more about NIH grant writing through our final assignment. ",
            "\u00a0I have spent a lot of time working in research labs (the same can be said for pretty much everyone in the class), and this class is extremely helpful to anyone who does research or has to read a scientific paper at any point. We learned how to read papers and think critically about experimental design, and we discussed current topics in various areas of research. I think this class is invaluable to anyone who has worked or will work in a lab. ",
            "\u00a0Signal transduction pathways, of course, but also how to read a scientific paper at a totally new level, how to distinguish between good and bad papers, and how to write a grant. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this class. If you are an MCDB major (or pre-med in general), take this class.\r\n\r\nThis is how the class works: \r\n1. Monday, 3:30pm-5:30pm-ish, 17 Hillhouse\r\n2. From 3:30-3:45pm, some students will go up to the board for 1 min. to talk about an action item. Examples of action items: \"explain what BODIPY dyes are\", \"explain RNA sequencing\", \"tell us how the drug Humira works\" - these talks are supposed to be chill and informative. \r\n3. From 3:45pm-5:00pm, the class will talk about 2 papers. Both papers will focus on that week's pathway (ex. Hedgehog, TNFa, Wnt). Professor Crews will choose named cards from a pile and ask that student to explain a figure.\r\n4. From 5-5:30pm, a student will give an introductory presentation about next week's pathway. \r\n\r\nThis is why you should take this class:  \r\n1. It meets once a week for two hours. \r\n2. The class is usually 10-15 students (mostly seniors, some juniors). Everyone in the class is smart, hard-working, supportive, and friendly. It's a fun environment. \r\n3. You grow SO MUCH as a scientist. You will be amazed by the sharp increase in your ability to read scientific papers, critically analyze the faults in bad experiments, and come up with your own experimental setup.\r\n4. You only read 2 papers a week. Usually it took me 5-8 hours of my weekend to read both papers and take notes on them. During the first few weeks, you will struggle a bit reading some of the papers. By mid-semester, you will see patterns/themes and feel a lot more comfortable. \r\n5. The only big assignments are the presentation and the final grant proposal. The presentation is quite time-consuming, as you must make a comprehensive powerpoint, but it's manageable if you are organized (and you get resources on Canvas like review articles to help you get started). The grant proposal is what you make of it -- it's 13-15 pgs. single-spaced (but Professor Crews gives you past examples to help you get a sense for what he expects). My advice for the grant proposal: search through Nature, Cell, and Science journals under their 'trending topics' or 'current opinions' sections -- or read a paper about the mTOR pathway from 2016/2017 and see if you can find anything about future directions/next steps in the discussion section. Ultimately, the grant proposal can seem overwhelming, but if you can nail down 3-4 specific aims by December 1st, you will be good. The /heart/ of your grant proposal is truly your specific aims, which boils down to experimental set up/design. After you know conceptually what you which experiments you want to do, then you can write the background and preliminary data sections for the assignment. \r\n6. Professor Crews is a great teacher. He's understanding of his students' other commitments (ex. med school interviews, sick, etc.) and fosters an environment of camaraderie. ",
            "\u00a0I  gained practice in the skill of critically reading scientific papers and gaining new scientific insights from primary literature. ",
            "\u00a0Great class that will teach you how to think critically about primary literature and implement what you learned into a grant proposal. Craig is amazing and is always willing to help. Not much I would change about the course at all ",
            "\u00a0This is a course that teaches you how to critically read primary literature by forcing you to actually do it. The knowledge gained about cell biology is also important to the course but is auxiliary to the skills you gain from reading and discussing so many scientific studies. ",
            "\u00a0This class makes you a better scientist. It not only made me more comfortable reading primary literature, but it also encouraged me to think deeply about and even criticize the experiments and data at hand. "

            "\u00a0After many years of teaching the course, Professor Crews has this course turned into everything you would expect from an upper-level biology seminar. Its a great course overall and you learn a ton. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Overall, this is an amazing class. Professor Crews seems to really care about the students, and as a result, he has designed a well-structured and engaging course. The largest strength of this class is its small class size and seminar-style teaching, which enabled us to have in-depth discussions about the papers we were reading. \r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: We went late almost every class, which wasn't a big deal, but it was a bit frustrating if you had somewhere to be after class. ",
            "\u00a0I'm very happy with how the course was run. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing class overall. Would be nice if the professor lectured just a little bit more, especially on the papers. The student-led part may have gone a little too far this time. More feedback on the grants/presentations/in-class responses would have been good, as I really had no idea how I was doing in class and if my responses were actually good. ",
            "\u00a0Actually no weakness. \r\n\r\nAbsolutely take this class. If you are an MCDB major (or pre-med in general), take this class.\r\n\r\nThis is how the class works: \r\n1.

            "\u00a0Weakness: It can seem rushed through some of the papers, and I can't help but to feel that there are more to pull apart in the papers than just figures. Perhaps some of the discussion could be focused on how to write and how not to write parts like introduction, results, and discussion sections.\r\n\r\nStrength: The class did very well on including all members of class in discussion. It also really facilitates learning and developing skills in reading scientific papers. ",
            "\u00a0The course effectively taught participants how to read and engage with research and research methods. Additionally, we learned about the industry and methods by which things have been discovered as well as the techniques that will drive discovery in our own research labs. The class was interesting and well taught and allowed for all to participate. ",
            "\u00a0Great class that will teach you how to think critically about primary literature and implement what you learned into a grant proposal. Craig is amazing and is always willing to help. Not much I would change about the course at all ",
            "\u00a0I think the format of the course logistics works well. I fully endorse the comments we made in the last day of class about strengths of the course and ways it could be improved. ",
            "\u00a0The structure of the class was great. The papers were usually interesting, which made them much more fun to read. Class time itself was also used well; we had enough time to discuss the papers pretty thoroughly and still enough time to hear a presentation at the end. Overall, this was one of my favorite classes I've taken. I wish more STEM classes were taught as seminars because they make you engage with the material differently and require much more critical thought. "

            "\u00a0This is an amazing upper-level elective for MCDB majors. It's engaging and fun, and you really do learn a lot. Specifically, you will become better at reading and criticizing scientific papers. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great class that teaches you to read papers and design experiments, and gives a lot of context to the work that you may be doing in your lab on a daily basis. Definitely take it! (It's especially a great class for seniors I think.) ",
            "\u00a0Great class if you're interested in the material. Be warned that this is among the harder ways to meet your 350+ MCDB req. The 12 page, single-spaced grant is an enormous amount of work, and you won't get a lot of help in class to do it. That said, Crews is simple amazing and knows basically everything there is to know on this topic, along with just being an great person. ",

            "\u00a0It's a great course to learn to read scientific literature. I highly recommend taking it if you intend to get involved in a scientific field (biology primarily but skills can be applied to other fields). ",

            "\u00a0Yes, if you want to learn how to read primary literature well, take the course. You basically read 1 or 2 papers a week and come to seminar ready to discuss them in great detail. As a final project, you write a mock grant, which is a useful exercise in understanding what it takes to write convincing science. It's a phenomenally useful course for anyone interested in going into research, and for anyone that wants to know what a lot of scientific research entails. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend taking MCDB 482. It's a great class and will improve your skills as a scientist. As Professor Crews said during the first class, \"this is the class you've been waiting for.\" "
