            "\u00a0This course made the material very exciting and challenged me to synthesize readings and theory in every class. ",
            "\u00a0This course has expanded the ways in which I study and interact with photographic objects. There is so much knowledge and potential in the study of photographic materials, and I'm excited and feel better prepared to engage with photographs in my future studies. ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge spanning many fields related to photography. Scientific approaches to understanding the materiality of photographs. Epistemological and phenomenological questions related to photography. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the technical aspects of photographs as well as the theoretical. ",
            "\u00a0how to better interrogate photographs, materiality (paper, gloss, texture), bringing together different skills (web design, stats, art history), presentations ",
            "\u00a0I was introduced to an entirely new way of thinking about photographs. My exposure to material history was near-zero, and HSAR 463 allowed me to develop a new vocabulary for looking at and classifying photos. I have a better idea of how race and gender play a role in how photographers choose to photograph.Likewise, this upper-level art history seminar allowed me to engage with high-level theory that was intellectually exciting and cause for my growth as a writer. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think about and analyze photographs from an art historical perspective as well as a conservation perspective.  We approached photography not only as art objects, but as science objects, objects of philosophical thought, and objects that move through and are affected by time.  We thought about and discussed the philosophical questions of photography and its relationship to institutional structures both physical (museums, auction houses) and abstract (race and gender) as well as more historical and visual analysis-based concerns.  We also took field trips to make photograms, talk to artists and curators about their practices, watch master printers at work, and visit the Guggenheim conservation lab. ",
            "\u00a0This course takes something of a unique angle on the history of photography, approaching the medium from the standpoint of material rather than from the standpoint of art or art history. Profs. Bravo and Messier always had provocative questions to ask, and seminar sessions were always stimulating. The course's focus on bringing people from diverse fields in the art world was also refreshing; we had conversations with artists, conservators, art dealers, printers... ",
            "\u00a0I acquired significant knowledge about the process of creating photographs through various techniques, and I gained exposure to the field of material history. Thanks to the feedback on our class assignments, my writing improved, too! ",
            "\u00a0I have a much deepened knowledge of the importance of material support in photography.  We studied papers and various methods of printing through many fun field trips and readings. ",
            "\u00a0This course really pushes you to think about the material aspects of photography, particularly the ways in which the substrate used for a photographic print impacts one's relationship with art. "

            "\u00a0It was great to have both instructors offering their insights into the material. There could have been more of an overview period to get everybody on the same page. Also, it could have only been improved by being maybe a bit smaller. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes it felt there was never enough time to discuss all of the ideas brought up in our readings, but 'tis the nature of the seminar, I guess. The many guest speakers, conversations, and visits to other facilities at Yale (like the PDP and West Campus) were incredible opportunities I would not have had otherwise, and I'm excited to keep exploring these resources. ",
            "\u00a0Incredible syllabus that ranging in diverse topic related to photography. Many relevant guest speakers and field trips to enrich discussion. ",
            "\u00a0The two professor class with the academic professor and the conservator was really amazing, as well as the hands on experience with guest lectures, field trips etc. The only bad thing is the class wasn't long enough! ",
            "\u00a0really great syllabus, great field trips, interesting guests, good class size, good student discussions ",
            "\u00a0This course is excellent for those who are interested in a discussion-based art history or ER&M course. The best part was getting to come to class every week with Paul and Monica, an excellent team of two people who are as friendly as they are insightful. The instructors put a lot of energy into creating a fun and rewarding classroom environment, and the guest lecturers and field trips (with the curator of photography at the Guggenheim, along with several artists) made the class even more engaging.\r\n\r\nI would suggest in the future that, in order to break up the workload throughout the semester and facilitate better classroom engagement, the reading response assignment be changed to 2-3 shorter responses. This way, we will be able to hire a wider range of voices, since people will have completed more of the readings. This wasn't a huge problem, but is something to consider! ",
            "\u00a0This was one of the most amazing classes I've ever taken, at Yale or anywhere else.  I always looked forward to going to class and always left giddy with excitement and inspiration over the things we learned and discussed and questioned.  The readings were carefully selected and fascinating, and the organization of the course touched on so many different questions in such a well-thought-out order.  Both Monica and Paul were extraordinary professors.  They worked together extremely well and together produced a group dynamic that invited thoughtful discussion that never felt overwhelming or unwelcoming.  They were accessible, kind, and willing to field all sorts of questions related and unrelated to the class.  I also loved the design of the class, with weeks of discussion interspersed with field trips and presentations.  The only complaint I have is that the class wasn't longer -- I could have discussed any of the topics we discussed for multiple weeks, not just one.  The assignments were also a lot of fun and asked us to approach the question of photographs as material objects from really interesting and unexpected directions.  Overall, the class made me realize how much there is to think about and explore in the realm of photography, and taking it was by far one of the best decisions I've made in college. ",
            "\u00a0The most rewarding part of the course was the chance to engage with people from diverse fields in the art world. That being said, it would have been pleasant to have a few more \"straight\" seminar sessions focused on understanding the readings for the week and on addressing issues from a more historical standpoint. But the excellent conversations we had with artists and conservators far outweigh the downside of having fewer conventional sessions. ",
            "\u00a0HSAR 463 was a fantastic 400-level art history seminar. I loved how we covered so many disparate topics that all made sense within the context of material history. It was an approachable class for those without any background in photography or material history, and it was equally engaging for those with exposure. Monica and Paul did a great job balancing out lecturing/discussion -- info about Paul's experiences in his field and Monica's work were a great supplement to our discussions. I also loved the amount of visits and guest lectures we got to have -- the trip to the Guggenheim with the curator of photography was my favorite.\r\n\r\nOne suggestion: I think our class discussions could have been more rooted in the readings -- a way to encourage this might be to break up the reading response into 3-4 smaller reading responses in paper or on a discussion forum on Canvas. In my other classes, this has been a good means of keeping people engaged in discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: good topic (material history is quite trendy), lots of field trips, great class discussion, and lots of independence in terms of assignments.  Weaknesses: assignments and expectations for them were too vague. ",
            "\u00a0Close discussion with professors and the guest speakers/field trips were amazing! "

            "\u00a0It was an amazing course rooted in great material with two great instructors. The assignments were genuinely enjoyable and the discussions were very engaging. ",
            "\u00a0MOST DEFINITELY! It's something I now consider so crucial to the study of photography, and was such a well-planned class full of great conversations, insights, and opportunities. ",
            "\u00a0Incredibly engaging course that brought in knowledge from many fields of study. Great pairing of professors that communicated well with students. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing class taught by a great professor and a conservator who really knows his stuff. Really gives you a multi-faceted overview of the history of photography and materiality. Recommended for majors and non-majors of any level! The seminar format really makes everyone feel welcome. ",
            "\u00a0Really interesting class with a great syllabus (field trips, guests), engaging professors, and accessible to students of various levels. ",
            "\u00a0HSAR 463 is a good course for anybody with an interest in photography that wants to dedicate time to exploring a niche subject. The students who get the most out of the course, I think, have some background in photography, though Monica and Paul make it accessible for anybody with an interest in the subject. It is important to think about the readings before class in order to have the best discussion, but Monica and Paul are good facilitators of discussion as is. The classroom environment is extremely enjoyable while also being intellectually rigorous, as many of the best classes at Yale are. ",
            "\u00a0I can't recommend this course enough -- it was absolutely extraordinary.  The class challenges you to think about photographs in a way that you might never have before, as physical objects that are a product not only of the artist who made them but of the technology the artist used.  The discussions and readings are a combination of science, art history, and philosophy.  We talked about everything from what it means to make a collection or archive to the reproducibility and \"aura\" (a la Walter Benjamin) of photographs to color shifts in color photographs of the 1970s to the possibility of color technologies as racist (i.e., calibrated for light skin).  We took field trips where we watched a master printer make a Sugimoto print, saw Robert Mapplethorpe photos in the Guggenheim conservation lab (without matting!  the edges of the photographs are deckled!), talked to artists and curators and Sotheby's former photography chairman, made photograms, and probably more that I'm missing.  Paul and Monica are incredible professors -- they're both so knowledgeable and thoughtful and great at facilitating discussion, and it was fascinating to hear both an art historical and a conservation side to the things we were studying.  If this class is ever offered again, seriously take it -- it was an incredible experience. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This course takes a fascinating and necessary angle on the medium of photography. Profs. Bravo and Messier teach photography in a way that is relevant to artists, art historians, scientists, and engineers... Exploring photography with their guidance is simply a joy. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to anybody looking for a high-level discussion-based class. While it is definitely more HSAR than ERM, Monica and Paul make the course accessible to everybody, and the topic is niche enough for most students to have just a bit of background. Monica and Paul go out of their way to facilitate great discussion and make sure everybody is on the same page. They are a perfect duo. While you'll take away a lot in the way of topics like preservation techniques for chromogenic inkjet vs. chromogenic prints, you'll get even more out of the course when it comes to your writing and understanding of the intricacies of artists' processes. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course! Monica and Paul were so kind, supportive, and fun as professors, and I learned quite a lot from them. We took field trips to famous galleries, a printing studio, and the art conservation lab at Yale's West Campus.  Readings were not too challenging but were thought-provoking.  Class discussion was great, and students were given a lot of agency in both seminar time and in the assignments.  With only two papers total and a few readings each week, the workload was relatively low but the payoff was high. Really fun course, interesting way to approach the topic of photography, and a definite must-take for anyone interested in the medium. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The challenge (and beauty) of this class is that you have to think through all subject matter with a material lens but you'll have two wonderful professors to guide you through it. Monica and Paul have a great dynamic, and it's great to both dig into theory of photography and learn far more than you ever thought you could about (among other things) glossmeters, whether Kodak film is racist, how to detect a fake Lewis Hine print, the preservation imperative vs. a hurricane... ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Not only is the subject matter very interesting, but the activities and trips organized by the Professor Bravo are definitely worthwhile. "
