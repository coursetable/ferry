The extent to which this project was successful is a bit unclear, but I appreciate the flexibility in discussion, for it tolerated and encouraged different ways to think about interpretation and argument.

            "\u00a0The course gave a lot of opportunities for work with short essays and a presentation, as well as a culminating project, which all forced us to consider the texts in different lights. The professor was a little slow with grading, which caused anxiety for students who were considering dropping or Credit/D-ing the class by midterms, but became better as the year went on, and the feedback was very helpful.
