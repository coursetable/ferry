            "\u00a0Alex is a specialist in Islam, so I'm not sure how he ended up being a TF for a course on Early Christianity. I think he did the best he could with the resources he had though. His sections mostly consisted of discussing the readings as all he could really do was just read along with us and help us wrestle with the texts. ",
            "\u00a0Alex was very kind, and he did all the readings well, but because his major field is not Early Christianity/theology he was not always able to respond meaningfully to students' question during sections. ",
            "\u00a0Alexander was fantastic. He was very competent at leading conversation. He allowed the appropriate amount of freedom in exploring the questions of the course without letting us become too sidetracked. ",
            "\u00a0Alex was kind and a good communicator, in class and via email. Section was comfortable, and everyone seemed willing to engage. He was accessible and willing answer questions if I bumped into him outside of class.\r\n\r\nDuring study groups for finals, I learned the other TF had handed out charts to help organize the material. That might have helped, since again, Church Councils, were a bit too much to cram for at the very end. ",
            "\u00a0Very responsive outside of class/section. The discussion sections could have improved as some of the question asking was more leading than discussion starters. ",
            "\u00a0He was kind. Great at keeping the section conversation on topic. Incredibly intelligent. ",
            "\u00a0Had trouble engaging section in discussion\r\nDid not cover all topics as necessary throughout semester ",
            "\u00a0Very good at facilitating conversation ",
            "\u00a0Alex was a wonderful TA. He led thoughtful discussions in an organized fashion. He was very approachable, which was nice, because lecture did not feel like there was any room for disagreement or dialogue. ",
            "\u00a0Alexander did a good job leading discussions in section. His feedback on papers and assignments was helpful and substantial. Great job. ",
            "\u00a0Christopher is well equipped to teach, he is patient, caring and very knowledgeable of the matter. ",
            "\u00a0Christopher saved the class by doing his best to fill in historical and theological context that the lectures clearly lacked. His organization of the readings for the second half of the semester on Canvas was also very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Christopher was extremely helpful in section. He took time to listen to what we were struggling with and helped us comb through some of the finer details of councils, dates, and theologians we needed to remember. He was always really responsive to emails, and willing to meet outside of class hours to go over feedback for papers. ",
            "\u00a0Christopher single-handedly saved this course for me. He was a patient and helpful present and was absolutely excellent at explaining the material that Samuel left out (which was alot). ",
            "\u00a0Christopher was an excellent teaching fellow. It was clear he cared about his students and wanted to do all he could to help. He had a solid grasp of the material and worked hard to answer student questions and to provide clarification in section. He made sure to point us to the main themes of each work and to ensure we had all the materials we needed to be successful on the exam and papers. Christopher was a thoughtful and fair grader, as well. I appreciated that he printed out and hand-graded our essays!\r\n\r\nI would encourage Christopher, however, to make sure that all students have an opportunity to speak in section. At times, louder students could overshadow quieter ones during discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Very knowledgeable about the subjects at hand and unfailingly kind. The information given during section meetings was very helpful in contextualizing (and understanding) the concepts covered through the course. ",
            "\u00a0Christopher is great! He provided a lot of the background we didnt get in class with clarity. Moreover, he was extremely willing to be of help. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Patience and perseverance. He was helpful when we needed some assignment clarification (sometimes) and he tried his best. The most effective teaching moments were when he would put charts or tables on the board to help us \"fit\" all the pieces together, whether council dates or geographic issues etc.\r\n\r\nRoom for Improvement: He was hesitant and lacked confidence at first, and so the section meetings were pretty wobbly. Sometimes a student would ask a question about a text and he'd say \"What do you think?\" It was clear he didn't have an answer, but a better way to handle this is to say, \"I don't know, let's try to figure this out together.\" ",
            "\u00a0Christopher as a great TF. He was attentive, engaging, and careful to prepare his students for assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Great control of the classroom, very informative. Christopher helped us to make sense of the readings that we did and created an environment that lent itself to good discussions. I've appreciated his feedback on my assignments as well. ",
            "\u00a0Christopher's historical inclinations were a great compliment to Samuel's philosophical ones (although inevitably, both do both). Christopher, for instance, would often recap the course with regards to dates, councils, geography, which were helpful to have in light of Samuel's more analytical approaches. This was a big strength of the course overall: bringing historical and philosophical perspectives to bear on the topic of ancient Christianity. \r\n\r\nChristopher is very available to the students of his section. He responded to all of my questions via email thoroughly and thoughtfully. He also made himself available outside of section time for conversation regarding assignments.\r\n\r\nChristopher is a very kind teacher, and this is his greatest strength. He appreciates each person, and encourages them in ways that might resonate with them as individuals. This is apparent in section, and also in the comments he places on your assignments, which discern very well the student's weaknesses and strengths, hopefully in the service of building them up. . \r\n\r\nFinally, Christopher is very intentional in his language. He uses jargon only when necessary, and encourages a thinking a type of thinking that distills key terms into simpler parts. I hope to be more like him! ",
            "\u00a0Christopher was very good at helping us sort through some of the complex Trinitarian/Christological ideas--he had a good way of using visual schematics as a way of illustrating conceptual differences between different thinkers.  He really helped clarify what would have otherwise been quite opaque from our readings.  In the classroom, he was attentive to different students' learning styles, and was adept at leading our discussions.  I found him very sympathetic and helpful when I asked him for advice on my writing.  His excitement for the early Christian world is palpable. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent TF who provided helpful feedback. ",
            "\u00a0Christopher was a very good TF and had the arduous task of having to explain concepts, which we should have gotten in lectures. He facilitated discussions well and made sure people were heard. He was very well prepared and very familiar with all of the material so that discussions could include references to concepts and ideas in other parts of the course. Christopher made clear what was expected of us in assignments and was always available and willing to answer questions and to have discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Christopher West was the best teaching fellow I have had at YDS. His strongest strength was his ability to listen to our section needs and concerns with grasping the difficult material and presenting it in a way we would understand. ",
            "\u00a0Simply amazing. Insightful, through, encouraging, patient, clear. "
