            "\u00a0The flipped class format is simply NOT an efficient or productive teaching methods.  The explorations did introduce topics, but the fact that the material had not been taught in class means that many don't take them seriously.  Further, the exams tested knowledge and concepts that were not emphasized in class or on problem sets.  Problem sets were very computational while exams tested for theory and knowledge of proofs or theorems and synthesizing concepts that were gone over maybe for 10 minutes in a class. LITERALLY the only thing that got me through this class is having Brett. If you take this take it with Brett ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course is that it is structured very well, and if you pay attention in class and diligently do the problems sets you will be able to succeed on the exams. A weakness, for me at least, was that the class has 40-50 students, which made it difficult to engage during lecture. ",
            "\u00a0This course does a good job of explaining how and why certain tests or hypothesis work, but leaves it up to the student to learn how to solve actual problems. I found that during exams, there were problems I knew what I should do to solve them,  but in practice, I didn't know where to start. It may improve the course to explain some topics, particularly error bounds, more practically. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the flipped method where we read the book first and then came to class ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: clearly presented material, and enjoyable engagement of the material \r\nWeaknesses: I wish we would take time in class to go over homework problems that gave the class trouble ",
            "\u00a0This course is very thorough and broad but the topics also seem very connected. Weaknesses are that many students have already seen the material so if you haven't it's difficult. ",
            "\u00a0The class sizes make it difficult to learn when clueless because the pace of the class means you go through a minimum of a unit per class, and at times multiple units. It means that during class theres no REAL time to learn something. The questions on exams are based on theory or indepth knowledge which you essentially must learn on your own because there just isnt enough class time to learn. The other issue is that the class is so varied in math ability with students whove taken courses in their previous schools and are taking it for an easy A vs kids whore seeing this for the first time which makes it difficult for the instructor to both keep the pace fast enough and indepth enough to entertain the students whove seen it before and slow enough for kids to understand ",
            "\u00a0The course was great! ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: not everyone was engaged and willing to learn math (this really can't be improved on the behalf of the professor) \r\n\r\nStrengths: great professor, really enjoyed math. ",
            "\u00a0The problem sets in this course were great practice for the concepts we learning. The explores online were usually helpful, but sometimes they were confusing and hard to understand. ",
            "\u00a0There is a lot of self taught learning required. However, what we learn in class is very engaging. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course material is presented in a way that is unnecessarily difficult. I had experience in BC calculus in high school and the same topics I had seen then were taught in a very hard to understand and unclear way at times. Brett was amazing and certainly the best of the available professors for the course, but the material was oddly difficult at times when it didn't need to be. ",
            "\u00a0I dont see any significant weaknesses, one hiccup was that different professors use different notation / variables to refer to the same process, making review sessions or help from a friend somewhat confusing. Strengths include redemptive grading with multiple shots to improve ones grade, as well as a surplus of resources and practice problems via p-sets and practice exams. ",
            "\u00a0The course sometime feels like it is being taught for people who already know the material. So I would say that is a weakness. However, this also means that a good amount of content is covered, and covered well. \r\nA weakness would also be the organization of the course, or well, the order in which material is covered. Although in the end it all tied in very nicely, I do think that it gets a little messy as the course goes to and from the series part of the course. ",
            "\u00a0The class sizes are small, which encourages learning. I think the content after the second midterm was rushed and not fully developed. ",
            "\u00a0The \"flipped classroom\" style in which students watched a video then completed an exploration before the course felt like a waste of time, especially since the professor ended up going over all the content of the video in lecture anyways. Thankfully, Brett did go over the material comprehensively instead of just answering questions, which I assume was the purpose of learning the material beforehand, but doing that effectively rendered the explorations useless. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Brett is a great professor. The course material is truly interesting and he makes sure to use graphics and real world analogies to help relate it back to something we have dealt with before.  Weaknesses: I didn't feel that the pre-class explorations/videos were always adequate in preparing for class and sometimes felt like a waste of time. The course definitely could have better prepared the class for exam problems that would go beyond the scope of textbook and class questions. I also felt that the material was more rushed at the end of the course and didn't handle the last few topics as fully as it did the earlier ones. ",
            "\u00a0teacher was good ",
            "\u00a0I honestly didn't hate the flipped classroom setup as much as I thought. The online explorations weren't particularly helpful, but the in-class instruction was engaging and fruitful. The Problem Sets were not unduly long, but often reinforced principles learned in class. There truly is no better way to study math than by practicing, and the class offers plenty of opportunities to do so without being overly time-constricting. There are also plenty of opportunities to practice for the exams (practice tests, several review sessions, etc.) and the teachers are super friendly. Brett in particular is really chill and fun and it's great just getting to talk to him. ",
            "\u00a0Brett was an awesome teacher. I did feel like sometimes the explorations, videos, and lectures didn't work together so cohesively. Also not any time was spent on explaining things in the format of the textbook, so I only used the textbook for pset problems. Also, I felt that a lot of material wasn't taught on a very deep level. We would learn how to do things but only think about why they worked on the surface level. ",
            "\u00a0The explorations were a strength of the course and are a good preview to lecture material. Also, the peer tutoring system is well run and proved to be extremely helpful. Weaknesses of the course would have to be the exam reviews. While some were helpful, they were for the most part not great. It was really dependent on the prof. or TA running them. Also, I think the communication between profs. and students about specific expectations for exams and grading procedures could be improved. ",
            "\u00a0A great strength is definitely the fact that the course material is gone through at a pretty good pace. However, I think that the explorations should be due the after class so that the information we learn in class can marinate. A weakness is that how much a person learns from this course depends on the professors, because it is evident from many students that different professors are not the same . ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course is that the curriculum is very clear, and there are explorations before classes to help students understand what they need to know before class. A weakness is that the textbook is not extremely clear. I had to at times use internet resources if I didn't understand the lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Practice of topics through psets\r\n\r\nWeakness: Difference in level of problems between class and psets/tests\r\n\r\nDeltas: Give more practice problems that match the difficulty of psets/tests ",
            "\u00a0I thought the explorations were well thought out, and I really liked my professor Brett. In terms of weaknesses, the course was taught like everything we were studying, we'd seen before. To some extent this was true because I took the Calc AB class in high school and took the BC test, but for the topics I wasn't as familiar with, it was really difficult to catch up on my own. Also, the unit on sequences/series/convergence was frustrating because, and I apologize for the cliche, I could see very little practical application for the majority of what we learned. ",

            "\u00a0The material is well taught and y professor was really supportive and kind. ",
            "\u00a0I think at the beginning, for myself at least, I was admittedly intimidated by what appeared to me as my fellow classmates knew much more and were more well prepared than me for that class. Being FGLI and coming from a school that did not offer the most advanced courses, I think that led to me being kind of complacent in class, not answering questions and just kind of going \"yeah, it's just me who doesn't get it.\" Over time, I think I let that narrative play in my head for too long and it hurt my progress in that class. I don't know how this course could help out with this issue but this was I think the biggest issue I've had this year. Yes, the content was difficult, but the issue I stated above compounded on the class' difficulty and it just felt like I was sinking. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures sped through the material so I spent a lot of time outside of classes working on the course material. ",
            "\u00a0The 'flipped' structure of this course is not effective in teaching students Calculus 2 for the first time. It is difficult to gain knowledge from the pre-class explorations, and in class the main focus is on doing example problems rather than teaching concepts. This type of course is best suited for those who have taken Calculus BC but want to refine their skills in the subject. ",

            "\u00a0If you have any interest in furthering your mathematics education, I would recommend it! The workload is very manageable (just a problem set and pre-class online explorations), and you are able to learn a lot of information relatively quickly without feeling overwhelmed. As a frame of reference, I spent about 6 hours a week on this course outside of lecture. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend it to someone who has taken Calc BC or the equivalent prior, because having all of this material be completely new would definitely amplify the workload and difficulty. It's definitely doable if you are committed to math and to getting supplemental help, but without some Calc BC background, I would have struggled greatly and wish I had taken 112 first. ",

It often gets a bad rap, and its course evaluations aren't always the greatest, but I think that's because it can be difficult for a lot of people and it doesn't always have the most interesting subject matter. That being said, the professors are great, the opportunities for improvement are consistent throughout the term, and the grading really tries to help you out. I would've enjoyed a bit more focus on real-world application (population growth, area problems, etc.) because sometimes the material feels kind of abstract and difficult to ground in intuitive principles. ",
