            "\u00a0This course broadened my knowledge of the reaches of literature in conversation with culture; the western canon texts are all influenced immensely by the Greek and Roman culture that they are immersed in or come after, and they also affect the culture, as well. The intertextual understanding I gained from these works was incredible, and having a professor who understands Ancient Greek, Latin, and Italian language and culture certainly helped in providing the tools for us to see the connections between cultures and works. ",
            "\u00a0My skills in connecting different works of literature across a long period of time increased. ",
            "\u00a0Essay writing, critical reading ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think critically about the role of structure and cultural context in classical literature. I learned to think about overarching themes and how texts from across regions and time periods interact with each other. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about Ancient literature, essay writing, and engagement with ancient texts. ",
            "\u00a0My writing skills definitely improved through this course, particularly regarding the organization of my ideas. I also learned so much not only about the literary content of the works we read for class, but their relative cultural significance and how they reflected their respective societies. ",
            "\u00a0I developed an ability to read, interpret and find insight into classical texts. I learnt to create and develop my ideas with more clarity and depth through the papers I wrote in this course. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to write about content that interested me in the text and dedicate myself to my work, not only by putting more time and effort into my papers, but also by emotionally interacting with characters in the works we read ",
            "\u00a0This course will teach you a lot on how the books of the Western canon connect with each other. It was really fun seeing, for example, how Dante replicated Virgil, who copied Homer, in the epic tradition. Same with a lot of stuff in the Old and New Testament readings we did; there are a lot of tiny continuities you wouldn't pick up if you read these texts outside of a class like this. My writing has improved immensely, along with my ability to do close readings of texts to find important, tiny details that one may pass over with a more superficial reading. ",
            "\u00a0This class truly taught me how to close read. It's an important skill that I will carry with me for a very long time. I was able to develop my ability to interact with different texts from thousands of years ago and write about them in a way that felt fresh and personal. This course gave me a completely newfound appreciation for ancient Greek and Latin literature. ",
            "\u00a0I gained critical evaluation skills by analyzing many canonical western texts and synthesizing such knowledge in order to draft papers. By interacting with many of such key literary works of western civilization, I was not only able reconsider my own beliefs on some key topics such as theology and ethics, but was also able to consider how it would square with my pre-existing eastern beliefs. ",
            "\u00a0*Knowledge*: A familiarity with a good number of classic stories - which is both fun, and, for many other works, foundational.\r\n*Skills*: One cannot escape learning how to \"close read\" - giving a greater intimacy with texts, and (yes) learning through our essays how to share the\r\n*Insights* this careful, mindful reading is bound to produce.

            "\u00a0The weaknesses of Directed Studies are well-known; you cannot go very in-depth into works, there is way too much reading to do and maintain good health, and the professors are not experts on every work that they are teaching. Yet getting this survey of Western literature is extremely valuable to anyone who wants to take humanities courses at Yale, and being able to study it in tandem with two other courses and a consistent body of students is a unique opportunity that everyone should consider. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Freudenburg's knowledge and excitement regarding the content of the class was very helpful. Having to cover fewer works would be an improvement. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the professors enthusiasm and the way the course opened my eyes to the rich intertextuality within the Western literary canon. On the other hand, the enormous reading load made it difficult to delve into deeper analysis. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are in the expertise of the professor in classical literature. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the course -- I felt that it was well taught, interesting, and difficult but not impossible. The strengths are the course material and the teacher, the weakness would probably be the speed, which sometimes didn't allow us to delve deeply into the works. ",
            "\u00a0The amount of reading was significant and it can sometimes feel like you don't dig deep enough into a work because you have to move on so quickly, but that's a fact of DS. It's very rewarding if you can get through it all, for the content is generally extremely engaging. DS is overall a very well-structured program, so I have no recommendations for it! ",
            "\u00a0Perhaps by decreasing the number of books covered so that they can be focused on with greater depth. For example, increasing the number of seminars delegated to discussing Sappho and The Bacchae, while eliminating some of the biblical texts  for example, Romans. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting material, good class discussions\r\n\r\nWeakness/improvement: sometimes too much reading; would have learned more if final had been a take-home paper ",
            "\u00a0DS Literature has a lot of material to cover in very little time, so it's expected that we can't read every important author, but there were some disappointing holes in the curriculum. We didn't read any Roman plays or satires - in fact, the only two Romans we read were Virgil and Ovid. I also felt we spent too much time on the Bible. Reading Paul's Letter to the Romans didn't make very much sense in a literature-oriented course, but we still spent a class period on it. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it's incredible how knowledgeable all the professors are with these texts. There are tons of little things that Professor Freudenburg would point out in the Odyssey or the Aeneid that blew my mind. The Literature lecture was also my favorite out of the three lectures every week. It really added another dimension to our seminar discussions. ",
            "\u00a0I think the class was very successful in making the Classics accessible to students without dumbing them down. I felt that the pacing was quite well thought-out. In the curriculum, I would like to see more female writers and/or more time spent analyzing Sappho. I think there is lots of room in the curriculum for women's voices to be focused on. I did not feel like reading Purgatorio and Paradiso by Dante brought much to the class. The course itself was excellent and well-taught. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very rewarding in that we were introduced to some of the most important tenets of western thought. However, the work at times included heavy reading in preparation for section, and it was mostly impossible to discuss such texts in as much depth as we would have liked. ",
            "\u00a0I'd say Literature is the subject in which the machinery of D.S. shines best. With Philosophy, the fast pace and sheer quantity of works can leave one wanting for depth. History and Politics gives a tantalizing glimpse of history (and a smaller taste of politics), but one still feels wrong reading just a few dozen pages from an author and claiming to understand him. Literature mostly escapes these pitfalls: we read full novels (and plays), and because the human brain is hardwired to understand stories, are able to move through material more satisfactorily than with philosophy. This allows a broad survey that exposes one to a great variety of great stories, allows one to appreciate the depth of these works, reveals the evolution in storytelling from Homer to Dante, and (perhaps greatest of all) leaves one thirsting for more. "

        [
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who is deeply interested in the humanities and is excited at the prospect of a LOT of reading a lot of books (albeit good ones). Definitely not for the faint of heart, but worth it for those who want a challenge. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who wants a good foundation in western great works. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend the course to any student interested in literature of the humanities. It introduced me to literature that I probably would not have read on my own, and the professor was helpful and very engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This was an amazing exposure to some of the greatest literary works in western civilization, in a unique setting where your peers are all equally engaged and analytical. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! A very interesting introduction to the western literary tradition. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - directed studies overall has transformed my writing and altered how I see the world; DS lit specifically greatly increased my precision/awareness of what it means to write precisely ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested in the classics and the Western Canon and want to do a broad survey type course before diving in on specific eras or authors, then I recommend you take this course! There are lots of texts that we don't go over, but we hit the big milestones in Western tradition, like Homer, three Greek playwrights, the Old and New Testaments, Dante, and lots more. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The class was a great balance between being challenging and engaging, allowing me to grow a lot from the beginning of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student as the works read were invaluable, and the key ideas gleaned from reading them can be reapplied to many different contexts. ",
            "\u00a0I think many of us at Yale have, at one time or another, considered books among the best of our friends. With this mindset, D.S. Literature is a wonderful journey - you'll make almost a dozen new \"friends\" (and perhaps one or two enemies) which you can carry throughout your whole life, and time and again find new riches in. A life without the classics misses out on a good deal of depth; Directed Studies is a good way to develop a taste for those immortal works.\r\nAre there compromises? Almost certainly. You might spend so much time with your \"friends\" the books that fewer outside friendships are formed. You might also find a rich community of camaraderie within the D.S. family. My advice: if you take this course, you will (somehow or another) find time to make it work. And upon finishing, with a full bookcase of lifelong companions, this is a choice you'll never regret. "
