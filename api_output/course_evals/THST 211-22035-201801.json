            "\u00a0How to better approach a scene, rehearse with a fellow actor, bring a character to life. ",

            "\u00a0This class taught me a lot about working with a scene partner, the process of developing a scene, and staying on my voice. In particular, I learned to move through a scene slowly and purposefully, and to always prioritize having a connection with a partner. ",

            "\u00a0A strength is you end up getting a lot of scene work done through the semester and can grow. Things felt a little too focused on just the scenes at hand and I would have loved to have a more general structure. ",
            "\u00a0Really allows you to focus on acting in a non-stressful academic environment. ",
            "\u00a0It is an honor to work under Joan's watchful eye and tutelage. I only wish  the class was longer (especially given Joan's unfortunate sickness). I do think some classes felt more productive than others, which may have been because students entered the class at different levels of experience. Perhaps if there were two classes taught in the future there could be different levels depending on the student's background with acting. All in all, I really enjoyed getting to spend the entire time working rigorously on scene work and not having to be encumbered by papers/ overly academic work. I truly loved coming to class every day and working in such a supportive environment. ",
            "\u00a0This course needs a TF to help with rehearsals that happen outside of class, like to how Bundy's class is structured! "

            "\u00a0Yes, you get to act and do scenes! ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in acting, this class is a must-take. You will get exposure to a variety of different styles of scenes and get the opportunity to work with Joan, who is brilliant and deeply cares about her students. ",
            "\u00a0YES- Joan is a great acting teacher! "
