            "\u00a0liked the discussion-based class and the papers chosen were very relevant \r\n\r\nwould have preferred to see a greater variety of papers chosen ",
            "\u00a0The course had fantastic topics, and the papers that we read were difficult but very useful to read and evaluate. As a journal-club type course, our discussions were interesting and well-led. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Interesting topics, interacting with faculty with expertise in areas of interest in the cancer biology field, exposure to exciting and interesting articles\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes it seemed difficult to engage the class or encourage participation and meaningful discussion. One suggestion is to require presenters to generate discussion questions based on the article they presented, and spend at least half of the time discussing these questions. Another suggestion is to pick papers that are related to each other and have the two presenters give a joint presentation and highlight how the papers are alike/different, etc. Another suggestion (something we did in the first year of this class that I really liked) is to sit down in small groups at the end of each unit or the end of the semester and identify unanswered questions in the field of the unit we covered or in cancer biology as a whole and then brainstorm ways to address these questions. I found that to be a meaningful way to synthesize the information discussed in the lectures. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn about very specific cancer topics, and is interesting in improving their ability to read papers. ",
