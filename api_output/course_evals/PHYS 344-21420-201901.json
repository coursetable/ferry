            "\u00a0Professor Barrett was absolutely the highlight of this course - he came to class every day energetic and excited to teach students. For a set of classes we were originally going to have to make up, he recorded audio lectures in his own personal time for us to listen to. As others have mentioned in the past, the workload is very reasonable and helps solidify what's been learned (problem sets and presentations). My only complaint is that I would have liked for this class to have been a little bit less abstract. The material on quantum algorithms / quantum cryptography was super interesting, but we only delved into the most basic of cases for each of these topics and spent a lot more time on more mundane things that felt like applied linear algebra. Also, 9:00AM in SPL is hard (which is probably why so few people attended class). ",
            "\u00a0Class is only psets and a presentation, which is really not bad, especially if you have a group of students to work on them with (and if at least one of them is a physics major). Decent amount of math involved, but not unreasonable if you go to lectures/OH to figure stuff out. Really get whatever you put into it, its possible to just coast by without learning much though ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- A great introduction to the applications of quantum mechanics.\r\n- Covers some fascinating and puzzling material in a way that allows students to think about tricky topics without getting lost in the mathematics.\r\n- Very manageable workload but not at the expense of learning (or keeping the class interesting).\r\n- Lectures are well-planned, well-delivered, and well-discussed (if you choose to stay after class).\r\n- Delves into modern research topics in quantum computing that you probably won't get exposure to without a lot more physics background.\r\n- Encourages students to delve into some complex material without having to worry about exams or strict grading policies.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Focuses a bit too much on basic principles of quantum mechanics at the expense of more interesting topics in quantum computing and cryptography. I think the time spent on this module could be reduced a little bit, especially in deriving the mathematical properties of vector spaces and the review of linear algebra. Note that I've taken a quantum mechanics course prior to 344 (PHYS 440/441 at that) and thus my opinion may be a reflection of my experience not shared by my classmates.\r\n- Would be better served by shorter, more frequent meetings, in order to force a more condensed presentation of material and facilitate a discussion of a broader array of topics (especially in the latter half of the semester). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Interesting subject material, excellent survey of quantum concepts (with a focus on the computing aspect)\r\nWeaknesses: At times, it was difficult to stay engaged. ",
            "\u00a0The material is interesting but slow, so could be taught faster in order to pack more into the semester. ",

            "\u00a0This course did not require a high level of engagement to pass (up to you if this is a strength or a weakness) -- I went to less than 20% of the lectures, spent a few hours on the problem sets the night before they were due, didn't spend much time on the final project. But still managed to learn some cool stuff (and solidify knowledge from other physics courses). ",
            "\u00a0The class is organized very well. I always knew what was expected of me and where to go to if I needed help ",
            "\u00a0Great course, great professor, maybe a bit slow at the beginning with the math background; however, this was done to get everyone up to speed ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Barrett is probably one of the most caring and dedicated professors I have ever had. He makes this course super accessible even for non-Physics majors.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Quantum computing was not really introduced until the end of the semester when we started talking about quantum gates. Would have loved to skip some of the derivations in the middle of the semester so that we could cover more about how quantum computers actually work (e.g. more stuff about quantum algorithms). ",
            "\u00a0Something that could be viewed as either a strength or a weakness is that the class required very little work (only 5 psets and a presentation on a topic of your choice at the end of the semester), so you definitely dont have to go to class all the time, although the material will be really hard to understand if you dont, since the notes are not very self-explanatory and there is no textbook. The professor is really kind and is always willing to answer questions or give you extra time for assignments if you need it. The main weakness is that the class is at 9am in SPL, so it is so hard to motivate yourself to actually get up and go. ",
            "\u00a0Great introduction to quantum ",
            "\u00a0I appreciate that this course tries to give an introduction to quantum physics for students with less physics background who might otherwise never have the chance to learn about it. Sean Barrett is absolutely in love with quantum, and wants us to be as excited about the field as he is, which is great. The main weakness is that the concepts build on each other haphazardly and out of order, and without the discipline of the textbook guiding the lectures, I quickly lost understanding of what was going on, even though I was one of the (very) few people who went to class. The professor has his own \"mini textbook\" of lecture notes, and class consists of him copying those notes onto the board and reading them out loud as he does so. A VERY EASY WAY to improve the course: post these notes on Canvas BEFORE the lectures rather than after, so that people can print out the notes and take notes on top of them, rather than copying down everything from the board which he just copies from his Canvas notes. In general, though, having a textbook would be extremely helpful. Given that this is a 34X course geared toward people with only 180/181/301 as background, I would suggest that the course slow down and make sure people actually understand the fundamentals before going on to topics that build on those fundamentals. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Barrett clearly put a lot of thought and effort into the organization of this course. His enthusiasm for the material is contagious, and I thought his organization made a lot of sense. Honestly, a final exam, however low stakes, could have helped me get more out of the material, as I found the final presentations to be not super enlightening. "

            "\u00a0This is a great course for anyone who needs a science credit and actually wants a challenge / to learn something interesting. I took this class as someone with very little physics background, but a decent math background, and got a lot out of it. Quantum mechanics is fascinating, the assessment structure is very fair, and the professor is outstanding. What more could you ask for? ",
            "\u00a0decent class for a SC requirement, especially if you have a math background or are interested in quantum mechanics/quantum computing ",
            "\u00a0If you are a physics major who has already taken 440, then this class is the class for you if you want a more application based class of your quantum physics background. You don't need much background to take this class, but if you don't have a quantum physics background, take it with a friend who does. If not, this class is going to be very difficult if you try to just do the problem sets by itself. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. As a non-physics, STEM major, I was very comfortable in this course and was able to learn quite a bit about quantum mechanics and its applications to quantum computing (topics which I find very interesting). The workload was very manageable and there were no stressful exams, just a presentation which allowed me to dive deeper into the scientific literature and research a topic of my choosing. I think this course really excels because it encourages you to learn without prodding you with assignments or grades (though individual student motivations mean that your mileage may vary depending on your level of discipline in attending class and paying attention). This isn't to say that the class wasn't challenging, though. Much of the material is quite tricky and requires some thinking in order to fully appreciate, once the chalk settles and the equations are written. Our pace through the material was thankfully slow enough that I could grasp the mathematics while still contemplating the conceptual details, and it largely avoided being too slow (save the mathematics/basic QM review). Prof. Barrett makes this a fun and accessible entry point into quantum computing, so if spins and qubits are up your alley, this is an excellent, low-commitment way to get a flavor of some very interesting material. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another stem major or someone with an intermediate physics background as an introduction to quantum. ",

            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the class was completely doable and fair, even as a non-science major. It allowed me a low-stakes way of learning a really difficult subject I otherwise would have avoided out of intimidation. I am incredibly thankful for that opportunity. I learned a lot in this class. ",
            "\u00a0If you need another PHYS credit, take this course -- low workload, and you learn as much as you want to ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to another student the content is well organized and the material is interesting ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is an excellent, interesting, and relaxed course. While I took this as a Physics major, I don't believe it was particularly challenging. Instead, Professor Barret presented excellent, cutting edge topics at a relaxed pace that allowed us to appreciate and absorb them. He really started from first principles and built everything up. The majority of the class had very little to no physics background. My year there were only 5 leniently graded psets and one end of the year journal club presentation. No exams. It was really a \"you get what you put in\" kind of class. ",
            "\u00a0Would definitely recommend to anyone who is a non-physics major and has some background in linear algebra. Quantum mechanics is super cool, and this class is a great way to get introduced to the topic. Don't be misled into thinking that this class is a \"gut\" though...some of the psets are quite challenging. Keep in mind, all the other people who call this class a \"gut\" are probably physics majors who have already taken 2 semesters of quantum mechanics. Nonetheless, this class is definitely very doable as long as you have the mathematical background for it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any physics or math student who want a class with a relatively low time commitment or for anyone who is actually interested in learning about quantum computing and other related things. The five psets do take a bit of understanding, and the presentation at the end of the year will require some preparation, but other than that the class does not take up much of your time. If you just need a science credit, beware that you there is a good amount of linear algebra, and understanding bra-ket notation may be difficult if you are unfamiliar with it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Super chill class ",
            "\u00a0If current trends continue, this class will get a very low workload rating, tempting many people to take it for a \"cool\" science credit. The reasons for that rating are that most people don't go to class (since all he does is copy the Canvas notes to the board and read them out loud as he does so), and that the only work in the class is five problem sets, plus a very easy final project essentially graded on completion. That's all true, but just keep in mind that these problem sets can be quite time-consuming for two reasons: 1) you probably won't know how to do them, so you'll need to go through his notes to figure it out (luckily the notes are very helpful for the psets), and 2) some of them have a LOT of busy work, which might come in the form of copying long proofs out of the notes or doing very many slight variations of the same basic problem from the notes. The average scores on the psets were very high, but that's because a lot of strong students took the course, and because most people formed study groups. I'd strongly recommend joining/forming a study group if you possibly can, since if you can work together to figure out the psets, you're all set for this class. The material is probably cool if you understand it, but I don't know because I didn't. Over your semester you won't spend much time on this class -- especially if you're in the large majority that doesn't go to lecture -- but make sure to set aside decent chunks of time for the psets. You'll need it. ",
            "\u00a0This is a very low-stakes course, great for an elective in an otherwise busy semester. Quantum computing is super cool, but we actually spent more time on the math behind QM than the technology of quantum information. If you're already a seasoned veteran of QM, this course will probably be boring, but if you're looking for some cool applications of a very weird theory, this is a good introduction. "
