            "\u00a0This course gave me a good understanding about how my cohort think about history and the writing of history. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to engage and analyze historical books that cover very different topics than I myself study. I was exposed to other topics in history I have not really studied before. I dove more deeply into some subfields than I have before and ever plan to do in the future, but it is useful to know about them. I can now understand references to some canonical historians work such as Braudel. However, in terms of actual skills, I am having a hard time thinking of any. I did however enjoy the interview assignment, but would make the reflection 5-7 pages long rather than just 5 pages. I also truly enjoyed the book presentations and worksheets since  it let students get to know each other in the small groups and then also allowed students to talk about their own subfield. I actually plan on reading a few of the books presented during my winter break. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about a variety of different theoretical approaches to history. ",
            "\u00a0By bringing together specialists in many fields, the course made us question what we have in common as historians and what, if anything, defines our profession. I think our conclusion was that we are generally interested in creating stories or giving voice to people who have not been able to write their own stories; that there are always technical and ethical questions (about objectivity, speaking for subalterns, filling in gaps in the source base, etc.) that will accompany that activity; and that there are professional norms, or obligations, or a code of conduct regulating our answers to these questions, norms we're often unaware of and which seem to operate by silent consensus, but which it's worthwhile to discuss. It would be difficult to say that we're all interested in the past, because several of us work with people who are still living. We have pretty varied methods, and we each engage with other fields to different degrees. And yet somehow we've got to find a way of communicating with each other, because otherwise what we do can just become career-focused. ",
            "\u00a0I believe I started to think more about what it means to think historically. ",
            "\u00a0It was useful to survey foundational texts and become familiar with various approaches to history as a discipline. It was also wonderful to get to know the cohort in this setting. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me a broad overview of historiographical issues (objectivity and truth, incorporating oral history, the problems of privileging documentary sources over oral ones) and exposed me to topics, themes, geographical regions and problems the that my classmates will be studying during their time here. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a helpful introduction to a variety of historical methodologies (archives, oral history, subaltern studies, etc.) and to some of the most important works in academic history over the past 60 years. By reading widely across time periods and geographies, I gained a deeper sense of my own historical interests and sensibilities. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me how to develop an argument within a broader conversation or narrative. ",
            "\u00a0I gained insight into what others in my cohort thought about history and historical methodologies. I had the opportunity to read widely from different chronological and geographic periods, which was incredibly useful and I very much appreciated. "

            "\u00a0It is crucial in building a sense of community, and I met and got to know other graduate students I wouldn't ordinarily have spent much time with.\r\n\r\nThe course material was random and difficult to thread together. Should be a methods course more plainly, or an introductory course in something completely different that everyone takes together anyway. If Professor Botsman had done an introduction to Japanese history I think we would been able to have continuing conversations that built on one another and expanded our knowledge of a field none of us (in my cohort at least) study. ",
            "\u00a0I agree that this course should exist. However, I think the current format does not work. Having 21 students studying different topics analyze books on topics unrelated to our own doesnt really accomplish much. A better format would be to actually have a methodology course. This could include having a week on microhistory, a week on political history, social history, cultural history, etc. or even include oral history, public history etc. This would mitigate the fact that we all study different topics since the vast majority of our subfields have been influenced by these trends. Plus, it would be more helpful for students to gain a grounding the basic trends of the field.  An alternative method (or one that could be included in this one) would be to add more professionalizing elementssuch as making a syllabus, giving lectures, and applying for grants. Assignments could be make a syllabus, write a grant application statement, and give a lecture. These are practical skills we will have to do as historians and in our careers, but there is no concrete opportunity for students to gain insight into these skills right now besides trial and error and asking other students/advisors. ",
            "\u00a0This course would be invaluable regardless of its content, simply by virtue of the fact that it brings together the entire first-year cohort. Weekly book presentations were an excellent chance to get to know about our colleagues and a good way to practice presenting our research interests. I'd enjoy reading a bit more theory/historiography, although I realize that the course wasn't really designed to address those areas. I think it would be worthwhile to reintroduce some classes in the philosophy of history, which I gather has fallen out of fashion. All historians ought to read Hegel and Marx, at least. It might also be worthwhile to devote some time to a discussion of how we teach history, and what obligations we have to the public. ",
            "\u00a0There were simply too many people in this course. ",
            "\u00a0The course is good introduction to grad school, and it was nice to see how different students approach history. It would have been useful if we did the proposed syllabus project in addition to the book review. ",
            "\u00a0I am glad that the course included a broad range of texts that grappled with an array of themes, some of which included the use of oral sources which is especially important to me. My classmate's presentations on texts that are significant to their field was my favorite part of the class. The course could be improved by shifting the lens from a Euro-centric, North America focused syllabus (especially in the beginning) and examining the Subaltern Studies project and other historiographical challenges to the field more intensively. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I thought the course effectively covered a lot of ground in the historiography. Most of the readings were interesting and provoked (at times heated) discussion. The reading load and assignments were manageable. Breaking into small groups helped greatly with discussion.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: With more than 20 students in the class, it was often difficult to participate. Assignments were not always adequately explained. Presentations were generally interesting, but their purpose was unclear. It might have been helpful to read a bit more theory. ",
            "\u00a0This syllabus for this course was well organized to reflect monographs from virtually all parts of the world. This is remarkable for a semester course. Nonetheless, European history monographs dominated and I think in the future a near balance of it would be great. ",
            "\u00a0The course is inevitably a challenge. Is it a methods course? Is it a survey course? Professional development? Theory? For me, I am inclined toward the course being a method and theory course that traces the genealogy of academic historical inquiry.  This would probably mean reading fewer monographs and would incorporate a range of influential theorists (Hegel, Marx, Benjamin, Althusser, Arendt, Kristeva, Michel-Rolph Trouillot, Habermas, Du Bois, Glissant, etc.) who may not have been proper historians but are significantly influencing much of the most pathbreaking and/or conversation-shaping work in the academy. I realize that this could become a \"greatest-hits\" kind of theory class and would mean gleaning very surface understandings of a variety of scholars work. Moreover, this could detract from thinking critically about methods that are particular to the historian proper (especially amidst job market concerns). Yet, the absence of this conversation felt it reflected a broader challenge of the course which as multiple people warned me had more to do with my classmates than the class. This was a kind of perceived apathy or apolitical stance of the historian that is outside of politics, dynamics of power, and the ethics of historical inquiry, that ended up being bolstered by the absence of bigger questions of what history does in the world. How it has bolster fascist regimes. How is fuels change. How it interacts with economic systems. I recognize that this may not be the view or priority of the department, in terms of what they feel it is most important for first-year history students to be thinking about or focusing on. "

And I think it's also important to cultivate an awareness of how \"niche\" your work may be, and to remember that you need to present your work in such a way that it's accessible and meaningful to a very diverse audience. That's why it's so important to find out what the universal language of history is, if there is such a thing. Do all historians write the same way? Do they all use theory in a certain way? These are disciplinary conventions that you need to follow if you want people to engage with your work. ",

A few texts really spoke to me (Amrith's in particular, and Freedom Papers) but on the whole I found it difficult to be engaged with the material and class discussions. ",

This is a course I will recommend to students who plan to remain in the academy. ",
