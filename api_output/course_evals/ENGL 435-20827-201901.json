            "\u00a0I learned how to think critically about texts that were, at times, very difficult to read; however, I found that it is always worth persisting and questioning sentence structure as well as pertinent background information. It was great to be immersed in James's works and to be able to follow his trajectory from his early works to his later. ",
            "\u00a0This course immerses you in the work of Henry James and his trademark style. You will read seven novels in twelve weeks, including some of his best (and a few of his not-so-great). The seminar tends to be small, so you have to read attentively and be ready to participate. Discussion ranges from close reading/passage analysis, to thematic observation, to comparison with other James novels. The coursework includes two papers--one 5-7-page midterm paper, and one 20-25-page final paper, for which you can repurpose some of your earlier essay. Because of the length of the novels and short time frame in which to complete them, this course is also a study in time-management that can be highly satisfying if done correctly. ",
            "\u00a0I developed not only a deeper understanding of Henry James in particular, but also of how to read in general. I learned the skills of close reading and analysis of novels which helped me understand how the genre works. ",
            "\u00a0I have never learned so much about a single author as I did in this course, which was a truly wonderful experience. I also came to love and appreciate Henry James, and novels in general. ",
            "\u00a0This course introduced me to the major works of author Henry James. The class covered seven novels and several pieces of secondary reading including The Art of Fiction. These readings were challenging, and the nature of the syllabus improved my abilities as a close reader of the novel form. The class also presented the challenge of a 20-25 page senior research essay. The senior essay component of the course improved my writing and research skills. Finally, \"Henry James\" improved my skills as a seminar participant. The intimate nature of the class and deft discussion facilitation by Professor Yeazell encouraged me to engage during weekly sessions and speak up even when I might have been afraid to voice my opinions. I've grown in leaps and bounds as a writer, reader, thinker, and speaker thanks to this highly challenging but equally worthwhile course on James. ",
            "\u00a0This course introduced me to the novels of Henry James and, more broadly, to the state of the novel as it transitions from 19th century realism to 20th century stream of consciousness and other experimental techniques. It also deepened my ability to read and analyze novels in an academic context. "

            "\u00a0Our class discussions were among the best I have had during my time at Yale, and Professor Yeazell was really great at facilitating discussions while also allowing us to debate with one another. It was truly a community, and I learned equally from both Professor Yeazell and my classmates. The only weakness of the class is also one of its strengths, which is the amount of reading that we had and the pace of the class. I at times felt that I did not often have times to really and thoroughly reflect on James's works in the way that I had hoped due to the fast-paced nature of the class (The Golden Bowl, for instance, could have a whole class taught on it!). That being said, it was really special to be able to read as many works as we did, and it also kept up the momentum of the class. ",
            "\u00a0This is -- by some distance -- the best class I've taken at Yale. There's nothing quite like reading one of the great novelists of the last 200 years in the company of a great group of students and with the guidance of one of the sharpest, kindest, most generous professors on campus. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are: the incredible knowledge, insights, and guidance provided by Professor Yeazell; the small, self-selective group of students that it attracts, who are highly engaged and perceptive contributors to discussion; the great novels on its syllabus. \r\n\r\nIf the course has a weakness, it would be that we don't read some of the best-known or best-loved novels, such as The Wings of the Dove and The Bostonians. I definitely would have preferred these to some of the early works that we read. I would rather take a class on James's best as opposed to one that gives a balanced look at the trajectory of his career. ",
            "\u00a0The course was organized wonderfully. By beginning with James' easier and earlier works we were able to build up slowly to the great late novels. By the time we were reading \"The Ambassadors\" and \"The Golden Bowl\" we were immersed in James' style. ",
            "\u00a0This course is absolutely perfect for a serious English student. The reading is difficult but the seminar is so engaging that it would feel ridiculous to do any less than all of it. It is also very well designed for preparing students to write their senior essays. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Yeazell has this course down to a science. She has curated a thoughtful syllabus that provided me with a broad sense of James' style and development over the course of his prolific career. Assignments were often long and challenging, but never unreasonable. I greatly enjoyed seminar and appreciated Professor Yeazell's skill for facilitating discussion. Seminars were strongest when Professor Yeazell had provided us with some guiding ideas or principles for discussion, either over email before class or at some point during the previous seminar discussion. For example, my favorite discussion from the term involved students bringing in specific passages from the assigned reading. The passages allowed for a focussed conversation that felt grounded in the concepts that most struck members of the class. Professor Yeazell would also ask us to consider certain questions when approaching the assignment for the week or alerted us to specific passages to note while reading. These guiding points made for the strongest seminars. Without these guideposts, especially in the beginning of the term, weekly discussions could feel unruly given the vast number of pages covered each week. I would recommend consistently prefacing each week's reading with either a small assignment (like finding a passage to share with class) or some general point of emphasis for students to focus on while reading. Even though this type of instruction might seem juvenile, I recall distinctly the elevated quality of conversation that resulted from these types of exercises. The texts are vast and some extra work or focus often produced the best conversation. ",
            "\u00a0The chief strength of this course is the breadth of its syllabus. Having read no James prior to the class, I came away from it with a solid understanding of Jamess career and his place within the larger tradition of the novel. The small size of the class, which allowed for close discussions of Jamess texts and for the development of an esprit de corps, was also a major strength, although this small size may be more an incidental consequence of the classs daunting reading load than an intended result. \r\n\r\nI cant identify any major weakness in the course that would need redressing. The reading load is a lot, but I dont know if it could be reduced without sacrificing the understanding of James that I took away from the class. If the primary reading load was reduced, however, I would suggest adding a few more secondary sources. The criticism that I read while writing the final paper gave me an appreciation for James that I hadnt had before, and I would have benefitted from reading some of it earlier. ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus was well organized in terms of the novels we read and also the timing of the papers, topic selection, and final paper prospectus. Professor Yeazell is an amazing seminar leader and her questions really push students to engage with crucial aspects of the novels. Another highlight of the seminar was the way that Professor Yeazell really listened to students' comments. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to another student provided that the student was willing to take on the workload and responsibility that the class demands. It was certainly the most challenging class I have taken at Yale, but it was also rewarding as well. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course! It is a great way for English majors to fulfill their senior seminar/senior essay requirement, and completing it feels like an accomplishment. Some of the novels are must-reads. And everyone should take a class with Professor Yeazell, whether or not it's on Henry James. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The literature we read is so moving and so beautiful. This is an amazing way to plunge into the work of a sensitive, poignant, and brilliant author. It will change the way you view human interactions. What more could a course do? ",
            "\u00a0This has been one of my favorite classes of all time. I would highly recommend it to any serious English or literature student. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!!! This was the best seminar I've taken at Yale. It was incredibly intellectually fulfilling and challenging in the right ways (and an amazing excuse to spend all my time reading novels). The people made the course for me. It was so engaging (and fun!) to hear my peers' thoughts on the novel we had all read that week. And Professor Yeazell ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. The class is challenging in many different ways. The readings are long and dense; James' novels are difficult to navigate and the syllabus, packed with seven novels, doesn't allow you to take a breath on weekly assignments. Yeazell is an exacting discussion leader and will expect a lot from you during weekly discussions. Also, the final senior essay will prove a demanding task. However, the ability to study Henry James with Ruth Yeazell shouldn't be passed up, no matter the challenge. You will leave this course in possession of a budding relationship with Henry James and will come out a better thinker, writer, and reader. If it's offered, please don't miss out. ",
            "\u00a0This course involves a lot of reading, and Professor Yeazell is upfront about this fact. Getting the most out of the class entails reading and at times rereading the texts in order to understand Jamess difficult prose. So long as one understands how much reading the course requires before taking it, the course is fantastic. To anyone who wants to read Henry James and who has some prior experience reading novels in an academic setting before, I wholeheartedly recommend the course. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student (given the student is serious about doing a lot of reading carefully!!!). The course has a large workload but it is totally worth it to learn about James with Professor Yeazell. "
