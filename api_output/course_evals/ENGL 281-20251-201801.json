            "\u00a0Should meet more than once a week for less time each time; about 2/3 of the way through seminar, the class devolved into Prof. Berger talking almost uninterrupted. Does not reflect course title/description. ",
            "\u00a0I thought one of the greatest strengths of this course was how it attracted students from different disciplines (not just English). This brought in a lot of new perspectives and ideas that I might not otherwise have encountered. However, this was in some ways also a weakness, because the discussions occasionally veered into territory that was less analytical, though in the end I always felt the discussion was valuable and added to my understanding of the texts. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include a wide array of literature from more scientific pieces to personal accounts. One improvement would be to include scientific papers that evaluate animal intelligence in order to get a better understanding of what we know about animal capabilities as well as to critique the ways in which animals are studied. "

            "\u00a0You're not going to read much modern american fiction, but if you want to think about the place of animals in literature through a more historical, factual and, towards the end of the semester, fictional lense, then it's still an interesting seminar! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student from any discipline. English majors will encounter different types of texts from what is normally on the syllabus, as well as students from different disciplines they might not otherwise encounter in a classroom setting. Non-English majors will have a chance to exercise a different type of thinking and writing, perhaps on topics they study in their own majors or subjects they are interested in outside of the classroom.
