            "\u00a0This course was AMAZING and Professor Lamont is the best ",
            "\u00a0A core understanding of ancient Greek history as well as an understanding of new directions in classical scholarship and social history. We learned a fabulous mixture of facts and experiences regarding the ancient Athenians ",
            "\u00a0A pretty broad array of info including some interesting detail about Ancient Athenian daily life. The course includes some interesting reading material. ",
            "\u00a0Fantastic course! 10:10 ",
            "\u00a0Wonderful course, available to all regardless of their previous background in the course. You learn how to analyze complex pieces and art. ",
            "\u00a0This class was really really interesting, because I got an understanding of ancient Athenian life and history that centered in large part around the lives of ordinary people. It's a unique way to look at history, and one that I found really exciting. ",
            "\u00a0A study of everyday life in ancient Athens, with a focus on traditionally marginalized populations. ",
            "\u00a0I greatly enjoyed this course's approach to Greek history, and I gained a better understanding of the daily lives of ordinary people in Athens. This approach to history expanded my way of thinking about the ancient world, and has made me more excited to explore social history in general. ",
            "\u00a0An understanding of classical Athens as a culture rather than The Culture, complete with curses, groundless medicine, class warfare, and petty interfamily spats. "

            "\u00a0I think the lecture & section could have benefitted from greater engagement with the readings. A few of the readings (e.g., Sophocles' Antigone) received little or no attention during class time. I thought it was a bit odd that we were sometimes assigned extra reading for section, especially because we did not go over all of the material that was already on the syllabus. In addition, some of the lecture material simply summarized or restated the readings, which felt a bit redundant, and it might have been more valuable to have primary source readings or supplementary scholarly articles to enrich our understanding.\r\n\r\nOther than that, this class was fascinating and I truly enjoyed it! ",
            "\u00a0the course is awesome ",
            "\u00a0This is a really, really excellent class! I think all of the readings were very well-chosen and, of course, the lectures were well-prepared and super engaging. I think it could be improved by more challenging essay assignments; we just summarized and objected to pieces of scholarship but didn't really have the chance to propose our own directions. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Clear structure and organization. Interesting topic. The historical overview at the beginning of the semester was the best part.\r\nWeakness: At times a bit dry. Focus on social history (almost entirely) was frustrating for those interested in military, political or economic history. ",
            "\u00a0Love this course. ",
            "\u00a0Incredible course, Prof Lamont is incredible. ",
            "\u00a0Very interesting, builds upon commonly known Greek myths and subverts preconceived notions. Appreciate the comprehensive look at Athenian society, not just elite men. ",
            "\u00a0The different units seemed really well-organized, even as everything overlapped throughout the year. Professor Lamont also did a good job of tying one lecture to the next. I'd love to have learned more about curse tablets! ",
            "\u00a0Good balance between primary and secondary sources. I learned more about ancient Athenian social history, from the workings of the democracy to the practice of exposure. Some of the lectures, though, were just summaries of the secondary readings; I wonder whether we could have expanded discussion a little further, using the readings as a launchpad. ",
            "\u00a0I liked how this course was organized. It was helpful to start with a general overview of Athenian history, and then dive into the details of daily life in Athens. ",
            "\u00a0STRENGTHS: a broad range of readings and an engaging professor.\r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES: a little repetitive at the beginning of each lecture. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely. I learned a lot and was never bored in class. The class was accessible for Classics majors and people who had never studied Athens. ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely! It's a great class, fun and interesting material and Professor Lamont is a true gem. Take this class just for her, it doesn't feel like you're in class but rather that you're listening to her tell stories. She brings in so much enthusiasm, passion and energy to the classroom and has truly been one of my favorite professors at Yale! The workload was also fine, a midterm, two reading response essays and a final. Great class! ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. It's really interesting--ancient Athenians did some weird shit, and the way they understood personhood and citizenship feels very relevant in a way I didn't expect when the semester first began. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you want to learn about Greek social history. The course could have been a little broader in scope, looking beyond Classical Athens, but as a whole I learned a lot. ",
            "\u00a0I would! This is an engaging course that covers a diverse array of topics. Even a newcomer to Greek history like myself can get a lot out of this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you're interested enough in classical Athens to consider this course but not so deeply immersed as to already know the history. The first half is very much a history course, which might prove repetitive to classics buffs; it's only in the second half that you dig into subaltern social studies. "
