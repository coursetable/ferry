            "\u00a0I learned the basics of the Italian language in an immersive environment and got to understand a different culture. ",
            "\u00a0Not only did I learn a lot of Italian vocabulary and in particular grammar, with the help of Anna and Sarah, I also learned grammar instincts and cultural knowledge. I also learned good study skills/tools for learning languages in general. ",
            "\u00a0Learned basic Italian skills, grammar, and vocabulary. Gained some insight into Italian culture as well through readings. ",
            "\u00a0Basics of the Italian language, especially in terms of conversational Italian. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to speak Italian at a faster pace than I could ever have imagined learning a language. It was challenging yet amazing. ",

        [
            "\u00a0It was great that I learned the language in an immersive environment because I got to apply what I had learned regularly, which really helped with my understanding. Also it was great that I got to learn Italian simultaneously with Italian culture because the two components of the program complemented each other really well.\r\nProfessor Marra and Professor Atkinson's styles also complemented each other very well in the Italian course. With Professor Marra, we applied all the grammar and vocabulary in real-life settings which is really fun and engaging, and with Professor Atkinson, we studied the grammar in a more structured manner. The two components really made the Italian course more engaging and accessible. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very strong in terms of learning language very quickly. To me, the only significant weakness was that the textbook did not always teach helpful vocabulary and instead favored more obscure vocabulary. ",
            "\u00a0Course was very well structured where the two professors balanced each other out perfectly! One pushed us to converse and use Italian and the other hammered in the grammar really well! The only weakness isn't really in control of the professors, and that's simply that we don't have enough time to learn all the vocab and get used to grammar at a more comfortable pace. The only room for improvement I see is maybe speeding up the pace of the L1 portion of the class to ensure that the L2 portion doesn't feel as rushed as it did. ",
            "\u00a0The first half of the program was slow enough so that we can learn a new language and actually memorize the concepts, but fast enough that we had materials to talk to our host families in the foreign language itself. There is absolutely nothing to complain about the way our amazing professors taught the class, and if anything I wish I was informed of the amount of vocabulary I had to memorize. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the dynamic of teaching between the professor Sarah and Professor Anna. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed how Anna made the course engaging for the students by playing Jeopardy and Kahoot! It made waking up early for the class worth it. "

            "\u00a0Definitely! The program is a once-in-a-lifetime experience that helped me not only study another culture but also discover more about myself. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would! It was fun and rigorous. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Learning Italian in Italy motivates you in a way you cannot be on campus. Also, since you're mostly only focused on Italian the entire program, it's easier to stay focused on the material and not get bogged down by other classes or activities. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, a lot. I love almost every aspect of the class. ",
