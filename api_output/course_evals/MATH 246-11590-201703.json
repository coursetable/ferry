            "\u00a0We learned how to solve linear differential equations of any order using a variety of methods, such as variation of parameters, undetermined coefficients, and the Laplace transform. Also, we learned how to solve systems of linear diff. equations using linear algebra. ",
            "\u00a0In the Boyce and DePrima diff eq textbook we did almost all of the content from Chapters 1-7, covering ordinary differential equations (no partial). This includes, first order equations (separable, exact, linear), and linear second order and higher order equations, as well as series solutions, Laplace transforms, and systems of differential equations using techniques from linear algebra. Overall I feel we really did learn a lot, and when I flip through the pages of the textbook it feels like a review. ",
            "\u00a0Learned how to solve every kind of linear differential equation (and some non-linear). The material I learned in this class helped immensely in my physics classes. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to solve differential equations. Well, some equations - we skipped a lot of really cool things that I feel should be included in an ODE course. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: well taught, well organized, covered a lot in a short period of time\r\nWeaknesses: covered too much in too little time, class was too long and was used to fit in more material than needed to be covered through the year ",
            "\u00a0Very computational, as opposed to proof-based (both a strength and a weakness). ",
            "\u00a0This is a pretty standard diffeq course. It's pretty boring, but I don't know if there's really a way to make diffeq interesting. It was graded fairly, although I think the final should be worth less than 50% of the final grade. I appreciated that the final was not cumulative. ",
            "\u00a0When you look at what you're going to cover in the class at the start of the semester, it seems like not that much (just first- and second-order diff eqs?), but once you finish the class you realize how much you learned. The sequence of material is conducive to understanding the course. The psets are fair, just enough of a challenge to be fun but not burdensome. I would suggest that for next semester the class move a little faster (sometimes Professor Yang spent too long on simple concepts). ",
            "\u00a0The strengths:\r\n\r\nI LEARNED the material I expected to. When I look through Chapters 1-7 of the book I'm like \"I've got this\".\r\n\r\nThe weaknesses:\r\n\r\nThe psets are highly computational and can be very tedious. Don't get me wrong, it makes sense for a diff eq class to have a lot of computation, I just think the psets were a little too tedious and would have benefited from a couple more interesting problems. While I appreciate my newfound computational efficiency, the occasional proof would have been nice.\r\n\r\nAlso, whenever we covered systems it was basically all linear algebra. This is fine, however I wish the math department would just go ahead and make it a prereq so we could have skipped the linear algebra review lectures and gone deeper into the subject. I think most of the people in the class had already taken linear algebra, and for those that haven't there's always the ENAS diff eq course that doesn't cover systems. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very computation heavy and I feel as though it would be rewarding to have some more proof based questions on problem sets and in class. ",
            "\u00a0It covers the basics of Ordinary Differential Equations. However, I think that the course is unfortunately designed in such a way that students are not challenged. Many of the most interesting topics in Differential equations were skipped. For example, we didn't even talk about fourier series or the convolution integral, we didn't extend the laplace transform to the realm where they are actually useful (heaviside and dirac delta functions), and we didn't talk about sketching nonlinear systems with multiple critical points (this is really neat!). All of these ideas would improve the course by introducing valuable math ideas and methods and not just teaching how to solve differential equations. ",
            "\u00a0This class was well organized and well taught. The homework helped illuminate and reinforce topics taught in class. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were very clear and well-structured.\r\nI think it would have been helpful if Canvas was updated more regularly. ",

            "\u00a0This class varies enormously by teacher. Jinwei Yang was excellent, but a bad professor can ruin the class. ",
            "\u00a0Only if ya gotta or need a math cred. ",
            "\u00a0You pretty much take this if you have to. If you're looking for a fun math course to expand your knowledge of math and encourage critical thinking, diffeq is not the class to take. It was a good class in that it taught me how to solve differential equations, it's just that the subject matter itself is pretty boring. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who is planning on majoring in any science or applied math, as differential equations are applicable to many different fields of study, such as economics, quantum mechanics, classical mechanics, acoustics, chemistry, etc. Having this math in your arsenal makes your life that much easier when you study advanced scientific topics. Plus, this course isn't that much work or too intellectually challenging that it'll tear you apart mentally. Take it with a friend and you'll enjoy it. Also, never forget the Wronskian (#neverforget). ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. I'd just say make sure you know your linear algebra, otherwise Chapter 7 will be extremely difficult. ODEs and PDEs are used in just about every applied setting you can imagine (physics, chemistry, biology, geology/seismology, finance, economics, etc.) so this math is extremely meaningful. \r\n\r\nI also think a lot of the methods we've devised for solving differential equations are quite clever and they're fun to learn about. Just be ready to solve a bunch of tedious problems on the psets. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to a student who needed to know differential equations in order to pursue higher level courses in other fields like engineering and physics. As a stand alone math class I feel as though there are more interesting courses. ",
            "\u00a0If Jinwei Yang is teaching it, Math 246 will be a nice and easy credit. He tries his best, which is appreciated as you can tell he cares. However, the material is inherently boring and is taught like an engineering class rather than a math class. ",
            "\u00a0I want to be able to recommend this course (because I love this kind of math!), but the course was just too basic that it felt uninteresting. We went through the textbook section by section (skipping many because they were \"too hard\" or \"unimportant\"). I feel that we weren't intellectually challenged. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class with Professor Yang. ",
            "\u00a0This class is great if your any type of STEM major as differential equations have a way of sneaking into most subjects. It's a logical place to pick up after MATH 120 if you need another math credit that is mostly computational. It's also very easy. 10/10 would recommend. ",
            "\u00a0It's a very straightforward and relatively easy class, and you learn a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Very MONOTONOUS; even if you're a physics major (as I am), this course probably isn't necessary and you're better off taking other math courses (i'd recommend 225, 250, and complex) "
