            "\u00a0I gained so much more knowledge about the Chinese language. I improved my speaking, writing, reading, and listening skills immensely. ",
            "\u00a0A better understanding of modern Chinese language and culture. This course covered a variety of topics that are important to modern professions, including business and economics terms, news and media, and different literary devices. ",
            "\u00a0Much more insight on serious topics and how to discuss them. ",
            "\u00a0This class taught me a wide range of useful vocabulary words/structures and offered valuable practice for further developing my language ability. ",
            "\u00a0Continued to improve my Chinese language skills with an emphasis on speaking and listening. ",
            "\u00a0Continued in a thorough improvement of my Chinese reading abilities, as well as improving my speaking confidence. ",
            "\u00a0Grammar, Chinese culture and knowledge ",
            "\u00a0Deeper understanding of China- and Taiwan-specific issues, including the economy, important movements like the May 4th movement, some important 20th century debates in Chinese culture (use of characters, what is a man, class conflict, the nature of literature). I think I liked the material more than that of CHNS 150. ",
            "\u00a0In this class, you build on what you learn first semester. The lessons cover economics, China-Taiwan relationships, and movies. You work on improving your Chinese to a level where you can discuss more complex topics. It is very similar to CHNS 150. You use a textbook that is a continuation of the textbook from first semester. "

            "\u00a0I loved this course. I liked how rigid the structure was. I definitely learned a lot. I guess I wish there was a little more room for creativity in the curriculum. Maybe the assignments/class structure could be changed up every now and then, instead of going through a reading in the textbook every class. ",
            "\u00a0The workload of the course could be better distributed. Around exams there is a crushing amount of work, as essays and listening homework is all due then. But, there is much less due on other times. This could be better smoothed out. Other than that, the teaching and topics covered were great and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Cant think of many weaknesses, well organised and thoughtful. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: broad range of topics, which has helped understand a wide range of material. Tutorial sections are valuable for practicing conversations with people. Fantastic teachers/TAs.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Classes were larger than Chinese 110 and 120, so there weren't as many opportunities to practice speaking as there had been previously. ",
            "\u00a0Both professors are excellent, the tag-team lecture method is very effective, the textbook is very well written and contains high-level yet relevant subject matter. 5 days a week is brilliant! ",
            "\u00a0A strength is the diversity of topics covered and of requested assignments.\r\nA weakness is that sometimes the workload seems a little bit unevenly distributed. The tinglis, for example, all take place on the same day. ",
            "\u00a0The course is well-designed. However, the workload is too much. Daily tests are really stressful. ",
            "\u00a0I think putting all of the assignments on Canvas has been really good, streamlining the course. I think last semester I would miss more assignments because some were online, some handwritten, and some on Canvas; now, it's almost all in one place. Having the same tutor as last semester was great, too, because I got a lot closer to him. ",
            "\u00a0I wish there was a greater emphasis on more conversational speaking. We cover some interesting topics but a majority of vocab words are only used once and hard to remember as lessons go forward. Assignments got busy sometimes when we had essays and oral assignments due on the same weekend. Teachers are usually very accommodating and try their best to help you in any way possible. The video skit project at the end of the semester was not very useful and kind of a waste of time in my opinion. I think more time reviewing for the final or fun review activities would be a better use of students' time (especially since the video only counts for 2% of the overall grade) "

            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this class. Wang laoshi and Zhang laoshi are absolutely incredible. The class is very fun and you learn so much. It is also really hard (there's a lot of work), but I found it worth it in the end. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who wants to further their Chinese language abilities and real-world applications. ",
            "\u00a0Of course, interesting content while learning the vocab + grammar. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this to another student. Although the workload is high, you learn a lot of valuable Chinese and have fun while doing so (as least in my opinion). The classes are engaging, the teachers are wonderful, and it's a great learning experience overall. Don't take it if you're not willing to put in some work (you learn 40 new characters every two days and go through 80-character chapters each week). ",
            "\u00a0Without hesitation -- it's an excellent continuation of Chinese studies at an intermediate high or advanced low level. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the course improves my Chinese a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! I think I improved in all areas during this course, especially in the realm of writing in a more formal style. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's a good way to keep up your Chinese. Teachers are very nice. However, especially if you are coming back from a Chinese language program over the summer, the intensity of the class and the progress you see in your Chinese is not comparable. Make sure to keep that in mind and find other ways to keep practicing your Chinese outside of class otherwise you might feel a little burnt out or disappointed by this class. "
