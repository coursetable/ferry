            "\u00a0very strong teaching, off-topic questions could be dismissed potentially ",
            "\u00a0The course is hard to follow at times and the material taught in class is not always consistent with assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Coming to this class, I had very low expectations due to my own lack of understanding in calculus. However, I was very pleasantly surprised, and found that Prof. Hall was able to make the topic rather interesting! More importantly, this class (as taught by Dr. Hall) was easy to understand if you listen and do work, which is especially important when you haven't been exposed to any of the material before. Plenty of additional work was offered for those who wanted to do more or practice for exams. One improvement might be to do a few more exam-like questions in class: it seemed that exam-style questions had a specific form for justification that may be overlooked. Additionally, it might be a good idea to do a warm-up before the quiz, although this is not necessary. ",
            "\u00a0Very good breakdown of math 112. It helps the transition of precalculus to calculus be easier. I think that the quizzes before every class were unnecessary. ",
            "\u00a0The best part about this course are the frequency of office hours. Having them literally every night but Friday and Saturday made me more eager to study/do sets in advance because I knew I had someone available to help if I got stuck or didn't understand something. ",
            "\u00a0The course was incredible. Professor Hall was really invested in making see students got all the help we needed. The only thing I didnt like was the daily quizzes. ",

            "\u00a0It had lots of strengths. There could have been a higher ULA to student ratio at office hours, but prof hall was very willing to answer questions and cared a lot about his students learning. ",
            "\u00a0The course is laid out well, and the class does not move too fast ",
            "\u00a0Professor Hall is definitely the strength of this course. He is an incredible professor who clearly has a vested interest in his students understanding the material of the course. The weakness is the textbook we use. We aren't allowed to use calculators on the exam but almost all of our textbook problems require them. ",
            "\u00a0It's a very good course with a lot of support. ",
            "\u00a0The lecture is a weak point in the course. It needs to be more engaging. The problem sets were very helpful. They helped us practice the skills we needed in the class. ",
            "\u00a0The classes were structured well, and it was nice to see an agenda of what we would be doing on the board. The quizzes at the beginning of class were helpful tests of retention and comprehension of the last class. ",

            "\u00a0While it does depend on the student and their abilities, I would probably recommend this class to other individuals who have a similar foundation in math to myself. The course provides a solid introduction to topics in calculus, and was very well-taught. Real-life examples were also very good to see for those who may not understand simple definitions and theories of calculus. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend it to anyone who wants to not rush with math, get a better understanding, and also make sure that has the right basis to continue to further math classes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if they are willing to put in work to understand the material/pay attention in class. It is a great way to learn fundamentals of calculus. ",
            "\u00a0I would! Professor Hall is amazing. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class if you need to, but dont expect to take it because you took calc in high school and want an easy a. Dont make my mistake. The psets are long and graded very harshly, and the midterms can be tough. Take this if you need to. Its very easy to get an a, if you go to office hours every week and study a lot. Theres plenty of resources available to get an A, but you need to put in the effort. ",

            "\u00a0I would if you dont love math. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. If you're not very confident going into Math 112, this is a great start since it's the same concepts as it's extended into Math 111 in the spring. ",

            "\u00a0Yes. It's a great course especially if you don't have prior exposure to calculus. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because it was not too difficult. It went slow enough that it was fairly easy to learn the material, but it was also challenging enough to not be boring. ",
            "\u00a0As someone who is not confident or enthusiastic about math, I was still able to understand most of what was taught in this class. ",
            "\u00a0YES! It was a great course! In addition to a great teacher and a manageable workload, after it was over I felt very fulfilled! "
