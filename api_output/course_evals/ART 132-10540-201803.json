            "\u00a0moderate foundation in color theory/aesthetic theory, emphasis on hands-on, more deliberately manual assembly of compositions (required more conscious choices in style than simply using the Adobe Suite would), learned time management for projects through trial and error ",
            "\u00a0Core art concepts, ability to analyze and discuss visual elements, what is working about a piece and what might be changed to improve the composition ",
            "\u00a0I think one huge thing I developed in this course was an understanding of basic design elements and a knowledge for how to talk about design. At the beginning of the course I had no sense for words like balance, visual rhythm, contrast, etc as they applied to design and now I feel like I can talk and think cogently about design.\r\n\r\nThere was a lot of emphasis on getting a meaning across through design, and I think I learned how to think more thoughtfully about what the purpose of what I was doing was. This almost feels silly to say now but I think at the beginning of this course I just made designs that looked nice without thinking about the word-visual connection, and I have a much stronger sense for the latter now especially after doing the word design project, which was probably my favorite project of the course. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to talk about design principles in graphic design. I gained a better sense of how to integrate the visual form and message of logos, posters, and collages. We discussed considerations such as hierarchy, color, and typography. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the basic elements of graphic design and how to implement that knowledge into a variety of design forms, including pamphlets, logos, posters, and more. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to create beautiful and meaningful graphic compositions through the use of color, direction, balance, and text. \r\n\r\nThis class also taught me how to think of graphic solutions much faster, by analyzing successful designs and using the elements that made those successful in my own work. I also gained a lot of insight into how designers work with clients to build a brand identity or get a message across. ",
            "\u00a0Through this course, I was able to develop a sense of aesthetic through the handwork of  elementary graphic design. I was able to produce a wide range of work, making the class demanding but very rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the formal elements of design, as well as how to properly critique my work and others. I learned how to look at art from a critical perspective and I learned how to do a bunch of interesting art projects. ",
            "\u00a0The course provided a foundation in graphic design by starting from the very basics, and growing to complete projects through several stages of development. By primarily relying on a hands on, tech free approach, the students were taught a fluid process and how to train our eyes. ",
            "\u00a0How to create, discuss, and critique the designed world. We developed a vocabulary and set of concepts that we used to achieve this goal. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think visually by first processing my ideas by hand and then creating designs with physical elements. This course did not use technology, which I appreciated because it leveled the playing filed and caused you to focus on fundamentals. The class taught me a great deal about text and image relationships, principles of design and caused by to perceive design I see in the world with a more critical eye. Its a very helpful introduction that asks to be followed by more design classes, color or typography. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about utilizing the principles of graphic design to express ideas visually. ",
            "\u00a0I developed knowledge of some of the principles of art and graphic design, how to receive and provide constructive feedback, how to structure creativity, and how to use the tools of handmade collage. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: great, engaging professor; quiet but helpful and kind TA; emphasis on process and not just final products; good balance of critique class meetings and work/lecture days\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: no syllabus, and only sporatic homework reminders/descriptions, which would have been helpful, since in-class descriptions weren't always the most organized ",
            "\u00a0Loved the critique and feedback on work. I felt like I learned so much in the process, both of getting feedback and giving it to others. Assignments were also interesting and built on each other. Would have liked some flexibility on the \"Border\" theme, which was a bit of a struggle to work with over two assignments. \r\n\r\nMost confusing part of the course was understanding assignment guidelines and deadlines. Improved as the class went on but sometimes hard to keep track of. ",
            "\u00a0I feel like this course was really strong. I liked how we were introduced to a vocabulary that we got to use throughout the rest of the semester. I also found critiques pretty helpfulthey were kind but still helpful in that people were encouraged to make suggestions, especially as the course moved forwards. ",
            "\u00a0Assignments felt purposeful, but the instructions were sometimes unclear. It would have been nice to have a better sense of what materials and techniques would be needed in the course. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very time consuming in the amount of time students have to spend outside of class on their projects, especially because most of the projects are done by hand by cutting and gluing paper, rather than just using digital design software (although we were permitted to use said software on projects towards the end of the semester). Although it was a lot of work, I found almost all of the projects to be interesting enough that the time I was spending on them was typically very enjoyable rather than tedious. I appreciated the time we were given in class to workshop, as well as critique days, which were well facilitated to make sure that all students' pieces were talked about, focusing on the positive elements of every piece along with the parts that needed further work. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: This class was incredible. I learned so much both from doing the hands-on projects and from the in-class critiques. As a prospective art major (intending to concentrate in graphic design), this class was required for me, but every minute spent in class felt purposeful to me. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The first set of projects are all collage, which is definitely necessary to the class, but they sometimes felt tedious. I felt that I put in a lot more work into this class than I originally thought I would. That said, I got a whole lot out of it. ",
            "\u00a0The course required A LOT of time outside class to work on projects. Most of class time was spent critiquing everyones projects from the night before. I think this practice is pretty standard for art classes though. A huge asset to the class was the professor, Henk. He was just the coolest guy you could imagine. He gave gentle and helpful constructive criticism on our projects, and made time to meet with us one on one despite having to commute daily from his home in Brooklyn. ",
            "\u00a0This course is great, because it gives enough time in class to work and get feedback from the instructor and TA, in addition to working at home. In addition, the critiques are very helpful, honest, and most importantly efficient. I felt like I really got a lot out of this class. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very strong in the actually enabling you to create and in getting amazing feedback from one of the most famous graphic designers, Henk. Its awesome that he looks at your work so carefully and offers his own feedback. Its defintelt a lot of work and you end up spending a bit on printing and supplies, even though you already pay a $150 for the studio fee. I thought the fee would cover the materials. Also, sometimes I felt that class time was wasted spending too much time on critiquing others work. Just a piece of advice, you dont learn as much about digital art. This class is very centered on the actual creation process with physical paper, so if you are taking this hoping to master Indesign or Illustrator or Photoshop, this is not the correct course for you. That said, you can get away with using digital platforms for the poster and logo projects. But you are never formerly taught how to use them. ",
            "\u00a0The longer class period was a very strong piece of the course, as it allowed everyone's artwork to be discussed. One weakness of the course was that assignment requirements were never sent via email or posted on Canvas, and the only way to ask questions or confirm the requirements of a project would be to email the professor directly. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: great professor, helpful teaching method, requirements were generally reasonable, lots of feedback, fun and worthwhile field trip to Manhattan.\r\nWeaknesses: we stalled on a project in the middle of the semester, so my final portfolio had less breadth then I hoped it would, sometimes there was too much expected in a very short window-- work was not evenly spaced. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I loved the assignments and thought they pulled upon and helped build different skills throughout the term. I liked the emphasis on handmaking pieces. Prof. van Assen is very effective at facilitating crits that are supportive, student-driven, yet identify major areas for improvement.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: 1) I thought we went through the principles of design too quickly, in only 2 sessions I believe. 2) I found myself spending more time on trying to find materials, trying to find a printer that could do both color and size, trying to figure out how to learn the tools than on actually making art. This created time constraints that often made me feel like once I finally had everything I needed, I didn't have enough time to be thoughtful about my piece, to make multiple versions, etc. Perhaps one of the first classes, or an optional session outside of class led by the TA, could provide an overview of resources and services at the art school, where to buy materials, where to print, some practical collage execution advice, etc. "

            "\u00a0Yes, not just as an avenue into higher-level graphic designs classes, but also as a great primer for color theory and graphic design basics, which will be useful in any upper-level class ",
            "\u00a0This is a great intro course into graphic design. Not high pressure but involves meaningful feedback and critique that helps you develop a foundation. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend this course for sure! It's exactly what it says it isan introduction to graphic design. If you've never had any formal training in graphic design, even if you've done it on your own, this course is super helpful in developing a formal understanding of graphic design principles and in training you to really connect the style of what you're doing to the substance of the message that's being conveyed. Do know that the coursework is mostly done by hand, so you're not going to learn how to use indesign in this class. I found the by hand aspect really quite enjoyable, but I also already have a good grasp on indesign so it was ok for me that I didn't get to learn it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Learned a lot about how to communicate visuals clearly and also what graphic designers do. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning about the elements that lead to creating visually engaging graphic design. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This is a class that forces you to work by hand, making you learn about the fundamentals of graphic design, NOTE: not digital design. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to anyone wanting to make a lot of art and learn a lot about graphic design. You do so much that you come out of the class with a good looking portfolio. You also get to have a close relationship from Henk, which is awesome. The trip to New York at the end of the semester is also a blast and really inspiring, since you get to see Henks studio. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student because the skills learned are useful to any academic project and provided a good introductory art/design class for any level or background ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course was very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. This course brings something needed to a Yale schedule by engaging other parts of your brain (helpful in my STEM-heavy course load). It will change the way you create and interpret the world around you. However, expect late nights of cutting and gluing. This class requires some patient and finesse with exacto knifes-- make sure that is a good fit for you. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to someone who is interested in graphic design! It was an amazing learning experience and Henk is a fantastic professor. It was a lot of work, but the variety of projects was really interesting and enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - I learned a lot not only about graphic design and art, but also about feedback, rigor, and structured creativity. It's important to understand, though, that this is a studio art class, not a graphic design class that will train you PowerPoint, InDesign, etc skills for class or in a professional setting. While the principles will likely help you in those ways, it is less directly applicable than a course that utilizes such software. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely a great class and Henk is a great professor, got really close and bonded with my class through work sessions and a trip to New York. Class is a lot more physical work than you expect so don't expect this class to be a gut workload wise. "
