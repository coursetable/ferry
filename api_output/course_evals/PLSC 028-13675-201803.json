            "\u00a0I looked at the American Constitution from philosophical, judicial, and practical perspectives. The course covered a lot of material that allowed us to see our founding documents from a variety of lenses, and I leave the semester feeling both more convicted in my prior understandings and more confused than I was upon starting the course. It was an excellent exposure to the nuances of the American system, and provided a good foundation for future studies in political science. ",
            "\u00a0I gained so much for this course, but above all else, I gained a more nuanced understanding of the Constitution and the United States as a whole, as well as the debates that characterize our society. I also learned how to grapple with reading material that was very difficult. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave a good overview and introduction to constitutionalism and political philosophy. We learned how to analyze court cases and connect more recent court decisions to writings of our country's founders and other philosophers of the time. ",
            "\u00a0How to read Supreme Court cases and analyze works of political science ",
            "\u00a0Due to the heavy reading load, I was able to gain a lot of exposure to American politics, and definitely became more appreciative of our system of government. Especially in our polarized political climate, it is reassuring to gain a thorough understanding of the Constitution that has outlived even worse times. Many of the readings I had previously interacted with before, but only at a very surface level and was never able to thoroughly understand. In this course, we read directly from the source, which was often lengthy and arduous, but is the most effective way of examining documents. For example, by reading Supreme Court arguments, both majority and dissenting opinions, we were able to evaluate arguments and build our own. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to analyzing primary sources. I also learned how to write a college level essay as well as articulate my argument/idea sufficiently in class discussions. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the constitutional basis for many of the issues that are prevalent in today's political discussion. Through the reading of influential works of political writing and SCOTUS decisions I learned about the reoccurring themes of American politics and their role in today's political climate. ",
            "\u00a0By reading so many supreme court cases, I learned so much about how to understand the jargon, understand how the court decides some cases, and about famous cases in general. ",
            "\u00a0American Constitutionalism gave me a lot of insight into the American legal system and the principles that have shaped American government. I read court cases for the first time ever and ended the semester with a much better understanding of how the law and the Constitution govern American politics. ",
            "\u00a0Learned how to analyze an argument made in primary source documents. ",
            "\u00a0I developed insights about the origin and intent of government in America, various perspectives on the true role of government, and the ability to apply these insights to discourse on issues in the modern American political paradigm. ",
            "\u00a0Interpreting primary sources, linking America's past with the political present, asking more and more questions about a text or many texts to come up with a coherent argument. ",
            "\u00a0I got much better at ready complex arguments, especially those of Locke, Paine, etc. whose writing was also hard to understand because of differences in dialect. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a platitude of skills in this class: how to read and analyze legal documents, how to participate in meaningful class discussion, and how challenge my current ideology. ",
            "\u00a0Showing up to Yale, I wasn't sure if my classroom discussion skills were up to par. I had taken many many intense seminar classes in high school, but it is hard to know how to hold yourself in an intsene political science classroom at your new University. This class taught me how to engage analytically, critically, and thoughtfully in a Yale classroom. I learned a lot about the teacher-student dynamics, how to navigate difficult conversations, how to pull from the text, and how to be prepared for push-back from the teacher on your point. \r\n\r\nMr. Silverstein taught me to think about legal issues differently. How did this SCOTUS decision factor into the political landscape at the time? Why is the Founding Father using this language here? How is religion embedded in the Founding Documents? \r\n\r\nEven if you are already interested in law or political science, this class teaches you how to think about these topics differently. "

            "\u00a0The course had incredible continuity from beginning to end. Each day/week was themed, and the professor selected excellent court cases that led to fruitful discussions. My one suggestion would be to emphasize those themes a bit more and engage in cross-theme comparisons every so often. ",
            "\u00a0There were so many strengths to this course; the readings were interesting and the class discussions were stimulating and exciting. I wish I got more feedback on my papers during the writing process so that my final papers were stronger. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strength of this course was that class conversations were incredibly lively and interesting, which encouraged all students to contribute and compelled us to truly understand the assigned readings. The weakness that comes along with this is that sometimes, the conversations became less structured as the class went on and we became more off topic. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Silverstein really pushes discussions and students to think deeper about American ideals, documents, and history. Seminar style means you get to know your classmates and professor pretty well. Professor Silverstein was very accessible and always had office hours/was willing to talk about the class and/or politics! \r\nWeaknesses: While it is objectively difficult to cover all of the concepts that fall under the umbrella of American constitutionalism into one semester in an undergraduate course, the amount of readings assigned to be completed in one week could become excessive at times. I would only categorize the readings as excessive if we did not get to them during the in-class discussion. ",
            "\u00a0It is great because it is mostly student-driven but the professor guides the discussion without implanting his opinions. ",
            "\u00a0There are truly no weaknesses to this course. I learned so much and began to formulate my own political ideas. Class discussion with the professor and class is definitely a strength. The only weakness might be that there is a lot of reading. ",
            "\u00a0The discussion based format of the course is its greatest strength. Students have to have their own ideas and convince classmates of their correctness. A weakness of the course was the time that it took to receive feedback on the papers that we turned in. While the feedback received was always very helpful and clear, due to the delay in receiving feedback, it was not as helpful as it could be. ",
            "\u00a0This class was near perfect. ",
            "\u00a0This course teaches students an incredible amount of information over the semester, which is definitely one of its strengths. The dynamic of the class was also one of its greatest strengths. Students are actively encouraged to participate and learn. As for weaknesses, it's hard for me to think of one. The class was definitely my favorite of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0The course had little to no weaknesses: the professor was superb, the was engaging, and the discussions were  very high-level ",
            "\u00a0I think it was an effective course, but more attention could be paid to applying certain documents and Court cases to today's issues, especially in the first half of the course. ",
            "\u00a0There was a good bit of reading for the course, 30-50 pages per meeting, which meant few people were fully prepared for class each day. The class had three papers, with three students turning the second paper each week during the middle of the term on that week's topic. This meant that a small group of students led the discussion each week, but also meant that the other 15 people in the class often lagged far behind in discussion, especially if they didn't closely read that week's cases. Professor Silverstein was the best part of this class: he was a fantastic discussion leader and brought a ton to the class. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked this course. I dont think I would change anything. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were definitely the engaging class discussions, which Professor Silverstein did an excellent job leading. Weakness is the amount of reading, which often felt too long to really stay focused and understand the material. ",
            "\u00a0At times there was too much reading and not enough of the content was reviewed in class. It didn;t always feel like the reading were worth drudging through. I wish Mr. Silverstein would be more selective about the assigned readings and instead use class time to dive super deeply into the narrower material rather than trying to cover too much. "

            "\u00a0Yes -- it is a great political science class regardless of whether you are interested in pursuing political science any further, and it has helped me figure out a direction for myself in that field. Other than that, it's a very thought-provoking course and it will force you to be very introspective about this country and about your own beliefs. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student -- it was my favorite and most interesting course so far. I learned so much, the professor was amazing, and it was overall very fulfilling. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to another student, especially a first year. It was a good way to get used to the seminar/conversational style class and introduced politics in an exciting and relevant way. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. As a freshman seminar, this class is interesting and introduces you to members of your class and a very engaging professor. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! If you are interested in court cases or better understanding the constitution, this is a wonderful course to take. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course for students who have a strong interest in American politics. The course has a very heavy reading load, but I was genuinely interested in the assigned readings and felt that I was able to gain a lot from them. However, I can see that for students who are not as interested as I was, it could be very difficult to get through. Personally, I think all students should have a thorough understanding of the political system they live under, and should be able to critically analyze arguments presented to them by politicians, which this course covers. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Definitely! This class was amazing. I loved the community that formed and everything else about this class. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely recommend this course to another student. Due to manner in which the class is taught it is very easy to tailor your workload to your interest level in the course. For those who are very interested in politics the class can be a deep dive into each of the topics focused on. For those who are taking the class out of casual interest a broad overview approach can be taken. Either way the class is worth your time. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely. Professor Silverstein was absolutely wonderful, a terriffic teacher. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, especially if they're interested in American politics or the law. The course is a great introduction to constitutional law and gives students a strong understanding of how the American legal system impacts politics. ",
            "\u00a0Without reservation ",
            "\u00a0As with any course, I'd recommend it only if the subject is something you're interested in. In this course especially it can become monotonous if you're not completely invested in the topic. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It's a great introduction to basic US case law without the pressure of memorization, allowing students to think about the meaning rather than names or dates. The class had a lively discussion every day (although it could have used some more ideological diversity, as always) weaving modern examples with the cases. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I really liked it and spent a lot of time talking to my friends about it, and using what I learned (especially Mill) in discussions. ",
            "\u00a0I would 100% recommend this course. Professor Silverstein was incredible and the seminar format insured that everyone participated. Not only did I learn a lot, but gained many friends in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It is an intense class with intense material and an intense classroom setting. It calls you to be very engaged and on your toes. But teaches you so much if you engage with it. There aren't too many essays (only 3) and he makes himself very available whenever you need to chat. "
