            "\u00a0I walkaway with a clearer idea of what it means to be critical of a documentary. Prior to coming to the course, I thought that every documentary is good and effectively communicates a message. However, there is a lot more complexity than simply 'it's good\" or \"it's bad.\" ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about the documentary form by taking this classnot just the history of the medium, but the really nuanced debates around nonfiction status, authorship, and representation. I really appreciated the interdisciplinary and customizable nature of this class. ",
            "\u00a0This class explores concepts that everyone, regardless of what they study or what they are interested in, should be familiar with. It explores the veracity of \"truth,\" the documentary form, the inherent power of the camera, how we classify \"others,\" the \"savage slot,\" and global historical concepts. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the methods, uses, applications, and problems of documentation and ethnography. ",
            "\u00a0This course pushed me to think harder and deeper about everything. Beyond the ethics and challenges of documentary filmmaking and viewership, this course pushed me to think more about how I go about the world and issues around me. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I do not think there are any weaknesses. This class is excellent from the discussion to the carefully crafted documentary selection. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Grewal is the greatest strength of this course. She selected incredible films to represent the trajectory of documentary history, and she is the most talented seminar leader I have ever experienced. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of this course was Zareena and the comfortable format of each class meeting. Zareena is simultaneously extremely intelligent and human -- with high expectations of her students but reasonable expectations. I am someone who rarely does the reading for courses, but because of the appeal of the content and a desire to be able to meaningfully share during class, I found myself doing every single reading assignment. This course was full of strengths, and you would be in a hard position to find any concrete weakness. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely. This is a must-take. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! It's valuable both to casual fans of thee documentary medium to experienced practitioners of the art. It's a critical look at the documentary form that will inspire the student both as a consumer and creator of media. ",
            "\u00a0Any student who wants to broaden their global perceptions of the world and have their point of view challenged in a respectful manner in class should take this class. It is hard to verbalize why students should take this class, as the feeling of \"why\" is an emotional one, and I believe that speaks to the reason more than any words could. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to anyone interested in American studies, ethnicity, race, and migration, and African American studies, but not necessarily to someone interested in film. ",
            "\u00a0Documentary Studies is a terrific course at Yale. It is extremely engaging and thought-provoking. It helped me develop a critical lens to looking at documentary films and cinema in general. The discussions are lively and present. We met twice a week where the first meeting, we watched the movies, and the second meeting, we did the readings. The assignments are super enjoyable and fun - you watch movies, and discuss! We were able to interweave our first impressions with incredible scholarships. Additionally, Professor Grewal is an amazing teacher who is generous, kind, and will push you to critical think in all new directions. I loved the class and would 100% recommend! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Learn about documentary films (which everyone should!) and learn about the world. Have amazing discussions. Do it. "
