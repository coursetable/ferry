            "\u00a0This course was a great exercise in approaching history through a multi-disciplinary lens. Many readings came from political scientists, anthropologists, and other theorists, in addition to historians. ",
            "\u00a0A better concept of the different forces that shaped the fall of the Soviet Union and the actors who shaped the direction of the Russian Federation in the intervening years ",
            "\u00a0In terms of pure knowledge, I gained a much better understanding of 20th century Soviet history. I also think my writing and research skills definitely improved, particularly being able to synthesize and comment on secondary sources. Relatedly, my ability to adequately skim readings for content and ideas definitely got better as the semester went on. ",
            "\u00a0I have been interested in the history of the Soviet Union since my family lived there and immigrated after its collapse in 1992. This was a very interesting seminar that covered the poltical, economic, societal, and over history of the second half of the Soviet Union's history and discussed the reasons that contributed to its fall. I learned how to analyze historical texts and study diverse secondary sources, finding biases and different perspectives in the texts. I also learned how to write history papers. "

        [
            "\u00a0The course has a great structure which really brings insight into the chronology of events in the second half of Soviet history. I would like to see more engagement with primary sources (to the extent that it is possible to a largely anglophone audience) rather than just secondary sources during seminar. All of the primary source work in this class came from the research paper. ",
            "\u00a0I think a better background coming in would be helpful ",
            "\u00a0Professor Antonov is definitely a strength of class (see other answers), but I would definitely recommend taking a seminar with him.\r\n\r\nThe class was really small, only 5 students, and that was a strength and a weakness. There was plenty of opportunity to speak to get feedback on our ideas in seminar. On the other hand, because there were only five students, there was no way to hide, so we had to make sure we did the readings well even on our busiest weeks. \r\n\r\nClass discussions were great (see other answers).\r\n\r\nThe readings were mostly secondary literature (there isn't much primary literature about the USSR in English). That made doing the readings tougher. I also didn't love the weekly reading responses: they took up a chunk of time each week, and writing them meant we couldn't save our most interesting points about the readings to make in seminar. I think they might be more useful in a larger seminar in which there is less opportunity to speak in section. ",
            "\u00a0The course was interesting and well taught. Perhaps some additional primary sources could be added as we read almost exclusively secondary sources. Also perhaps more diversity in text would be interesting as we mostly read political and economic accounts of the Soviet Union. However, the readings were interesting and I got alot more insight on the Soviet Union. "

        [
            "\u00a0Yes, this was a fascinating discussion-driven class which really delved deeply into this fascinating period in Sovietand worldhistory. Prof. Antonov is very knowledgable (having lived in the USSR!) and cares deeply about his students. He gives great feedback on assignments and is always available for help and guidance with assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Certainly. I think it does a very good job of shaping one's understanding of how the Soviet Union collapsed and what different forces conspired to make that collapse possible. It also actively confronts the general concept of why the Soviet Union fell apart by looking at numerous different scholars on the subject. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I definitely would. Class discussions were interesting, and Professor Antonov is great (see other answers as well). The workload is not too bad, only a 6 page book review and a 15 page research paper. That being said, the readings are all secondary sources, so they take a long time to read, and the weekly reading responses to take up a chunk of time (see other answers). If you are interested in the USSR, I definitely would recommend it. ",
            "\u00a0I do recommend this course to any student with an interest in Soviet history. This seminar provides great insight into the post-WWII history of the USSR and the factors that contributed to its collapse. The readings are generally quite interesting and provide a variety of perspectives for seminar. Professor Antonov is knowledgable, opinionated, and does a great job leading discussion. He listens carefully and will occasionally push back on students. The assignments are about what you would expect for an upper level History seminar -- weekly Canvas posts, a 6 page book review on a monograph of your choice at the midterm, and a final 15 page research paper. I learned a lot, and am glad I took this course. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to a student who is interested either in the Soviet Union specifically or in learning about how large nations or empures collapse. "
