            "\u00a0The course was an ambitious and stimulating exploration of two veins of critical thought and literary production, namely thinking through the articulation between the legacy of the Holocaust and forms of colonial state-administered or soverign violence. Specifically, students gained an introduction to the literature and scholarship of memory studies and trauma theory by investigating a corpus of both aesthetic and scholary works. ",
            "\u00a0A fantastic, stunning course. I learned about various literary perspectives on memory, justice, violence, and decolonization. I was so honored to be included in this seminar. Highly recommend! ",
            "\u00a0A critical theoretical overview of memory studies, decolonial thought, and the politics of literary representation. ",
            "\u00a0I came to think seriously about the work that violence and memory do in conjunction and against each other. This course guided me towards thinking about ways of responding to trauma and the ethical stakes that always at play in such response. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this course mediated a fine line between being an introductory course for students without great familiarity with post-colonial studies and those who plan to write theses on this subject. I learned a lot. We touched on the limits of traditional academic learning for such subjects  the limits of pain and trauma and the way they resist translation into traditional academic discourses. I really liked the formulation of the question every week  I thought it was the right place from which to start when approaching this material, a question rather than an answer. ",
            "\u00a0In this class I was introduced to literature in the fields of memory, decolonial, and trauma studies. I also got to practice my french reading comprehension and develop a style of analysis that draws evenly on the insights of academic theory and aesthetic works. "

        [
            "\u00a0I felt the course was powerful in its thesis, original in its design, and makes an important contribution to the course offerings at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0The strength and weakness of this course was the fantastic range and richness of the materials with which we engaged. Often, simply due to the limits of time (I think the course perhaps should have met for an hour longer, but that is a general problem with the graduate school!) we had to move our discussion quickly through material that otherwise could have engaged our attention for weeks! I benefited from it, however, and the course left me wanting to engage more in these materials and literatures in the future. Many of the novels and authors we read I did not have much experience with; I look forward to reading more from them! ",
            "\u00a0The strength is Professor Jarvis. She is an absolutely top-notch teacher, with a real commitment to each of her students. ",
            "\u00a0While Professor Jarviss insight was always extremely valuable, more opportunities for students to guide the course of discussion/more time spent on each individual discussion prompt would occasionally have been appreciated so as to allow more time for thoughts to develop at the seminar table. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a joy in every respect, my only preferable change is a logistical one: i think it would be better as a smaller seminar than it was this year. ",
            "\u00a0I felt this course had an excellent syllabus, and the reading was manageable. If possible, I think a smaller seminar would have been somewhat better. ",
            "\u00a0There were a lot of students in the class, and a lot of reading. I think that sometimes it was difficult for me to motivate myself to do the latter simply because the discussion group was large. ",
            "\u00a0I found this course to be excellent. The instructor purposefully crafted a fast-paced and widely ranging syllabus that was able to draw powerful conclusions by the end of the semester. It felt almost like three courses in one, but in a good way! I was introduced to a large amount of critical theory, as well as a dozen African novels, and was able to draw insights between them consistently. The workload was large, but it all felt worth it to me. The instructor's weekly feedback to our online responses helped me to feel invested in weekly discussions and guided in my learning. "

            "\u00a0Yes-- I especially think the course is important for students interested in the legacies of colonial violence and their expression in literature. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! ",
            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY. Professor Jarvis is completely brilliant; and doing incredible work. Its an absolute pleasure to learn under her and I would encourage everyone to do so. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student. Professor Jarvis is unparalleled as a pedagogue and there are precious few courses that deal so explicitly with the stakes of violence. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to students interested in postcolonial theory, representations and representability of trauma, politics of language and translation. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! The course staged a fruitful combination of political and aesthetic criticism, and was broadly a masterclass in ethical, imaginative, and contemporary engagement with artistic works. The instructor was also articulate, highly intelligent, dedicated, and friendly. You could tell she is passionate about the course material and a committed teacher. "
