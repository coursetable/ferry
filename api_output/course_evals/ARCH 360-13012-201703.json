            "\u00a0I felt like I had a better understanding of how to present research using the Adobe suite. I also learned how to better delve deeply into a project and parse through a lot of information. ",
            "\u00a0I was challenged to express what I know in a visual way that engaged both people, but also pushed them to think critically about a subject. \r\n\r\nI learned how to do extensive research on a very particular subject. ",
            "\u00a0Through the course of the semester, I learned how to visually nd graphically represent the products of my research, and in lectures, learned geographic/cartographic precedents and how globalization and urbanization can be understood from the perspective of design and architecture "

            "\u00a0It was very well structured and overall an amazing class. The sections, however, could have been used more effectively. ",
            "\u00a0I think the lectures at the beginning of the class were not helpful for the task of research. They were helpful in certain ways, but not in other ways. They provided a wide variety of examples of how to display research and think through problems, but they were often too theoretical and too much information to take in. I would have liked to have seen more tangible use of class time to discuss the skills needed to produce some of the visuals that the class demanded. How do you design research questions? What are the kinds of things that are worth looking for? ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated the freedom we had to generate our own research based on our subjects of interest, and I thought the final exhibition that we put together was a great way to culminate the semester's work. I would have appreciated more direct feedback, however, as well as more guidance in terms of how to graphically represent the material. I thought that the expectations were often unclear, and would have appreciated a greater level of guidance and feedback "

            "\u00a0Yes, it was an incredible course if you are interested in urban studies or just the modern city in general. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone remotely interesting in anything Urban and likes research. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to other architecture students, but probably not to non-majors. I think that the class at its best would benefit from the interdisciplinarity, but the mismatch of expectations made it difficult for everyone in the class to feel like they were equally prepared for the class, and the focus on design made it difficult for non-majors to produce the same material without access to the same resources.
