            "\u00a0Unbeatable reading list. Levene is clearly a brilliant thinker who asked very provoking questions and was a fair essay grader. Really helped both my discussion skills and reading interpretation skills. She keeps us honest to the texts. ",
            "\u00a0Close reading of Fear and Trembling, Genealogy of Morality, Gay Science and Beloved. Learning about the foundation of morality and the evolution of philosophy in time. ",
            "\u00a0This class gives you a more difficult interpretive task than most other humanities classes. I felt as though I significantly grew in my writing through the two paper assignments, and that I grew exponentially between the first paper and the second paper. ",
            "\u00a0We learned a lot about methodology; how to read a text charitably and critically, how to formulate arguments and challenge texts. Learned a lot that expanded my view of metaphysics beyond traditional, strict analytic readings. ",
            "\u00a0This is a readings-based class, so those were the most important part. I learned how to analyze non-philosophical texts with a philosophical lens, but we were never tremendously rigorous philosophically speaking. You really just read the text and defended your interpretation of it from the other students/professor Levene. Still, the texts were very interesting and well worth reading and discussing. ",
            "\u00a0I seriously learned how to work through difficult texts in this class. This is not a class to take if you're trying to come away with a perfect understanding of the authors. If that's your goal, you're much better taking Marcy Shore's intellectual history or some lecture like that, where the professor will summarize key points of philosophy. Nancy Levene is much more interested in teaching you how to think than what to think. I'm still far from understanding exactly what Kierkegaard or Nietzsche is trying to say, but I am far better equipped to read difficult philosophy and tease it apart. ",
            "\u00a0Reading philosophers! Analyzing a text deeply - looking at its authorship as well as all its content. Writing a philosophy paper (first time). Writing a long paper arguing a single point (first time). Looking at philosophical texts through lenses of other texts. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to develop clear and convincing interpretations, as well as the relative value of those interpretations. ",
            "\u00a0This course introduced me to the writings of several key philosophical thinkers including Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and Kant. The philosophical readings also paired thoughtfully with the works of several prominent literary figures including Dostoyevsky, Kafka, and Morrison. The general thrust of the course, to my understanding, focussed on the transition in philosophical thought from an ethics grounded in first principals to actions justified through interpretation and historical reality. This course also aided my skills in seminar; Professor Levene focussed extensively on seminar conduct. By the end of the course, I felt as though I had improved as a contributing member of a seminar environment. ",
            "\u00a0Not many really. We read a few great texts in depth and then discussed them in seminar. The goal was to develop critical thinking by engaging with the texts and each other, but more than anything it became us interpreting texts however we wanted (which can sometimes be valid, but most of the time lead us completely astray). "

            "\u00a0Perhaps more assignments or participation requirement? Found some of the students became unengaged during discussion because they were unmotivated to participate. ",
            "\u00a0The course greatly challenges students to engage with dense texts and make arguments based on textual evidence! The texts are really hard but the experience is really rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0This course has a great reading list and Prof. Levene does an excellent job of pushing students to support their comments with the text. ",
            "\u00a0The course has a really interesting and engaging set of texts. I especially loved the inclusion of Toni Morrison and found it most helpful and appropriate. The class also did a good job of allowing us freedom to explore various topics in our writing while also giving us structure in the form of mandatory outlines and meetings with the professor to discuss said outlines. The weakness of the class lay in its discussion. The discussion was spotty and often ran around in circles. Much of the time the discussion escaped the texts and ventured into untethered territory, and I had difficulty following what was going on and what people were saying. ",
            "\u00a0Something that can be improved is the class composition and class size. seminar discussion was not always fruitful because people had different backgrounds in philosophy, different approaches and ideas. It would be good to find a way to control discussion. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course are in the texts that we read and in Professor Levene herself, who was an excellent and charismatic professor. A weakness, however, was that we could tend to focus on what were (in my opinion) unimportant parts of the text or poorly-founded interpretations of text. I think if we as a class could have all stepped back and decided definitively what aspect or theme of the text we wanted to analyze, discussion would have been more fruitful (but of course, that can be asking a lot). ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are the directions that the curated readings take us. However, seminar discussion was way too uncontrolled, so that we often spent too much time on areas that did not as consequential to the main themes we were looking at. Prof Levene could have better controlled the class, or even started out each session with a short lecture and then move on to the discussion. If not, seminar discussions often left me unsatisfied at both the pace and direction. ",
            "\u00a0I think the strength and the weakness is the same: this is an extremely student-driven, discussion-driven course. The advantage, is that Prof. Levene doesn't tell you what's going on in these texts, and it's up to you to work through it together. You'll definitely become a better thinker. It can also be frustrating that she rarely steps in to say yes that's right or no it's not. Sometimes it felt like she let us flounder for a little too long, and I would have appreciated slightly more guidance. However, in office hours she can be quite helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Readings are super well chosen and the class is run as a discussion-based seminar with just the right amount  of direction from the professor. Weakness is I wish we knew why it was called \"End if Metaphysics\" and what the theme between the texts were from the get go, would've been less confusing. ",
            "\u00a0Seminars are engaging, the material is fascinating and there's no real structure, which is what makes the class great. Not much else like it - a free space to shape and mold and take root intellectually. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this was a strong course. The main strength of this class is Professor Levene. She is a fabulous instructor and has set out to redefine the way seminars are facilitated on Yale's campus. She clearly takes teaching seriously and I was repeatedly impressed by her commitment to both the course material and the students around the seminar table. \r\nDiscussions of Fear and Trembling marked the most successful part of the course. I wish we had more opportunities to discuss Kierkegaard. The syllabus might have benefitted from other Kierkegaard texts. The class began to sag once we approached Nietzsche. In the second half of the semester, discussions felt untethered and generally lacked focus. As we were only assigned specific excerpts for the remainder of the class (exclusive of Beloved, which felt skimmed over as the semester rang to a close) , seminar would have benefitted from a stronger sense of direction. Instead of approaching an entire extended argument or whole text, we instead examined only small slivers of texts during the second half of the semester. This left me feeling slightly dissatisfied. Though Levene forwards a progressive model of seminar discussion that prizes free and open discussion lead by student interest, I felt as though she had curated specific selections of readings designed to elicit particular responses from students. That is to say: the goals of the course and the methodology of the course felt, for me, in conflict with one another. While on the one hand, Professor Levene wanted the students to lead discussion, on the other hand, I repeatedly felt as though she had a particular agenda and wanted for us all to arrive at a particular conclusion. To remedy this, I would recommend either keeping the open dialogue style of discussion (which I personally enjoyed) and swapping out curated reading selections in favor of reading entire books OR scrap the open dialogue model and keep the selected readings. ",
            "\u00a0Strength is that Prof. Levene is clearly brilliant and has spent a lot of time thinking about these texts. Weakness is that she doesn't really share any of that knowledge and gives the students complete control of the seminar. The times she does go on short lectures, they're often abstract and in response to students rather than the texts. That results s in some fascinating and engaging conversations, but in which you learn nothing about the texts' accepted or intended meanings/interpretations/intentions. "

            "\u00a0Yes! Again, great way to read some amazing works. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you want to challenge yourself intellectually, take it! But I would recommend taking it after one or two classes on intellectual history or something like that. You will get more out of it this way (in my opinion). ",
            "\u00a0This is an excellent course to take with Prof. Levene. She is great at keeping the class focused on the text and at synthesizing points made by students. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this course if you are interested in the idea of meaning how it is affected by modernity. The readings and the papers give you ample room to explore and develop your understanding of those ideas and their relation. The workload isn't too bad, and the professor is amazing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, as long as you're comfortable taking a class that's very heavily based in the readings (i.e., you actually have to do the readings). Also be aware that it isn't a super rigorous philosophy class, although whether that's a plus or a minus is up to you. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely, if you're down to not know exactly what's going on in really difficult texts are willing to go through the process of trying to figure stuff out. It can be frustrating to feel like there's an expert in the room in Prof. Levene who rarely is willing to give away the answers.... but that's also the best part of the course. You'll learn to read and think more critically than ever before. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - the caliber of other students was daunting to me at first as a freshman and not a philosophy major. But it's challenging and extremely rewarding. The philosophy is actually applicable to life. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It will never be the same course twice, but you'd be stupid not to take it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Professor Levene is a fantastic instructor and will make you a better reader, writer, and thinker. Don't miss out on an opportunity to study with her. ",
            "\u00a0Know exactly what you're in for and if it's your type of thing you'll love it. Don't take the class if you're doing it because the syllabus looks exciting. Do it if you're interested in Prof. Levene's unique seminar style, which is hard to get a grasp on during shopping period. "
