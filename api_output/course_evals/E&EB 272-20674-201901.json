            "\u00a0I knew nothing about birds going into this class, save knowing how to identify a handful of common ones. Suffice it to say that I now am much more conversant about birds and the whys and wherefores of avian critters, if not leaving the course knowing a lot more varieties of birds. ",

            "\u00a0I knew a lot about birds before this course, but I was amazed at how much there was still to learn. Facets of avian biology such as the avian lung or avian vision never ceased to amaze me. Furthermore, I learned a lot of things about science and the nature of the universe through the thought experiments that birds make possible. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about all different parts of bird science! It was really cool! ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much interesting facts about birds! I admittedly took this course mostly for a Sc credit, but I ended up really liking this course. Learned about the evolution of birds, feathers, and flight, as well as the anatomy and reproductive systems of birds. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so many cool things about birds. It was amazing. ",
            "\u00a0This course teaches a lot of biology, chemistry, and physics in a way that isn't overwhelming as it relates to birds. Fascinating lectures on birds' evolution from dinosaurs, the tubular growth of feathers, theories surrounding the evolution of flight, the physics of flight, nest architecture, compass/migration genetics, speciation, brood parasitism, and the revival of the Darwinian-Wallacian debate on sexual selection (this is the coolest lecture I've ever attended at Yale! Professor Prum's work on this subject completely changed my view of evolutionary biology--a must see). ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the biology of birds---a heck ton about the feather morphology (barbules, barb ridges, rachis, hooklets, etc) and how they are formed--and their behaviors. The lab, from what I hear, is more biodiversity and bird identification based. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about how birds evolved, how they fly, how feathers grow, how their bodies work, how they sing, etc. ",

            "\u00a0In the first part of the class, you learn about the evolution of birds, of feather, and of flight. You learn about feather morphology, why birds are dinosaurs, and how birds fly. In the second part of the class, we focus on avian biology, like their nervous system, how they perceive the world (hearing, vision, etc.), bird coloration, and many other topics. The last part of the class involves examinations of bird behavior, such as mating behavior, song learning, and breeding patterns. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about birds, and about scientific assessment of birds! I have never taken an EEB course before, and this was a thorough introduction, but sometimes very very challenging. ",

From the origin of birds to colors of birds to flight to neurobiology to song to mating and many many topics in between, I feel like I learned about many fundamental topics of ornithology as well as some groundbreaking topics. I gained a much greater appreciation for birds in this course. "

            "\u00a0There is too much graded work for this course. The exams require a lot of studying and memorization, and it's just not fair to have two midterms, a final exam, and a final research paper in a single SC credit for non-science majors. It can be difficult to follow what Professor Prum says: he goes through material really fast, and won't post lecture slides until a week before an exam. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course -- Professor Prum is so enthusiastic and knowledgable about the subject, and it was a real joy to take this class. There is a lot of information, but all of it is presented in an interesting and engaging manner. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are definitely the lectures. Prof Prum knows way too much about birds. I really enjoyed taking notes-- the one \"weakness\" of the course I can think of is that the lectures go so fast, if you can't write quickly (and Prof Prum doesn't allow computers in class) you're at a significant disadvantage as far as being able to record all the information (especially because he talks a lot more than what is covered on the slides) ",
            "\u00a0There werent enough grades I think so everything was weighed super heavy. But the class itself and the material was super interesting and the lectures were AWESOME ",
            "\u00a0There is a lot of material to cover but the workload doesn't feel too intense until the end of the course, when you have to both write your final paper and study for the final exam, which is cumulative. The exams evaluate how much you can memorize and regurgitate detailed (very detailed) information about the what we learned in lectures. The strength of this course is definitely the professor and the lectures, which are super entertaining. However, if you're not great at taking exams where you have to memorize a lot of info then good luck with it. Also, start early on the final paper! ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are highly entertaining and informative, and the exams were fair -- my only complaint may be how the work is heavily weighted toward the end of the semester. Professor Prum has honed this course over the years, and it is very well taught. ",
            "\u00a0The material is very interesting, but not super related. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Prum is a great lecturer. Material was presented clearly.\r\nWeaknesses: not a lot of guidance on the final paper, but wasn't a huge deal. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely  loved this class. You will learn more than you thought you could possibly know about birds, and if that is something that you are interested in you will have an amazing time in this class. I was in the lab as well, and would definitely plug the lab as well, it was fascinating in its own right, and was a really nice tool to help physically illustrate concepts that we discussed in class.\r\n\r\nI have never been more interested and attentive in a 9:25 am lecture than I was for this class, even if I was consistently three to five minutes late every single day. Rick's style and zeal for the material are infectious, and I spent more time telling my friends about this class than anyone could have possibly wanted.\r\n\r\nThis was far and away my favorite class of the semester, and  definitely a contender for all time favorite class period. As I have said all year, it is amazing how often bird-related fun facts come up in general conversation, especially when you bring them up at every possible opportunity. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were engaging but occasionally sped through--the course moves very fast ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were very engaging, and there is a lot of interesting material discussed. The only downfall of this course would be that the lecture slides were only posted a few days before the exams. I would've appreciated if the slides would be put up after the unit was complete if not after the lecture. ",
            "\u00a0I wish that instead of having three midterms, there was a homework component that would replace one of the midterms and that would reinforce in-class learning. ",
            "\u00a0It is a lot of work. Would recommend having only either the final paper or examination rather than both. Why are there 2 midterms? not at 9.25am pls. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the professor. He is extraordinary. However, I feel like having 3 exams and an essay was excessive. ",
            "\u00a0The course is extremely fair regarding testing. if you pay attention in lecture and study, the tests will not throw any curveballs. The lectures are also very interesting, and a joy to attend. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Prum ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were engaging and the slides supplemented the lecture but did not give the lecture. Professor Prum is very knowledgeable in the field of ornithology. The workload fluctuated throughout the semester, since there was a final paper and a final examination. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course could have been improved through more thorough weekly engagement - it would have been good to have section with the TAs and/or weekly quizzes that held us accountable for the knowledge we were picking up. I thought the syllabus was well-written though! It would have been good to have more guidance on the papers. ",
            "\u00a0It's an incredible course. I wouldn't change a thing. Professor Prum is an incredibly animated and entertaining lecture, and I had a blast everyday. I can't imagine any other course and any other professor that could make me excited to learn at 9:25 in the morning on a Friday. This truly is a special course. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course is that the material is very interesting, and the two midterms help one stay on top of the material. A weakness is that it was hard not to procrastinate. It would have been helpful if there was some incentive or encouragement to start the paper before reading week. ",
            "\u00a0Writing a ten-page lit review felt a little irrelevant but other than that I thought the class was well run and organized. ",
            "\u00a0This course was really interesting and covered lots of interesting topics. One thing that could be improved is making more information accessible on the slides. The presentation slides were primarily visual aides, meaning that most of the important information was only delivered orally. This made it harder to study and review information, because if your notes were confusing, there was no source of information to refer to. This was also a problem if you missed any of the lectures--there was one day where I was 10 minutes late to class, and missed all the information on a physiological system. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Prum's attitude in class makes learning a very simple task. He is clearly excited about what he is teaching, it is easy for you to become excited as well. He is genuinely happy to receive questions about the material because he clearly loves birds, and that love is contagious. That would be the biggest positive to the course. On the negative side, the tests were too long, and needlessly stressful because of that. There is a difference between not knowing the material and not writing fast enough to explain it all because you didn't know you would have to, and the tests seemed to not allow any real room for thinking. They felt more like a race than a test of knowledge. "

        [
            "\u00a0This is not an easy SC credit, but it is definitely accessible to non-science majors--it just requires a lot of memorization (and organization on the student's part in order to be able to memorize, since the material is not clearly presented). Still, though, there's a lot of interesting material in this course, and it's fun to be taught by the field's leading expert. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course: yes, it is a lot of material, and yes, the tests can be challenging, but this course is fascinating and very well taught, and I really enjoyed it, even though ornithology has absolutely nothing to do with my selected major. ",
            "\u00a0Totally! If you like writing lots of notes, and don't mind that your grade essentially comes from two tests (where it's really only possible to do well if you can write super quickly, because time constraints) and a final/final paper. ",

I took this for my second science credit as a spring semester senior because I didn't have that many options that worked with my schedule. I ended up putting a lot of work into this class because you can't just cruise through it (unless you're a bird expert already). The science content itself is not very challenging, but you have to master a lot of material about birds (flight, origins, reproduction, migration, vision etc...). Take it if you're ready to put in the work! It's very interesting and the lectures are great (even if they are M, W, F at 9:25am). ",
            "\u00a0YES YES YES. It is very rare to find a course that is taught by a world-renown expert who actually knows how to teach well. The lectures are very engaging and accessible, even to someone who last thought about biology sophomore year of high school. Professor Prum makes a serious effort make the material relevant to everyone, no matter their background. However, note: this is not a gut SC credit. The exams and paper are not to be taken lightly, and you do need to go to lecture to succeed. ",

            "\u00a0Yes! A really great course that I actually feel like I learned a lot from. Professor Prum is also very passionate about the subject which makes learning much more fun. Also, as someone who isn't majoring in pre-med related fields this felt like a great course (not too gutty, but also not too \"STEM\"-y). Definitely recommend. ",
            "\u00a0YES YES YES YES YES YES YES\r\n\r\nBut only if you are interested in birds. Don't take it as an easy science class because it isn't, take it because you are interested in the material and because the idea of waking up early each morning to hear one of the best ornithologists in the world talk about his research (it seems like he discovered 90% of what the world knows about birds), and the general state of the field sounds like the best thing ever.\r\n\r\n12/10 stars from me, and a big thank you to Rick and Liam and Courtney for being amazing, and probably the other TA who I never met. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but it is a lot of work requiring a lot of studying if you don't like science. If you are up for the challenge it is well worth it ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student! Professor Prum is really knowledgable and also a wonderful lecturer (he sometimes makes really funny comments during his lectures). So, the class is really engaging despite being a 9:25 am class. The class does go through a lot of content and there are 3 exams including the final, and a final paper, but as long as you pay attention and take notes, you should be fine. The content of all the exams are also relatively predictable--they are cumulative but with greater focus on the most recently learned material, but do require you to know the information discussed during the lectures. Take this class to learn more about how cool birds are!! ",
            "\u00a0I took this as a science distributional requirement, and although it was difficult, I do not regret it. This is not a gut class, but I think it is worth it if you are really interested in learning more about the world. ",
            "\u00a0THIS IS NOT A GUT.\r\n\r\ni would, simply because professor prum is a great professor who is incredibly engaging and insightful. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - if you are not taking a class with Prof. Prum while at Yale you are wasting your money. ",

However, this class does involve going to lecture everyday so that you know the material and a normal amount of studying. If you do plan on taking this class, plan for having a final paper and exam so that you can allot time for both of those large assignments. ",

I also took the optional lab, and I would strongly urge anyone taking this class to take the lab as well. If you don't take the lab, you are truly missing out.
