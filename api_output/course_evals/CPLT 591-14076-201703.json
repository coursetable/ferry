            "\u00a0I learned about the rich history of secondary criticism surrounding the Aeneid. I learned how to further appreciate the dreamlike uncertainties of this dense, fascinating, and complicated poem. ",
            "\u00a0I gained new insights into Latin literature, and the discipline of the classics more generally. I gained skills reading classical commentaries. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a new respect for the complexity and multi-layered nature of Virgil's Aeneid.\r\n\r\nThe course gave students a strong sense of the history of scholarship on the poem, especially in the 20th century. "

            "\u00a0I love the format of the course: each week reading Vergils poetry in Latin and accompanying English secondary sources. The long classes gave us time to get into a rhythm of discussion where I learned from my classmates as well as my professors. ",
            "\u00a0The courses strengths were its people: two instructors of unmatched expertise and charm, smart and engaged students, and a Latin author of inexhaustible richness. \r\n\r\nThe weaknesses were few, but were mainly that there weren't always clear expectations. It would have been nice to have had an online discussion forum where we needed to post weekly reading responses, so that students could be more engaged. ",
            "\u00a0More substantial opportunities for student-led discussion may have helped stimulate class conversation. Perhaps, shifting student presentations away from secondary literature and toward fifty or hundred line chunks of the poem would do this. "

            "\u00a0Yes! The opportunity to read a wildly difficult text slowly with two experts is not to be missed. "
