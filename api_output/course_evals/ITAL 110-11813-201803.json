            "\u00a0I came in with absolutely no knowledge of the Italian language, and left with the ability to essentially converse in Italian. The class focuses on listening, speaking, reading and writing, and because the class in conducted fully in Italian every single day, I was able to work on all of these skills without specifically intending to. ",
            "\u00a0I've learned elementary Italian and can understand about half of the dialogue in a given movie, and the majority when subtitles are on, either in Italian or english. ",
            "\u00a0I have a really solid understanding of basic Italian language. After just one semester I am able to stand in front of the class and have a ten minute conversation in Italian! ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to speak in basic Italian verbally and in written form. I also have new basic listen and reading comprehension in the language. ",
            "\u00a0I was given an engaging, fun introduction to italian (mostly vocab and grammar). I also practiced speaking through conversations with my classmates and through answering questions from my teacher. ",
            "\u00a0By taking this course I was able to develop several skills necessary in order to learn how to properly communicate and write in Italian. I learned a great amount of vocabulary as well as grammar rules to write in Italian and convey messages that took place either in the past or in the present. I feel as though I was able to learn enough Italian to have a fairly extended dialogue with an Italian person as well as more than enough to go visit the country as a tourist. "

            "\u00a0The course is definitely a commitment, as it meets Monday through Friday and Professor Farina gives daily quizzes, but the class is always entertaining and the assessments are very fair. Because unit tests happen almost every week, the stakes aren't very high, and grades are composed of lots of different factors (compositions, presentations, quizzes, etc.) which is also really helpful. I have very few complaints with this class, but it would be nice if we could get our assignments back a little bit sooner. ",
            "\u00a0This class had a quiz every day (under professor Farina) which helped keep me diligent on studying every day, ultimately resulting in a more thorough understanding and a lasting knowledge of vocabulary. ",
            "\u00a0I love the we all are given opportunities to speak out loud and that the class is taught practically 100% in Italian. ",
            "\u00a0Teaching languages everyday is extremely helpful. Also, learning through conversations and immersion is much better than translation. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Michael Farina is a lively, fun, and caring teacher, and he made a morning class that could have been something to dread something really enjoyable. Other strengths were the interactions with classmates (small class size) and when we listened to italian music/watched italian movies.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Could feel repetitive just\r\nto go through textbook exercises, and I would have liked more conversation and more italian culture. ",
            "\u00a0I really have trouble finding any weaknesses with the course. Some of the strengths include how the course is taught, which has a perfect blend between self-learning and perfecting the content in class by going over it and getting more insight and clarification from the professor. Furthermore, the tests and assignments are a fair reflection of the material taught and don't contain any tricks if you learn it well. The course is excellent and contains a wide array of activities to keep students engaged as well as resources to further practice the material. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in Italian or wants to take a more fun, easygoing foreign language course. You will have to commit to studying and doing work on a daily basis, but as long as you do commit an hour or so each day, you're practically guaranteed to do well. ",
            "\u00a0This course is the most fun course I've taken at Yale. I highly suggest taking this course under Michael Farina if you are willing to do the work. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you are looking for a language, you seriously could not pick a better one! Italian is beautiful and useful. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Italian is a beautiful language and Michael is a very patient and helpful teacher. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Professor Farona was fantastic and always made class exciting and engaging (a particularly challenging feat given that class took place at 9:25). In just a semester all of our Italian improved dramatically. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you are looking for a new language, this course was really enjoyable and a fun class to go to every day. Take it with Michael Farina! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I'd definitely recommend this course to another student. The number of resources and time the professors will put into making sure you learn and understand the material can't be compared to other Yale courses or departments because it is much superior. You will get feedback and will get the help you need if you struggle. "
