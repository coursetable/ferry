The class was already small to begin with so many students just stopped showing up. It's not that the professors were bad, but that it's a topic students aren't interested in. I don't know if there could be any way to make the environmental health courses more appealing to other department students, but it would definitely be something to look into because pretty much all the students I've talked to have dreaded the course they had to take to fulfill that requirement.
