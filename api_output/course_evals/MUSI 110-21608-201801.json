            "\u00a0Solid foundation of music theory ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot of about introductory music theory and how to listen to classical music. Learned about the fundamentals of what sounds good and how to build up from there. ",
            "\u00a0I came in to this course with absolutely no knowledge of music (besides 3 months of piano lessons when I was 9). After taking this class, I feel I have grasped the fundamentals of music theory. Originally, learning the concepts felt almost as if I was learning a new language, but with the help of Professor Lalli, it came easily. However, to get the most out of this course (both in terms of grade and knowledge), you must put maximum effort and investment into it. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a general understanding of intervals, triads, sevenths, and some harmonic functions. I learned how to analyze and appreciate real music. I developed listening abilities and practice with playing and composing on a keyboard. "

        [
            "\u00a0I wish there was more singing. Otherwise the course was wonderful. I really appreciated the small class size. ",
            "\u00a0I love how small the class was and how interactive it was. ",
            "\u00a0One of the key characteristics of this course is both a weakness and a strength. Due to the way Professor Lalli conducted the course, much of the material (the order, the amount of time we would spend on each concept) seemed random and sporadic. Initially, this bothered me, as it differed from the usual structure of most Yale courses. However, I learned that this teaching style was most conducive to learning, as it caused myself and my fellow students to remain on our toes and pushed us to put in time outside of the classroom to fully grasp a concept before building upon it. A lot of this course involves self-teaching, due to the pace of the class which was at times fast for me, so if this is not something you are willing to do, I would not recommend the course. "

            "\u00a0Do it. And take it with Lalli. He is the kindest man and he cares about his students an immense amount. He brightens your day whenever you see him. The course is a great intro to theory- I went from not knowing a bass from treble clef to having the language to engage classical and pop music and play piano. ",
            "\u00a0If you love music but feel like you have never known enough about the theory behind it to truly appreciate it, if you are trying to build a solid foundation to write your own music, or if you are just looking for a fun 5th or Credit D class, this is the class for you. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, Professor Lali creates an environment where students of all skill levels can feel comfortable learning and sharing music. The course is great if you have some musical interest but want to get your feet wet with a little bit of theory and actually begin to understand how music is written and understood. The exposure to classical pieces weekly keeps students engaged and assignments such as compositions give the student a feeling of efficacy. It really helps when you get to the end of the year and you cant help but notice chord progressions in any piece of music you see. "
