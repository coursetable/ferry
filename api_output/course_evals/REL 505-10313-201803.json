            "\u00a0Actually it was Matt, but he's not listed! ",
            "\u00a0She is smart, engaging, respectful. She is wonderful! The only critique is that she sometimes lets loud, overpowering students control the section. It's okay to silence people. ",
            "\u00a0Anne Schiffe was an excellent instructor. She was confident in the face of a difficult group in the classroom. She was intellectually prepared and solid with the material. She solicited input from each student and respected such input from all. She could improve by continuing to do this work and continuing to offer her extraordinary gifts to this and other learning communities. She was amazing. ",
            "\u00a0Anne was a thoughtful, rigorous teacher who asked us to engage in the readings in meaningful ways. She employed a number of pedagogical approaches to engage the class and help us make connections between secondary readings and the assigned texts.\r\n\r\nShe also did a good job of keeping the class on track, which could have been challenging given the number of big personalities in the class and the emotional/personal stakes of the material for some of those people.\r\n\r\nAnne made herself available for consultation regarding our assignments, and offered constructive feedback that was clearly aimed at improving our work. She took us seriously and pushed our scholarship. Being in her class was a pleasure. ",
            "\u00a0Anne was a great TF. She always had a plan for each section and executed successfully. I liked the way she varied the dynamics of the sections as well (discussions in large group vs. pairs for example). ",
            "\u00a0I actually had Matthew but for some reason he's not an option here. I found Matthew not the most engaging, although our section did have good discussions. I did really appreciate when we broke up into groups to discuss questions. ",
            "\u00a0Facilitated discussion\r\nResponsive to class needs ",
            "\u00a0Anne was a wonderful discussion leader. Her lessons were thoughtfully planned out and she answered student questions/ facilitated conversation with great dexterity. ",
            "\u00a0Anne was a great TF. She provided helpful feedback. I would have appreciated if she had responded to emails in a more timely manner (one email I sent took almost a week for a response). I would have also appreciated if she spoke much, much slower. I appreciated how she kept the class focused, entertained multiple viewpoints, and did a really good job with breaking down the material for us. ",
            "\u00a0I can't say enough good things about Anne's teaching.  She brings a lot of energy to her teaching.  Her cheerful demeanor made it very fun to learn with her.  She is adept at classroom management, and understands how to use different discussion formats (large group, small group, pair, etc) to encourage participation from everyone in the class.  In terms of content, she was particularly helpful at getting us to synthesize lecture material with secondary readings. ",
            "\u00a0Anne did an excellent job of leading our section discussions. I would advise that she slow down how fast she talks. She did an excellent job of that during her class presentation. \r\n\r\nAt times it would be helpful to explain some of the theories or answers to questions. Often Anne uses the pedagogy of asking other students to answer questions asked by students; however, sometimes we just need an answer from the TF. ",
            "\u00a0My teaching fellow was actually Matthew Siebert, but I can't seem to select him. We had excellent section discussions. The only thing he needs to do is be more confident in leading the discussions! :) ",
            "\u00a0Excellent teacher. Patient. Uses small group work well. Sorry she won't be with us in the spring. ",
            "\u00a0My TF was Matt. ",
            "\u00a0Anne was a great tf. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing all around ",
            "\u00a0Anne was enthusiastic, eager to assist, and clearly has a deep understanding and passion for the material. She could be more powerful in the classroom, guiding discussions in more fruitful ways rather than letting them meander. That, of course, is a personal choice. ",
            "\u00a0Anne is very approachable, kind, and earnest. She's very good at creating engaging conversation. In terms of improvement, Anne can only improve in continuing to hone her facilitation skills-- at times, section got a little away from the question of the day. ",
            "\u00a0He was very kind and gave great paper comments, but he spoke a lot in section and didn't know how to make the conversation equal. As a result, a few boys dominated the conversation and interrupted the girls at times. ",
            "\u00a0Tim was a wonderful TF. ",
            "\u00a0Kind, Great at facilitating discussions, available for questions, sense of humor, familiarity with the material. ",
            "\u00a0Tim is a good TF, but he returned the feedbacks on the second essay too late. Generally, I think he is good at facilitating discussion. However. I appreciate more constructive and in-depth discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Timothy Gannett was not my TF. My TF was Matthew Siebert. I did not feel that Matthew was a good TF at all. He was very removed from discussions and unhelpful on the exam reviews (for example, he would tell the section both during scheduled sections and reviews: \"Today, we will be talking about what you want to talk about\" and expressed how he would set an agenda in order to allow students to maximize their interests). The rankings I will give are for Matthew Siebert. ",
            "\u00a0He was great at facilitating discussion. ",
            "\u00a0My teaching fellow was actually Matthew Siebert, but I can't seem to select him. We had excellent section discussions. The only thing he needs to do is be more confident in leading the discussions! :) ",
            "\u00a0Tim encouraged maximum participation of all members and guided our discussions in a competent way. ",
            "\u00a0Great for answering questions, helped stir up lively conversations in section and was self-aware to not do most of the pulling or talking. ",
            "\u00a0Tim was a fantastic section leader -- he established and maintained a safe and productive discussion space and consistently used interesting methods of dialogue to engage the texts. He was highly responsive via email and compassionate and level when challenges arose. ",
            "\u00a0I had to select a listed answer, but Timothy Gannett was not my TF, Matthew Siebert was. While Matthew was generally clear and helpful, on occasion he could have been clearer/more decisive in his expectations regarding essays and written assignments. ",
            "\u00a0I had Matthew, but his name was not available for selection. ",
            "\u00a0Timothy was a kind person and easy to talk to. He was not great at facilitating conversation and seemed unsure in sections. He was also not great about challenging his students to think deeper or to question theological interpretations of the text. ",
            "\u00a0Tim provided me with the best written feedback I have gotten at YDS. He is constantly available to talk with students who have questions, in person or in email. He leads good section discussions as well. ",
            "\u00a0He is very understanding and kind, but he rarely gave his input in class discussions. Some inputs are necessary for better facilitation of discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Timothy was a great resource for us and helped us to focus our attention on key articles for our discussion sessions. His email reminders really helped to prioritize our readings in preparation for our session, and he set an open, friendly, respectful tone for discussions.\r\n\r\nThe only suggestion that I currently have is that the email reminders would be more helpful if they are sent at least 1-2 days earlier. ",
            "\u00a0Tim's knowledge of the material was outstanding! He was able to lead discussions while holding space for all students participate if they wanted to contribute. I appreciated taking time in the first discussion to create a community as a discussion rather than dive straight into the material. ",
            "\u00a0I did not have Tim Gannett - no option has been given for Matthew Siebert. Matthew grew in his confidence over the course of the semester. He could improve by better directing class discussion away from unimportant, tangential topics that students often get consumed with back to agenda/readings at hand. I thought his lecture at the end of the semester was well done. ",
            "\u00a0Answering questions outside of class ",
            "\u00a0Excellent TF who provided feedback and was available outside of class and section. ",
            "\u00a0Timothy was clear about the expectations of course-work. By the middle of the semester, we were able to have productive discussions. I would suggest that more time should be given to discussion rather than to house-keeping issues. He understood the material and was able to direct discussions well. ",
            "\u00a0Timothy did a great job of creating a variety of formats for section, which allowed the group to focus on items that were most relevant for each week's topic focus. For instance, instead of simply discussing the articles we read each week, we would sometimes break into pairs or small groups before sharing with the whole section. Sometimes this meant drawing comparisons between the gospels, performing a detailed reading/analysis of a specific passage, or examining a miracle account in a non-biblical ancient text. This allowed us to learn something specific and useful (such as how ancient historiography differs from modern, or how New Testament scholars might approach differences in parallel passages) that would have likely been more difficult to cover if we just had a large-group discussion of the readings every week.\r\nAdditionally, Timothy gave our section a lot of guidance and resources in writing papers - which was very welcome since many of us were unfamiliar with exegesis research/writing - and was always available and responsive via email. ",
            "\u00a0Tim was a kind and understanding section leader, who took interest in his students and facilitated good conversation. I often felt that there was more he wanted to say and that there were angles of interpretation he wanted to give voice to that he chose not to. I couldn't help but wonder if he was constrained by instructions that Professor Dinkler gave him, and I feel that my educational experience would have been greatly improved if Tim were allowed to speak more freely.
