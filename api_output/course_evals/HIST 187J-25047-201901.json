            "\u00a0YES!!! Prof. Todd is the best (esp if you're a minority who hasn't felt heard by professors in the past), she is so perceptive and ready to listen to all of your experiences and talk about how they relate to the subject matter. It's such an interesting topic and interweaving with medical history was able to bring to light a lot of information that we aren't usually exposed to. ",

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend students to take Science, Settlers, and Starvation! The readings are super interesting and focus more on Indigenous communities and the settler state in a Canadian context. Professor Todd gave us so much insight and perspective into Indigenous life in Canada and taught us about a more global perspective. Professor Todd made this class so enjoyable. The class had a few readings each week (not a lot), and we were able to think about all of them in depth. This class helped foster a healthy learning environment and was super enjoyable! I 100% recommend! "
