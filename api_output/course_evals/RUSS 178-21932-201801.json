            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend taking advanced language courses in Russian, as the topics they cover are much more interesting than topics covered in other language courses. ",

            "\u00a0Would absolutely recommend to another student. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. Julia Titus is absolutely the best Russian professor there is. She cares so much about all her students. Thank you! ",
            "\u00a0The literature is cool (too many duels for my taste, though), but the professor is not a great discussion leader. Intimidating to talkI felt like the professor was always waiting for me to finish whenever I said anything. ",
            "\u00a0This course is an excellent way to become familiar with Russian literature and some of its most famous authors. The four essays you write during the course of the semester help you to develop your formal writing skills greatly and facilitate a deeper analysis of the texts covered. I highly recommended this course for anyone interested in Russian literature or even Russian in general. Professor Titus is amazing and class will never not be fun and engaging. "
