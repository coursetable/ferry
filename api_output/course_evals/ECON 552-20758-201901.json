Not only was she difficult to understand, but each lecture lacked any kind of structure or cohesiveness.\r\n\r\nThe course could be vastly improved by giving it a structure. Also, it would be helpful to present and discuss methods other than Sieve estimation, and to point out advantages and shortcomings of different methods. Generally, I would prefer instructors who do not mostly teach from their own papers.\r\n\r\nGiven the circumstances and the material he was asked to cover, the TA did a great job. ",
            "\u00a0The class was fantastic. It provided me with all the necessary resources to advance my knowledge in the field. \r\nI would have enjoyed doing an application of the methods we learned with real data (as well as the simulation study). In general, I prefer a class at a slower pace but with more detailed exposition. I would also prefer to have two classes per week rather than one class lasting longer. ",
