            "\u00a0This class uses the writings of Stanislavksi, Hagen, Twyla Tharp, and Sarah Ruhl as the core for considering not only the process of an actor, but the process of an artist overall. Through improv, short exercises, warm-up activities, scene work, monologues, and writing, this class is an exploration of that process and putting it all into play. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the techniques and processes of forming character and constructing performances. I learned about different styles of approaching character development, and found different physical and emotional exercises to get there. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This class has good core texts and remembers to consider how all aspects of the actor's life and process are important to acting itself. The class also teaches so many useful little exercises and shows how even some random games or things can relate to acting. The workload is a little bit of a juggle, as often readings, discussion responses, daily writing, and longer rehearsals are all required in preparation for class. The middle unit on scene work lasted several weeks, and perhaps could have been balanced better by dividing class time with a little more time for exercises or other warm-ups before diving right into scenes for the whole duration of class. ",
            "\u00a0One of the strengths of this course was the chance to work on different pieces (monologues, scenes, etc.) on a weekly basis. There were a variety of creative and engaging activities in class like improv exercises, games, and different creative exercises. I think class was definitely fun and engaging.\r\n\r\nProbably the greatest weakness of the class was that there was a lot of work assigned outside of class (essays, movies, reading assignments, daily writing, discussion posts, and preparing performances with other people). Sometimes their connection to the class was not entirely clear, so it felt like you were putting a lot of effort into something that wasn't fully incorporated into the class which was frustrating. I also wish that working on scenes was more collaborative or a discussion, because sometimes you would just watch the professor work with other people on a scene for a day, and not speak the whole class. I wish there had been more of an opportunity for discussion about what we were seeing. ",
            "\u00a0I found that the class was relatively laid-back and enjoyed most of the class time, I felt the exercises were engaging and helpful. I particularly liked doing improvisation and status exercises. I found Hal's notes on the monologues and scenes to be extremely insightful and very helpful on improving the pieces. I didn't love doing morning pages, maybe this is only because it is 30 minutes of writing a day and the time was difficult to manage with consistency. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes! Hal does a great job teaching you to become a better actor and pushes you out of your comfort zone. ",
            "\u00a0I think that an actor should definitely take this class, as the writings and theories of the core figures of the class are important to know. This class also just asks you to learn more about yourself as an artist, which is so beneficial. ",
            "\u00a0The class was more or less an intro class. Anyone who didnt take THST 210 with Toni Dorfman should definitely consider taking this class. People who took Tonis class might benefit less from this class but it may still be worth it for dedicated actors. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to someone who is interested in performance and think that someone of any skill level can benefit form this class! I really enjoyed it and found it could be beneficial to people with a range of different levels of experience. "
