            "\u00a0From taking this course, I learned basic statistical principles that are important for biostasticial analysis. For example, I was introduced to power analysis, which is necessary to determine how many subjects are needed to confidently say ones findings are significant. In addition, I learned the basics of IBM's SPSS, which may facilitate analysis of data I produce in the future. "

            "\u00a0A strength of the course is that both statistical theory and the practical application of the theory are integrated well. The lab section of the course is helpful in emphasizing the important equations and theories discussed during lecture.\r\n\r\nA weakness of the course is that it attempts to consolidate a complex topic in two weeks and, as a result, many of the lectures are rushed and it was difficult at times to stay on top of the material. Extending the course by a few days or a week may alleviate this issue. "

Additionally, it provides resources that will benefit biomedical researchers beyond the time in lecture. "
