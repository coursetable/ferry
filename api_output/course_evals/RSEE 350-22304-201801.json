            "\u00a0This is an interesting course on the history and network/cultural theory behind the development of the Internet, with an excitingly diverse and topical syllabus. This was the first year it was taught. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how the internet happened, and also practiced skills in thinking about how to critically evaluate different perspectives, sources, and narratives. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about network structures and what I guess is called digital media theory. I didn't have much theoretical background until this class. ",
            "\u00a0This has been one of the most shocking classes I have taken at Yale. I gained a massive amount of perspective about issues of internet policy. ",
            "\u00a0This class gives you a great overview of the history of the internet/personal computing, a general understanding of concepts like network theory, and exposure to current issues around technology and the internet. The scope is really broad, but you have the opportunity to really focus on things that you're actually interested in with the assignments. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this was a great class for learning about todays technology and the cultures that have emerged as a result. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the history of the internet and how networks form. It was very interesting to learn about the internet through a humanities lense. ",

            "\u00a0Broad knowledge of history of the internet and computers from 19th century origins to 21st century recent developments. Strong introduction to sociological concepts like information and network theory. Analysis of different cultures on the internet and effective methods of film/media studies. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a better understanding of the history of computing and the internet, as well as at least a beginning knowledge of how the internet works. I saw how networks affect our lives both on and offline, and an understanding of the different approaches to the internet. I also learned to look at texts critically to evaluate their arguments and compare them with opposing texts. ",
            "\u00a0I learned why the state of the Internet is the way it is--the history behind its making, the trends that helped it progress, and the people and culture that drive it today. ",
            "\u00a0this class was absolutely amazing ",
            "\u00a0This class has helped me develop the skills I need for further graduate work. Not only was the material applicable to what I am interested in, but the professors were incredibly welcoming and help develop my academic interests. ",

            "\u00a0This course was interesting at times, but a lot of the lectures and course material felt disorganized and disconnected. The readings we did at the beginning of the semester seemed to fit nicely together, but the second half of the course felt very much like a series of discrete topics. A lot of the second half was also based in current/timely events that I already knew about, so I felt quite disinterested and like I was not learning much. The lectures were also often very reductive and simplified; I felt as though the professors and TFs could have gone a little more in depth about fewer topics rather than giving reductive versions of many topics. The beginning half of the class taught me quite a lot about the formation of the internet, and I was left wanting to focus on that rather than on niche aspects of current events and odd occurrences. ",
            "\u00a0I think we spend too much time on the history of the computer and other physical technologies at the beginning of the course. The professors did admirably well incorporating daily news updates and items into the course, however, as internet cultures are evolving every day (and at the time we were taking the course, the Cambridge Analytica Facebook scandal went down). ",
            "\u00a0A strength of the course is its broadness, in that it invites students to come at it through the perspective of their own backgrounds. I think this was also challenging at times-- the material felt somewhat surface-level, and the lectures often felt like re-hashings of the readings, I think because there was so much to cover. ",
            "\u00a0The course harped a bit too much on the history during the first part. We spent a lot of time learning a historical framework but then rushed through some of the most interesting material at the end. ",
            "\u00a0This course included an incredible selection of readings, each of which was highly revolutionary to me. However, the volume of readings assigned in the beginning of the course a bit heavy, while the volume assigned in the second half of the course was a bit too light for me. Additionally, the professors and TAs provided an incredible amount of support and feedback. ",
            "\u00a0It's obviously a huge topic, and since this is a new course I think the professors were trying to figure out the best approach. Overall, I thought their approach was a little too broad, although there's definitely huge benefits to learning about the history of the internet, which is something we use every day but take for granted. You could tell in section that people weren't that invested in the course sometimes, or people would be invested in specific topics that didn't really match up with what other people were interested in and you couldn't really have a conversation. ",
            "\u00a0I thought there was a lot of reading but it was interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I felt like there wasnt a clear structure - while it was informative, I think it often assumed the class knew less about digital culture than we did. I found it really interesting how many of what the students have simply grown up with are being explained academically in different terms, and that would have been interesting to tease out through the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the lectures by the professors who were phenomenal speakers. However, I wish there was less of a focus on history and more focus on present-day internet cultures because the topic is more relevant to today. ",
            "\u00a0An overall very enjoyable class. Readings were a big strong point and often a pleasure. One counterexample was the week involving philosophy (second to last section, I think), which was just... godawful. Like, criminally incomprehensible to everyone in my section.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of the semester was marred by the double-professor switch-offs. Quality of instruction improved substantially after the first few weeks when the professors had a more solid dynamic.\r\n\r\nThe first third of the semester could/should be compressed. It's not a HSHM class -- Prof. Ragas in the HSHM department could be recruited for a lecture midway through the semester for historical context, perhaps. I wish the later 2/3rds of the class were the entire class. The history felt a bit \"so what?\" / out of scope at times. I love history, but that's not what I most wanted from the class.\r\n\r\nThe last few weeks were probably more what people were expecting from the class as a whole, and it showed. I particularly enjoyed the piracy bits and links with Slavic/Eastern European Studies.\r\n\r\nI think people would've liked more applied discussions, e.g., explicitly that \"this lecture is on XYZ community on Tumblr/Reddit/whatever\" and all of the concepts framed around those lenses. This happened during the semester, but lecture ",
            "\u00a0I thought the topic was really interesting, and the professors were both very clearly engaged with the topic. At the beginning of the semester though, it felt like the lectures didn't really add much to the readings, and I think I still felt that way a bit by the end. The lectures themselves, especially in the \"cultures\" unit, were usually very interesting but not very informational, so I would've liked to see more concrete substance there. The assignments were really interesting--we had to write our own wikipedia page (but we didn't have to post them) for one assignment, and then edit each other's pages on a private wiki-like space for a different assignment. For the end of the year, though, I think it would have been cooler to do an assignment that wasn't just a simple paper, like some sort of social media simulation or making our own creative media project. Overall, though, I enjoyed the course! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- covered interesting material. \r\nWeaknesses- lectures were sometimes rather disorganized, making it hard to tell which whose view was being explained or analyzed or what the trajectory was supposed to be. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very interesting subject material, great professors (M&M are both so kind, intelligent, and open to student feedback!), interesting readings, reasonable and fairly graded assignments.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: due to this being the first year the class was taught, the syllabus/reading schedule was sometimes uneven week to week, TFs varied in background so experience and specific type of engagement with subject matter largely depended on TF, vague/unclear expectations for some assignments (but definitely graded fairly) ",
            "\u00a0This course was a really great overview of the history of the internet, and had a really interesting approach to how the internet is used in our everyday lives as well as how it influences and affects our culture. I thought that both professors were really good and split up the material quite well. The assignments were interesting, I liked how they were more than just a standard paper, and I think the professors did a good job of incorporating technology as well as current events into the class.\r\n\r\nAlthough I generally enjoyed the readings, I think the professors sometimes assigned too much which discouraged doing the reading at all. In addition, they would sometimes go over the readings in class, which further deincentivized doing the readings outside of class. I think shorter selections would allow students to do a more careful reading, and lecture would be improved by bringing in more outside materials and ideas. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the professors were very receptive and encouraging of student feedback (they gave us midterm evaluation forms to give them feedback), the course was well organized, the outside material (readings, movies, clips, etc.) were very engaging and relevant, and the assignment prompts were open-ended to allow for a variety of submissions.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the professors tended to use lecture time to summarize and comment on the readings, which incentivized students to either go to lecture or do the readings, but not both, since one could get the same material from either the readings or lecture. It would've been better if the professors had utilized lecture time to present overarching ideas or trends about the subject matter--that is, the traditional lecture format. In the beginning, there was also too much reading. Since this was a new course, it also seemed that the professors didn't know exactly what they were looking for from the assignments--the overall structure of how assignments were supposed to be was often vague and required many clarifying questions. ",
            "\u00a0I do not think the history section needed as much time as it was given, and I think some of the books (Issacson, Watts) could have been left out, but everything else was incredible, including the assignments and section. ",
            "\u00a0The material is interesting, but sections bordered on too philosophical and abstract to actually be relevant, and since there was no midterm or final and only one paper engagement was low. ",
            "\u00a0There's the potential for a lot of interesting discussion here, but it was at time difficult to understand the lenses through which each text was to be approached, critiqued and analyzed. But then again this is the first time this has been taught and I can see this becoming a really wonderful course. ",
            "\u00a0STRENGTHS: fantastic curriculum covering an eclectic breadth of issues.\r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES: at the start, lectures were a bit repetitive, and the readings were A Lot. Fortunately, these issues were fixed halfway through the semester. "

            "\u00a0I probably would not recommend this class to another student because of its disorganization. I felt as though the readings were interesting, but I didn't end up learning much in the lectures or feel challenged by the writing assignments. It was not a difficult class in terms of work load, but it was a difficult class to stay involved in because I don't think the discussion sections or writing assignments were particularly fun or compelling. ",
            "\u00a0If you need it for your major or you really love the internet, yes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Extremely informative and looks at both the history of the internet, the theory of networks, and modern day technologies and applications. It is what you make out of it. ",
            "\u00a0I would. Not too difficult. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student looking to get out of it what they put into it. Almost every conversation that I had with another student in the class came to the conclusion that neither of us were putting in as much work as we could be, but that we still found the class super interesting and relevant. ",
            "\u00a0If you care a lot about digital media and network structures, then I would. I wouldn't let the title entice you, it's much more of a history class then it makes itself out to be. That's not bad, it just can be a bit dry at the beginning. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially as a fourth or fifth class. ",
            "\u00a0Take it if you like Black Mirror, if you want to think critically about how people use and relate to technology, of if you're interested in the history of the internet/personal computing. You kind of get out of it what you put in, so do the readings (they're actually really interesting, even if you need to skim some parts) and go to lecture. The professors are absolutely amazing so get to know them. ",

            "\u00a0Yes! It had some first-time-taught bumps and hitches but was overall very enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who is really interested in 1) thinking more deeply about how our relationships and even our own selves change on the internet, or 2) the history of the internet, especially in terms of who is represented in historical texts and what projects were highlighted in history. The class was more historical than I expected, which was really interesting, but as someone coming from a completely non-technical background, I was kind of lost in the Network Theory unit. I would also recommend this class to someone who is an English or Literature major (or potential major) looking for a really unique class that's pretty different than other English classes; that's why I took this, and it was super intriguing and refreshing! ",
            "\u00a0This was the first time the class was being offered. Having taken it credit d fail and not done much of the reading, I do not feel qualified to provide a perspective on that side of the curriculum. But the lectures were generally interesting and made you think a lot about how networks take shape and information is disseminated, so I would recommend it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Again, it being the first year the class was taught, there were some inconsistencies and the class jumped around a lot, but Im sure if it is taught again those kinks should be worked out! Great professors, super interesting course material, great mix of majors, and important knowslege to gain as an individual living in our current internet age. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this class was really fascinating. It was far enough outside my normal field of study that most of the information was new, but intersectional enough that I felt that I had the background to effectively grapple with it. It deals with a lot of super current issues and definitely changed the way that I think about and value the internet. Both professors were really engaging and also super friendly outside of class - I spoke a couple of times with Marijeta and she was always really helpful. The workload isn't bad, 3 projects (which are a little different than just normal papers and so are more interesting) and weekly reading responses, which I found actually made section much more enjoyable. The reading can sometimes be a lot but is generally very interesting and covers multiple perspectives, which is really nice. Overall one of my favorite classes this semester. ",
            "\u00a0Yes--this is an in-depth and fascinating look at the development and culture of the Internet. ",
            "\u00a0absolutely take this course! amazing professors! a crazy syllabus that will change your life / your relationship with the digital era!! always thought-provoking! always exciting! very dystopian! great! ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course. Even if someone's focus is not in internet cultures, it is a class that can reach any kind of study. If not this particular course, I would recommend any course with the two professors. ",
            "\u00a0It's a pretty easy humanities credit if you're a CS major and want something somewhat relevant, but if you want a class that you get a little more out of, skip this one. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you're interested in the histories undergirding the Internet and the practices unfurled upon it. Less so if you're into critiquing the structures of the web this class is weighted heavily toward agency. "
