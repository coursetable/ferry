            "\u00a0I gained economic skils, but as a student coming from a developing country I don't feel I gained any valuable skills to implement back in my country where challenges in the social and economic arena are very complex. ",
            "\u00a0This class is great for understanding different kinds of energy and how to go about thinking which are more appropriate in different contexts. I appreciated learning more and understanding global considerations regarding carbon emissions, climate change, and energy debates (including those about oil, wind, solar). ",
            "\u00a0Received a more in depth understanding of how policy-makers leverage (or don't leverage) current research. ",

            "\u00a0Learnt a lot about energy, energy policy and energy economics ",
            "\u00a0So many different skills - whether it's understanding energy economics through the policy framework, engaging with new and innovative policies, or just hearing from Ken's background. It was a broad and deep class. Definitely geared towards advanced students, which I liked. ",
            "\u00a0This course exposed me to various facets of energy, their underlying economics and the role of policy in each of them. \r\nThe resources/papers were excellent and were balanced in the sense that for any given policy analysis, different perspectives were placed for our understanding. That helped me learn both sides of an argument coherently. \r\nAs a student of economics, it was wonderful to apply basic concepts to the most complex energy issues! \r\nApart from the excellent in-class learnings, it was great to work on a group project. The project enabled me to improve my technical skills, exposed me to the energy sector of Pakistan and made me aware of challenges in energy, especially in the context of a developing country. \r\n\r\nOverall, Professors  teaching, class discussions, the materials and problem sets very very comprehensive for a one-semester course. \r\n\r\nMy best takeaways from the semester have been from this class! ",

            "\u00a0Comprehensive overview of topics related to energy markets and economics; introduction to the preeminent energy economics authors and ongoing debates ",

            "\u00a0So much! Oil markets, carbon mitigation schemes, renewable energy policy, energy market structuring. It was superb! The interagency working group history and the social cost of carbon metrics were really really cool and extremely important. ",
            "\u00a0A comprehensive overview of energy-related policies in oil, gas, the electricity market, renewable energy, and transportation, from an economic perspective. Topics including (but not limited to) oil prices, the law of one price (oil vs natural gas), electricity deregulation (California electricity crisis discussed), RPS and FIT, pollution externalities and abatement policies (tradeable permit, price rule vs. quantity rule), energy efficiency policies, and transportation-related incentives were covered.

But the learnings from the class have been beyond what I had expected. They were very informational, insightful and rigorous too! \r\n\r\nBeing a student of a one year masters program, I was looking for something rigorous and interesting at the same time. This course was a great choice! ",

The intricacies of oil markets and contending theories about an integrated oil market vs the need for oil security premiums is a relevant dialogue that was unknown to me. ",

            "\u00a0Very interesting class covering a range of topics in energy ",
            "\u00a0I liked it; I would have appreciated a little more discussion about the political economy of energy and political considerations in general, and not just policy implications. ",
            "\u00a0This course covers a wide breadth of topics, but touches on topics that many students already had familiarity with. Thought the homework sets were very well developed to maximize applied learning. However, the course relies on material that seems like it was last updated 5 years ago. In a time of rapidly changing energy policy, would have been great to have some more discussion on what is the most effective way of developing and deploying new energy policy. Covering fewer topics in more depth would have been great. ",
            "\u00a0Very academic focused, which is great considering Nordhauss contemporaneous award. Would have appreciated some more practical perspectives, e.g., is a world carbon price/tax really politically feasible? If not, what policy mechanisms might work better? ",

I am sure that Professor has kept in mind the technical background  of students, but personally, I would have preferred to have done some more problem solving in class! ",

I think something like a longer, take-home exam that was broader would be an improvement. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was super well done and would recommend it in its current format. ",
            "\u00a0I think the structure of the course is designed really well. I thought the reading supplemented the class discussions very well and found the problem set and term paper to fill out the quantitative needs of the class. I am not sure that a mid-term exam is necessary in this class-given the problem sets  and final paper and presentations but understand why Professor Gillingham would want to keep that component in a course like this. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent lectures. Good content. Too much reading. I feel like the amount of reading could have been reduced. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of the course is Gillingham. He's incredibly knowledgeable, plainly puts a lot of work into prepping his lectures, uses a fascinating reading list, etc. Gillingham is one of the best professors that I've had at any level of education -- he's that good. ",
            "\u00a0Ken is a great lecturer. The problem sets were very good and often times challenging. Sometimes the timing of the problem sets didn't seem consistent. Maybe just make them due biweekly or something? \r\n\r\nThe only other constructive feedback is that the transportation and urban sections felt a bit rushed. Maybe just nix the urban part and talk through transportation a bit more in depth? The transportation policies analysis... especially in consideration with the rebound effect... was very interesting stuff. ",

            "\u00a0Loved the project ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very relevant information for students interested in energy. Gillingham is an engaging lecturer, and motivates students to ask questions and explore their energy interests through the semester-long group project. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: there were several instances when we couldn't get through most of the lecture because the majority of class time was spent answering questions. While i see the benefits of this and support the idea of students asking questions, there were times when i felt questions got off-topic and I could have gained more by sticking to the lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Grading was generous, especially on final paper; I didn't think our team deserved the grade we got. ",
            "\u00a0The class touches upon a wide range of energy topics including transportation and oil & gas. The homework portion could be improved by going over those detailed economics-type questions (ex. get the graph of abatement cost, how to calculate tax revenue, etc.) ",
            "\u00a0I wish I could continue with the course next semester, really great! I would love to see a full course on electricity economics ",
            "\u00a0The strength is the pacing and depth. We covered so many topics without ever feeling rushed. If anything, I left feeling like the course could keep going for another semester as there was so much more to dig into. "
