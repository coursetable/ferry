            "\u00a0Strengths: lots of practical practice opportunities, FREE TEXTBOOK, lots of demos incorporated into readings and lectures, real-world examples of each and every concept. Also, office hours were really well set up (at least one every day, great for collaboration with others as well as having instructors / ULA's answer questions). It felt like we were really all in this together on the psets (not to the level of sharing code though, of course! Just of working through the logic).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: many lectures consisted of just watching the professor go through a pretyped demo Jupyter notebook. I understand there's probably not enough time for us to all like copy down all the code on our own, but it would be a lot more engaging if we had to put at least 10-25% of the code together ourselves in class! The infrequent discussion questions / opportunities to code on our own helped toward the beginning of the semester. I wish they had kept them up more because otherwise it was very easy to get distracted when you could just kinda look at the code and see it all there and there was nothing for you to do. More opportunities for discussion would also probably make it less awkward and silent when we did have discussion (lectures were kinda the opposite of office hours). Also, some sort of guide or lecture on transitioning from using the datascience import to using Python without (with just numpy, pandas, matplotlib, & whatever else is out there that I don't even know about from this class!) would have been great.\r\n\r\nOVERALL THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT AND I LEARNED A TON, LECTURES JUST COULD HAVE BEEN MORE ENGAGING WHICH WOULD HAVE HELPED TRANSITION INTO PSETS BETTER ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nFun course material\r\nGreat instructors\r\nLots of super helpful office hours\r\nRegularly assigned problem sets\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n\r\nFelt a little segmented with regard to Python - as if we learned only enough Python to be able to do the data science aspect, then stopped learning Python almost entirely. Though I guess this is primarily a data science course, so maybe that's okay. \r\n\r\nThe course needs to coordinate a lot more with its offshoot courses. I took data science for politics and it was clear that the two courses had not communicated at ALL, to the extent that both courses, at the beginning, were assigning the same material! Plus, in the politics course I was expected to start learning Pandas, something that was never asked of me in the main course. Coordinate better! ",
            "\u00a0Lectures itself could be more engaging rather than a rehash of the readings provided prior to class. It would be useful if we had more projects and perhaps fewer weekly assignments as the projects were more useful than the assignments in contextualizing the concepts we learnt in class. ",
            "\u00a0The problem sets were relatively easy, though some of the analysis questions were not clear. Overall the pace of the course was slow. ",
            "\u00a0Strengthsvery interesting content, enjoyable PSETs, not an overwhelming amount of work\r\nWeaknesseslectures are largely a waste of time (don't provide much beyond the slides themselves), tests are very different from the PSETs ",
            "\u00a0A strength is the focus on how statistics work and are used. A weakness is that I don't think we utilized python enough. Also I think the exam should be coding based and not on paper because that better tests what we had done throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Combining coding with conceptual statistics helped to reinforce both skills.\r\nImprovements: Many concepts seemed to be defined more in terms of what they weren't instead of what they were (confidence intervals do not represent X, Y, or Z), making it difficult to generalize the idea of any given model or measure. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Logical progression of course material; interesting assignments and demos (topics included the effects of smoking during pregnancy, calculating value among NBA players, and similarly interesting topics)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures not as useful as the textbook, while often just repeating lessons from the week's chapter; much of the work was backloaded (the professors had to make a third major project optional); difficult midterm that was not very similar to previous assignments (in large part because it was our first written, timed assignment) ",
            "\u00a0Office hours are very helpful and nurtured group work that greatly aided my learning.  The midterm and final exams, however, were much simpler conceptually than the work we did on the regular assignments and projects as they were handwritten and could not rely on developing a question in steps (in the way that Jupyter notebook problem sets could).  I recommend giving exams as Jupyter notebooks so that they can more closely assess the learning goals of the course. ",
            "\u00a0The demos are very helpful and the homeworks are good practice. It would be nice if we learned actual python and not rely so heavily on the datascience table methods. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: application to real-world data made it interesting; provides introduction to Python (very widely-used programming language); the homeworks and projects were actually very fun to figure out\r\nWeaknesses: Lecture not very engaging; still went to every class but the online textbook's explanations of the same topics covered in lecture were often clearer and sometimes provided even more information than lecture which probably disincentivized a lot of people from going to lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: extremely applicable to research, very practical, well-organized, questions asked in problem sets are pretty current and interesting\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I actually prefer the projects and problem sets over sit-down midterm and exam. I kind of wish we had a final project instead where we find a dataset to analyze or something like that. I find that the p-sets and projects better solidified my knowledge and use of statistics and critical thinking, though they didn't so much test how well I remembered code and functions. But in the end that's what the Python is used as a tool for, a mechanism to carry out that level of thinking. ",
            "\u00a0More proactive coding in class would increase student engagement. ",
            "\u00a0This course does little to prepare its participants for their assessments. The practice exams are nothing like the actual exams, and this leaves the course's students feeling as if their hard work in preparing was for very little. However, I did like the numerous office hours that the course offered. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: well-organized, good reference (textbook) to follow, knowledgeable professors\r\nWeakness: I was hoping for more coding and less statistics ",

            "\u00a0The textbook is EXCELLENT. The best I've had at Yale. That said, you could probably get as much out of the course by reading the textbook and doing the p-sets as you would by coming to lecture (which was well-taught, but generally covered the same content as the book, about equally well). I'd say there were about twice as many students at the exams as there were in any given day of lecture. Both of the instructors are fantastic, and the tests felt fair. The projects felt less worthwhile (they were just longer, more annoying p-sets) and could definitely be tweaked. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths - weekly psets keep you on top of the material and Jessi is overall a pretty good lecturer. Weaknesses- The beginning of the course seemed to go very slowly in covering pretty basic and easy-to-grasp material, while material that was more difficult to understand was often covered too quickly in my opinion. Also, they were quick to grade the midterms and final but very slow to grade our homework assignments, so it's possible our mistakes/errors compounded over time as we moved forward blindly with assignments. ",
            "\u00a0I liked that the class was focused on learning through solving problems (rather than passively memorizing ideas). I do think lectures could have been more creative; they were usually just a walk-through of the demos. I also think the wording of the problems was often ambiguous and confusing, and in general could have been clearer! ",
            "\u00a0Taught a lot of material but not to the point where I felt overwhelmed. Wish we had had more time to go over classifiers ",
            "\u00a0I think more engaging lectures would be beneficial. Weekly PSETS and frequent projects were definitely good aspects of this course. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very well-structured and organized. The content was taught in a logical order, and the textbook is incredibly helpful. The instructors are good, but unfortunately lectures were not very helpful for the course, as coding is something learned best through practice. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: abundance of help and office hours, regular work schedule. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: projects and homework should not be due on the same week, its very stressful to have one due Thursday and another Friday. ",
            "\u00a0I think the main area it could be improved is by adding more application. the \"projects\" were just longer homework assignments, and it would have been good for some more open-ended outside the class projects. ",
            "\u00a0The course has a nice pace to it but there is no real difference between the homework assignments and the projects. The projects are just really long psets that are due the same week as another pset. I would suggest making the psets worth more of the final grade since thats most of what we did in class anyways. ",
            "\u00a0It went quite fast paced ",
            "\u00a0I thought there were a lot of strengths with the courses like the projects and problem sets were really well-done and helpful for learning the concepts. The projects were especially enjoyable because they focused on real-world problems which really made you feel as though what you were doing mattered in a broad context. The lecture was usually very interesting and informative. One weakness is that the midterm and final were really different from the homework and projects so that was a bit of a shock. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the chronology of the class was strong, and the projects and psets were for the most part interesting. I wish the questions on the exams and the questions on the homeworks had been more more similar. I felt like the psets/projects did not prepare me well for the tests. I also think the lectures could be more engaging--most of the time the lecturer simply read from the slides and did not present course material in interesting new ways. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: The demos and practices which helped us to but to practice what we learned in class and to better understand the concepts and python; I also like how we used real life data sets in order to practice our analytical skills \r\nWeakness: Having too much work at times in one week such as weeks when we had both a long project and pset due; ",
            "\u00a0Strength: the structure of the course, the textbook, the TAs, Piazza, the eagerness of the professors\r\n\r\nWeakness: the sometimes slow and sometimes repetitive lectures ",
            "\u00a0This course was appropriately challenging. I think the lectures weren't the most engaging sometimes, and did not reflect how challenging the homework would be. Office hours were very helpful. I definitely needed additional guidance for a lot of the work. \r\n\r\nThe workload was pretty intense, especially when there were PSETs and Projects due right after each other. It would be great to not have PSETs due the week a project is due. I found it very overwhelming and not helpful. ",
            "\u00a0This course should begin by teaching stats concepts and then go into python and explaining how to implement the stats concepts. We did it the other way around, which was very confusing. The course got much harder very quickly. It would have been good to do stats concepts first, have a midterm, then go into python.\r\n\r\nI also think there should have been more office hours. \r\n\r\nLastly, I think there should be more emphasis on creative projects. The psets were so guided that I didn't really know what I was learning. Instead of a final for example, we should have had a project and the class should have been leading up to it. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I loved the pace of the class, not too fast and not too slow. In previous introductory coding classes, they go way too fast, and I get lost very quickly, but in this class, they went at a very slow pace, and I can confidently say that I have really learned how to code using Python. They also explained the statistical concepts very well, and there was a lot of practice to help solidify the concepts. The TA's were also fantastic! (Thank you Tuan and Dawn!)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes, the concepts were a bit difficult to understand with just a few lectures, so individual reading and learning was also needed, but overall, great course! ",
            "\u00a0So many assignments - too many!!!! ",
            "\u00a0I think the weekly homeworks are very helpful for developing skills, but I would appreciate the homeworks being returned sooner in order to better study for the exams. I also don't think that the homeworks and the exams match up very well in terms of the knowledge we're supposed to have gained. ",
            "\u00a0Strengthsthe online textbook was super clear and it was nice to have that be so accessible. The pace of the course was reasonable. I am not necessarily a \"STEM person,\" and it would say that the class never made me super stressed or anything. It was basically modelled so that if you put in reasonable work, you could understand what was going on.\r\nWeaknessesLectures never really seemed to add much on top of the textbook, and also could sometimes be confusing if you hadn't done the reading. Also, there were a lot of things covered that felt like they could have been very interesting to delve into a bit theoretically, but we never did. They would just explain different tools, but not why those tools work. ",
            "\u00a0Great course! ",
            "\u00a0The weakness of this course is that all of the material is online, and the professors just go through the online materials during class, which does not incentivize students to attend the lecutre, leaving lecture attendance as low as 15% on some days. I think it could be improved if the lecturers were more engaging and instead of just running and explaining common sense code, they lectured more and highlighted more important concepts that we should take in mind. First highlight the concept, and then show in code how the concept applies. Lecture time could have been more efficient. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were concise and felt like I learned a lot. ",
            "\u00a0The course is easy enough where you can do the hws each week without understanding the statistical concepts which made it hard to study for the final because I suddenly realized there were a bunch of concepts I had never learned. I think the lectures could do a better job of explaining these concepts. ",
            "\u00a0The course is well-organized and the homework seems manageable once you get the hang of the structure and deadlines. However, some weaknesses included the test structure. For a coding based class, a handwritten, in-class exam, might not as accurately test the learned principles (especially if students become used to running the code in the homework assignments). Otherwise, for an introductory course, this course was challenging but I feel like I learned a lot. ",

            "\u00a0YData is a super approachable class for people without any coding/statistics experience. I do think that I would have come to class more often if it had been held twice a week for 75 minutes instead of three times a week for 50. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: (1) Fills a really important need at Yale. The syllabus and topics covered in class are really relevant and interesting (2) The organization of the syllabus and availability of everything online. The structure of this course was great. (3) Letting us use cheat sheets. I ended up learning most of the stuff on them anyway, but having that safety net allowed me to focus on the overall ideas more and worry less about the mechanics of coding.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: (1) Frequent cancellation of office hours without rescheduling. Some ULAs were miles better than others (2) It felt like the beginning of the class was too slow and lingered on easy topics while the latter half of the class barreled through more complex ideas. (3) For some reason, professors didn't want to release projects or homework assignments early. Definitely frustrating. ",
            "\u00a0The course provides a solid foundation for programming in python and statistics. The homework assignments really helped develop the skills taught in lecture and there were many opportunities to get help where needed.

            "\u00a0I would! This is a great first QR class to take. It is a real class and you learn a lot, but at no point is it overwhelming or an insane amount of work. Anyone can take it, but it can get difficult conceptually at times! ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend the course! Great introductory statistics class! Getting introduced to coding in python and gaining valuable experience with data science are great skills to have. ",
            "\u00a0I'm not certain who would benefit most from this class. I had enough background in coding that I likely could have picked up Python better outside of a classroom environment, and I don't think my peers or I understood the statistical elements as well as my friends who had taken statistics in high school or other introductory statistics courses here. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0I'm unsure that this course is a stronger option than S&DS 230, although YData was in its first year while I took it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if they are looking for an intro or basic stats class. ",
            "\u00a0If you like problem-solving and extracting patterns from data, it's pretty cool. It's also fun to get a basic intro to a more intuitive coding language if you have never programmed before. The stats aspect can be more boring though; I found it harder to stay engaged when we were given formulas and definitions to know/memorize without sufficient intuition to explain why those formulas or definitions are the way they are. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Learn to code, especially if you work in a lab. It is so useful. Also, learning about statistical methods/data science is increasingly important...this class teaches it in an approachable way that very much equips you with practical tools to go do things on your own after. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course with the hope that its professors fix its issues in the course's second year at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's a lot of work but with coding, I feel it is necessary to learn through practice. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, this course was very fun and Jessi is a very engaging teacher. The new YData letcures and seminars are well worth the credit. ",
            "\u00a0yes great for non stem ",
            "\u00a0I would! It's a solid QR that isn't too too difficult as long as you have some quantitate skills, and you'll actually learn something. It won't change your life, but it does what it claims to do well. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially if you haven't had any prior experience with coding and data analysis. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student looking for an introduction to statistics and data science. The problem sets and projects are engaging and straightforward and the exams are fair. ",
            "\u00a0I would! I think it's a useful QR. It isn't a gut though. ",
            "\u00a0Take it because you'll learn a fair amount. It's a little dull but I think that was just because I don't really have any interest in the topic. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It is a great introduction to statistics and Python. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course serves as an excellent introduction to both statistical analysis and coding. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! It was a way to get your feet wet in programming and statistics without being too demanding from the get go; it was an excellent experience. ",
            "\u00a0Overall I would recommend this course particularly for those who are not STEM majors. It was a good introduction to coding in python. Some of the statistics were a little confusing still. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was a great introduction to statistics, and is incredibly well-organized so that anyone can take it. ",
            "\u00a0I had no experience with statistics, programming,, or computing, but I found this course not only accessible, but very enjoyable. The only thing is the midterm and final are pretty challenging, especially given that they're on paper and the psets are on the computer. But overall, I actually had fun! ",
            "\u00a0Its a good class for first years but I would not suggest it as a fifth class for upperclassmen. ",
            "\u00a0No ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student if you want to learn something different and very applicable to the real world. It's also a great course for humanities students because it offers a great break from things that are so subjective and makes your brain work in a lot of different ways. It can be really stressful at times though, especially in the beginning when you're introduced to these new concepts so the problem sets take a long time. It can also be a lot of work especially when there's a project and pset due the same week, but you can always get help. It's very interesting and rewarding, but just be prepared to put a lot of work into it. ",
            "\u00a0I'm not sure. I think the material in the course is good, but I would hope the lectures improve and the workload is reduced. ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely ",
            "\u00a0If you want to learn the basics of data science and Python this is a great course. You have to be ready to put in a good amount of work (weekly psets, midterm and final, 2 projects which are like longer psets) but the workload is predictable, less than comparable courses and there is lots of help. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this class. First of all, statistics and programming work extremely well together. Jessi and John both do an amazing job of showing this through the many examples they give in each lecture. Second, the workload and guidance for this class is extremely fair. Almost too fair. But I will say this: you won't regret taking this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is a great way to learn about the subject of data science and learn a useful computer language; I feel that I learned a lot and this class was very useful and helped me to figure out what I might want to major in ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student that has some kind of background in statistics, coding, or even just math. I found the course very challenging since I hadn't taken a real QR class in 3 years, had never taken any statistics, and had never coded. However, it was still doable. ",
            "\u00a0I think you should take intro stats and then stat 230 instead. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students who want to learn the basics of coding and statistics and data science! I think this was a great course that taught both coding and broader theories and concepts. Would recommend to those seeking to learn more about this growing field of statistics and data science and learn a bit of coding in Python. ",
            "\u00a0I was a great intro to understand and applying statistics (learning python too). ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely! ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested in data science, it's the place to start. I took it because I wanted to try programming and didn't want to wait until fall for CS50 or CS112. It's not a comprehensive programming introduction, but I ended up enjoying it anyways. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I thought it was a well-taught, actually useful QR credit. ",
            "\u00a0Would recommend! ",
            "\u00a0I would. I feel like I ended up learning a lot and enjoyed the course, although a lot of this learning was through reading the textbook on my own. I thought lectures could be useful, demos not as much. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend it to people who have never taken statistics or coding! I felt like I learned a lot of the basics of both in this class. ",

            "\u00a0I'm not sure. It depends what you are looking to get out of it. It might just be worth taking a more advanced class that might be harder but where you will learn more. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, since the coding part of it is easier to grasp (I had no prior coding experience and am not a datascience major). But, you might have trouble if you struggle with statistics concepts, although those aren't generally taught well anyway and I don't have another course I could compare it to. ",
            "\u00a0As a humanities student, I think the class has been sufficiently fun and challenging. Well structured and useful. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend YData for non-STEM majors, but for people intending on majoring in S&DS, or those who have already learned any coding or stats, the class is probably to slow/easy. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you don't have a background in coding, this is the course for you. The topics are very relevant and the textbook is incredibly organized. I started from scratch with both coding and statistics and really learned a lot this semester. There are definitely minor points of frustration (inconsistent office hours, tough projects, slow in the beginning and too fast at the end), but overall a great course.\r\n\r\nThe one thing is that I recommend taking it with a friend. The psets were a million times easier going over it with friends rather than doing all on my own. You can also go to office hours to go over things, but I just didn't find those to be very helpful at all. \r\n\r\nAlso want to mention that I didn't take this course with the half credit seminar and I still took a lot out of it.
