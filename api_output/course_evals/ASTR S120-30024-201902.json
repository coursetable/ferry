            "\u00a0Knowledge:\r\nThe evolution of the universe.\r\nHow stars born and die. \r\nHow blackholes form. \r\nWhat the universe is made of.\r\nDifferent types of stars.\r\nSkills:\r\nEstimating the temperature of a star simply by looking at it.\r\nWhich stars are more likely to form into a black hole.\r\nEstimating the age of the universe.\r\nDetermining the fate of the universe. \r\nInsights. \r\nNow I understand better the evidences for dark matter and dark energy. Prior to the course, these things were quite mysterious to me. ",
            "\u00a0- An appreciation for the laws of physics and how to manipulate them to solve problems in Astronomy.\r\n- An introductory understanding of the major themes in Astrophysics. "

            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nGiving a couple of multiple choice questions during each class leads to a higher student participation rate. \r\nObserving session.\r\nHomework problems.\r\nWeaknesses: \r\nThe course is quite short which makes it intense. It might be better to make the course longer than 5 weeks during summer ",
            "\u00a0Strengths. \r\n- Prof Kenney is incredible. He is really passionate about teaching and puts a lot of thought into the in-class experiments.\r\n-The textbook is amazing, it explores challenging content but uses language that is understandable and engaging to the reader. Ive never used a Physics textbook before that breaks down complex material as thoughtfully and simply as Universe. The questions interspersed within the text arent the demoralizing gotcha type trick questions that you find in other textbooks, but are geared to make sure that you understood the content that youve just read and offer opportunities to further reflect and view the material from a different angle. \r\nTl;dr the textbook caters to the lowest denominator (which I appreciated) while challenging those who are looking for more.\r\n-I liked that the reading quizzes were low stake, you get full credit just for doing them. Given the pace of the class, they are a useful motivator to ensure one keeps up with the readings and positively shape the structure of the lessons, by allowing the lesson plan for the day to focus on material that was more challenging or interesting.\r\n-Im not sure how I felt about the in-class quizzes. The part Es were great, somewhat philosophical and comical. Our group was small, collaborative and enjoyed the class, but I fear that in a different climate, the public medium in which questions are answered could become unnecessarily competitive and make a student with a long streak of wrong answers feel self-conscious. \r\n- The class website/Canvas site are well organized and the lecture slides are excellently structured which I really appreciated close to exams.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses.\r\n-This class has no weaknesses.

            "\u00a0If you have ever wondered what the universe is made of, how big the universe is, how the universe evolved and etc., then definitely yes. I have never enjoyed this much any other courses in my life. Also, this course is studying like physics but in a more interesting way. ",
            "\u00a0-This is hands down the best class I've taken at Yale. Definitely take this class if Prof Kenney is teaching it. He is super approachable and breaks down the material in such a way that it can be understood by anyone regardless of their Physics/Math background.\r\n-The class provides an excellent survey of the most important themes in Astrophysics and gives great context to all the Sci-fi you've grown up watching. \r\n- There's a good balance between exams and applicative components of the class such homework sets, participation and observation sessions. It definitely lessened my anxiety when it came to taking exams, while theyre important they are arent the only metric used to assess your effort in this class. "
