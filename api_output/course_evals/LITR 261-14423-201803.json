            "\u00a0how to read a variety of texts critically, including but not limited to secondary literature, sociological and specifically colonial theory, manuscripts, archives, novels; how to engage with these different forms of writing in a balanced manner in writing assignments ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to access and approach extensive archives for conducting book historical research. I also gained more familiarity with post-colonial theory and debates regarding canon formation. Perhaps most exciting for me was learning how colonial and post-colonial contact with the English canon often occurs in fleeting, ephemeral, and/or bureaucratic forms (e.g. periodicals, textbooks, quarterly reports, etc.). ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to use archival materials more effectively, how to be more efficient with my research, and how to think more critically about colonial and postcolonial theory. "

        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: well-structured (organized \"units\"); small class facilitated more participation than usual compared to other english seminars (in my experience), significant amount of background in colonial and postcolonial theory \r\nWeaknesses: wasn't totally confident in the expected form of midterm, even after asking ",
            "\u00a0Professor Mukhopadhyay's expertise was immensely helpful; so many of our readings were illuminated by her lectures and our class discussions, which she guided, but never monopolized. Perhaps because this is the first year this course is being taught, our ENGL 290 class only had 5-6 students. I think an enrollment around 10-12 students would be ideal for classroom discussions. I might also suggest that specific guidelines regarding the short and long papers be released earlier in the term so that students may prepare for them even further ahead of time. ",
            "\u00a0Readings were generally very interesting, but sometimes the conversation could lag a little bit "

            "\u00a0Yes! It's a great departure from the homogeneous texts of most other english seminars ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Any student who wishes to obtain a greater understanding of how the English canon was (and should be) formed, as well as the role the colonial \"periphery\" played in establishing that canon, should take this course. Even for students who have taken ENGL 128, this course will deepen the understanding you obtained at the introductory level with a greater emphasis on archival research. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Very interesting and Prof Mukhopadhyay is very kind and really cares about her students - she is also very knowledgable and excited to help with research or any questions. "
