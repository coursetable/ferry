            "\u00a0Professor Adornos wonderful course truly inspired her students to critically and analytically engage and interact with many Renaissance and Baroque literary works, especially those written by Inca Garcilaso de la Vega. Professor Adornos inclusion of all of Inca Garcilasos works, from his translation of Len Hebreos Dilogos del amor to his most famous Comentarios reales de los Incas, effectively and empirically demonstrated Inca Garcilasos unique and insightful ingenuity of formulating and articulating many original insights, such as his subtle yet incredible demonstration of the ultimate failure of the Spanish colonization of Peru, as well as introducing her students to essential literary genres, such as philosophical dialogues and books of famous men. Such profound comprehension of Inca Garcilasos works, as fostered by Professor Adorno, became further augmented by her inclusion of various other texts that Inca Garcilaso incorporated into his own texts. In this way, Professor Adorno effectively and successfully instructed her students to analyze and interpret Inca Garcilasos work in a comprehensive manner. Furthermore, Professor Adornos weekly showcasing of various copies of Inca Garcilasos works and literary works incorporated in them, all originating from Yale Beinecke Librarys marvelous collection, successfully and wonderfully instructed her students to decipher and analyze sixteenth and seventeenth century printed books, via examination of their fonts, illustrations, and even annotations written by past owners. Therefore, the students of this class were able to empirically learn not only how to utilize a particular text but also to analyze its very printed, physical format. All in all, Professor Adornos class consists of a wonderful and inspiring seminar of many different forms of literary analyses. ",
            "\u00a0I had become curious about the class while attending a conference in Madrid that celebrated the 400 years of the course. The course helped me to develop a deeper knowledge of the works by Inca Garcilaso de la Vega, as well as how to work with rare books and conduct research at the Beinecke Library, and I am grateful for the opportunity.

            "\u00a0Professor Adornos course enables her students to interact and engage with Inca Garcilaso de la Vegas works in a diverse and profound manner, thanks to her careful and detailed instructions and guidance. Professor Adornos thorough and elaborate introduction of historical and biographical contexts, during the weekly class discussions, enable students to interpret and analyze Inca Garcilasos work through unique and inspiring frameworks. Furthermore, Professor Adornos incorporation of her own insightful and illuminating analyses and interpretations of Inca Garcilasos works exemplified the types of analyses and interpretation expected from her students as novice researchers, in a clear and visualized manner. For instance, Professor Adornos incredible and engaging comparison between Inca Garcilasos exteriorized critiques and subtle critiques towards the Spanish viceroy and his government demonstrated students how to detect and infer cryptic yet significant viewpoints within a particular text. Furthermore, Professor Adornos comparison between don Francisco Chillchis brutal presentation of a supposedly artificial head of a Peruvian he allegedly executed and the Spanish executioners violent presentation of the head of the falsely accused Felipe Tupac Amaru showcased students how one can formulate profound analyses via comparing and contrasting distinct yet similar aspects of the same work in concern. In this manner, Professor Adornos course exposes students to various essential research frameworks for investigating sixteenth and seventeenth century texts. Also, the final, twenty page essay challenges students to formulate and articulate various analyses and interpretations into a coherent, article-length formal writing, thereby preparing them to write research articles. In summary, Professor Adornos course consists of a comprehensive and profound research seminar. ",
            "\u00a0Without a doubt, one of the major strengths of the course was its location at the Beinecke Library. To simply be in the presence of editions of the works that were once in Inca Garcilaso's library was a luxury, to say nothing of the opportunity to consult the first editions of those works while preparing presentations and final projects. The other great strength had to do with the professor, Rolena Adorno, whose enthusiasm and deep knowledge of the material made every class a joy to attend. ",
            "\u00a0The professor is a world renowned scholar of Latin American Colonial Literature and her invaluable insights and scholarship are paired with the opportunity to access first editions of the books discussed in the course. "

            "\u00a0Yes, I would most definitely recommend this course to my colleagues who have yet to take it, since a wonderful, multidimensional learning experience awaits them. For instance, Professor Adorno enables her students to acquire a diverse and profound knowledge of Inca Garcilaso de la Vega, both as author and as individual, because of her incorporation of all his texts and her explanation of the historical and biographical contexts surrounding their literary creation. This specific and profound focus upon Inca Garcilaso, in which Professor Adorno centered her course, truly enabled her students to engage with all his works. Furthermore, Professor Adornos wonderful presentation of many of Yale Beinecke Librarys holdings of Inca Garcilasos works and other works incorporated in them empirically and wondrously instructs her students about both the conceptual and physical circulation of ideas and viewpoints within the intellectual world of sixteenth and seventeenth century Europe and Peru. Additionally, Professor Adornos assignment of the final twenty page essay prepares students towards the immense challenge of writing article length, formal academic writings, via obliging them to carefully articulate their opinions towards a particular text into a coherent research project. In summary, much intellectual growth would be promised for students who enroll in this course. ",
            "\u00a0I recommend the Literary Worlds without hesitation to graduate and undergraduate students alike, because of the opportunity to work with rare books and to engage more deeply with the works of Inca Garcilaso, a key in colonial Latin American letters. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course without a doubt. It was one of the most wonderful academic experiences Ive had. "
