            "\u00a0I learned how to best approach environmentalism for the sake of genuine action and progress, rather than just promoting my own ideology. ",
            "\u00a0I read some of the most earth-shaking descriptions of climate change action and criticism of traditional environmentalism that I had to date. I learned a lot of new tools, some more coherent than others, that help appeal to stakeholders and design networks for action. I learned a lot about working (or not working) with clients, and got good practice in patience and teamwork. Learned a lot about regenerative/urban farming, carbon sequestration, and stigmery. ",
            "\u00a0Key principles relevant to systems communications, such as leveraging stakeholder value systems, forming and changing systems and networks, etc. ",
            "\u00a0I've been able to use certain communication tactics and tools to communicate with a range of perspectives that arise in environmental issues. Some of the key takeaways from the course are starting with the smallest seed possible that will definitely lead to action, mapping out stakeholder views with universal values and connecting stakeholders that have those same values, and realizing the difference between a narrative versus an outcome. I was able to apply these concepts first hand through a project working to establish, or in our case, map out a stakeholder network that would be interested in establishing a green bank in Alaska. ",
            "\u00a0This class changed my life. Basically, you learn systems thinking as a communication strategy and all the associated narrative and networking tools that go along with that. ",
            "\u00a0learned so much about communicating in a changing world\r\nnetwork building techniques behind projects or goals\r\ndesigning solutions to world-scale projects ",
            "\u00a0Systems thinking--which I will use for the rest of my career "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The biggest weakness of this course is that because it is changing every semester (the tools used, the details of the lessons), there is often confusing, and not much information to clarify difficult concepts. Professor Lussier, however, does his best to use his work experience to quantify the skills he teaches us. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were highly engaging, readings were excellent, TFs were available and helpful, Paul was a fabulous instructor.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the course, the effectiveness and clarity of the network toolkit began to be lost on my group. We also were not held accountable for continuing to connect with our stakeholder, and as a result finished up the term with an entirely theoretical proposal that was based in the skills taught in class, but not grounded in any actual realistic connections or values-based networking. ",
            "\u00a0The course introduced powerful concepts in a highly engaging and active manner, which made it all the more inspiring and impactful.\r\nNonetheless, the course lacked structure (a clear framework of where we are going, where we are, etc.), and some ideas became unnecessarily repetitive, partly because we keep losing track of where we are in the development of the principles. ",
            "\u00a0The class was useful in defining practical skills that could be used to take immediate action. I don't think that a lot of the readings are things that I'll remember, but readings waned towards the end of the course when the were summarized in lecture instead, which I found just as helpful. It would be useful to have a little more project time in class, but then again, our project team only consisted of three people so it was harder to manage things than a seven-person team. ",
            "\u00a0This course can change the way you think about climate change communications even though you may at first think this method is just common sense. On the other hand, using some the tools we use can  get very nitpicky . ",
            "\u00a0strengths\r\nGREAT course\r\ndesigned to teach you about real world\r\ntopics were intriguing every week!\r\nPaul's great ",
            "\u00a0This course was amazing! The readings were all incredibly enlightening and interesting.  The toolkits presented in class were all very helpful, and the projects were all amazing.  I would have liked a little more coordination between the readings and the projects towards the end of class - sometimes they seemed a little not aligned. "

        [
            "\u00a0Yes, I loved being able to apply what we learned to real-life projects and systems thinking allows you to view communication strategy in a very different and eye-opening way. It may seem very unclear and abstract at times, but I believe I can apply this to any field I go into, whether it's medicine, public health or environmental science. ",
            "\u00a0Anyone who wants to work in a field that involved group works/ community and business partner collaboration should take this course, even if they are not going into environmentalism or conservation. It teaches fundamental skills that are very valuable to understanding people and how the world works. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you need to get pumped up about the future of environmentalism and want to learn about the cutting edge projects that Paul is working on. Just know going into it that a real-world project based course can be demanding and frustrating in unexpected ways. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely a mind-blowing class-- the type of classes that ultimately prove the greatest value of a liberal arts undergraduate education. This class describes truly inspiring communication strategies that go far beyond simply the issue of climate change-- it can be re-applied to any other fields that involve people. I would highly recommend everyone to take this class to be better at reshaping communities and solving issues-- after all, that's what many Yalies wish to achieve. \r\nThe class is this most engaging class I've ever had at Yale, and I'm a senior. Paul's passion and energy are contagious, and you come out of the class not with blind excitement (as these type of classes tend to do), but with careful, considered, insightful confidence.\r\nA word of caution though-- the class is largely unstructured and depend on the \"flow\"-- people used to classes with a clearer sense of direction would need to prepare themselves. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student interested in environmental policy and communication. As an Ecology & Evolutionary Biology major, my interest in this course is secondary to research interests, but still found it useful overall. There's a lot of talk about networking that sometimes felt borderline exploitative, but I guess that's inevitable in having to communicate with so many differing perspectives to work towards an outcome that's ultimately good for the environment. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you are interested in finding out why we can't figure out a solution to climate change. ",
            "\u00a0YESYESYES! Paul is so entertaining and genuinely cares about his students and their learning. I took away more from this course than many others because you are learning in the real world, and working with real people on real projects that could change the world. Lectures are interesting and projects are super cool. They take a lot of work, but you won't mind if you're passionate about your goal. ",
            "\u00a0Not an exaggeration to say that this course was like going to church. Paul gives sermons rather than lectures. If you are looking for a BIG challenge that you can base meaning in your life around then climate change is it. It's not about the planet, it's about us. The systems we occupy and constitute need to change, period. Paul will steadily introduce you to new tools each week that make this challenge seem a little less daunting (spoiler: the key is to start small). There were many times when the lessons weren't intuitive at all but once I let them sink in they began to change my whole worldview. I highly recommend taking this course and going to office hours frequently to get some one-on-one time with Paul. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class!!!  Paul is amazing, the readings are amazing, the projects are amazing, literally just listening to Paul for one class changed my worldview more than almost any other class I've ever taken. "
