Nearly all music I've played during the time I've taken this class and after, I've been able to relate to the course content.

This class was a wonderful learning experience for contextualizing the music that I play and for making music more meaningful to me. I would absolutely recommend it. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the rise and decline of the European Art Music tradition from c.1800 - c.1950 and the tidal wave of popular culture that emerged in the 20th Century.  I also learned to critically examine the benefits and drawbacks of survey courses in music history and of the Western canon in my essay.

However, in addition to all of that, we learned of the cultural, political, and social implications surrounding major changes in the classical art tradition. Being a musician, the class not only opened my eyes to the music I've known almost my entire life,  but gave me a new perspective and view on the status of the elite art tradition today. ",

Highlights included Beethoven, Schubert, Chopin, Brahms, and a class about blues and jazz in the early 20th century in America. We learned not just about the famous composers of the era but the ideas and thinkers who inspired their styles. This course did a great job of placing everything in a larger historical narrative, with discussion at length of the effect of \"normal\" historical events on music history. ",

Life changing views of history and art. The best class by far I have ever taken at Yale. \r\nWeaknesses: I'd say assessments were a little too crammed into the end of the class. ",

",
            "\u00a0The strengths: cool course, lots of information, good lecturer. The weaknesses: biased lecturer, not enough discussion of why we were focusing on this canon, got much more history-based and less music-based as the course went on, AND TOO MANY PEOPLE IN ONE ROOM so I could never see the projected slides and note-taking was always difficult. ",
            "\u00a0I took this class with Prof. Hepokoski -- he is retiring so this course will not stay the same unfortunately. Prof. Hepokoski is a wonderful lecturer and will be dearly missed. ",
            "\u00a0This course provides a fascinating overview of the European Art Music tradition, but, as I argued in my essay, perhaps survey courses are not actually the most beneficial to students.  The only way I could see it being improved would be to completely replace it. ",
            "\u00a0I would've perhaps liked a smaller class size as to facilitate more interaction with the professor, but that's a minor issue - this class was wonderful. ",
            "\u00a0There's a lot of material to cover and a lot of reading! The workload is also substantial: 3 listening quizzes, 3 written exams, and 1 final paper. The good thing though is that you will be done with the class before reading week (if the format stays the same). Professor Jim Hepokoski is engaging and passionate about the course, but I heard he was retiring. As a non-music major, I was glad I took the class Credit/D because the listening quizzes can definitely be challenging. The written exams are not bad if you learn the material well (and do the readings), but even if the course is not cumulative, there is definitely a lot of things to learn for each. Overall, I found the material to be very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0The course is incredibly engaging and well-taught. However, I'm still not sure what the educational purpose of listening quizzes areyou'll probably forget a lot of the music after you take them. Also, because the course is curated by Professor Hepokoski, you are not exactly getting an impartial introduction to the material. ",
            "\u00a0Fantastic course with a great professor. There were times when it didnt feel like the social climate surrounding the music wasnt addressed enough, but overall it was very good. One other weakness was that the sections seemed rather disorganized. ",
            "\u00a0Lecture was fantastic. Professor Hepokoski made every lecture engaging with a constant connection to the broader themes of the course at large. There was never a diversion from the topic, and it felt like what we were learning was always relevant. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were obviously the lectures, but I also loved the readings. No real weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0It's really great. Sad Hepo's leaving. ",
            "\u00a0Study guides provided further in advance ",
            "\u00a0-very well-polished, engaging and informative\r\n-no complaints ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are in the lectures by the wonderful James Hepokoski (who we are all sad to see retire), the incredibly nice TAs, and just the interesting material/subject matter of the class. There really are no weaknesses although in future courses, no Hepo might be one. ",
            "\u00a0The course was excellent. The only complaint would be that the discussion of non-canonical musics (jazz, blues, popular music) was very limited and fairly ineffective perhaps it would be better to either expand the discussion of these musics, or relegate them to another class and have this course focus on what it focuses on. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very strong for the material it is required to recovered. However, topics such as jazz and blues could stand to be expanded upon, especially in terms of contextualizing the struggles of the black Americans that shaped these genres. ",
            "\u00a0A strength is its emphasis on cultural history and the lectures as well as teaching assistants. I think this sets it apart from many other music courses. However, I think that the course might need improvement in the realm of content testing. Listening quizzes should be biweekly to encourage listening as a habit rather than cramming. Additionally, the study guides often indicate much more information than is needed to do well on exams. They could use simplification. I would also like to see more treatments of jazz and blues in class as well. ",
            "\u00a0I think one weakness of the course was its overwhelming focus on instrumental weakness and, to a lesser extent, opera. There was very little discussion of choral music, and as one of several choral musicians in the class, I am sure that I was not the only one who would've liked to learn about all of the great choral works (of which there are many!) of the period we studied. I found the listening quizzes quite frustrating because they were actually too short. As stressful as they are, I understand that such quizzes are a standard element of a music history class, and I enjoyed engaging with the repertoire. It just didn't feel fair to test ten short excerpts (worth 10% of our grade) from 9+ hours of music. Perhaps these could be longer and administered in section, although of course sections are already limited because that's when the other exams are administered. ",
            "\u00a0While I found the lectures engaging and interesting, I felt that the organization of the course left very little room for students to learn - a large component of the required work was rote memorization in the existing structure; I think it's telling that the most significant artifact I have from this class is pages of piece titles with names and dates, checked for spelling, copied over and over for the purpose of listening quizzes. Moreover, even in places with some more inherent room for interpretation, like the factual exams, questions often addressed not necessarily the facts of history as much as the interpretations of history favored by the course (e.g. asking about specific readings of pieces or searching for characterizations of composers in highly subjective, but fixed terms). The longer essay required for the course required some more thought, but it did not feel like a substantial component of the class. While I suspect that the course as it stands would strongly appeal to those with a strong reverence for the classical music tradition and a desire to participate in it in the traditional way - and perhaps it serves some purpose in preparing students to work in an existing culture of classical music that does value these things - it falls short on any goals of critically approaching history. \r\n\r\nIn concrete terms, I think it would be improved by giving more emphasis to work beyond memorization; first of all, the listening lists are unmanageably long - while it is absolutely possible to feel comfortable with the existing format of quiz, the quantity of music leaves hardly any time to understand the context of each piece or to use one's ear to verify the assertions made in lecture of in the texture or to understand, aurally, how historical contexts affect the music. This reduces the student's scholarship to a blind trust of assertions by the lecturer and textbook author. Other courses with listening quizzes often ask for knowledge beyond who wrote it and when, and this is highly worthwhile, but restricts how much content can be included.\r\n\r\nI also think that there would be value in emphasizing the interpretations of students in class; it struck me, for instance, as incredibly strange that the lecturer proposed an almost programmatic interpretation of Beethoven's Symphony No. 5 to a room full of students capable of hearing for themselves (and who, myself included, might not hear the abstract interpretations proposed by the lecturer unless they were properly challenged and defended in reference to musical events rather than in reference to the professor's subjective experience). It seemed improper that a surely diverse spectrum of perspectives would not be included in a discussion which music majors are well equipped to have. On a more philosophical level, this sort of teaching seemed like it advanced a very traditional understanding of what music and composers are intellectually valuable (especially as the professor kept saying \"As you all know...\" and other such phrases that seemed to assume the audience were completely on board with the approach of the class), which is not something I'd be eager to see perpetuated in an environment which includes considerable diversity, even among those who have an interest in the given tradition of western art music. ",
            "\u00a0For what it was, this course was essentially perfect. Professor Hepokoski has it down to a science (sad to see him leave), and it showed. It was as if each lecture was a chapter in a larger book, and we just got to enjoy it. Perhaps one thing that could be improved is the paper that we had to write - I felt that my resources for engaging meaningfully with the topic were limited, and I wish that I could have done more research or talked more to my TA or Professors Hepokoski before I wrote it. ",
            "\u00a0Listening quizzes, essays, and factual exams were too closely spaced towards end of course but otherwise, the course was well organized ",
            "\u00a0Super rigorous class, wouldn't change a thing! Best class I've ever taken at Yale and I'm a senior. ",
            "\u00a0I wish there was a way to reduce the sheer amount of memorization of this course. As I wrote in my term paper for the course, the class is designed in a way that privledges instrumentalists, students whose high schools had excellent music curriculum, and students whose parents were highly musically educated. Oftentimes, these groups also belong to much more economically privledged statuses. Consequently, I feel that the course should be adjusted to make it more accessible to students from lower income backgrounds. The course feels like its on an uneven playing ground. ",
            "\u00a0Overall I think this course is structured very well. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Engaging lecturer and material.\r\nWeakness: The listening quiz required too much memorization. ",
            "\u00a0This course is part of a sequence that has been by far my most fulfilling academic experience at Yale so far. The course is rigorous and comprehensive, providing students with a clear grasp of the musical-historical arc of the time period in question. Evaluations ensure that students have a solid foundation in factual knowledge, are able to identify influential/representative pieces, and are exposed to high-quality musicological writing. "

            "\u00a0Take this class at all means possible. Given professor is retiring, find him at his home and beg him to lecture you on the History of Western Art Music. ",
            "\u00a0In case you are not aware: the professor who taught this course, Dr. Hepokoski, is leaving after this semester, so you will take it with someone else. Thus your experience will be vastly different from ours. The class we took was incredible, and one of the most challenging and most meaningful educational experiences of my life. He is easily the best lecturer I've ever had. \r\n\r\nIf you are a music major or a (relatively serious) musician, absolutely. Regardless of what this course becomes without Hepo, it is incredibly valuable to have a knowledge of the canon, and the class will provide a much, much greater appreciation for the composers we all know and love (and tons of others, too. I discovered great music). \r\n\r\nIf not: if it were under Hepo, I would 100% recommend it as a Credit/D/Fail course (simply because it was pretty damn hard and someone without that much knowledge of music might not want to invest that much time). I knew tons of non-musicians in the course who absolutely loved it. However, there's no telling what the course will become. If you're reading this while Music 351 (which goes before this in the sequence) is still going on, go to a lecture in that class to get an idea what this will be like. If not, maybe read the reviews and get some opinions. Definitely keep an open mind though, as this class can reach incredibly highs. ",

Listening quizzes will be time-consuming to study for, and some theory-based things will go over your head, but you can still learn a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class!!!! (as long as the next professor who teaches it is as wonderful a lecturer as Prof. Hepokoski) If you can, Credit-D it. This class has a ton of work that really picks up after the credit D deadline. ",

The course highlights the relevance of classical music to society through its rise and decline, emphasizing many of the controversies.  It is also just a fascinating class for anyone who loves classical music. ",
            "\u00a0This was one of my favorite courses taken at Yale, and perhaps even my favorite. If Hepo weren't retiring, I would recommend it to anyone, no holds barred; as such, studying this material in a critical context provides immense insight into historical European and modern Euroamerican culture. Lectures challenged preconceptions I didn't know I had and were revelatory nearly every time. Extraordinary class. ",
