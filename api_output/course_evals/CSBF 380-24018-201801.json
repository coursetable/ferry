            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the form of the book and the various components that go into its production, as well as a look at its history. We experimented with paper production, ink, and forms of binding, and we were exposed to a number of great book collections at the Beinecke and Haas Special Collections ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the history of books, paper-making and various other book arts. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a lot of historical knowledge about the history of the book and its component stylistic and material elements, and learned what sort of questions I should be asking about texts and how readers interact with them. This has fed back into the texts that I wish to produce. ",
            "\u00a0I learned that books are more than just ways to conveniently contain information and stories. They are art. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the process and history of bookmaking, but what I appreciated the most was the final project. I got to do my own artist's book, and for the first time, I felt like I could actually create something physical that reflects my ideas. "

            "\u00a0The material was overall very interesting and the workload was totally manageable. The people we had the privilege of meeting were by far the highlight of the course. They were incredibly passionate and unbelievably supportive in our interests. The class was also excellent at making us aware of the expansive amount of resources offered by Yale's libraries and facilities, such as the printing presses. At first I was quite drained by the 3-hour long class periods, but after a few weeks I came to appreciate that we met only once a week for an extended amount of time on one subject. ",
            "\u00a0I loved how free-form this course was. It meant that there was never an overwhelming amount of work and I found almost all of the work very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I think there could be a greater effort to link the readings to class work or discussions - I sometimes felt that the two were on a separate trajectory, which made me feel less enthusiastic about our readings. \r\n\r\nI really enjoyed the hands on sessions and excursions (to the Beinecke Conservation Lab, GHP, etc). ",
            "\u00a0This is a truly great course, and I'm so glad it was offered this spring.  In terms of strengths, the course has so many--we met in our assigned \"classroom\" only once, on the very first day of the class, and spent the rest of the semester visiting various museums, libraries, and other facilities on and around campus.  Every class thus has something entirely new to look forward to.  Professor Longmire really takes advantage of the incredible and varied collections and resources on Yale's campus, from the Beinecke and Haas Special Collections to Sterling's antique bibliographical press, the Benjamin Franklin papers, the YCBA's artist's books, and even a local printing plant.  As a whole, this was all so interesting and so enjoyable I'm not sure I really have any major improvements to suggest for the course--though I might advocate for reducing the length of the student presentations slightly, as these sometimes seemed a bit too long (then again, the time spent alone looking into a particular aspect of some institution's collection was valuable). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: It's a very nomadic class and you get a lot of insite from experts. The final project is fun and allows for a lot of creativity.\r\n\r\nWeeknesses: It can be rather drab. It would sometimes cause me to drift off because there's so much talking and it's so long. ",
            "\u00a0Before this course I had never had the chance to explore thinking by actually producing something with my hands. The process of looking at the history of bookmaking while actually performing some of those ancient techniques (like paper making and printing at Sterling) was really engaging. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely. A fantastic 5th credit on a beautiful and often unexplored subject. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would. It was a fantastic course that allowed for a hand's on look into the art of books. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This class was the perfect example of learning for the sake of learning, about a really interesting topic, and we got to dabble in all sorts of different fields before gravitating in the direction we were most interested in. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! One of my favorite courses this semester. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student, and I really hope it's offered again.  If you have room in your schedule, take it (even if you don't have room in your schedule, find a way to take it.)  It's an incredibly unique seminar that I think can prove fascinating and important to nearly any major.  As students, we spend so much of our time buried in books, but do we ever pause to think about the incredible history and beauty of the object itself?  Take this course if you have even a passing interest in knowing more about the intricate backstory behind the most significant object of recorded human history.  You'll make paper, study antique inks, explore the special collections of institutions like the Beinecke, Haas Arts Library, Yale Center for British Art, Sterling's Benjamin Franklin papers, and so much more.  You'll end up visiting a contemporary printing plant to come full circle with everything.  It's a real cornucopia of opportunities and field trips and a lot of meaningful conversations about each.  Take it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because it includes a lot of history and provides a creative outlet. ",
            "\u00a0For sure! Every week I felt excited because I knew that I would see the application of what I read. "
