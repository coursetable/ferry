            "\u00a0I've learned how to use Adobe Premiere, DSLRs for videos, lights, other video cameras, Vimeo, etc. It was a great class to learn a variety of video-making tools and the assignments provided plenty of opportunity for taking risks, learning, and experimenting! I've also developed a better eye to read videos as texts and appreciate aesthetics from a technical point. I've also learned that Neil is a great professor and mentor! ",
            "\u00a0learned fundamental techniques and approaches to framing, sound recording, camera movement, lighting, and editing, including how to watch for these aspects in film/video art and how to use them in my own creative work. worked on critiquing (constructively) other peers's work. learned a lot about how to approach analyzing video art for meaning and trying to incorporate nuanced, abstract footage into work about something meaningful in a communicative way. ",
            "\u00a0I developed both a better understanding about the technical aspects of shooting (basics of camera and post production), as well as a more nuanced and honed in understadning of the conceptual aspects of creating video art in both classroom and one on one crits. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a familiarity and comfortability with using basic video equipment and software, and an overview of major video artists. I'd never taken an art course before, so, more broadly, I learned the ropes of taking an art class at Yale. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: community, small-knit classroom invited more in-depth discussions where everybody could contribute to conversation, one of the best pacing of assignments and lessons for a class, risks in creative vision and execution were always encouraged and there was room for failure and growth, overall a beautiful and exciting learning experience!  Length of class also was great to feel immersed in subject and nothing ever felt rushed. \r\nWeaknesses: difficulty in collaborating with equipment centers because of deadlines on equipment, technical difficulties made it stressful sometimes but they were understood! ",
            "\u00a0Very well organized to facilitate introduction to each concept. Great atmosphere for critiquing work of fellow classmates. Neil is incredible at what he does and at teaching/talking about it, so he is a great source of discussion, creative ideas, and inspiration. The once-a-week meeting time is both great for getting time to work on the weekly draft and hard to manage because the weeks fly by faster than expected. Sometimes we would learn useful camera/equipment tips in class and I would quickly forget those, so perhaps some kind of general guide to equipment even after the tutorials would be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Really great art class for non-art majors. Most people in the class had little to no experience in the material, so it was a very comfortable and informative introduction. ",
            "\u00a0The four hour long meetings were draining, but essential, to the high quality of the course. They provided Professor Goldberg with sufficient time to run technology and skills demonstrations, critiques of student work, and screenings. Our TA  Hua was fantastic, and was a great additional instructor to the course. "

            "\u00a0I definitely recommend this course to someone interested in making videos as well as understanding how to appreciate and read digital videos beyond just consuming them as you would with any video. It was a comfortable and exciting learning environment and you are so encouraged to do well and just love what you make. Neil is great at feedback and critique in a way that pushes you beyond what you think you're capable of because he has a great mindset of individual passion, growth, and learning. You are not expected to create masterpieces with each assignment, and instead, you are encouraged to think critically in ways you have not before and to harness your personal passion and perception to create something worth looking back on. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely yes! Neil is amazing, this class is super fun and a different kind of intellectual challenge than any other class I've taken. It requires creativity, a willingness to fail and take risks, and jus thinking about art in general. If you're at all interested in making art, in film techniques, or in having a different kind of challenge, take this class! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, Neil is a very engaged and dedicated professor, eager to help you become a better artist. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend to anyone interested in video art and in experimentation in non-linear storytelling, more broadly. Professor Goldberg's teaching style is excellent. He very much encourages discussion--participation is a big element of our grade--and I felt that he really made an effort to hear and engage with our comments. Professor Goldberg handled my ideas with care and gave me the advice and motivation to produce some of my best work. I grew close to my peers in the process. It was a highly rewarding experience. "
