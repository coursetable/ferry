Ostad is a great teacher and instructor - she explains things very clearly.\r\n\r\nI really appreciate the emphasis on learning cultural material and find it valuable - but I would prefer if less time in class had been spent on going over our culture posts. \r\n\r\nI did not find the Friday conversation classes to be beneficial. I think this time could be better used focusing on grammar, or just being structured differently. "
