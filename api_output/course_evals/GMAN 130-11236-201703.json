        [
            "\u00a0I think the course uses a variety of methods quite well, including conversation, video, worksheets etc. I also liked how we had very frequent exams which made them much less stressful and easier to study for. I think one major improvement would be to have vocabulary lists. I think learning vocabulary more systematically would've expanded my knowledge of the language more dramatically than trying to learn it organically. And although this method makes me internalize the words more, I still find myself needing words that don't know when I am trying to speak. "
