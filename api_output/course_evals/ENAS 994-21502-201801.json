            "\u00a0nice overview of how memory is stored, how to interface electronics and computers.\r\npicked up some coding skills, greater familiarity with circuitry, mathematical descriptions of controls\r\nas far as insights, i thought a lot of great intuition was given for the math we were doing, i.e. the motivation for laplace transforming and what it is physically ",
            "\u00a0- How to program Arduino in assembly\r\n- How to use stepper motors and op-amps in useful circuits\r\n- How to predict basic behavior of motors and op-amps\r\n- How to deal with basic control systems\r\n- Increased ability to read spec sheets for instruments and hardware ",
            "\u00a0Not only just specific material (circuit dynamics, micro controller operation, PID control, how motors work), but approaches to problem solving and debugging in instances where there are a lot of variables to consider. ",

            "\u00a0strengths: engaging, well taught, covers a nice variety of subjects\r\nweakness: lab portion is done with only one partner, so people divvy up work early on according to their strenghts and aren't forced to expand skills base as much. In my case, that partner was extremely familiar with arduinos and kind of took over the coding. i would have learned a lot more if I had more time at the computer ",
            "\u00a0Instructor is a strength: he is clear at delivering lectures, and engages the class effectively.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a few more advanced labs. Maybe have three sensor-focused labs early on, then move to systems. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Amazing/brilliant instructor lecturer. Very helpful TA's. Also, wide swath of material covered made it interesting each day. \r\n\r\n\r\nWeakesses: by the same token, I would've like to go into depth into certain areas (ie. control) a bit more. ",

            "\u00a0Take this class. Each lab is structured so that it contributes in some way to the final project. We built a sun-tracking robot by the end, and I was quite proud of it. Also, Professor Madhu is very smart and brings expertise to every in-class conversation. ",
