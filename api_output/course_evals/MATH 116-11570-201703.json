            "\u00a0I learned how math can be applied to the real world through modelling, a question that every student asks at one point or another. I learned the basics of linear algebra and learned about how modelling works using concepts covered in calculus. I also learned how to actually apply the concepts I was learning and answer questions that went in depth. ",

            "\u00a0I really liked the mathematical application to biology, which is my primary area of interest, so I really liked seeing how the two fields overlap. ",
            "\u00a0In this class, I got valuable review of integration and differentiation techniques with a lot more depth. I also learned to solve differential equation and use systems to model biological systems like viruses, cancers, predator and prey populations, and ozone depletion. I also learned more about infinite series and using these to approximate functions we cannot integrate. ",
            "\u00a0Developed skills in integration and mathematical modeling, as well as better understanding scholarly academic articles and mathematical models contained within. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me to develop key intuition regarding mathematical modeling hat has proved (and will continue to prove) useful as I further my studies. I frequently find myself overwhelmed by notation, and this course challenged me to confront this weakened and overcome it. It was also interesting to see these models and the principles that we covered applied in the literature, as it added a sense of purpose to what we were doing. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about nullclines and how to draw phase planes. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a much deeper understanding of mathematics as a whole due to Professor Hall's \"top down\" methods. Our exploration of multiple fields of math from differential equations to modeling was very interesting. And the interdisciplinary approach was perfectly fit to my interests. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to use Linear Algebra to evaluate differential models that appear in scientific papers. That is definitely a skill I hope to use in the future when I keep analyzing scientific papers for research. ",

            "\u00a0This course is confusing, disorganized, and DEFINITELY should have a textbook. ",
            "\u00a0Students are able to learn a lot in this course, especially because the material is almost completely unfamiliar and new to us. The material is very interesting and relevant to the real world. However, what was learned in class did not correlate to what was asked of us in the p-sets and exams. The problem sets and exams required much more than what was taught in class. Therefore, doing problem sets and doing well on exams meant consistently attending office hours and seeking help. They were near impossible to do independently. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are its coverage of mathematical concepts while still integrating real-world examples. The one noticeable weakness is the classs lack of assessments besides the midterm, final, and integration quiz. I know that some students appreciate a heavier reliance on psets, where collaboration is encouraged, though. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are the organization of the lectures and the professor's office hours. The weaknesses were the very few assessments we had in the class to improve our grade. ",
            "\u00a0I think the difficulty in class was much easier than the difficulty of the problem sets and exam. I think another major weakness with this class is that there was no textbook, so if you didn't not understand how a concept was explained in class, it was hard to find other resources to go to. Similarly, not having a textbook meant that there were limited practice resources. ",
            "\u00a0I feel like the lecture moved too fast and breezed by things at times. ",
            "\u00a0I think having this class at a later time would be more beneficial to the students. Strengths: The fact that this class was taught by a professor instead of a TA was helpful. ",
            "\u00a0This was a very informative, well presented and organized course, and John Hall is a great professor. He is very committed to helping students learn content inside and outside the classroom. The practice tests for the exam were really helpful for studying, as were his review sessions. The papers we read were all interesting and how we approached them, both in class and on Perusall, was also interesting. \r\n\r\nOne thing I would love to see improve for the course, however, is to get more practice exercises in class that Professor Hall could give throughout lecture to apply the content we just learned. I know the class is pretty short and only meets twice a week, but I would have liked to have time in class to try out the practice problems for ourselves before Professor Hall solves them. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course came from the professor; he was very knowledgeable and accessible to students, and would stay late into the night at times to make out of class quizzes conveniently timed for us. The weaknesses came in a few areas though. Firstly, there is no textbook. It saves us some money, which is greatly appreciated, but it also makes us entirely reliant on lecture to learn concepts and be able to complete assignments. The concepts we covered were also sometimes less common calculus concepts or applications than what one might find in MATH 115, and that made it harder to find appropriate outside resources (via the internet or CTL). Additionally, the problem sets were often significantly more challenging than what was covered in lecture, but without any buildup to the level of challenge they posed. In other words, the lecture material appeared relatively straightforward, but all or nearly all of the questions required a much deeper understanding of the material to complete. Lastly, the readings were often very difficult to get through, particularly for first-year students, as they required not only an understanding of calculus, but also biological, physiological, and ecological concepts that many first-year students may not have had prior training in. For upper-level students with experience in these areas, they may have been more accessible, but the material was often very technical and it limited the opportunity to learn applications of the concepts we learned. ",
            "\u00a0The readings are not covered in great detail, but enough detail for the tests. ",
            "\u00a0This course lacked structure and the fact that we didn't have a textbook made the situation even worse. Most of the lessons, especially those near the end of the course, seemed rushed. It was especially hard to get a grasp of how to solve differential equations with power series when so little time was devoted to that skill. I was upset when a significant portion of the final exam was on power series. ",
            "\u00a0Parts are hard and long. The class is structured well, though I would have preferred a textbook or some other material that is easier to understand than the obscure articles meant to teach us more about the specific math topic we are learning. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: interesting, engaging, and fast-paced\r\nWeakness: Lack of primary textbook for personal reference ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course are definitely the teacher and the course notes he provides. It really helps the students understand what is going on. One of the weaknesses is how fast the course is and how the teacher sometimes assumes students know how to do some mathematical simplifications that they don't. ",
            "\u00a0Since there is no textbook, the course forces you to learn many topics yourself. You must, therefore, rely heavily on course notes. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed learning the math, but the p-sets were very difficult and took so much time that I felt they were degrading my learning rather than helping it. Many times, I wouldn't understand the p-sets even after completing them, and even after going in for help. The integration of biology and real-world problems was really helpful, and I enjoyed the readings! Professor Hall was wonderful as well, and made me feel successful even when I was struggling. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths-\r\n- manageable homework\r\n- related assignments\r\n- wonderful professor\r\nWeaknesses-\r\n- move too quickly in class\r\n- last minute cramming of information (in each class) ",
            "\u00a0The peer tutor was the biggest weakness ",
            "\u00a0It felt like the problem sets were largely ahead of the class so some material we were expected to know to complete them wasnt introduced until the class period before it was due. ",
            "\u00a0The class was interesting in that it allowed for the student to think about math in a different way. The class moved very fast though and the problem sets also included material that had not yet been taught which made it very difficult. I felt like the concepts could've been explained more clearly though the professor was very friendly and helpful outside of the classroom. The final exam was also extremely difficult. ",
            "\u00a0The course was really good at reteaching me integral calculus but I feel like the Linear Algebra often seemed kind of rushed and forced because of some of the more advanced bio articles we were looking at. ",
            "\u00a0The class was taught very well. I have no complaints about the quality of instruction. I do, however, think the course's subject matter does trail toward higher level math than advertised. For this reason, at times, I did wish there was a book. I would say a weakness is that the instructor's passion can drive him to include more than is necessary for this level of mathematics. ",
            "\u00a0One strength of the course is that it is well-organized. Another strength is that Professor Hall is enthusiastic about the course topic, and it shows in how he teaches. One weakness of the course is that it is super fast-paced. Another weakness is that since the class is a small lecture class, there are not a lot of resources you can go to in order to grasp the topics more firmly. More resources dedicated to the course's complex nature could help future students. "

            "\u00a0Take 115 instead. 116 sounds great if you are a bio major, but in actuality, it is difficult and confusing. ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend this course to another student if they have an appropriate mathematical background. I would advise against taking this course without at least Calculus B/C in High School. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this class is very interesting and should be explored by any students with an interest in math and biosciences. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to any student looking to complete MATH 115, but with a greater emphasis on math with evident applications to the real world than just straight computation. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I would recommend this course to another student who is genuinely interested in math and the biosciences. It was a very difficult course, but I believe it was worth it! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to other students interested in material that connects biology with math. To me it wasn't rewarding to see how the two are related and gain insight into how calculus is  incorporated into research work. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Only if you like biology or find medicine interesting. It will prompt you to think more deeply about the math behind science. ",
            "\u00a0Potentially depending the student. ",
            "\u00a0For students planning on taking Math 120, I would not, but to students that only have to take Math 115 or 116 and are science-oriented, I would. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to students who are interested in biology and how mathematics can help better understand biological systems. It's also an interesting option for students who have to take Math 115 or an equivalent, and John Hall is a great professor. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend for any other student to take this course with Professor Hall.  He is incredibly helpful in making the most complex of concepts easy to understand.  He is a very engaged professor and holds teaching as his main goal, rather than assessing.  Highly recommend his course as a way to advance calculus skills in a biology-related modeling context. ",
            "\u00a0For students interested in the applications of calculus rather than the pure math, this is probably a better choice than MATH 115. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, though you should know that this class is different than 115. It is more conceptual. ",
            "\u00a0If you are taking this course to fulfill your pre-med requirements, please take some other math class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes if you are truly willing to put in the time and work for to understand the very specific topics that are taught in this class. If premed, I would just recommend math 115 even though this class does sound very interesting in its description. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, although there is a certain stigma that hangs above this class. People believe that it is very \"pre-med-ish\". In reality, it is not. It is biological, and it takes a genuine interest in biology and the sciences as well as maths to stay engaged. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. Can't wait for Math 121 when it comes out. ",
            "\u00a0I don't know how Math 115 is, but this class is going to challenge you a lot. You might need to take 116 or 115, but think wisely before choosing this one. I would recommend it if you're up to a challenge and really want to learn about math in a way that relates more to the real-world. It is a good class, but it is also the hardest class I've had this semester by far. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I believe that MATH116 is an incredible alternative to MATH115, and requires/teaches a different skillset. It may not be the most useful for non-STEM students, but otherwise I would recommend it. ",
            "\u00a0Overall I would recommend this course to another student. It is well organized and I learned a lot from taking it. It was also interesting to see real-world applications of mathematical models in different fields of biology and health sciences. My only criticism of the course is that it was somewhat disjointed in that not all of the topics learned were related/ built upon each other. It is a challenging but rewarding course. ",
            "\u00a0At the level of math 115 I think that course is easier in terms of material based on talking to enrolled students and think that students should focus on these calculus foundations before extending into these complicated applications. ",
            "\u00a0If the person was very interested in biology and math, I might recommend the course. I would, however, tell them to prepared for very difficult problem sets and a Professor that is very friendly but moves very quickly in the class (too quickly for me) ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Great course that taught me the basics ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning how to interpret mathematical representations of biological behavior. I found the content widely applicable and intensely satisfying. ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend this course to students who are completely confident in their math abilities. The course topics are ridiculously complex as we deal with linear algebra and differential equations even though the course's only prereq is calculus I. Since there is only one section of the class, resources are scarce when you are stumped on one of the 9-10 question problem sets that have multiple parts that are assigned every week. Another drawback comes from the fact that there is no textbook to try and teach yourself the material. The course notes online are rather bare, and lectures are filled with examples that do not actually tell you how to approach the problems on the psets. If your major requires you to take a calc class or a stats class, I would suggest that you take the stats class. "
