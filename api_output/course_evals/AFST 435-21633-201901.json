            "\u00a0An appreciation and corporeal understanding of West African Dance and parts of it's diaspora ",
            "\u00a0When I looked at coursetable and saw this course, I thought \"this is crazy.\" It was !!! The best experience at Yale!!! I thought I could never dance. Boy I was wrong. My legs and arms started doing all these complicated movements and choreographies. I was like, \"new body, who dis?\". TAKE THIS CLASS! You might think like \"oh how will this class be useful to my consulting career\". I'm telling you: stop thinking like a snake and start thinking like a human being who can tear up the dancefloor. Also I found in this class an incredible, tight-knit community. We laughed and danced and had the best semester. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my dancing and rhythmic abilities. ",
            "\u00a0i learned several west african dances, traditional and contemporary, how to become comfortable with my own body and improv, how to construct rhythm, and lacina's experience in burkina faso ",
            "\u00a0Learned about West African culture, rhythm and improvisation. ",
            "\u00a0Understanding of traditional and contemporary West African dance and how that fits into West African culture. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the basics of different styles of west african dance. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the art of improvisation and of feeling liberated while dancing. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this course.  First of all, it was wonderful to dance for four hours a week.  Initially, it seemed like a large time commitment, but it flew by.  I gained a thorough understanding of traditional and contemporary West African choreography. We also read texts and watched videos that delved into the culture of West African through the lense of rhythm.  The reading was light and manageable. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: Lacina Coulibaly is a wonderful Dance Professor, and has a wonderful energy and approach to encourage his students to go outside the box and try new things in each of the dances.\r\n\r\nWeakness: I would have liked to recieve a bit more feedback from the midterm essay before going into the final paper for the class. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is the Professor, Lacina, who is an extraordinary dancer. He will break down moves for you until you get them. Another strenght, is that this class is STRESS-FREE. Yes you heard me right: no anxiety of finishing psets on time, none nerve wracking exams ... Just dance and relaxed group discussions. It's the best learning environment. Obviously, you have to put in the work and come to class, which is twice a week, 1h50 each class. But I swear to you it's worth the time and sweat. At the end of the semester, we have a performance which gave me some much joy and adrenaline. It's the best! ",
            "\u00a0It was an amazing course, I see little room for improvement. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: such a breath of fresh air from yale courses. i always left this class energized and happy. lacina is such a gem and loves his students\r\nweaknesses: don't expect any feedback, some of the instructions were ambiguous, the class was really long twice a week so it takes out a huge chunk out of your week. i think it could be shortened ",
            "\u00a0All strengths, no weaknesses ",

            "\u00a0This is an amazing course! Only downside is that it is a lot of in class time, but it is certainly worth it because the readings are unnecessary. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The professors attention to each student was impeccable. I really enjoyed how Professor Coulibaly deliberately worked to help us gain from his culture through dance. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Coulibaly was patient and enthusiastic.  He did a very good job of teaching the movements, so that all students could understand.  I enjoyed our discussions and the final presentation. \r\nMy only critique is that I wish the expectations for the writing assignment were more explicit. "

            "\u00a0YES! If you get into this course after the day of auditions, you should definitely take this course, Coulibaly helps personalize the experience for every dancer, so every person gets specific individualized helpful feedback on their approach to the dances. The discussions each week are full of insight from Coulibaly's experiences and his philosophy of dance. ",
            "\u00a0YES!!!!! Take it!! Aren't you tired of sitting in a dark lecture hall at 9am ? Come dance in the bright studio of Payne Whitney instead! This class will give you life. I had forgotten what my body felt like. After this class, I felt like all my stress and worries disappear. There is no room for negative energy in this class. ",
            "\u00a0The one flaw was that we never received feedback from our first paper, which made the second paper slightly more difficult. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I loved this course! It was definitely one of my favorite courses Ive taken, and it was truly a great senior spring course. ",
            "\u00a0take it to challenge yourself, to exercise, to learn about african dance and culture, to witness the greatness that is lacina, to build a tight community with your class. could not recommend enough--this class made my spring semester so worthwhile. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, great for beginners and advanced dancers. ",
            "\u00a0Intellectually stimulating in a way that I haven't found in any other class. Must take if interested in music and dance. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! Its so much fun to learn for professor Coulibaly. ",
            "\u00a0This course did an amazing job of immersing students in the different aspects of West African dance and helping us to understand what it means to not think about the next steps in choreographies, but rather, to just improvise. ",
            "\u00a0YES.  This class was gratifying and fun! It was a good balance with my other classes, which had a more strenuous workload.  I loved learned about West African Dance and culture.  The required events outside of class were great, and getting to interact with the movement was exceptional. "
