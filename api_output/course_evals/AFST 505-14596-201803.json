            "\u00a0Most of my learning came from the readings. I will carry Baldwin's \"horizontal accountability\" notion everywhere I go.\r\nI learned that archaeology can be a great deal more than meticulous extrication; prof. Waweru's paper was quite fun for me personally to read. Straus' article reminded me why I had such an interest in Cote d'Ivoire; I will be looking for opportunities to do some research on the country in future.\r\nI retooled my thesis idea; I had originally planned to integrate my South Africa research into a much broader study of African secession, but now I will more likely use South Africa as a means of studying secession in Africa. I requested and received Harms' African history overview for Christmas and look forward to reading. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a broader sense of the kinds of research approaches taken by scholars working in Africa across various fields. The course deepened my engagement with scholarship across various disciplines. "

            "\u00a0The course provides a solid grab bag of foci for the African Studies student looking to do interdisciplinary work, or looking for the category into which their thesis might best fit, who to approach for advisement. A number of the readings were quite engaging, as I mentioned before.\r\n\r\nThe weekly lecturers need to put much more effort into streamlining their presentations. Much of the time they spent far too much time detailing the background of what they did instead of looking to explain their field, its importance and new innovations within it. Their focus on the readings was spotty; sometimes they paid essentially no mind to them and lectured on a totally different subject (Newell, Steinberg), and at other times they adhered very strictly to said readings to the extent that they needn't have bothered presenting (Veal). The lectures felt like a ground-level introduction, excellent for undergraduates with no background at all, less so for graduate students who are not only familiar with the field but also are required to write a thesis for the major and therefore should have been thinking about it anyway. \r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, I would ask lecturing professors not to talk about their own writing, as it risks distracting from the field writ large. PowerPoints generally did not help, except when visuals were necessary. Harms' lecture was vastly better for not having notes or slides, even if he did talk for far too long.\r\n\r\nThere needed to be far more class time spent on honing our ideas and proposals. At least one of my classmates had no background with writing a broad thesis and as a result expressed a frustration that they lacked focus and were not sure of how to approach the whole endeavor. The advice both profs gave on proposal writing was good - but it needed to be given much earlier in the semester, preferably right around the time we submitted the idea. I came into the class with a fairly specific idea that I came up with before I even applied to the program - and I suspect others did too. The challenge of this aspect of the class was not structured to maximize depth and strength in the proposals. Catherine's presentation had some great practical insight and I would have liked to see it earlier in the semester to help inform the \"challenges\" section of our proposals.\r\n\r\nIn short, the basic idea of the class makes sense but there ought to have been much more time devoted to how one ought to write a proposal than to understanding the full variety of fields in African Studies. ",
            "\u00a0The course needs more structure and should be more directly focused on preparing students for their research projects. ",

            "\u00a0It's required for African Studies Masters students so a recommendation is relatively irrelevant. If the course were retooled I would - and it was interesting - but I would only recommend this course as is to someone coming into African Studies with a multidisciplinary or hard-to-categorize approach. Both profs are helpful and lend their free time to one-on-one discussion, so there's plenty of opportunity to clarify and hone your ideas. For me, as someone with a fairly specific idea of what I wanted going into this major, I lent certain lectures far more attention. However, this class offers plenty of opportunities to hone your writing and flex your analytical-critical muscle, and exercises in concision are essential for a good writer, not only in improving your craft, but your understanding and ability to read articles well in the first place.

            "\u00a0Yes, its a means of exploring the kind of research that is being followed across the continent. "
