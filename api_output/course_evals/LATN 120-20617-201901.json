            "\u00a0In this course I gained a very solid understanding of latin grammar, and also gained the ability to begin reading actual latin texts. The first half of the course is dedicated to reenforcing the grammar learned in Latin 110, as well as adding on several new concepts, and the second half we spent translating a short latin text, which was very fun! ",

            "\u00a0I learnt much more vocabulary, syntax, and sentence constructions to add to my latin knowledge from L1. I learned how to read a short text of latin, and translate. "

            "\u00a0A weakness of this course is the pace we move at, but I think that is hard to avoid due to the intensive nature of languages here at Yale. This at times makes it hard to fully grasp a concept/translation before moving on to the next thing. However, the strength is that you are able to become at least proficiently good at Latin in a VERY short amount of time! I've only taken latin for two semester, yet I feel very comfortable approaching any latin text and at least be able to understand basic components of it. ",
            "\u00a0The pace was good I liked the course ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are its immersive nature of teaching and the speed with which you develop skills in the language. The weaknesses could be the workload, and a heavy focus on syntax. "

            "\u00a0Yes! But only if you are prepared to dedicate 2-3 hours a night. The course is phenomenal, and you are able to get very good at latin very quick, but it's not for those who are looking to breeze through a language requirement. ",
            "\u00a0Only if you get Chris Londa as your instructor ",
            "\u00a0I would if they are keen linguists and looking to be fully immersed in a language. If they have a tight schedule, I think this class could present difficulties. "
