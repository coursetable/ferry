            "\u00a0I learned about classical theory, dictation, sight singing, and rhythm. ",
            "\u00a0In this class, I was able to strengthen my aural skills in music. I really think my ear got a lot better at analyzing music throughout the semester. I also became a better sight-reader and more confidently in performing difficult rhythms. Probably the most helpful part of the course, to me, was keyboard lab. I felt like I learned so much about voice leading and good voicing from having to do it on the spot in figured bass realizations and melody harmonization. Also my confidence in score reading at the piano really improved throughout the semester, and It's a skill that I have found very useful to me in my studies in music composition. ",
            "\u00a0I developed my ability to hear, sing, and analyze music. ",
            "\u00a0I became a better pianist. Chromatic solefedge was helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I am leaving this course with a slightly better handle on how to problem solve musical transcription. ",
            "\u00a0Worked on listening and dictation skills, but I don't feel like I learned much about how to get better at it -- we just practiced a lot and I continued to struggle ",

            "\u00a0This course was enjoyable, but I would suggest that there would be more ways to prepare for the unprepared parts of the exams.  The dictations and listening portions seemed to be much easier for those with an existing background in classical music or perfect pitch.  In that way, those musicians had an advantage. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course was having a separate keyboard lab. I felt like it was a great way for me to improve through gaining personalized feedback. And I think missing that specific feedback with ear training and sight singing was a real downside of the course. I feel like I could've improved so much more, if I would have gotten more personal feedback. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the pace and the content was great! Honestly, it felt a bit too infrequent to be really effective though. With a lot of the things we learned, I thought that meeting 3 times a week or having some kind of daily practice would have helped. ",
            "\u00a0No more theory please. Keyboard lab is very helpful if you put the work in. ",
            "\u00a0Its a decent amount of work for only a half credit. ",
            "\u00a0It should focus more on how to improve your musicianship skills and not just focus on practicing them. I understand that practice is important, but I rarely saw improvement because I never learned techniques about how to get better at these things. ",
            "\u00a0The course is fairly strong. The only inconsistency that threw me off was the use of the generated audio for some harmonic dictation exercises. The soundfont is so poor that it can make discerning pitches extremely challenging. ",
            "\u00a0Not particularly engaging or interesting, but I learned what I needed to learn. was just taking this so I could get lessons for credit. I'm pretty sure I didn't do a single piece of homework for this class the entire semester and I still did well. "

            "\u00a0Yes; if you are looking to become a more well-rounded musician, this course gives you a great foundation in so many skills necessary to being a good musician. ",

            "\u00a0Yeah. It helps, and it's a prerequisite. ",
            "\u00a0As a fun way to fill a half credit, yes. I wish I had taken theory or history instead of skills, but this definitely exercises your brain in a way you wont find anywhere else. ",

            "\u00a0You learn somewhat useful skills, but it wasn't especially intellectually engaging "
