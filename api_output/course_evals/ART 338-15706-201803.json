            "\u00a0This is an excellent class for developing a semester-long photography project with regular and quite helpful crits. ",
            "\u00a0How to identify a project and follow it all semester, how to sequence images, how to print on large Epson printers ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot from the lectures on photographers and discussions about the history of photography from this class about digital photography. But these lectures made up a small proportion of the lessons and most of the photographic skills I needed to teach myself. You need a very high level of photographic skill and understanding to take this class and I would recommend watching YouTube tutorials about DSLR cameras to take this class. There is very little instruction about how to use the camera. "

            "\u00a0The course allows you to pursue photography at your own pace and you get to shoot things you are really interested in. It fosters a good environment for creativity. ",
            "\u00a0This class offered you a lot of freedom in regards to what and how you could photograph. The professor just lets you make up a project on your own and then spend the entire semester doing that project. But because of this it was very difficult to understand what kind of work the professor wanted to see. Also we were not expected to use lesson time to photograph so the class was a lot of work because you had to do all of your photographing outside of class time. You had to take many pictures with a high skill level in order to display one photograph that the professor really liked. This is by no means a class in teaching you the skills of photography and it is more about finding the meaning behind your photographs, which already have to be at a very high level. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely take this class if you can! If you dedicate yourself to the work you'll come out  of it all a better artist, with a portfolio to show for it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to someone who wants to learn more about pursuing a real photography project and improving on one idea for the whole semester. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student looking to take their interest in photography to the next level. For the most part, Ted allows you to photograph whatever the student chooses, which really allows for the student to find their own style and the types of subjects they are interested in. Ted as well as the rest of the class provides excellent feedback through semi-regular critiques, which are also extremely helpful and prompted me to think about my work in a way that I had never done before. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0I would reccomend this course to another student that already has an in-depth understanding of DSLR cameras and digital photography. If you do not understand how to use tripods, lighting equipment and long aperture on the camera I would reccomend learning to do that before you start this course. I would not recommend this course to someone who has nothing to say via taking photographs. "
