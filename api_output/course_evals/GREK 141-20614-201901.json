            "\u00a0The syllabus was well chosen, and the workload was just enough to be challenging without ever being overwhelming. I think that it would have been nice to have more engagement with the Iliad, but I understand the limitations of the course and the need to focus on a singular work. \r\n\r\nI did feel, however, that the length of the quizzes was never quite right. This is the only class I've taken where I've felt that I consistently haven't had enough time even to write down my answers on regular assignments, and I think that slightly shortened quizzes wouldn't detract anything from the class but would only make the actual process of evaluation more manageable.

            "\u00a0Definitely. I learned a lot from this course, and our professor Pauline LeVen was amazing throughout the semester. ",
