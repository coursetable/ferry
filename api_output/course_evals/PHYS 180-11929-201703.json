            "\u00a0Adrianne Steinacker is the absolute best and she is 100% the strength of this course. The weaknesses of this course are the depth of the material one is expected to know in a basic pre-req class that many STEM majors must take ",
            "\u00a0This class is designed to promote student learning and success, IF you have a lot of extra time to spend on it. Without attending office hours (which added an extra 6 to 10 hours to my classes), extensive work outside of class, etc. I'm not sure that passing this course is even possible. However, the instructor is fair and cares deeply about her students, and want to help students who put the effort in. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\nGreat organization, great professor, great online lecture notes, problems sets are just challenging enough but not too overwhelming \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\nDiscrepancies in grading between TFs seemed unfair ",
            "\u00a0The support in this class is incredible. The professor is absolutely amazing. She has office hours almost every day and works hard to help everyone out while also getting to know all her students by name. There's also a lot of support from the peer tutors which really eased the pressure of the course/workload. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very fast for students who have not taken mush calculus or physics before.  I never took physics in high school and found the material and exams very difficult.  I also only took MATH 116 before this course and found the math hard to follow sometimes. ",
            "\u00a0Very time consuming, but I guess that's the only way to learn physics ",
            "\u00a0You will definitely work a ton more in this class than in any other class, but its totally worth it. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Steinacker is great! She is a really entertaining lecturer, and she cares for every one of her students. Even though the topics can be difficult at times, she is very willing to help each student understand the material.\r\nWeaknesses: None really. ",
            "\u00a0The strength was the collaborative attitude was all the students helping each other to solve the problems and the ability to use test corrections on tests. However, the weakness is that the problem set questions are very hard and there is a disconnect between lecture topics and problems on the pset because the pset is much more advanced than the basics learned in class, so the pset takes a very long time to complete each week. ",
            "\u00a0The problem sets are really difficult. But that said, they are worth 35% of your grade, so Steinacker makes them worth your while. ",
            "\u00a0Great course with many resources to utilize for optimal learning. The feedback on homework and exams although generous for grading was not clear on how to answer the problem and learn the material. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course was very well organized. The amount of help you can get outside of the classroom is overwhelming. It is impossible not to do well in the class, if you are committed to learning. The problem sets sometimes were too long, but it may be a subjective opinion because I had a heavy course load this semester. ",
            "\u00a0This class is so demanding, and I think that is both its strength and weakness. You have to dedicate so many hours to office hours and study hall just to get through the psets each week, but if you are willing to make that time investment, you come out knowing so much. ",
            "\u00a0Adriane will post lecture notes for all of her classes after the lecture. So, you can go back and review the material she covered in there. I didn't realize this until a few weeks in but Adriane's lecture notes are WAY more useful than the textbook, so it's worth it it to just use that. They will also go into concepts/ideas slightly more in depth/have a more throughout explanation than in class - so it's always a good idea to check them out. Also, a strength is that there are corrections after each of the 2 midterms, so you can gain back half of the points you lost. ",
            "\u00a0I really like that this course is graded in such a way that most people do very well. The class is taught well and everyone who takes the course seriously will learn something, no matter their physics background. Not the most difficult course but I would prefer if the PSETs focused less on smart algebraic thinking and more on physics ",
            "\u00a0It's Physics 1 -- it can't really be dressed up. But Dr. Steinacker does a great job of making the subject interesting -- she's obviously incredibly intelligent and passionate about physics (especially her background in astrophysics research) and she makes students excited about it too (at least for me!). This was one class where I felt like the professor really made an effort to show students interesting applications of the material so that you felt what you were doing was important and relevant, which is so often lacking in intro STEM classes. The structure of afternoon office hours and evening study halls for psets was also very helpful and it's great that there are so many different times available so that anyone can fit at least one of these sessions into their schedules. ",
            "\u00a0The course is really good Professor Steinacker does a really great job of publishing clear notes and that are well organized and fit well with the problem sets etc. I always felt like I needed to do the psets with other people because they were difficult and some problems were so hard you just need hints, but I really enjoyed working with other people and I think it was a good learning experience. There was a decent amount of algebra. ",
            "\u00a0The study halls every night were the best part. ",
            "\u00a0This course fosters (and for many, demands) a collaborative environment that emphasizes group-based learning. Between Professor Steinacker's well-attended office hours and evening study halls on Hillhouse offer plenty of opportunity for students to work together on problem sets and work to understand the material better. It's important, because the lectures are paced very quickly, so the structure of having an assignment due each week and working on it with other people helps to keep students responsible for the material without falling behind. The problem sets are designed to help students learn the most important concepts. An additional section of 180 might be an improvement on the course to prevent overcrowding, especially because Professor Steinacker tries to encourage greater participation in class and with a full lecture hall, it is difficult to accomplish that engagement. ",
            "\u00a0I personally think the strength of the class are the lectures which are very good and the sense of community that develops around the classroom. The main weakness that I find are the p-sets which are very time consuming and difficult to do. ",
            "\u00a0The class is incredibly well-taught under Prof. Steinacker, though it is certainly challenging. It is highly collaborative and relatively low-stress in terms of grading, but it is also very high in workload. ",
            "\u00a0Less proofs and more problems. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly, too many psets that take too much time. But lecture helps, and Steinacker is the best. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Steinacker makes Physics 180 worth it! The p-sets are really challenging and usually take me at least half a week's worth of work to finish, but as long as you put in the effort to go to office hours and ask questions, you can figure out the right answers to everything. Professor Steinacker and her peer tutors are there to help, and they want you to do well on these p-sets. The two midterms were hard for me in terms of time management - the questions aren't unreasonable in terms of content (you can prepare well by doing the provided practice midterm/going to Professor Steinacker's review session), but you do have to work efficiently, which isn't always easy when you run into a problem you need to take some time to process. The final exam was killer, though. It wasn't so much cumulative as it was focused on the last third of material we covered in class, but the questions were much harder than the midterm content! Professor Steinacker's reviews were helpful, but they didn't really prepare me for the level of difficulty of the exam. ",
            "\u00a0This class pushes you to learn a lot of physics and tackle really difficult problems. It trains you to think like a physicist and to think about how all topics are related in physics and in science. The class homework takes a long time and can be difficult to do independently, but there are so many resources for you to learn and get help: study halls, office hours, peer tutors, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Steinacker herself is certainly the main strength of this course. She is one of the most enthusiastic professors I have ever had the fortune to have as an instructor; she truly cares about the students and wants to make sure they succeed in learning the physics concepts. She is always available to help students and always willing to put more time in. Her tireless energy truly made the class a wonderful experience, despite the abstract-ness of some of the topics.\r\n\r\nI also thought that the homework load was very fair. I know that in past years, all ten homework problems were required, but this course was extremely fair in only having students complete 7-8 questions. I would not have minded if all of them were graded, though, rather than only 5 questions graded per pset. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: well organized, well taught, many resources for help (extensive office hours and study hall), amazing professor, fair exams, test corrections\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some pset problems were too difficult and I found to save time students would just ask for solutions rather than trying to spend more time and effort than necessary to understand how to solve the problem ",
            "\u00a0One strength of this class is how much emphasis there is on collaboration, especially with the psets. I really appreciated that Professor Steinacker encouraged us all to work with and learn from each other. One weakness of the class was that I thought the lectures were a bit disorganized at times. While the lecture notes were always really clear and explained the concepts well, I thought that the lectures focused a bit too much on the math behind the physics rather than the physics concepts themselves. ",
            "\u00a0Considering the material Prof. Steinacker made it super interesting, so Id say shes a solid strength of this course. I think its pretty well set up, in class demonstrations are one of the best parts, grading is exceedingly fair, and overall a good experience. The lecture notes are awesome. ",
            "\u00a0This course can teach students (those who have the time to REALLY dig into it) quite a LOT.\r\n\r\nAnd as time consuming as the problem-sets are, I believe that they teach valuable approaches to general problem solving. I would assert that the problem sets are also good for developing skills around teamwork, as it doesn't seem to be often that they're solved, totally correctly, by a single individual who's working alone.\r\n\r\nHowever, it also seems to me that students can neglect to learn how to actually study physics (building understandings of concepts, learning how to derive & apply formulas, etc.) & simply focus on turning in P-sets. Copying them IS totally possible, and, sadly, does happen.\r\n\r\nOf course, copying P-sets is also reflected in exam performance.\r\n\r\nMy only definite complaint would be that more accurate practice tests and finals should be available, as the practice final that was provided was far more difficult than the actual final.\r\n\r\nAlso, I know that this would be difficult to provide for a lecture of this size, but a larger emphasis on solving physics problems in general (i.e. more feedback on the format & reasoning students provide to back up their answers) would be nice. Teaching HOW to do physics, and not just providing knowledge of kinematics, dynamics, etc., is, I believe, important. ",
            "\u00a0Physics 180 provides the students with an ample amount of resources in order to help with problem sets as well as any questions one may have about the material. Not only do they have Office hours several times a week but then there are also study halls which I found incredibly helpful if you are struggling with a problem set. As for the weaknesses, I think it would be better to have a consistency in who grades the problem sets because what I have found is that some TA's grade easier than others causing certain people's grades to suffer slightly more than others. ",
            "\u00a0This course, through Psets, gives one a creative approach to problem solving but there are alwaysbquestions in Psets that need complex mathematical manipulations one would never figure out on their own ",
            "\u00a0I found the homework to not be all the helpful for learning the material. Most of the homework was too hard to complete by-myself, so I went to study hall nearly every night. At study hall, someone who did understand the material very well would then answer all my questions, but I couldn't have figured it out on my own. On the contrary, being able to do test corrections was a bug help! Having to go back through my mistakes helped me to understand what I had done correctly and what I had messed up on! ",
            "\u00a0I feel like there isn't enough preparation for the level of difficulty for the types of questions we see on the psets/exams in comparison to what we do in class. Part of this is definitely due to the large amount of material that we try to cover but there should at least be one or two questions in a class that are of the higher caliber/ incorporate multiple concepts at once to prepare for higher-level thinking. ",
            "\u00a0The structure of the course, with lectures, study halls, and office hours, was very helpful. The PSETs prepared us well for the exams and the exams were fair. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Steinacker clearly cares about seeing students succeed, and her lectures are very engaging. The midterm exams are challenging, but fair, especially based on the problem sets and exam reviews provided. There is so much help available -- between office hours and study halls. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The problem sets are meant to be collaborative, which has its benefits, but there are some problems that seemed to only be solvable with very specific knowledge/strategies that one could not get unless they attended office hours or worked with a friend who had attended. \r\n\r\nAlthough the problem sets are time consuming and complex, they are weighted to reflect that in the grade, and the complexity was good preparation for exams. ",
            "\u00a0honestly, PRAISE prof steinacker; she put in a huge amount of effort and labor and really helped me learn how to work through a problem. assignments were hugely challenging, but you get through them and are better. i assume this amount of difficulty is necessary for other students, as a pre-med it was a little much...but i did really learn the fundamental concepts as well as a large amount of algebra.... ",

She has an in-depth, expansive knowledge of this field, which she explained to us in a way that was easy to understand. She was always available to help us and the amount of time she dedicated to us was quite remarkable. A weakness of this course were the teaching assistants because they really didn't seem engaged and weren't helpful during study halls because they wouldn't check the answer key before launching into an explanation that was either incorrect or beyond the scope of the class.

I suppose that this I s a good way to learn, and it was pretty well compensated for by the grading scheme. The material was clear and well organized, and Professor Steinacker was helpful and enthusiastic. Unfortunately, many students, like myself, took this class as a prerequisite, and were not particularly enthusiastic about physics. I think one way to draw in such students could be to offer more examples of real-world applications. ",

            "\u00a0The strength of this course is that Prof Steinacker is a really helpful and engaging lecturer. She's also a superwoman during office hours. I'm honestly not sure how she manages to help so many students in a few hours.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of this course is that it relies heavily on math to explain physics concepts. For instance, we would often derive equations we had never seen before, and then learn what they represented in the physical world. For me, this made the derivations extremely hard to follow because I had no idea what direction the equations were going.\r\n\r\nThe class is currently structured as: learn a basic equation, work through a derivation to a new equation, explain what that equation does and how it relates to physics.\r\n\r\nI think this class would be greatly improved if class was structured as: Here's a physical concept (like simple harmonic motion) which has these properties, here's the SHM equation, you'll notice it also has these properties. Here's the derivation a famous physicist used to get to this point.\r\n\r\nOne last suggestion is to cut down the breadth of P-sets. Some questions were very tangential to what we learned in class and had little to do with what we were eventually tested on. I understand the desire to broaden our knowledge, but it's cruel to add broad questions onto P-sets that already take 10+ hours a week to finish. These p-sets honestly took me longer than all the homework for my other classes combined.\r\n\r\nThere was also a general feeling among the people I spoke to that their should never be problems that you can't solve with learning a specific math trick during office hours. There was one problem on the P set where you just had to divine a simplification by multiplying something by sin/cos in the maximum case and cos/sin in the minimum case, with absolutely no explanation, and pretty much no way to discover that on your own (unless you're extremely talented at math). ",
            "\u00a0This class made me love physics and gave me the confidence that I could solve physics problems by following a systematic way of understanding and thinking. Professor Steinacker really helped me develop interest, confidence, intuition, and problem-solving ability through her in-class derivations, demonstrations, and style of lecturing. I loved the problem sessions and frequent office hours/peer tutoring hours. They really gave me the chance to ask questions and understand the material. \r\n\r\nMy one suggestion for improvement is that the chapter on harmonic oscillators and waves be taught more slowly. I feel like we rushed through the material at the end. ",

            "\u00a0If you have to take this course as a prerequisite, Professor Steinacker is a good teacher to take it with. She explained the material clearly and offered a lot of support, and though her assignments and exams were difficult, the grading scheme evens things out a bit. I didn't enjoy the class, but I don't like physics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, take this! ",
            "\u00a0No, especially not if they had not taken a physics before this one. ",
            "\u00a0It's intro. physics. You'll likely have to take it at some point. I would recommend taking 180 over some of the other courses, simply because it has the most dedicated professor, TAs, and peer tutors. ",
            "\u00a0It's a standard physics class. the concepts will be very easy for you if you've taken AP physics C. Prof. Steinacker is awesome. Be aware that P-sets are literally impossible to do on your own and will take a minimum of 10 hours a week to finish. Office hours are basically mandatory because their are math tricks required to solve the problems that aren't covered in class and would be extremely difficult to figure out on your own. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to a student interested in physics and willing to work. Whereas I have sometimes felt that physics is one of those subjects where the work I put in all goes into a black hole and doesn't correlate at all with my performance, in this class I definitely gained confidence and felt that the amount of work I put in directly correlated with how well I could do. This class is very empowering that way. The class is very rigorous but you emerge with a gut-level understanding of the concepts and problem-solving. You also become convinced that physics is beautiful and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend this class to students with a strong physics background. ",
            "\u00a0I would not take this class unless I had to.  Unfortunately, it is one of the courses needed to fulfill many prerequisites.  It is very difficult and not very enjoyable if you don't like physics. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course because I learned a lot very deeply. I was able to collaborate with other students and that made the psets more enjoyable. It was challenging but good. ",
            "\u00a0Physics 180 was a great class. "
