            "\u00a0This course provides a nice introduction to Chaucer, Shakespeare, early English lyrics, and Milton. ENGL 125 students learn to apply close-reading strategies to analyze and construct arguments about early English poetry. ",
            "\u00a0Familiarity with certain influential English poets and their works, as well as common discussion around certain works and insight into forming our own arguments about them. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a more comprehensive understanding of some major English poets, and was able to study as well as critique some of their major works. I also further honed my own writing skills and voice which improved my ability to write critically on certain literary texts. "

            "\u00a0One strength of the course is that the works are truly interesting (although challenging) to read. Another strength is that students are always encouraged to delve deeper in whatever direction or topic they choose for their papers. However, the readings for the class were rarely discussed in full. I'm not sure if this is true for other sections of ENGL 125, but it seems as though our class would read hundreds of lines of poetry in preparation for class and then discuss a few dozen lines. Close-reading is of course crucial to this class, but I think class time might be better spent recognizing overarching trends throughout the entirety of each session's reading assignment rather than focusing on such a small quantity of lines. Clearer feedback on papers could also be given besides \"go further\" or \"delve deeper\", especially considering that our topics are self-assigned. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely feel the pieces read for this class were very important for understanding other important works.The reading was very fast-paced and while the workload was manageable, it felt like the discussion was somewhat surface-level on account of the amount of reading we had to get through. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very good at giving a comprehensive and detailed focus on each text we read, so that students could analyze the poetry from many different perspectives. The inclusion of non-literary aids as well as a trip to the Beinecke museum created a well-rounded atmosphere. One weakness of the course is its lack of female authors. "

            "\u00a0There are certainly more fun and exciting courses but this course is more or less mandatory for English majors and I understand why. Discussing these works is essential for understanding the evolution of English poetry and literature. If that isn't your cup of tea, I wouldn't take the class, but if it is, absolutely do! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student if they are interested in early English poets. The course is intensive and focuses on some great texts, but the pleasure that you derive from the course is directly dependent on how much involvement you have. If you do all of the required readings and participate in discussion, the class is very enjoyable and fulfilling. "
