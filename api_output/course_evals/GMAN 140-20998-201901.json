            "\u00a0I gained a better grasp of the German language and culture. ",
            "\u00a0By taking this, I got to learn a lot more about German culture and in addition to learning the language and its semantics. My writing, speaking, and hearing skills all became much more refined over the course of the semester. The things I learned helped me make comparisons across cultures, which was helpful. ",
            "\u00a0German ",
            "\u00a0i have improved my grammar, listening, and writing skills during this semester. I have also realized the necessity of continually reviewing new vocabulary words in increasing proficiency in a language. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of new German grammatical structures and vocabulary. ",
            "\u00a0German grammar, speaking and writing ",
            "\u00a0In addition to learning new grammar and vocabulary, there was a special focus on improving our speaking through various group activities and discussions in class. ",
            "\u00a0Although I was exposed to German daily, I do not think I really developed nor improved my German skills. It is true that speaking in the language on a daily basis motivated me to practice German, but that was about it. Explained grammar was only showed on the slides for only several minutes - no additional practice was given to us like worksheets, or anything to practice the new grammar. I feel like it was assumed we were supposed to study it on our own.  I have studied German for many years and I know the best approach is practice practice and practice. However, the style of teaching in this class was highly ineffective and really do not think I have learned a lot, besides some interesting facts from German-speaking countries. "

            "\u00a0The course is well tailored to help strengthen understanding of the language with a good mixture of technical assessments and assignments and creative, fun activities that make students think outside of the box and learn the formal and colloquial aspects of the language in a new, interesting way. ",
            "\u00a0Very responsive to feedback and caters to the general interest of the students in terms of structuring the course around students weaknesses to improve upon them. ",
            "\u00a0One strength of this course was the numerous video exercises we did in class to prepare for the tests. These definitely helped to improve my listening skills. However, one weakness of the course was that some of the videos on the actual tests either 1) pertained to a topic that was not quite related to the unit we studied in class or 2)included too much new vocabulary that we were unable to really comprehend it. despite our level of skill in listening. Videos that relate at least partially to topics covered in class would be more reasonable. Another strength of the course was the numerous exercises in spontaneous speaking in class which definitely helped improve my confidence in speaking the language (also revealed grammatical skills I needed to work on). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Teaches a lot\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: meets everyday and homework is too regular (you get homework every single day) ",
            "\u00a0I liked the class size; I did not like having to complete a group project that was such a large component of the grade; I also wish we completed more grammar worksheets and individual work, rather than constant group work in class. ",
            "\u00a0We got to improve our German through learning about different cities in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland.  By the end of the course, we became much better writers and speakers.  The course focused on many aspects of language learning, including listening comprehension, grammar, vocabulary, reading comprehension, and writing. ",
            "\u00a0There are definitely more weaknesses than strengths of this course. \r\nStrengths: Exposure to German daily. \r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- Very limitied-or not existing practice of new material. \r\n- Almost no feedback on our work (like the practice, where we could see our mistakes and keep them, so we can retrospectively return to them and see where we made mistakes.  (the only place where we could do so were literally the tests after being corrected and when it was too late to improve. \r\n- the class felt extremely bored and not engaging. It was not because of the morning time. I took Russian in the morning the last semester, and the level of engagement and acitivity was SOO much higher. I think the problem here was the professor, who was not really capable of engaging the class efficiently. \r\n- the emails were totally useless. I never checked the corrections from my German partner did for me. I think it would make more sense if we could go over these mistakes in the class. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to better understand the german language and culture. It reviews a lot of grammatical structures and introduces some new ones, as well as a lot of new vocabulary, and the course is set up to learn the language through learning about the cultures of german of speaking countries which I thought was very cool. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student, because the professor was very engaged in the course and open to meeting with students who had questions about the course and its assignments. The material is engaging and vigorous, and the things covered in the course allowed a greater appreciation for the language and its culture. ",
