            "\u00a0We learned a lot of music history with an emphasis on gender and race. As a writing credit, we also wrote a great amount and received feedback on our prose. ",
            "\u00a0Critical tools for evaluating representation and identity in art and media, especially opera and music. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about music history & the way it intersects with gender studies. A lot of the material dealt with opera, & despite no previous interest in the subject, I found it super fascinating/ was always excited to do the readings. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of history (music, theater, performance) but through the lens of feminist musicologist scholarship. I learned how to write my own performance reviews. I developed skills to more critically analyze performances, especially with a vocabulary that was developed in the class out of feminist and musicologist teachings. ",
            "\u00a0I was made aware of a vocabulary that has made me keenly aware and able to discuss womens issues. I was able to write better and understand blogs. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The readings were all interesting and covered a good array of issues and perspectives. Class discussion was always engaging and thoughtfully handled by the professors. I personally would have preferred less of a focus on opera, and more balance with other musical and theatrical situations, but appreciated that opera was made accessible for me to study as a relative newcomer. I also really appreciated the freedom we had on our final paper to explore whatever brought us to the course in depth and in conversation with the readings we had covered in the course. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I thought the structure of this course was really strong. It just meets once per week, but the length of the class allows for pretty in depth discussions on some really interesting topics. At the end students are even encouraged to study something of particular interest to them, so there's lots of room for curiosity & engagement. ",
            "\u00a0I think one of the best things about this class is how much the class covered. I think there was a topic that really interested everyone, even if every week wasn't exactly your cup of tea. Albeit, this meant that we often had to discuss works that I was unfamiliar with -- I was always able to better contribute to the discussion when I was very familiar with the work. This is a problem for any sort of survey course, so it is certainly understandable. Besides some teaching issues, those are the only weaknesses I see in the actual material of the course. They did a great job at choosing diverse topics that made everyone reach outside their academic comfort zone in one way or another. ",

            "\u00a0Absolutely! I loved Women on Stage. I'd never taken a music course before this, and it was a really wonderful intersection of musical analysis, WGSS, and contemporary issues of feminism. If you're at all interested in the performative female body, you should absolutely take this course! ",
            "\u00a0I recommend this class to everyone! This has been one of my favorite courses in the music department, and is a much needed music history course that focuses on race and gender ",
            "\u00a0I loved this course! The readings were all interesting and covered a good array of issues and perspectives. Class discussion was always engaging and thoughtfully handled by the professors. Even when I didn't have time to keep up with the readings, I loved coming to class, even at 9:25 AM, and I always came away with new thoughts and ideas. I personally would have preferred less of a focus on opera, and more balance with other musical and theatrical situations, but appreciated that opera was made accessible for me to study as a relative newcomer. We were also encouraged to pursue our own interests for the final paper, and it was the first time I really felt like a scholar, because I cared so much about the subject, one I had never had the opportunity to consider in an academic context. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone with an interest in studying music!! It was my favorite class this semester & I wish it could've gone on longer. The readings are always fascinating & really well chosen, & the weekly discussions are fascinating. Both professors are incredible & work well together! ",
            "\u00a0This course does a great job of looking at many different types of women's performance, although with special attention toward the professors' area of expertise, which is opera. However, the final project gives students a great opportunity to explore what is personally interesting to them, and the professors do a great job of buying into each chosen topic. I would absolutely recommend taking this course. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who would like a performance (opera, theater, music) history course through a feminist musicologist lens. Personally, I feel like this was a really great way for me to approach these performances and this history. Professor Kreuzer is also incredible and always engaging. The course covers a wide range of topics so there's likely something that will really interest you. Additionally, the course equips you with ideas, knowledge, and a vocabulary that will allow you to do (at least in my case) some of your best academic writing. This was probably my favorite course this semester because the material was really engaging and I felt like I was having valuable discussions while also just learning real facts of history. I also got a lot more exposed to the opera world, and even saw a show for free at the Met. Overall, a great course and if this sort of thing interests you, then I would definitely recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0I completely would recommend this course to everyone. "
