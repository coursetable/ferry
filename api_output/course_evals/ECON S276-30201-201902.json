I know one of the nice features of the course is that you can learn from so many different professors, but I found that a lot of them taught us the same things, so even though there was this amazing professor in front of me, I hardly learned anything new from them.

To that end, the inclusion of integration in some of our notes/lectures were more confusing than clarifying.\r\nReally enjoyed Prof. Songa's guest lectures. Really enjoyed the connection of contracts to redlining in American real estate. ",
