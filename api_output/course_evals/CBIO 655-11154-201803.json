            "\u00a0A broad understanding of concepts relation to various types of adult stem cells, as well as applications of stem cell biology. ",
            "\u00a0This class introduced many different concepts in stem cell biology and gave me a solid background in the field.  I not only learned about stem cell biology, but I also was introduced to how stem cells can be used in medicine in addition to the ethical considerations of this. ",
            "\u00a0I developed my soft research skills. Specifically, my skills in reading and writing in time-efficient ways, and in my consciousness of contemporary biological research techniques and applications. ",
            "\u00a0We read literature to learn about current findings regarding the different types of stem cells. There were different professors for almost every lecture who spoke on stem cells related to their research (e.g. retinal, embryonic, neural,etc.). ",
            "\u00a0Integrating the past, present, and future of stem cell biology research. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt a lot about differentiation and learnt that the concept of stem cells is more complicated and nuance than it is often made out to be. I also learnt presentation skills and how to summarise papers well. "

            "\u00a0Have no idea how we are doing in class because of the way assignments are structured. ",
            "\u00a0Very good course for surveying the entire stem cell field. It could be difficult at times for every instructor to teach scheduled class due to conflicts- may need to plan ahead for potential conflicts (retreats, etc) ",
            "\u00a0Schedule was not consistent (several classes reschedule for other times where not every student could make it). ",
            "\u00a0I thought every professor who taught this course gave an excellent lecture.  I really liked the emphasis on the recent developments and techniques used in the field.  I also thought the format of the class was well done, with the first half of class being lecture-based and the second half of class being presentation-based. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course was great! I think it would be helpful to receive some specific feedback over the course so I know how well I'm doing. I think that would be helpful given the particular soft skills refined by this course. In particular, feedback on the presentation would be helpful. All of the students have given presentations before. If there is not some more specific feedback for these students, then these presentations become mere pieces of busy work. Speaking experience is good, but without topic specific feedback, it wouldn't actually matter what the students are presenting. In my opinion, without that topic specific feedback, students could get a similar advantage from presenting their favorite foods and movies. I guess the presentation does force students to go study and contemplate a topic in depth. But this focus is only on one topic, which may or may not be related to specific student interests or research goals. ",
            "\u00a0There is never any feedback returned to the students. I received two comments out of all the weekly assignments turned in. However I received no grades on the weekly literature summaries and no grade on the final paper. ",
            "\u00a0Felt repetitive because each lecture was a guest lecturer, so there wasn't continuity. Hard to fix without completely revamping the course design though. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, it was very interesting and well organized. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class. This class is engaging and offers a great opportunity to improve soft research skills in the context of an interesting topic. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, even though the course wasnt exactly as I expected and there were no grades returned I still learned a lot. I think this is a good course for those who work with stem cells or are interested in learning more about them. ",
            "\u00a0I think if you are interested in the topic, go for it. It's low workload and it's fun to meet many different faculty. ",
            "\u00a0The topics taught in the course are interesting, so if you want to learn about stem cells take it. but you will get no feedback whatsoever in the entire course. "
