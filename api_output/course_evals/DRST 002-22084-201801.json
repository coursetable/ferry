            "\u00a0Close reading and analysis. How to evaluate the significance of each character's features ",
            "\u00a0I learnt how to better scrutinise literary texts and do close-readings. I also gained a deeper understanding of how the western canon developed in terms of literature. ",
            "\u00a0I learned what it takes to write a really good essay, including the writing process before starting the essay and editing once finished. I also improved my close reading skills. ",
            "\u00a0Learned literary analysis skills, close reading, how to engage with texts ",
            "\u00a0My writing improved exponentially by taking this course. Professor Bauer consistently highlighted areas of growth in a very fair way. I learned the importance of re-outlining, how to cut down on wordiness, and how to watch a thesis develop and grow. I also learned the importance of being fair and truthful to a text and not forcing an interpretation or generalization on a work. Overall, I learned a lot in terms of thematic interpretation, and I feel like I have a pretty good overview of the western literary tradition. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to analyze literature from different perspectives & improve my writing skills (make my prose clearer, and how to not overextend my argument beyond what the text presents). ",
            "\u00a0Literary analysis, class discussion, writing ",
            "\u00a0how to write a literature paper, how to analyze and discuss a text, how works of literature respond to each other "

        [
            "\u00a0Prof. Bauer's section was really intelligible especially because he and the appointed starter(s) posed discussion topics before the class so that the discussion would be profound and dense. Also, he had many extended office hours and his comments on papers were sophisticated, so I could improve my writing effectively. ",
            "\u00a0The seminars and lecture for DS Literature are incredibly engaging. However, what is less engaging is studying both Proust and Flaubert - please just cut Proust he is so boring and I feel like I didn't gain anything new from 'Swann in Love' when we also read 'Madame Bovary' and 'To the Lighthouse'. ",
            "\u00a0Very strong course ",
            "\u00a0I think this course did a great job of familiarizing me with a wide variety of books as well as promoting thought on some of the big ideas that authors have pondered for generations. Sometimes the reading load felt excessive and nearly impossible to complete in a weeks, however, especially with Don Quixote. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Excellent selection of books\r\nWeakness: breakneck speed ",
            "\u00a0detailed feedback on your papers from your professor, you get a taste of some of the most important works in western literature, and the discussions are enlightening. "

            "\u00a0Yes, your academic skills in analysing literature will definitely improve. And above all, his section is really fun. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend DS Literature to another student. You cover lots of the canonical greats and really improve your essay writing and close reading skills. The sections and lectures are incredibly engaging. All of the professors are incredibly invested and will meet with you to talk about the books and give you help. If you have Professor Bauer, however, be warned that he expects a lot of you even for DS. Be expected to write questions and short close-reading answers before every section with him. ",
            "\u00a0Directed Studies is an in-depth survey course, which makes it paradoxical in a way. Directed Studies Literature with Professor Bauer was an incredibly rewarding experience, but it was also a lot of work. I think Professor Bauer facilitates conversations that allow for meaningful and in-depth discussions that other sections might miss. That being said, this course really was a serious time commitment, which I impacted my time and grades in other courses. Still, I don't regret taking this class, as I really learned a lot. I think of all my DS courses, this one truly made me a better writer. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Such a valuable experience. I learned so much about writing and literature ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to anybody interested in reading some of the greatest works and doing so in an awesome environment promoting deep thought and thematic exploration. Your writing will improve immensely, and you will be able to read some truly beautiful pieces of literature that have left their mark on the Western tradition. ",
            "\u00a0Yes; DS literature has great selections & second semester texts are truly enjoyable ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but be aware that Professor Bauer does not make it easy to fake the reading. ",
            "\u00a0Bauer is a wonderful literature professor. He effectively balances care and kindness with firmness and assertive directing. He makes himself very available for office hours, and I think his office hours are particularly instructive. He gives great feedback on papers. ",
            "\u00a0yes, if you're interested in the history of literature. even though literature is the subject that I'm the least interested in out of the three in directed studies, I still learned a lot and enjoyed the discussions. "
