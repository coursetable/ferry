            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the reading for this course, and did learn a lot about policing and police violence. I also learned a lot about reading and writing ethnography, and highly enjoyed the police ride-alongs. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the history of policing ethnographies, and about how to conduct ethnographies in general. I also learned a lot about modern work being done in policing enthnographies in the U.S. ",

            "\u00a0We learned a lot of about the specifics of policing and approaching policing from many different anthropological frameworks. ",
            "\u00a0During my time here at Yale, I searched far and wide for a course that placed a value on qualitative research. I've spent much of my Yale career doing quantitative analyses, literature reviews, and a series of other methods. However, in taking Professor Tur's Ethnography of Policing and Race, I felt for the first time that I could use elements of my personality and identity to make contributions to the realm of academia. In doing police ride-alongs, I learned how to exercise patience, decentralize myself within the context of a conversation as a means of amplifying the voices of others, and treat interactions with new people as a privilege. It's not that I didn't know how to do these things before. Rather, I learned that success as an ethnographer requires one to be strong in these areas. By listening closely, I was able to glean how these officers see themselves within the social sphere and the barriers they face in performing their due diligence in investigations of wrongdoing. I was also able to see first-hand the role of intersectionality in policing, as well as some of the tactics employed to negotiate the relationship between representatives of the law and the individuals they are charged with serving. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about the Erving Goffman approach, the thoughts of police, the methodologies employed in ethnographies, impression management, impression formation (officer presence, officer safety), conceptualizing the criminalization of bodies that aren't just those of black men but queers women and latinos as well "

            "\u00a0This course has such interesting texts, but not enough time. I really enjoyed the ride along requirement aspect, but wish that in class was more properly structured and better timed. We would often have extensive schedules to follow but the outcome was more of a confused or not as thorough discussion. Up to this point (before the final paper) we have received no feedback or grades in the course, which has caused some confusion and nerves. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: excellent reading list, passionate lecturer, excellent opportunity for engaging with the New Haven community, reasonable workload\r\nWeaknesses: waaay too many people in the seminar ",
            "\u00a0Strength: breadth of literature chosen, requirement to do ride-along in the community. Weakness: discussion of how quantitative work relates to the ethnographies. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor and Ride-along component.\r\n\r\nNo weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0I think structuring the class assignments around the ride alongs was great, and I personally loved the ride alongs. That being said, I think making people do them more consistently throughout the semester (as in having check ins where field notes are due at multiple different points) would make it a lot better, as I think a lot of us were scrambling to do 2 ride alongs the last week. ",
            "\u00a0The class needs fewer students and more structure. It suffered from disorganization. ",
            "\u00a0This course's reading list is great, and I really enjoyed the opportunity to conduct ride-alongs with New Haven Police Department officers. The class as a whole however, was just kind of weird and disorganized. Professor Ture went on a lot of tangents that ended up taking most of our discussion time. There was also no feedback built into the course, which made it impossible to know what your grade was. When we turned in our midterm assignment, he told us he would give us feedback over spring break, but then did not provide any. Then at the end of the semester, he said he had responded to people's midterms if \"there was a problem.\" ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- Police ride alongs are amazing way to give a student first-hand experience\r\n- Strong reading list\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Not enough time to grapple with the readings ",
            "\u00a0The course was relaxed but also facilitated really in-depth examinations of policing in the US. The course could be improved with a smaller class size and more rigorous discussions. Often it felt like we should dedicate more times to the reading and really push thought beyond observations and into more detailed analysis. ",
            "\u00a0I think the syllabus was good, but class discussion almost always disappointed. We often didn't get past the surface level of material, and I often felt like I left class learning little. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: extremely engaging, wonderful teaching style, creative use of interactive games and music\r\nWeaknesses: could have been more organized, the long weekly emails from the Professor were a bit overwhelming to read, would have been better if he had put a folder on canvas for each week and uploaded readings there. Also books were very expensive would have been nice if he had just scanned the chapters he wanted us to read. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course as I feel the topic and context is so important. If the course were restructured and honed to cover and thoroughly discuss each text it would be even better. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Would highly recommend. Ture really cares about the topic and his students. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely!!! This course was so interesting and valuable. Professor Ture is amazing and I felt like I learned so much! We went on 3-4 ride-alongs with the New Haven police, which really helped us contextualize the course readings. I also loved listening to the presentations at the end! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student, but not to one who is particularly averse to the idea of performing a ride-along with the New Haven Police Department. The books are quite insightful, the material could not be more relevant to our social climate, and Professor Tur's unique perspective as a former police officer and scholar of ethnography is enlightening. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely, if anything just for the ride alongs. Something that will really change how you think about policing, just because you will see it first-hand as an ethnographer. ",
            "\u00a0You effectively get academic credit for doing ride-alongs with the NHPD, as you do little else of notable substance in this class. Perhaps it will improve with time and further structure. ",
            "\u00a0I probably would not recommend this course, unfortunately. The course's topic is incredibly important, and I did really enjoy the readings and the ride-along assignment. That being said, I found the course's lack of organization fairly stressful. Professor Ture also taught the course more like a lecture than a seminar, so I definitely wouldn't take the course if you are looking for a standard seminar experience. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Ture was a very good professor in that he tried to do different things to make seminar engaging. We would have different discussion topics and formats, we would skype with authors of the texts we were reading, we would watch videos and have debates. However, the down side was that sometimes we didn't have enough time to just discuss the readings, which I thought was a shame, since I found my classmates often had very interesting things to say. The workload was very fair, with just some ethnography readings each week, which read like novels, and are interesting and easy to get through. However, our whole grade ended up being the ethnography we submitted as our final paper, so you didn't really know how you were doing in the class as the semester went along. The police ride alongs were super interesting, and Ture did a great job of presenting the topic in a balanced way that allowed you to understand police perspectives, while at the same time seeing how policing can harm certain communities. The only other thing I didn't like about the class was that there were a couple more students than the 18 limit, so it felt too big, and by the end of the semester I still didn't even know the names of all the kids in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only if there is a better structuring with the syllabus. ",
            "\u00a0This is a good course. A little confusing at times what the expectations for the class are and what we would do in class on a given day. Professor Ture cares a lot about his students and has incredible experience that you should definitely try to learn from. The best parts of the class were talking about the professor's career, the specifics of anthropology, and the unique role of policing in modern america. ",
            "\u00a0The subject material is really interesting, but it was too disorganized. I didn't come out learning much from the class. I thought the ride alongs were a good assignment, and I probably learned more from them than I did anything in-class. Ture is really nice, but discussion almost always veered off-topic. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. A wild ride. Absolutely fascinating and eccentric teaching style. Workload very manageable but a lot of readings. "
