            "\u00a0We learned a great deal about a set of discourses surrounding European color theory. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a very nuanced understanding of the conceptual, physical, and poetic properties (and possibilities) of color, which is a topic so expansive that it will surely inform my future work, whatever form that might take. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the history of color from an art historical and philosophical perspective. The selected texts were fascinating as were the in class discussions. ",
            "\u00a0This class helped make broad connections, trends, and developments in the philosophy of color and its use by artists. It synthesized a huge breadth of information, and provided a solid foundation in an aspect of art that is often taken for granted. It honed my ability to read primary source materials outside of the art discipline, including science, technical manuals, and philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about the history of color, and really appreciated the interdisciplinary character of the course. I enjoyed getting to read criticism about color and its use and provenance from various different historical sources. ",
            "\u00a0A better understanding of interdisciplinary art history, and the interdisciplinarity of art-making, in regards to science, philosophy, and literature investigating the visual phenomenon of color. "

            "\u00a0This course did a beautiful job of introducing us to a particular history of color theory. However, especially given the period of European history covered, the absence of sustained analysis of the imperial or racial aspects of European color theory was frustrating. ",
            "\u00a0For me the strength of the course was the chance to work with two equally wonderful professors, who introduced me to important texts in the field and brought in two different but complementary perspectives on each of the major themes discussed in the class. While I enjoyed the many different aspects of color that we examined, I would have loved to have spent less time on scientific/optical/practical color theories, and to have engaged more with some of the most literary approaches. ",
            "\u00a0It was a wonderful course! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - going to museums, libraries, and field trips to look at objects in person; diversity of types of primary sources assigned; diversity of students in class (mfa students)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - length of assigned reading was unrealistically long and discouraged reading because there was too much to get through, and the majority was never touched on in course (would be better if readings were consistently ranked in terms of priority and importance); class discussions were often not continuous and collaborative, instead it was each student making an individual remark ",
            "\u00a0It was very fun and interesting to hear about color from the perspective of many different academic disciplines, and from the perspective of artists. I particularly enjoyed learning about the history of specific colors, and learned a lot from my peers' presentations at the end of the class. I thoroughly enjoyed our field trips, and they were a highlight of my semester! ",
            "\u00a0Too large of class size. Reading material often not connected back to art. Class discussions not focused on. ",
            "\u00a0I would have spent slightly less time on the early color-making treatises and scientific experiments: at some point, they started feeling a little repetitive. I loved the literary portion, and would have added a section or two at the end with more 'writing' color/poetics of color/ and the (literary) philosophy of color. I really enjoyed having two professors teach the course-- it both enriched and encouraged discussion within the class. "

            "\u00a0Probably; it did offer a chance to spend time with some interesting strands of thinking in the history of European color theory. Nicola and Carol's strong rapport, and their complementary knowledges, also make for a wonderful learning opportunity. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think the course offers very valuable theoretical tools for understanding color. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course because it is such a wonderful topic with important primary source reading material. However, it was discouraging in its quantity of reading, and stilted discussion (likely because students could not read and synthesize the amount of material and be ready for engaging discussions. The weekly reading passages were helpful at stimulating discussions, but also made students dependent on only discussing their own points). The presentations at the end of the course were a wonderful way to end the semester and also created the most dynamic discussions of the whole semester. It was also wonderful to have the different perspectives of two professors, and I felt that they collaborated and led joint discussions very well. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student, as it was very interesting, illuminating, and engaging. ",
