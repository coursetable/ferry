            "\u00a0This course was very poorly taught. While the material itself was very interesting, the professor did not do a good job actually explaining the concepts. As a student in the class, you had to rely on peer tutors and your own understanding to actually learn any of the material. ",
            "\u00a0The slides didnt explain the concepts very well, but the professor tried to challenge us to think critically. ",
            "\u00a0Enrichment should be provided to everyone. It made me understand things I wouldn't have ever otherwise.\r\nThe professor also doesn't answer questions - he cuts students off and everything is unclear then. Therefore, you have to use Piazza or ask your TA - many of whom don't understand or speak English. On Piazza, only Prof Park answers really. ",
            "\u00a0This class had very few strengths other than the deeply interesting aspects of the material, even though these were not necessarily appreciable in lecture. Professor Zhong appeared entirely unwilling to engage with students and frequently cut people off as they tried to ask questions. The environment created by the class did not facilitate thoughtful learning or engagement with the material in any way. ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Zhong is an awful professor. Julie is amazing ",
            "\u00a0The actual material was very interesting. Learning about epigenetics, sex chromosomes, and cancer was very cool. However we werent tested on this which is sad because this is what is applicable to real life. We were tested on details we covered in passing and due to the lack of a midterm we werent prepared. The class should focus on lage concepts first and then dive into the details to understand it and studies that proved this. ",
            "\u00a0the course is well structured overall and the lectures are fairly well outlined, however, during lecture some questions were left unanswered. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: common themes that tie in the concepts throughout the whole course, practical uses of what we're learning. What we do in section reinforces concepts necessary to understand lecture material and is also helpful for homework.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: readings often don't match up with the lecture material. When they do, the readings are very helpful, but when they don't, it's kind of a waste of time. ",
            "\u00a0Julie Park's enrichment sessions and the textbook were my primary methods of understanding the material.  Piazza was also helpful for reviewing the day before the final.  I found lecture to be confusing, especially when students would ask questions and the professor would offer meandering explanations.  I answered \"agree\" to question 5 because of how awesome enrichment was!! ",
            "\u00a0I liked the way that the lectures were arranged by topic, but most of the time the format was too confusing and I didn't understand the relevance of a lot of concepts. The material on the quizzes seemed to be based on either trivial information from the lecture slides or required a lot more thought than was possible in the 15 minute time frame. Explanation of the concepts during lecture was really confusing--Professor Zhong attempted to make the concepts tie into \"broader concepts\" of development, but that didn't really help as the smaller details weren't really clear in the first place. Attempts to engage the class with questions were admirable but were ultimately really frustrating as the question posed was never clear, or student responses were dismissed. ",
            "\u00a0The content of this course is very interesting, but. unfortunately, this module was very disorganized and hectic. The genetics concepts were taught very poorly, if at all by Zhong in lecture. The discussion sections seemed very disconnected from what we were doing in lecture, and they largely felt like a waste of time. Finally, the difficulty of the quizzes varied, but, overall, there quizzes were too hard/too demanding given the time constraints. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the course coordinator was great, and I pretty much learned all of what I know from her. She was very well organized and explained the lectures in a way that made sense.\r\nWeaknesses: I simply could not follow lecture. There were too many complicated studies and I got lost in the jargon/methods every single time. ",
            "\u00a0The material is fascinating and is very important to understand, but sometimes feels disjointed from lecture to lecture. For the most part though the class is fairly well structured and organized. ",
            "\u00a0The content of this course is actually pretty interesting. It was taught terribly and actually made me hate biology and make me think of changing my major. The questions on the quizzes and the exam are worded so poorly it is more of a reading comprehension test than anything else.The class timing itself (75 minutes) is not beneficial to student learning, as the majority of people cannot pay attention for 75 minutes straight. Changing it to be a 3 day a week, 50 minute lecture, with powerpoint that make sense and quizzes that are fair, would improve the course a lot. ",
            "\u00a0The professor makes the class. I thought the class was interesting, or at least had the potential to be, but Professor Zhong made it hard to really get involved in the material because everything went so fast. There wasn't a lot of valuable information on the powerpoint slides, so you couldn't rely on them a whole lot if you had questions. On the topic of questions...Don't try asking Professor Zhong questions because he will either say \"Ill get to that\" or he'll interrupt you in the middle of you asking to answer a question he presumes you're asking even if its not even close...And his explanations to those questions are incomprehensible because he yells into the microphone and that mumbles his words. So yeah...If you have questions just go to Julie Park (or the program director if she isn't it for you). So the strengths: cool material. The weakness: Professor  Zhong. Nice guy, but not the best professor. ",
            "\u00a0The course teaches the basics of development and genetics, but it goes way too fast and the concepts are extremely difficult to understand. Many students mentioned how lost they felt. Even with enrichment I struggled. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Zhong often cut students off in the middle of their questions. His slides were confusing and contained way too much jargon. The class itself didn't seem organized or sequential in any way. ",
            "\u00a0One strength was Professor Zhong's inclusion of writing a research proposal as our homework assignments. I really appreciated going through that process in a step-wise manner and applying what we learn in lecture to a more \"real-life\" project.\r\n\r\nOne weakness was that there was no formal review session for basic genetic concepts. We did, however, have excellent peer tutors who offered a basic genetics review session, so if students could have the option of attending a basic genetics review session every time BIOL 103 is offered, that would be wonderful. ",
            "\u00a0Some of the questions that Professor Zhong asks in class are extremely hard to understand, not because of their content but because of how they are phrased, so most of the time, the class just stares back at him blankly without knowing how to reply.\r\n\r\nThat being said, the course is very strong in its contents; all of the examples provided make the concepts much easier to learn. Some of them may take a lot of time to sink in, but peer tutor hours help a LOT (cannot stress this enough). There are a lot of resources for BIOL 103 like peer tutors that help reinforce conceptsEnrichment, Piazza, discussion sections. The quizzes were also good in that they were a combination of memorization and applied knowledge. The discussion section readings also tested our knowledge of concepts very well. ",
            "\u00a0The learning goals and objectives at the beginning and end of each lecture were helpful because they gave a detailed, but succinct, summary of lectures that could be intimidating due to their wide scope. This course could be improved in two main ways: 1) provide more details about experiments introduced in lecture: hypothesis, methods, conclusions. Often slides only included a picture with no accompanying text, and we would zip through this in class, making it difficult to fully understand its relationship to the themes we were covering in class, and 2) institute more \"check-ins\" throughout lecture, such as a simple classroom exercise or two, that allow students to make sure that they're understanding the material. ",
            "\u00a0This course contained good content and on the whole seemed well-organized, but was taught in an extremely disorganized and confusing manner.  Instead of teaching us the process of development first, starting with an overview of embryogenesis, and then neurogenesis, and then growth, our professor started with extremely broad themes in development, like patterning, feedback and signaling systems, and drew examples from all of the wildly varying stages of development (embryogenesis, neurogenesis, growth) at random, and out of sequential order, to illustrate these themes.  This would be equivalent to teaching a history course and starting with concepts like militarism, imperialism, and balances of power, teaching each by delving into incredible detail about specific battles and events that represent the larger concept, and then, only at the end, acknowledging that they had all been relating to WWI. A normal course would FIRST go through the timeline of events of WWI, and THEN ask students to connect broader themes that explain them.  It is a simple concept, but I must re-emphasize how misguided this class was in its format. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this class were the enrichment program, the peer tutoring sessions, and the research proposal process. Without enrichment, I do not think I would have done nearly as well in this class. Professor Park re-explained everything that was so unclear in class in the best and most efficient way. The peer tutors also helped tremendously. And, the research proposal was a much-needed experience for me because I now feel very comfortable designing an experiment. The weakness in this class was lecture. Lecture always felt very rushed and questions were often left unanswered. The slides themselves were also not the most helpful in explaining topics or even complementing what Professor Zhong was saying. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the lectures were weak - Professor Zhong talked too loudly frequently and too quickly. I didn't like the way they were tested as well - frequently slides that were skipped over because we ran out of time were heavily featured on the weekly quizzes. ",
            "\u00a0I personally do not like the timed quizzes especially when they are Prof Zhong's quizzes because he asks questions that objectively more time than 15 minutes to fully digest and process and answer correctly. Another weakness: Prof Zhong's teaching style, he talks very quickly and interrupts students that are asking questions, which is annoying because they usually are good questions that clarify material; rushes through slides even though they might definitely be important; strengths - interesting material and didn't totally turn me off from genetics, made me realize that I actually like biology more than this class and made me able to endure it ",
            "\u00a0The course itself has a lot of broad areas of information involved. I think that the quizzes are much more difficult than need be, especially considering how the information is administered by the professor. I think the the course has good information and the overall structure of the course works well, although I think most of the work we had to do did not help us learn the material. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Zhong repeatedly said that we would only be tested on \"general concepts,\" but this became a joke by the end of the class due to the trivial facts that we were supposed to pick out and remember. Don't bother trying to learn from the book either as we were told, \"Only about half of the information in the book is correct.\" ",
            "\u00a0The course could be taught in a more chronological order in terms of development. Its strengths are that it is very interesting and organized. ",
            "\u00a0Course covered good amount of material, but explanations could be more clear for certain topics. I believe greater emphasis should be placed on concepts that will be tested, which I feel that this course did not do very well. ",
            "\u00a0Strength is the field in general is more interesting. We finally get to see science working outside of the molecular level. We look at frogs with two heads and mice stitched together. The project/homework is also a lot more rewarding than 101 and 102's PSETS. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very memorization heavy-- it relies on you picking out extremely specific information form the slides to regurgitate on quizzes and tests. The research paper that you produce over 5 weeks of homework feels very arbitrary and is much more work than the homework in 101,102 or 104. Also, the course is poorly organized. Why would genetics be in the same lecture as hormones? This feels like an afterthought. ",
            "\u00a0Poorly organized, limited resources ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were very confusing, and material was scattered and hard to understand. ",
            "\u00a0The professor was horrible. I thought the professor for 102 was bad, but this man was worse. His accent coupled with his incredibly difficult quizzes made the class terrible. I dreaded going to the class every week. Get a new professor to teach the class. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely confusing and goes into way too much detail on some topics without explaining basics ",
            "\u00a0The only strength of this course is that the subject matter is interesting. Even this was tarnished by how terribly the class was taught. Lectures were too basic for the level of understanding we were expected to have on the tests. Also, there were frequent questions on examinations that no student could have reasonably answered on their own. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: the professor talks way to fast, speeds through the lectures and makes it very difficult to follow and learn from. The lecture slides were incomprehensible and incredibly confusing. It was extremely difficult finding a gene with putative transcription factors that also had a plethora of papers to back it up. The psets NEED to be fixed, this was very frustrating. ",
            "\u00a0The material was very interesting and stimulating, and the homework provided an organized scaffold upon which students could create their hypothesis and scientific paper. A weakness of the course would be the disconnect between certain aspects of examinations and the actual lessons. ",
            "\u00a0While I found that I learned and understood a lot more of the material than 102, how well I knew it was tested so poorly. It was always difficult to understand what the quizzes were asking, even if I knew the material. ",
            "\u00a0The lecture did not make clear what concepts we were meant to take away and what level of detail was important ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of this course are the skills that students are able to build by crafting a research proposal step-by-step with opportunities to revise it every time. That constant feedback is very helpful. The material is also very interesting and well-chosen. However, there could be a better explanation of concepts. ",
            "\u00a0THIS COURSE NEEDS TO HAVE PROBLEM SETS THAT ALLOW STUDENTS TO PRACTICE AND APPLY WHAT THEY HAVE LEARNED IN CLASS!!! This course was difficult because the quizzes came out of no where, since we didnt have any practice. ",
            "\u00a0Poorly organized, the Prof skips important points, and not very engaging. ",
            "\u00a0I dont want to be misconstrued as being culturally insensitive, but I had an extremely difficult time understanding Professor Zhong when he spoke. He had a very thick accent and spoke too quickly. After the first couple of lectures, I gave up on attempting to follow along. I know I am not alone in feeling this way. Every other student I spoke to had a very hard time understanding him. \r\n\r\nBeyond that, I really enjoyed his enthusiasm. He is very knowledgeable. ",
            "\u00a0This course is easily the worst I have taken so far at Yale. The lectures are extremely poorly organized, and it often seemed like the lecture slides were just complications of slides that were previously used by the professor for his own research. The concepts should not be presented through specific examples, but rather explained first and then substantiated through specific examples.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, slides often presented data with no accompanying explanations, but we were never taught how to interpret often novel presentations of data.\r\n\r\nFinally, Professor Zhong often went through material without explaining it thoroughly, which made it difficult to follow the lectures. ",
            "\u00a0It is a basic intro class. I would say the strengths are the TAs. ",
            "\u00a0This course was not taught well. Even when attending the lectures every day, the important concepts we needed to learn were not articulated/ pointed out well. ",
            "\u00a0Material is interesting, but it is presented in a way that makes it very difficult to understand. I think the slides and method of teaching could be improved upon. ",
            "\u00a0The course does give students a solid background in genetics and development, although mostly the latter. Professor Zhong often integrates very complicated genetics/developmental concepts in his lectures, and it is often unclear what students are responsible to know. A few suggestions to improve the class: First, asking questions in lecture is difficult, given that students often don't know where to begin. It might help to start a whistling or clapping or some other way to facilitate asking questions. Additionally, Professor Zhong doesn't listen to students' nuanced questions fully, and often guesses what the question is and thus gives an answer that is not always satisfactory. Second, it might help to indicate on the slides themselves which ones students are responsible for, say, by putting a red star on slides that students do not have to know. Third, more practice with the concepts seen in class, either through problem questions during lecture to engage students or practice problems (optional) to do at home to practice for the quizzes. This was done for before the final, but more of these would certainly be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength is that this course has a lot of applied learning in situational examples and case studies. If this class could be improved, it would be that certain questions on quizzes and exams are phrased very open-endedly. ",
            "\u00a0The structure of the homeworks, each one being a piece of a research proposal we were writing throughout the semester, was a strength. The actual lectures themselves were a weakness, as Professor Zhong was often confusing and did not answer questions well in class. I felt like I learned much better in my discussion sections then in the actual lecture. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very very detailed. It was good to learn about genetics and development in this level of great detail.\r\n\r\nCons: very difficult to learn from lecture and because the information was so detailed, it was difficult to do outside research/ find the information in the text book. ",
            "\u00a0The material itself is interesting and while the concept of writing a research proposal is really smart they gave us almost no guidance which made it more difficult and time consuming than neccesary. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Zhong was not a good teacher. He did not explain the concepts well, if it hadnt been for the Professor Parks I would have failed this class. His quizzes seemed to be based on how he was feeling and arbitrary questions would appear on the quizzes consistently. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the BIOL sequence does a good job teaching kids to think critically and specifically in a way that will train them to be good biologists. With that being said, I believe one of the big weaknesses of this course was that the nature of the information taught was not always tangible, which means the professor should work a little bit harder in making the information flow better so that it is easier to swallow. Additionally, I think lecture was challenging for many people because the professor did not always effectively answer questions. I happen to always ask after class, so I did not have this problem, but sometimes the professor would interrupt or misunderstand a question, which led many people astray/made them more confused. I also think the professor and the teaching scholars should be more willing to use Piazza to answer questions. ",
            "\u00a0I think the quizzes every week are good because they force you to stay on top of the material. I also r ally liked the homeworks because they made you apply what you were learning in class to something you were interested in ",
            "\u00a0A lot of information but this class was much better than 102 (and 202) in terms of not memorising a huge amount of specific details (gene names etc.) and instead focusing on concepts and processes. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: genetics is interesting, and there was definitely an effort to design the course for student learning. In particular the weekly quizzes forced us to stay on top of the material, and the homework assignments taught valuable research skills. Weaknesses: it's too much work between the weekly quizzes and the very significant homework assignments, especially since it's just introductory biology. Also Prof Zhong's slides were hard to follow sometimes (ie hard to understand when looking at them again to study) and often disorganized. Plus the quizzes and final exam often had ambiguous questions (with ambiguous grading) and a lot more memorization than expected. ",

            "\u00a0The way the homeworks are structured to break up the writing of the research proposal is a huge strength.  It is well-explained and I think I learned the most from those assignments.  The weaknesses were that the lectures moved very quickly and were sometimes difficult to follow.  When students asked questions, the most common response was \"we'll get to it later,\" but often \"it\" was never explained later.  I think professor Zhong had difficulty understanding students' questions. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were very difficult to understand. ",

            "\u00a0Professor should be more open to questions.\r\nRewrite the lecture slides so that they are simple and relate more directly to what is being presented.\r\nSlow down when explaining concepts and simplify, many times I didn't understand a concept in class and I went home to look it up just to see that it was being explained in a way much more complicated than it needed to be. ",
            "\u00a0The course is well designed, but the lectures were slightly too long. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this course did a good job of providing important information that will serve me well in the future. It also challenged my thinking, and I think it made me a better student. One major weakness was the power points. While lectures were very informative and the power points were a good length, I think it would have helped to have more words on tge slides. Often, I would scramble ti write down as much as I could during lecture, but still miss explanations that would have been helpful to my understanding when reviewing my notes later! ",
            "\u00a0Main weakness is that the professor does not engage well with students and begins to answer questions before listening to the full question.  He is very difficult to communicate with.\r\n\r\nStrengths include a lot of interesting material. ",
            "\u00a0A strength is that the course covers a large amount of material and does so pretty efficiently. I also think that a strength is that it teaches students how to write a research paper, and gives support throughout that process. I also think it is set up well to facilitate learning and the review sessions were extremely helpful for making sure the material was understood. I think that sometimes the quizzes were inconsistent and formatted questions in ways that made them hard to understand. ",
            "\u00a0This course was incredibly difficult. The quizzes were not really reflective of what we learned in lecture and often required us to recall specific facts that were maybe mentioned once in class and were not in the lecture slides. No matter how hard you studied, you were never ensured a higher grade. ",
            "\u00a0The lecture slides were poorly formatted and pretty bad as tools for reviewing the material. I liked the focus on experiments, but what we were expected to know was not particularly clear. "

With that being said, many of the worries I had about the sequence were not as bad as I had hoped. For instance, there is this general understanding amongst pre-meds on campus that Zhong is a bad teacher and if you can help it, you should take the BIOL sequence in the fall with the other professor, and I don't agree with that. I was very tempted to bail but I am glad I didn't because, although Zhong wasn't always the most amazing teacher, he was clear if you paid attention in class and took active notes, and he answers questions incredibly well if you approach him one on one (which isn't something I think most students consider). BIOL 103 with Zhong gets a worse rep than I think it deserves, and I'd encourage whoever is considering taking the sequence in the fall to consider this comment. I will say, though, that my favorite sequence was 102 with Mooseker (because I liked him a lot, was able to work hard, learn a lot, and get very tangible skills), so maybe that will give you some insight on how I feel about the sequence in general. Still, consider just putting your nose down and working hard through 103 instead of postponing! You'll be surprised how much you learn and stuff. ",
