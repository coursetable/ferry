            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how various historical thinkers viewed  issues of politics, society, and ideal forms of government. ",
            "\u00a0This course teaches skills related to the interpretation of historical texts in the original context they were written in. It covers western political philosophy mainly, and is useful for understanding the arguments and ideas by some of the principle writers of the western cannon. ",
            "\u00a0This class encouraged investigation into the great works from antiquity up to the renaissance in historical and political thought through discussion, writing, and presentation, all of which were skills that I better developed. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to analyze historiography and political theory in a manner that I'd never been expected to do previously. I learned to extract major themes from the text, place those themes in historical context, and compare and contrast them to different authors. I gained a lot of foundational knowledge of Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome which was interesting although I'd never studied those topics intensively in the past. ",
            "\u00a0In this course, I improved my critical reading and writing skills by studying these texts. I also learned a lot about how investigations into historical and political thought have evolved over time given different influences of culture, war and peace, and the author's personal temperament. ",
            "\u00a0I learn how to analyze significant historical works and find themes that are significant across works and time. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to analyze texts through a historical lens, considering their contexts, styles, motivations, and biases. I also learned about some of the most influential ideas about the role of politics and philosophy in organizing our societies. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to read historians with an eye towards historiography as well as to the content of their histories. That was exciting. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about different political systems and about the rise and fall of governments from ancient civilizations to early Renaissance. I learned to compare and contrast different writers in essays and discuss these different political philosophical ideas with classmates. "

            "\u00a0I thought the strength of the course was that we stayed close to the texts and I came away with a clear understanding of each one. I think the class could have focused a little more on synthesis of the overall curriculum and applications of the ideas we learned to modern society/politics. ",
            "\u00a0The course covers a lot of material which gives it the unique ability to be a broad introduction, however, discussion is limited by time, and this means that the depth of argumentative analysis is less pronounced. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the class is in the seminar style and the choice of the texts, but the themes seemed to vary from section to section. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Renaud always did a very good job of encouraging people to speak up by re-articulating each student's argument and placing it in context with the discussion as a whole. Also, Professor Renaud helped guide discussions by passing out handouts with key passages or themes for discussion and study.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This is by no means a criticism of Professor Renaud, but there were some days where the discussion didn't really get going in seminar. This is probably due to number of external factors. I can't speak for other students, but for me it was sometimes difficult to keep up with the reading and thus be able to contribute thoughtfully. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were that the texts were generally interesting and well-chosen, and it fit well with the other two courses so there was some cross-learning. I also liked how section was very discussion based because it helped us work together as a class to analyze the ideas and draw connections across authors. In terms of weaknesses, sometimes the sheer amount of reading was excessive in regard to what we were actually able to discuss in depth during class time. ",
            "\u00a0I do not see any significant strengths and weakness of this course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include the opportunity to explore influential political thinkers and consider how they influence our modern conception of politics and government. One weakness is that the readings move very fast, and sometimes the amount of reading assigned is excessive. ",
            "\u00a0This is a strong course, and I wouldn't suggest any changes to the reading list. It would be interesting to begin the semester with a bit of metacommentary on the course's unique mission: what makes DS H&P different from a history course? From a political science course? What are the advantages of studying these texts in the context of a canon? All of those questions were explored implicitly but not explicitly -- it might have been nice to begin with a proper discussion about them. ",

            "\u00a0If they were more interested in learning political/historical philosophy, and less for a class about historical facts and analysis, then absolutely. ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend to individuals who don't have much experience with the western cannon and would like a survey introduction. The workload will outweigh the benefits if one is looking for a in depth, critical discussion type environment. But as a general survey, this is a good class. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely reccomend this course because of the insights into great global themes it offers. ",
            "\u00a0Yes--so long as you are genuinely interested in the books. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course because it takes an original and interesting approach to history and politics and gives one a very solid base in the classic works for further study in these areas. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because Professor Renaund is amazing. His teaching has a perfect balance of teaching and moderating discussion, and he encourages everyone to speak. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student, provided that this student has an interest in political philosophy and is willing to complete a large amount of reading without spending a lot of time on each text. The course is fast-paced, which brings both benefits (the ability to cover a large number of texts) and detriments (the inability to go in depth on many texts). ",
