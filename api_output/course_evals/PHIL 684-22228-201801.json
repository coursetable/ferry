We gained a bird's eye view of teleology and mechanism in history which is extremely valuable for seeing the trends, but that said, I would have liked to spend a little more time on each figure. I also would have liked to read more primary rather than secondary sources. But overall, it was a great class, and I think such an expansive topic required a more broad course outline. ",

            "\u00a0This course covered several major figures in the history of philosophy. This was both its strength and its weakness. Its breadth was a strength, because I was introduced to a wide-range of texts and thoughts on the topic. At the same time, I found many of the texts difficult to navigate. In order to get a better grasp on the ideas, I suggest the class spend more time on fewer thinkers. I will say, however, that I found it helpful when Prof. Franks gave an introduction to the thinker the week before our assigned reading.  If the breadth is retained, I suggest continuing this method.
