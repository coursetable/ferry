            "\u00a0Fermi problems (big, arbitrary estimation problems), investment/% money, probability \r\n\r\nI learned a lot of math stuff that I didn't know, and it was all kind of cool.  I learned how to think for myself and put pieces together. ",
            "\u00a0Helped me develop problem solving skills. ",
            "\u00a0How to make broad estimations and other valuable math skills ",
            "\u00a0I learned math skills that will help me in life like how to calculate mortgage payments, balance in accounts, and to estimate with accuracy. Some of the other skills I learned were less applicable to life. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to tackle and complete very complicated problems by using the Fermi method and using smaller, more manageable questions to estimate reasonable answers ",
            "\u00a0This class helps you understand how to calculate basic estimations (i.e., \"How much money is made from the sale of shoes in the U.S. in one year?\"). ",

            "\u00a0Professor Sargent is not only accessible and approachable, but she is also a fantastic professor who made learning fun, engaging, and stimulating. She is an absolutely amazing person-- take the class for her alone! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:  Covers large base, teaches unique math skills, highly organized, great practice on psets and worksheets\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:  I wish sometimes the worksheets were done together by the entire class and was taught to us, not us having to figure it out on our own, but idk maybe that was a good thing and helped me learn more ",
            "\u00a0Great professor and fun and interesting material ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- interesting subject matter, easy to grasp concepts \r\n\r\nWeaknesses- moves from topic to topic very quickly ",

            "\u00a0I enjoyed the course. ",
            "\u00a0This class is very fun, straightforward, and, honestly, quite casual. I always felt very loose and comfortable in class. It reminded me quite a lot of high school. The sole improvement I would suggest would be for the material to be taught a bit more clearly and extensively (an easy fix) before we start working on worksheets. ",
            "\u00a0The professor is super engaged and you learn about estimation! But the class isn't that intellectually simulating. ",

            "\u00a0I recommend if you need a QR credit, but it is not a super gutty gut.  You will have to spend time on psets and show up to class.  It's not a crazy amount of work, but you shouldn't go in expecting no work at all.  If you put the little bit of effort, it will be a cool class and you'll learn something.  But also I hate this type of math (probability, percentages, measurements), so I would rather have taken an easy calc or something. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is my favorite class that I have taken at Yale. Great professor and fun class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes because it was a QR credit that was geared towards people who struggle with typical math concepts, making it perfect for non-QR oriented people ",
            "\u00a0super easy QR ",

            "\u00a0Yes. It is a QR that is applicable to many facets of everyday life. It encourages critical thinking and fosters positive relationships between classmates in order to aid in understanding and promote synergy. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who A) needs QR and would like to take the easiest QR at Yale, or B) anyone who needs practice doing estimations and doing them well, such as someone preparing for a consulting interview (we did lots estimations that are easily something that could be asked during a consulting interview). ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are looking for a math gut! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it provides interesting perspective on math ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to any student looking for a math class that doesn't deal with anything too daunting or complicated.  Every topic is thoroughly explained, and the teacher does an excellent job of making key concepts easy to understand. ",
