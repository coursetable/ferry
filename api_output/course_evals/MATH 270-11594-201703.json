            "\u00a0The biggest thing that I took away from this class was the ability to think extremely logically about a problem. Most math depends on theorems and formulas, and while this class incorporated those, it really helped developed my critical thinking skills. ",
            "\u00a0Having had a weak proof based knowledge and a weak math based background, this class gave me a good introduction to principle ideas in set theory, different proof based methods, and an understanding of how set theory relates to other branches of mathematics. ",
            "\u00a0Proofs and basics of axiomatic set theory. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: the material is pretty interesting and Prof Zuckerman tries to really make sure everyone understands the material and the proofs. Was very accessible and office hours were super helpful.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Not much material was covered because he would spend so much time on each topic. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the pace of the course was a little slow, although the thoroughness and attention paid to each topic were important to how much I enjoyed. I came away feeling like I had a very strong grasp of the topics covered in the course. I would have liked more feedback on the homeworks, or perhaps some proposed solutions posted. ",
            "\u00a0I think the class could be sped up just a little more. We spent a lot of time on very specific things that I feel like would have been just as clear if we would have gone through them quicker. The good thing about this course, though, was that everything was explained extremely well. The professor tried his hardest to make sure that every questions was answered clearly and that there was no room for confusion. ",

            "\u00a0This course is awesome. The material is interesting and professor zuckerman is a saint. Workload is moderate, occasional p-sets, two midterms and a final. If you go to lecture and follow along, you will learn a lot about very cool topics and you will not struggle with the work. ",
            "\u00a0For a crash course in set theory, this is a very good class. It is very well structured and the professor puts in a lot of effort to make sure the material is explained clearly. Though it is an easier math course, it still requires work as the tests can be somewhat tricky. Overall, though, its a very solid class. ",
            "\u00a0If you are looking for a nice proof-based math class in a relatively new subject matter, this is your class. ",

            "\u00a0The Psets are long. Very long. Be prepared, and start well before the deadline. Other than that, a valuable course. "
