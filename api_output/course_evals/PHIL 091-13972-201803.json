            "\u00a0Reading and responding to philosophical texts and learning how to write a philosophy paper. ",
            "\u00a0In taking this class, I learned an incredible amount about the world of philosophy of games. I learned topics like strategy in games, how to define games, the metric of intrinsic value in games, applications of what could be considered a game. Overall, I learned a lot in instigating conversations with friends about contentious topics like \"is a race a game?\" and the importance of games in our society. ",

I consider myself to be a STEM student and never thought I'd take a philosophy class but somehow I ended up here and I loved it.  Philosophy is an extremely interesting subject and I'd never thought to look at the concept of games from this perspective. ",

            "\u00a0Very fun class, but a decent amount of reading. ",
            "\u00a0Course was fantastic. Don't think it can really be improved. Anyone interested in philosophy should take this as their first choice, but don't take it unless you are generally interested in philosophy because you'll take away spots from people who really do care. ",
            "\u00a0Mark Maxwell is a great professor and makes the discussions interesting and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were the breadth and depth of the topics discussed in the field. I think that dedicating an entire class session to one or two sets of readings was enough to get a valuable insight into the topic at hand without being overbearing or dry. I really liked the seminar-style discussion format and how Professor Maxwell asked stimulating questions to engage dialogue while inputting relevant, interesting feedback. \r\n\r\nThe only thing I could see that could improve the course would be maybe incorporating more of a heads up on irrelevant jargon or sections to skip on our readings, because sometimes it got confusing and I didn't realize until we began discussing it in class that no one really understood what it said. The professor did offer some of this insight beforehand in the previous class, but I would appreciate even more. I also highly, highly, highly would like to see the readings being posted entirely in advance so that it would easier for students to get ahead on the readings and get them done for the week, rather than have to Google them or email the professor and find them themselves. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - interesting material, direction from Professor Maxwell, discussion in seminar\r\nWeakness - some of the readings were quite challenging ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: readings are very interesting, and professor is very accessible\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes readings changed so it was difficult to know exactly what readings needed to be done. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength of the course lies in the in-class discussions revolving around the various aspects of games. On a few occasions we played games in class, which was fun and stimulating. ",
            "\u00a0There are a lot of super interesting readings in the class and it's a very interesting theme, but we would sometimes get sidetracked with somewhat irrelevant discussion. ",
            "\u00a0It teaches students how to effectively read and digest philosophical essays as well as think critically of everyday topics. However, the course did not help students with philosophical writing. Since it was an introductory course, I feel as if there should have been more structure built into the course to help students improve their philosophical writing skills. Additionally, I feel the course lacked periodic instructor feedback. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting topics, good discussion led, fair amount of work and assignments\r\nWeaknesses: tended to move off topic quite a bit into random discussions, sometimes these were good but sometimes not ",
            "\u00a0This class covered very interesting material. The readings and thus the workload was manageable. Discussions were always entertaining and interesting. A weakness is that sometimes we spent too much time on a topic and other times we would spend too little time on a topic but of course that's subjective to what I found engaging. "

            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course. It is an interesting way to look at games and how they relate to life in general. ",
            "\u00a0I 100% would recommend this course to another student simply because the discussion of games in society is a niche topic that is difficult to explore anywhere outside of college. This course has changed the way I view the world and even Life in examining what I think is a game and what the value of games is. It's such an interesting course that's taught so well that I can't recommend the class enough. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this first-year seminar was fun, engaging, and very enjoyable. Professor Maxwell cares about making sure we understand all the material and provided great feedback on our writing. ",

Personally, I'm very glad I took this class because it really helped me get used to college level readings without a lot of pressure and I got to engage in a topic that I'd never thought to learn about. This class also inspired me to take more philosophy classes because I surprisingly discovered that I really enjoy philosophy. And I also now know a lot about games and how to define a game. ",
