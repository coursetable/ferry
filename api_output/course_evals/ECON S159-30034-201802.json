Game theory, to me, seems more like a thought experiment than a field that can be implemented in public life, though I can see how some portions of the worldview espoused by game theorists can be helpful to strategizing about public policy. I think this practical application would require a deeper understanding of the field than what was exposed to us in class. It could be improved by being more interactive and less lecture-heavy. ",
