            "\u00a0A lot of tools for tackling Shakespeare in the future without tending too far towards the academic. A way towards truly meaning what Im saying. ",
            "\u00a0This course is an intensive acting workshop in which you will also improve as a reader of drama and spectator of plays. The class meets once a week on Friday afternoons for four hours. There are twelve people in the class (accepted by audition), so everyone gets 15-20 minutes each class to work on the assignment they have prepared that week--reciting a sonnet or a monologue, playing a scene, and finally presenting your final performance. For each of these, students also have to prepare scansions and paraphrases of the text.\r\n\r\nEach assignment is worked on for two weeks in a row. During their 15-20 minutes, a student will act what they've prepared, then Bundy will give them feedback and suggestions--not in a judgmental way but guiding them through what to think about and focus on in the work. When a student is not acting in front of the class, they are watching; everyone watches each other and hears Bundy's feedback to each person. \r\n\r\nIn addition, each week students meets for half an hour each with the TF, who will help them think through questions and further develop the work. ",
            "\u00a0Acting and life lessons of all sorts. Concrete engagement with Shakespeares work. ",
            "\u00a0This class gave me a greater understanding of how to approach and act Shakespearean text. ",
            "\u00a0Acting Shakespeare is an incredible class that teaches not only an in-depth look at interpreting and acting Shakespeare - from sonnet to scene - but crucial knowledge of one's own body, voice, and presentation. A ten-minute solo performance at the end of the class lets students completely reimagine a Shakespearean character while serving as a sort of director-playwright and establishing a creative character arc. ",
            "\u00a0Balancing naturalism with heightened language, finding the target, learning tools to help with Shakespeareian acting. ",
            "\u00a0This class deeply developed my understanding of acting as an exploration of the human experience and equipped me with a vernacular and set of tools to further dive into this process. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so many things as an actor-- how to target, what it means to play to your targets fully, how to use the complexities and dualities of language to bring a character and scene to life, how to dive deep into a character, and how to bring life to the work through poetry, imagination, confidence, and energy. I used to dislike Shakespeare because it felt so difficult and left me feeling so vulnerable, but now I appreciate the detail of his language, the gifts the work gives an actor, the rhythm, the vivid images, and the many different ways in which you can ground yourself to the text and what you're given. I definitely do not dislike Shakespeare anymore, and studying it helped me reframe my ideas about acting and change how I practice it in ways I never could have anticipated or imagined. "

            "\u00a0This is an amazing course. It allows each student to feel time and attention is really being given to them and incentivizes them to work hard so that they can grow as as actor. Because of all the time spent together, working on similar assignments, the students also develop close bonds, which fosters a supportive, open environment that helps students feel comfortable in class and while performing. \r\nOne challenge in the course was that the professor and the TF often had different interpretations of the text and disparate esthetic ideas. This made it difficult to please both sensibilities at once. It was, however, helpful, in that it pushed students to both try new methods and develop their own actorly judgment. ",
            "\u00a0This class's main strength is that its taught by James Bundy. He is a phenomenal professor and director. With every comment he makes you can see everyone's performance improve.\r\n\r\nMy main criticism of this class was its TA. It was class consensus that her directions were unhelpful. She would often give directions that James Bundy would say were wrong when you presented in class. This was incredibly frustrating because, if you were struggling with a piece, she was your main lifeline before having to present to James Bundy (but you couldn't trust any advice she gave you, since James Bundy would have you do the opposite of whatever she said). This made the class significantly more frustrating and difficult (especially because if he torn into you about an acting choice that she said you needed to make, she wouldn't speak up and take the blame for having given a bad direction).*\r\n\r\n*While I understand that acting choices are ultimately our decision, if we're struggling, it makes sense to default to what the third-year YSD directing student says, since she has significantly more experience and training. ",
            "\u00a0The class is perfectly paced and structured. By transitioning from sonnet to solo performance, students were able to learn at a good pace and improve incrementally over the course of the semester. The one class that felt a bit extraneous was the class where we read our solo performance cut out loud, perhaps that class could just be a short conversation outside of class about one's concept. Otherwise, this was a fast-paced and exciting class, one of my favorites. ",
            "\u00a0No Weaknesses - so engaging, formed to help students learn - it does so effectively. ",
            "\u00a0This course can be a bit overwhelming when taken alongside other classes and requires plenty of independent accountability, but is structured really well for what it is designed to be. "

        [
            "\u00a0Absolutely. But only if the student was really passionate about acting and ready to work. This class was hard in the best way, but it was still really challenging - I had to put a lot of myself into it. Any student who is ready to do that will learn an immense amount in this class. ",
            "\u00a0YES, this is an amazing course! If you are prepared for the time commitment (4.5 hours of class/meeting, plus several hours of assignments/preparation/rehearsal per week) and really dedicate your full attention to your work, you will learn so much over the semester--and read and memorize a lot of Shakespeare, which is fantastic! Bundy's insights alone make the class worthwhile. ",
            "\u00a0This is far and away the best acting class Ive taken at Yale. Take this if you can! ",
            "\u00a0YES! A thousand times, yes! I'm so happy that I was given the opportunity to take this class. If you get in, take it! You learn so much about Shakespeare and acting. It's an immense amount of work and very stressful, but 100% worth it to learn from an amazing industry professional. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely - if you can get in, take it. The best acting class you will take at Yale; designing your own solo performance is the biggest acting challenge you will likely get. James is an amazing teacher and you will learn so much from him and your TF. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I improved so much. ",
            "\u00a0Would absolutely recommend this to any student hoping to improve their acting ability, but with the recommendation to do so during a semester with a lighter workload. ",
            "\u00a0I would 100% recommend this course to another student, as long as you're willing and excited to put in the work. It's not a course to take lightly, and being a part of it means an incredible amount of preparation, memorization, rehearsal, vulnerability, and the ability to take suggestions and work them immediately in front of your peers. I was surprised by how much time I put into this class, simply because you end up wanting to in order to do the best work you can. I learned so much from it, however, and James Bundy is truly generous with his time, feedback, and attention to detail. The weekly tutorials with the TF are also incredibly helpful and instructive. If you can take it, definitely do! "
