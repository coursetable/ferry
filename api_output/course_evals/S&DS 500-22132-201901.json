We received our grades very quickly, along with feedback.\r\nWeaknesses: The class was a bit slow, and it would have been better having slides instead of having the professor write down everything on the board. ",
            "\u00a0Lecture organization was poor and expectations were unclear. We might, for instance, spend 3 lectures copying down Dr. Brinda's chalkboard notes and definitions without actually discussing what any of them meant or why they were important. On multiple occasions, a lecture would end with \"But you don't need to worry about/know any of this.\" Deadlines frequently changed. Lectures did not prepare students for quizzes. Gratuitous \"hints\" about the final quiz and exam content were provided to the class, presumably to get grades back up. While appreciated for the likely positive effects on our GPAs, this decision motivated blunt memorization of material over actually learning and understanding it. ",
