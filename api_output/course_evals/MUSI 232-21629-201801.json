            "\u00a0I learned so much in this course! I was exposed in a well-rounded way to a musical tradition and culture to which I had barely any previous exposure. The papers that we read provided incisive and accessible analysis into the history of gamelan and the way it fits into Indonesian society. Maho made sure to switch us around to different instruments, which helped us understand the colotomic compositional structure. The class was an excellent experience of performance practice, but made sure that experience was thoroughly contextualized. Maho always gave very thorough answers to the questions I posed in my responses. I cannot recommend this class enough! Very well designed, a very low workload that was also engaging, a teacher that is committed to engaging students in the art form, and a presentation of said art form that inspires future engagement. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about Indonesian culture, specifically traditional gamelan ensemble and wayang performances. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to play a series of gamelan instruments at a basic level. I also learned about what gamelan looks like in Javanese culture (especially in contrast to American adoption of gamelan), religion in Indonesia, and a variety of communities that interact with gamelan across the world. ",

            "\u00a0The course is very straightforward with expectations. Maho is very understanding of student situations when unexpected things come up, but she keeps a reasonably strict schedule, which I see as a strength of the course. It is very well organized and I have no complaints. "

            "\u00a0YES. Take it for a letter grade. It'll bring joy into your schedule. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommended- Maho is kind, patient, and a skilled instructor. I looked forward to this class every Tuesday and Thursday, and highly recommend it to any student- regardless of their musical background. ",
            "\u00a0Yes because it gives you insight into a foreign culture that you would not have experienced otherwise. ",
            "\u00a0100% I would definitely recommend this course. It first and foremost a lot of fun. Both musicians and non musicians come together to learn something they're both unfamiliar with. Not only did we learn the technicalities of performance, but we were immersed in history and cultural information about Java and Indonesia. We learned about religion, traditions, and other art forms in Java. I feel like we got to see so much more than just the instruments in the room because of all we learned about what it means to be a Javanese gamelan performer. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this class! Maho is great and the class is very fun and engaging! You won't regret it! It's a must take! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely take this. "
