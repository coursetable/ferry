This may be improved by installing all necessary programs on a library computer on campus. ",
            "\u00a0This course equips you with a unique skill set in descriptive and temporospatial biostatistics and epidemiology.  This should be required for doctoral students whose work can directly impact public health policy.  Major strengths include the use of real public health database data, the direct relevance of lecture material to its application in the assignments, and the amazing professor (as instructor and person).  The only weakness is that we did not get a chance to practice with GIS applications, but the professor (at our request) instead chose to use this lecture time to teach us another valuable skill (counterfactual analysis). ",

The way he structured the course was logical, and the material (lectures, application examples) was easy to digest and then apply in the homework assignments.  He also made himself available outside of the course for additional guidance on homework and the final project.  Truly, no suggestions for improvement! ",

            "\u00a0I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this course to anyone in public health (and especially PhD students) whose work has policy implications.  The readily applicable skills acquired through the course in descriptive and temporospatial epidemiology as well as in data visualization and interpretation are second to none.  Prof. Holford is also very kind, approachable, and open to tailoring class structure and discussions to the students' interests and needs.  To anyone considering taking this class: DO IT, and thank me later! ",
