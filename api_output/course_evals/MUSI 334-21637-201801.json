            "\u00a0Ability to sing polyphony. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about early music! Had a great time learning the Beggar's Opera and other pieces from the early era. ",
            "\u00a0This class develops your sight-reading/singing skills and introduces you to a very fun (and often quirky) body of early music. Youll focus on one particular era or type of early music each semester, e.g. British broadsides and ballads or German music of the Protestant Reformation. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to play the harpsicord and more about early music ",

            "\u00a0Really enjoyed learning about the musical side of history in this course. A very enjoyable performance class as well that teaches you early musical styles, techniques, and more. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed this class because it introduced to me beautiful early music. As a singer, this course has allowed me to improve my singing by learning how to blend with other people's voices and understand more musical theory. "

            "\u00a0The course could be improved if auditions were slightly more restrictive. Not dramatically so, but I think with a slightly smaller crew it would be easier to focus and learn more complex arrangements. I think a few more individual checkups towards the beginning to force more memorization of the music outside of class would also help get the ball rolling so that the class could move through the learning phase into the perfecting phase more quickly. ",
            "\u00a0I miss choral singing from high school and this definitely brought back a lot of the fun parts of that! ",

            "\u00a0This is honestly such a fantastic class. The composition of the class is fun and relaxed, the songs are chosen wonderfully, and Grant clearly knows his stuff and his passion for the music is inviting. ",
            "\u00a0Great course, sweet and musically intelligent professor. ",
            "\u00a0The course was too large this semester. I think it would be a better course if the total number of students were half those in the class in Spring 2018 ",
