            "\u00a0The course is expansive and helpful. Perhaps there could have been some primary sources, but that may have made it too unwieldy. Occasionally Dr. Sorkin assigns a slightly unreasonable amount of reading (400-500 pages), but usually it is manageable, and he uses class time productively to enhance understanding of material that may have been skimmed (as well, obviously, as material that has already been read thoroughly).
