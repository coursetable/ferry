            "\u00a0I learned many basic skills of microeconomic analysis such as the supply and demand curves for individuals, markets, firms, labor, and capital. I also learned how to maximize profit under a variety of conditions and how to minimize cost in both the short and long run. We learned why competitive markets are superior for economic efficiency and how efficient solutions will always result when there is little interference. Most of all, I gained insights into how people and firms make rational decisions. ",

            "\u00a0You'll definitely learn the material, but the class is pretty dry for much of the semester, especially if you already have some sort of background in Econ. There were times where we had interesting discussions towards the end of the semester, but those were few and far between. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were well done and the homework accurately reflected what we were learning in class. I wish, however, that the syllabus was a bit more accurate and that the lectures correlated to the readings more strongly. ",
            "\u00a0This course is mathematically centric and I did not expect this. There is some work with derivatives, but this extends only to Chain Rule types and x^1 types, which tend to be easy. \r\n\r\nThe course also covers lots of material in a very small amount of time. One should be prepared to spend a lot of time asking the instructor questions--but thankfully, unlike what I understand about the lecture course, you have a LOT of access to your professor! ",
            "\u00a0I was hoping that this class would be a way to learn econ through active participation since it's labeled as an econ \"seminar,\" but it was taught more in a lecture style. A few things (like buzz groups and the occasional class discussion - one particularly memorable one was comparing online dating and the lemons principle) made the class feel more seminar-like, but it was often difficult to approach buzz groups or get a discussion going on a particular topic because the lessons themselves were explained in a way that was rather difficult to follow. One definite strength of the class, however, was that we were allowed to use derivatives to solve our problem set/exam questions, which (from what I understand) is not allowed in the lecture course & I'd imagine that'd get really irritating really fast. For me, the introduction of simple calculus into the lessons made some of the graphical/mathematical concepts easier to understand. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course really resides in the textbook and the small seminar discussions. The classes should emphasize the discussion component more. ",
            "\u00a0I think that it would be beneficial to have the class be more discussion based. It was essentially formatted as a small lecture, but I think I would've gotten more out of the class if it truly was a seminar. ",
            "\u00a0This course was strong because of its relatively heavy math emphasis which I found good. The only weakness of the class is how I could have used a little more help understanding the relationships between the graphs. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is the use of buzz groups, but we don't do enough of them. I would recommend our using more buzz groups. ",
            "\u00a0The smaller setting was nice. It allowed us to be able to actually try problems in class and see how they worked. It might've been nice to have more class time, though. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, this course is strong but some classes could be more engaging and interesting. Sometimes, the material is dense or hard to grasp at first so I think slowing down at times could also be helpful. In addition, the different professors teach the course differently so I think collaborating more would be beneficial to both sections. Also, using or referring to the textbook more could also be helpful. "

            "\u00a0You need intro micro for lots of courses at Yale, and I would very much recommend this one over the large lecture. There's no section, and it's a lot easier to pay attention in a small classroom. The class does get dry at times, and the problem set grading will be frustrating at times, but I'd really emphasize that this course is much preferable to the large lecture, so take it if you can. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any introductory economics student looking for a small learning environment. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it to anyone wishing to gain greater knowledge of how the economy works. The Microeconomics Seminar is superior to all comparable courses because of the hands-on atmosphere in class and because of the connectivity with fellow students and the professor. ",
            "\u00a0Depends on the student. If you have previous background in econ (AP Micro, etc.), you'll probably be able to follow the lessons, but if you (like me) have never taken micro in the past, you're not really the type to speak up in class if you're confused, and you have classes during the professor's office hours, then maybe skip taking econ if you don't need it for your major or try shopping both this class and the lecture to see which one is better for you. Although, beware - I had some basic econ knowledge going into the class and I thought it was a piece of cake during shopping period when we were basically just doing supply & demand, but once shopping period ended and it was too late to drop it, it got really confusing really fast. I've also heard that your econ 110 experience could depend very heavily on instructor. If I could go back in time and revise my schedule, I'd probably take something I'm more interested in instead of this class since I don't need it for the majors I'm considering & I have plenty of other things I could do for social science & QR requirements. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would. ",

            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the seminar seems to be the best way. ",
