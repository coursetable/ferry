            "\u00a0I learned the theory and applications applications of vector calculus . ",

            "\u00a0There was nothing really exceptional about this class--I learned the foundations of multivariable calculus, and I say foundations because you can learn the topics as in-depth as you want or as basically as you want. The lectures themselves provide the framework for each topic, but we do cover I think a pretty wide but standard  breadth of multivariable topics. ",

            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are the sheer volume of resources that are available to you and the breadth of the content covered. The fact that this course covers a lot of material can also be seen as a weakness for some, as it is very fast-paced. Another weakness of this course is that is is difficult to do well in, as exams consist of very few problems, so not knowing how to do 1 problem will impact your grade pretty heavily. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the grading scheme of the three exams does not represent a student's knowledge of the different concepts well. The class should put less focus on computation. The class is comprehensive though. ",
            "\u00a0The course needs to be taught by graduate students with significant prior teaching experience or by full professors. Too many students are at a great disadvantage when they are placed into a section where the instructor is not good. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very fast paced and can be overwhelming at times. However, there are plenty of office hours to counteract this. ",
            "\u00a0Very good course. Some inconsistencies between instructors which should be addressed. ",
            "\u00a0I thought my section professor was a great part of this course, as he provided great explanantion of all the concepts as well adding extra insight. ",
            "\u00a0The course brings you through multivariable calculus at a good pace. However, at times lectures moved forward without a great explanation necessary for people who havent had experience with multi before. The teacher explained the necessary things in order to learn the basic functions of multi, but would brush over more basic knowledge that wasnt always commonly held. However, the course offers plenty of resources for extra help. ",
            "\u00a0Course is taught extremely quickly.\r\nVery abstract sometimes.\r\nTextbook and problem sets were very helpful.\r\nTeacher and peer tutors very available. ",
            "\u00a0The class was helpful in the sense that all the classes were about 30 students, so you can definitely ask questions and take control of your learning if you want to. The teachers are mostly graduate students, which I think could be a disadvantage but wasn't too bad in my case (my teacher was really enthusiastic about math and physics, so his shortcomings as a professor were made up for by his enthusiasm). However, there are just so many people that take this class that you start to feel like just a number, and if you fall behind, the general feeling is that no one will really help you catch up or care if you don't. My class was also not very interactive, so it was really easy to zone out. Lastly, I think having only 2 1 hour and 15 minute long lectures a week is not nearly enough time to cover the material well enough for most students to understand, so I would suggest having more class time. ",
            "\u00a0Lots of resources are given for test prep, which is very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Teaching wasnt great. Very focused on computation and not enough on concept / theory. Moved super fast. ",
            "\u00a0The professors are all well organized and a high standard is maintained. ",
            "\u00a0The material is organized in a really logical way but the graduate students teaching the course seemed lost and I felt that the biggest weakness was my teacher. "

            "\u00a0Yes, as I think it provides a good foundation of multivariable calculus. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class if it is a prerequisite and/or if you are really passionate about multivariable calculus for some reason. Keep in mind that this is a challenging course. It is not impossible to do well in, but in order to do so, you must be very detailed oriented, as small errors will be penalized fairly heavily on the exams. ",
            "\u00a0If the student's studies demanded the use of this level of calculus, then absolutely. If the student wants to explore the field of mathematics for exploration's sake, I would not recommend it. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend the course if you do not get placed into a section with a good instructor. This will make or break your experience. ",
            "\u00a0I  would definitely recommend this course. It is by far the best math course i have ever taken. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, very good and thorough class. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great class for anyone looking to apply this Calculus in a STEM major. ",
            "\u00a0If youre planning on taking math or interested in it, go for it. Despite its reputation, the work and intellectual challenge is manageable. However, if youre only trying to satisfy the QR requirement, there are easier and perhaps more applicable or interesting ways to do so. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because even if the material is hard, it is very interesting and it is very satisfying once you understand it. \r\nAlso, very good that it is NOT a flipped class. ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested in math, thinking about studying physics, or just coming out of high school and feeling weird about not take a math course, you'll probably have to take this class. Honestly, I think most of the Yale population does, and for all the complaints, most if not all survive. I honestly have no bad feelings towards this class. It's relatively straight-forward, and if you just read your textbook or watch Khan Academy videos when you're confused on p-sets, you'll probably be fine. I would definitely recommend pacing yourself when you do homework because that will improve your retention rate, as I felt the biggest challenge was remembering everything we covered come midterms or finals. Just don't get lost in the sauce, and you'll be fine. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0I would because I learned a lot and became a better mathematician. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course only if you have to take it. The material is interesting and useful but it is hard to get past the teaching. "
