            "\u00a0I think the course would have been better structured if it had included commutative algebra as a prerequisite. As someone who had taken 380, many proofs in class felt redundant or overly long to me, but they left some students who hadnt taken 380 confused. Another possibility could be to assume the commutative algebra results, giving a brief reminder of their proofs, but also giving a reference to a specific proposition in a commutative algebra textbook.
