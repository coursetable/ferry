            "\u00a0Both Duncan and Staib seem to be very interested in the topic, which makes the course more interesting although Prof Staib's lectures can be a bit monotonous. There were some inconsistencies/confusion with which transform tables to use, but this was a minor problem. Psets were appropriately challenging and about only once every other week. Stopped going to TA sessions once they seemed to be unprepared or not that helpful. They also did not give any feedback on psets. ",
            "\u00a0The subject matter had potential to be interesting but the presentation was a little dry.  The best parts were the intro to machine learning and the modeling of the cardiovascular system. ",
            "\u00a0Once you get a grasp on some of the basic course concepts, it feels interesting and useful course for modeling. Until then, though, you're gonna feel pretty lost and frustrated ",
            "\u00a0This course. Every time I walk into the classroom with just a basket of happiness that is slowly but surely drained from my body as the class continues for an unbearable 75 minutes. Professor Duncan and Professor Staib seem like kind people, but they do not know how to teach an engaging course. Staib is the worse of the two as he just reads slides that are copy/pasted directly from the reading material in a soul sucking monotone. At least Duncan will growl sometimes when he makes a mistake which is fun. I won't say I didn't learn anything, but I'm not sure these people helped me learn it. The TAs were helpful. This is only because they have to just hand out answers because they don't really have a strong grasp on the specific information taught in class. \r\n\r\nHonestly, the BME department is in desperate need of women of color. I can't take another class like this. \r\n\r\nThis is the worst class I have taken at Yale. I am a STEM major so that is saying something. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: TAs were very available by email to answer questions.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: class was not at all interactive, lectures were often boring.  The material that was on the problem sets often did not follow from the material from class, or, occasionally, even from the textbook.  The class was co-taught by two professors but I felt that the material that each one taught did not follow from the other's. ",

            "\u00a0Not particularly - this class was boring and focused a lot on foundational math skills which are important but not at all what I was expecting going in.  it is required for the BME major though.  it got a bit more interesting towards the end of the class where we actually started to learn about images.
