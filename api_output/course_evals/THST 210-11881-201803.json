Most of the class had minimal experience with acting and were more interested in the technical side of theater and this class was not at all geared towards this side of theater. "

In fact, acting in certain scenes was a catharsis for me at the time, and helped me through rough times. You will develop confidence in yourself as an actor. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it to theater majors or those interested in acting. It's a really helpful class with acting and general knowledge of theater, it was a great time, and Toni is wonderful. ",
