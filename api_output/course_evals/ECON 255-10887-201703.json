Long exams that made it difficult to check over work or even finish. ",

Super relevant material - never felt like I was learning useless things.\r\nWeaknesses: It was just so hard. So hard. I worked so hard in this course and was confused most of the time. The material is very challenging and there is so much of it. I remember remarking, while studying for the midterms, that there was more material to cover than I had ever had to cover for a midterm. This course could definitely be spread over a year. The professor spoke very quickly and went through material at lightening speed. Also, we never knew what our grades would be. Still don't know. It was really hard to tell how I was doing in the course. He refused to give concrete information on the grading curve and scale. ",

            "\u00a0There is a disconnect between what is taught in lecture and the PSETs. The weekly TA-led sections actually taught us what we were supposed to know for the PSETs. \r\n\r\nCriticism: \r\n*Essentially, Pascutti is not the most organized teacher. \r\n\r\n1. The answer keys to each of the seven PSETs had at least 2-5 typos on them. Sometimes the answer keys were not step-by-step either, making it hard to follow the solutions. Thus, as a student taking an INTRODUCTORY course on corp. fin., it makes you question whether the work you did was correct or if the answer key was wrong. \r\n\r\n2. The class syllabus specifically stated: \"2 Midterm Exams: (40%) Closed book but you will be allowed to bring one page of notes or equations.\" Several classes before the first midterm, Pascutti told us that we wouldn't be allowed to bring out own notes to the midterm, and instead, he'd provide us with his own equation sheets. Obviously he did not abide by what the syllabus said -- but of course no one in the class would bother to address it and just deal with it. \r\n\r\n3. The syllabus listed the topics that would be learned on that class day. However, Pascutti rarely covered all of the topics that were to be learned that day. It was confusing to keep track of what you learned in lecture vs. what was supposed to be learned (according to the syllabus). Also, the syllabus told us which chapters in the textbook to read -- however, if on Tuesday we were supposed to read all of Chapter 15, but Pascutti only covered 15.1-15.3, were we responsible for reading the rest of Chp 15. for the midterms? Students should not have to figure this out themselves -- Pascutti should have been A LOT more explicitly organized. If he didn't cover something in lecture, then he should've made a Canvas announcement to tell us, \"The syllabus said we were supposed to learn X today, but we didn't, so you are NOT responsible for knowing it for the PSETs/midterms\" or \"The syllabus said we were supposed to learn Y today, and we didn't get to it, so next class I'll address it.\"\r\n\r\n3.5. My recommendation would be to just follow the textbook more. Incorporate more figures / problems from the chapters into your lecture. Actually GO OVER relevant, example problems in lecture. Maybe include some of the conceptual questions from the back of the textbook in the PSETs.     \r\n\r\n4. Don't ask stupid (read: not the most relevant) questions on the midterm if you aren't going to ask stupid questions on the PSETs. Don't make a stupid question like \"What are the top ratings for Moody's and the S&P\", which can be answered in 5-6 letters, worth 12-15 points, while at the same time making a time-consuming NPV calculation question worth 10-15 points. It doesn't make sense... \r\n\r\n\r\nPositive Things: \r\n*However, Pascutti /does/ care about his students and he was willing to meet with them one-on-one. Additionally, he asked for weekly feedback and replied to what students had to tell him throughout the semester, which no professor really does at Yale. He is a good teacher now and I am confident he will be a better teacher in the future. ",

            "\u00a0Problem sets do a very good job of solidifying content. Lectures and lecture notes are not organized very well. Weekly feedback emails were helpful for looking at the bigger picture. Exams were fair but the final was very long and tedious. ",
            "\u00a0This course was organized in a very logical procession, such that later concepts built on and utilized previous concepts very well. As a result, if I understood earlier concepts better, it made much more sense as I was approaching new problems. I also thought that the class times were utilized very efficiently; we certainly aimed to cover a lot of material in class, so there was never a wasted moment. Between the class lectures and the supplementary readings and problem sets, I thought the course did a good idea of emphasizing what portions were most important to grasp. As for areas of improvement, I understand that this might not have been possible considering how new the course is, but it would be awesome if future courses could maybe have peer tutors to help out with problem sets. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of material ",
            "\u00a0Professor Pascutti is a definite strength of the course. He brings an impressive knowledge to the classroom, and his perspective as a practitioner was especially interesting. Another strength of the course was the material it covered, which was both interesting and useful. One potential way to improve the course would be to tailor some of the topics to closely address the specific knowledge students would be expected to know going into entry-level finance roles or interviews - such as by seeking input from hiring managers, the Office of Career Strategy, or interviewers - as it seemed that many students were preparing for interviews and hoped the course would augment this preparation. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: broad intro into finance, covering the basics quickly but well\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lack of coherent lecture slides or practice material, section TAs were impossible to understand or follow, the exams were much harder than the problem sets. ",

The one issue I have was that there was a clear disconnect between the professor and his TFs when it came to grading standards for the midterms, and without the professor actually grading, it was hard to tell what answers were creditable.

I see myself using a majority of the concepts in my job someday.\r\n\r\nOne weakness of the course would be the lack of feedback on test grades. They were harshly graded...

He also writes all of the solutions in word, without using equation formatting. This might seem like a small detail but when you are going through a million problems to study for an exam and this is how everything is formatted: 5/(1+0.3)*(1+1/(1+0.02)^140) it gets annoying. We get it, you don't come from academia, but please just get a TA that knows how to use Latec and can also proofread your typos. \r\n\r\nPascutti does not make powerpoints for class, he just scribbles on the board and goes through a list of topics. However, he is so disorganized that it is extremely difficult to follow which concepts he is talking about.  In addition, he does a terrible job introducing new concepts. If you don't have background knowledge, this class will be very difficult to understand.\r\n\r\nPiazza is available for the course, but Pascutti changed it so the names were not anonymous to him halfway through the semester, and he began to be really mean in his answers. Here are some examples of his answers: \"Everything we talked about in class,\"  \"I have already tried to be clear about this,\" \"I don't know how you could have interpreted this differently.\" I really don't understand the point of having piazza if you are going berate people for asking questions.\r\n\r\nI took this class because because I thought it would help with interviews, I ended up wishing I read book on this and instead used this credit for more a interesting course at Yale. Don't be fooled by Pascutti's energetic personality during shopping period. I'll leave you with that. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, I highly recommend, but with the caveat that it will be extremely difficult. You will be stressed. It's super useful if you want to work in finance or even just business. Definitely good for an ECON credit, too. But I would like to see what the future of this course looks like; this is one of the first years he has taught it, so he's still figuring out what works best. Depending on what grade I get, too, would change my recommendation! ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to a friend on the condition that they are actually interested in finance. The class requires quite a bit of work and is going to prove difficult if you aren't interested. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This course is fantastic for anyone who is interested in the material and is up for a bit of a challenge. Strongly recommend! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is a fantastic class in corporate finance that will give you a thorough understanding of the financial ends of all types of businesses. I have no intention of going into finance, and I still thought this was a fantastic course. ",
            "\u00a0Great foundation for finance stuff ",
            "\u00a0I would 100% recommend this course to another student. These are important concepts that very few people truly understand. ",
            "\u00a0I recommend this class to people genuinely interested in finance. The tests are hard, the problem sets are hard, so don't waste your time if you're just trying to get an Econ elective. Pascutti is incredibly engaging and interesting, but he is very smart and does not have time for students that are not fully engaged with the class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend the course if there were new TF's involved. I think Pascutti does a great job lecturing but the in depth teaching was lacking. ",
            "\u00a0Would highly recommend to anyone going into finance (S&T or banking) because the course provides a great overview of mathematical applications and Pascutti is freaking hilarious. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this class, but the stuff you learn in it is interesting and relevant for life, so I would recommend you learn this at some point in your life. As a non-econ major, I decided to take this course to become financially literate. I will first talk about the bad things and then the good things about this class. \r\n\r\nCriticism: \r\n*Essentially, Pascutti is not the most organized teacher. \r\n\r\n1. The answer keys to each of the seven PSETs had at least 2-5 typos on them. Sometimes the answer keys were not step-by-step either, making it hard to follow the solutions. Thus, as a student taking an INTRODUCTORY course on corp. fin., it makes you question whether the work you did was correct or if the answer key was wrong. \r\n\r\n2. The class syllabus specifically stated: \"2 Midterm Exams: (40%) Closed book but you will be allowed to bring one page of notes or equations.\" Several classes before the first midterm, Pascutti told us that we wouldn't be allowed to bring out own notes to the midterm, and instead, he'd provide us with his own equation sheets. Obviously he did not abide by what the syllabus said -- but of course no one in the class would bother to address it and just deal with it. \r\n\r\n3. The syllabus listed the topics that would be learned on that class day. However, Pascutti rarely covered all of the topics that were to be learned that day. It was confusing to keep track of what you learned in lecture vs. what was supposed to be learned (according to the syllabus). Also, the syllabus told us which chapters in the textbook to read -- however, if on Tuesday we were supposed to read all of Chapter 15, but Pascutti only covered 15.1-15.3, were we responsible for reading the rest of Chp 15. for the midterms? Students should not have to figure this out themselves -- Pascutti should have been A LOT more explicitly organized. If he didn't cover something in lecture, then he should've made a Canvas announcement to tell us, \"The syllabus said we were supposed to learn X today, but we didn't, so you are NOT responsible for knowing it for the PSETs/midterms\" or \"The syllabus said we were supposed to learn Y today, and we didn't get to it, so next class I'll address it.\"\r\n\r\n3.5. My recommendation would be to just follow the textbook more. Incorporate more figures / problems from the chapters into your lecture. Actually GO OVER relevant, example problems in lecture. Maybe include some of the conceptual questions from the back of the textbook in the PSETs.     \r\n\r\n4. Don't ask stupid (read: not the most relevant) questions on the midterm if you aren't going to ask stupid questions on the PSETs. Don't make a stupid question like \"What are the top ratings for Moody's and the S&P\", which can be answered in 5-6 letters, worth 12-15 points, while at the same time making a time-consuming NPV calculation question worth 10-15 points. It doesn't make sense... \r\n\r\n\r\nPositive Things: \r\n*However, Pascutti /does/ care about his students and he was willing to meet with them one-on-one. Additionally, he asked for weekly feedback and replied to what students had to tell him throughout the semester, which no professor really does at Yale. He is a good teacher now and I am confident he will be a better teacher in the future. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Great course to learn about finance. ",
            "\u00a0Will recommend if you want to know about finance! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this class is a great introduction to a lot of different topics in corporate finance. But be warned that classes are not organized very well, so lectures might feel somewhat confusing the first time around. Put in the time to complete the PSETs and understand what is going on, it will pay dividends later in the course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in finance or just wants to learn a little more about it. Regardless of whether or not you are thinking of a career in finance, I think this class did a great job in teaching you fundamental concepts that are important for life in general. The learning curve was a bit steep for someone like myself, who had gone in without any finance knowledge whatsoever, but I felt that if you immerse yourself and really take the time to learn the material, you will come out knowing a lot more than you did prior. ",
            "\u00a0Avoid if pascutti ",
            "\u00a0Yes if you are an econ major ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student, especially one with a basic background in finance who is interested in gaining more knowledge and a more comprehensive view of the subject. The course covers a wide range of topics, challenging students while teaching them foundational knowledge that can be applied in a finance role or in academic research. ",
            "\u00a0No, unless youre some kind of masochistic finance nerd ",
            "\u00a0My least favorite class taken at Yale, I would highly recommend not taking it. It doesn't help with getting a job, which is seemingly why most people take it, and the material is pretty useless. ",
            "\u00a0only if you have prior knowledge ",
            "\u00a0Probably not unless you are taking it credit/d or have done a summer in finance, otherwise it's really too much stress. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you have an interest in this subject, Pascutti is the best teacher for it and this is the only class at gale that really caters to finance ",
            "\u00a0Great course. If youre interested in finance definitely take it ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but prepare to be challenged (as any good class should do)! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if the student wants to be familiar with finance. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Great overview of all the important finance topics. If youre planning to do finance/ consulting/ etc this class is a must. And even if youre just going to work at a company, I still think this would be helpful to give you a basic understanding of how finance works and explains why companies make the decisions they do. ",
            "\u00a0Yes but credit D!!! ",
            "\u00a0I completely recommendend this class. Pascutti is an amazing professor and you learn a lot. The Psets are actually helpful in facilitating learning and getting prepared for exams. One of the best classes Ive taken at Yale thus far, 10/10 would take again ",
            "\u00a0Great course just be prepared for almost weekly psets, two midterms, and a final! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend im this to anyone who is at all interested in corporate finance. It is definitely a useful class. Try to take with Professor Pascutti if possible. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is the one of the most engaging Econ classes to take at Yale, thanks to Pascutti. ",
            "\u00a0ECON 255 is a great course for undergraduates with an interest in business/finance. The lectures are interesting and informative, the exams are tough yet fair, and the course really prepares students with a baseline understanding of some of the fundamental concepts of the corporate world. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. If you'd like to develop a fundamental grasp on the field of corporate finance this class is for you. The learning curve can be steep at times, but that's the nature of the material. Take it as a credit/d if you'd like; the material and professor are phenomenal but the grading can be inconsistent. ",
            "\u00a0If you are planning on going into the corporate world, this course is a great introduction to what you'll be dealing with. You begin to think about money and financial decisions in a different way-considering risk and the cost of time. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, interesting material and a very good instructor. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great Credit D if you're interested in finance. You'll learn a lot and have great lectures. ",
            "\u00a0I would because I enjoyed the material... but the class grading and tests were unclear. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely not an easy course, but if you are interested in corporate finance, absolutely. Many kids go into it thinking they can take it for job or interview prep, but this is very misguided. This course is not designed for and will not be able to help you land your internship, but will enable you to read and understand every financial term you thought you knew but really didn't. ",
            "\u00a0This is a good basic finance course. Pascutti made it clear his goal is to have the course designated a core Econ course, and it shows. A lot of the material is very relevant to what comes up in the newspapers and just useful to know for everyday life in general, and Pascutti's teaching is solid, traveling to offer office hours and giving more or less weekly feedback via email, nice for a lecture. I'm not an aspiring consultant/banker/trader but still found most of the material interesting; some topics like options trading and different asset pricing models were a bit narrower than I would have preferred but seem necessary for other applications, more or less, so take that how you will. ",
            "\u00a0The class is what you sign up for and put into it. Pascutti has a ton of knowledge and can be a great teacher. He will teach you a lot (I knew none of the material ahead of time). However, it will be a hard class, so keep in mind that you will have to read the book sometimes and study hard. The averages on midterms is low, so I'm hoping for a good curve. ",
            "\u00a0A true gem as an introduction to finance. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in corporate structure and the stock market, this class can be interesting at times. ",
            "\u00a0Would totally recommend if you're even just slightly interested in finance. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you're interested at all in finance, even if you have no idea of what finance entails. "
