            "\u00a0I learned how to become a better writer in terms of clarity, character development, plot development, and story structure. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the basic elements of writing a story, including setting, dialogue, and characterization. Since this was my first course in fiction, I got to experiment with a new genre of writing that excites me. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Choi does an awesome job in the first weeks of focusing on specific skills: dialogue, setting, revision. I had never taken a fiction course that focused on specific details on how learning to read fiction affects our ability to write fiction. ",

            "\u00a0A strength of the  course is the workshop environment. Being able to talk over creative decisions with peers who are also writing fiction is such a valuable and intimate environment. A weakness of the course is because of the need for intimacy all students should be willing to share. ",
            "\u00a0I cant think of any major weaknesses! The class was rather well organized. However, the workshop format and the many consecutive workshops we had became tiring after a whileperhaps alternating workshop classes with classes to discuss readings would be better. ",
            "\u00a0The readings exposed me to various different forms of fiction, the workshops helped me in the revision process, and Susans feedback was phenomenal. "

Second, this course is a great form for you to improve your fiction writing, given you'll spend most your time editing either your pieces or workshopping your classmate's. ",

            "\u00a0Yes!!!! Professor Choi is a warm, humble, and kind. On top of being a wonderful person, she is an excellent teacher who gives clear, thorough feedback on all your work. ",
