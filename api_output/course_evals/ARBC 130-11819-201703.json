            "\u00a0Grammar skills and speaking skills ",
            "\u00a0After this class, I have a much better understqnding of the grammatical structure of the words as well as an expanded vocabulary. ",
            "\u00a0This course requires you to practice your Arabic every day and that allowed me to really develop my skills in speaking and writing. Aziz is great at facilitating learning in the classroom and assigning work that helps you further develop as an Arabic speaker. ",
            "\u00a0I gained greater facility with the Arabic scipt (reading and writing) and learned a lot about Arabic culture! ",
            "\u00a0I definitely feel my Arabic has improved through Arabic 130. It felt great to be forming sentences off the top of my head when having mock conversations in class. That meant I could conjugate verbs (e.g. tense, number, gender, etc.) without thinking about it actively. I also felt that I developed my Arabic public speaking skills through reading passages aloud in class and through practicing (and performing) the final project. ",
            "\u00a0I learned Arabic vocabulary and grammar at the intermediate level. I learned how to speak more fluently and write Arabic essays. I also learned about Arabic poetry. I am better equipped to hold long Arabic conversations. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a mastery of the intermediate level of the Arabic language including skills such as writing, reading, listening, and speaking. I was fascinated the many facets of the Arabic culture that we were exposed to and the speed at which we were able to grasp difficult concepts through the hard work and excellent teaching of Dr. Muhammad Aziz. ",
            "\u00a0This course covers lessons 1-4 of Al-Kitaab part II and is supplemented with a few Arabic poems and additional grammer topics. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I think that the class could be improved by having cultural activities instead of section because we really learned a lot during Arab night. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths in this course are mostly Professor Aziz. He is a very genuine teacher who really wants his students to develop a passion for Arabic and Arab culture. He is willing to work long hours with you in office hours if you need extra help and is always encouraging of his students to ask questions. ",
            "\u00a0Slightly disorganized, and perhaps we could have benefitted from more rigorous grammar exercises. Most of the time we worked out of the book, which presented us with a lot of vocabulary but not very thorough instructions on grammar and usage. The Hawari book was very helpful, however! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Attitude of professor, very strong textbook (good for picking up a lot of vocabulary)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It would be interesting to have options to continue practicing Arabic outside the classroom, through Arabic dinners or the like. ",
            "\u00a0This course could be improved by having a more regimented class. I think that the best way to learn grammar is by constant practice and repetition, and I wish there were more grammar exercises so I could be better prepared for the tests. This course focused a lot on speaking and new vocabulary, and now I feel better equipped to have Arabic conversations. I also wish this class had a more regular workload because some nights we would have hours of homework whereas some days we would not have that much homework. I like having section once a week to focus on dialect as that improves my speaking skills. Having a textbook with structured drills and exercises was helpful and made the class more consistent. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course are the exemplary teaching by professor Aziz as well as the depth it goes into in mastering the Arabic language and ensuring all the different parts of the language are well developed in each student. ",
            "\u00a0This course covers a lot of material in a short amount of time.  I think it could be improved by additional learning materials outside of the textbook and homework website such as in class worksheets to help with grammar concepts. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0It would really help anyone who want to improve their Arabic and be able to speak it. ",
            "\u00a0L3 Arabic is a great course because it takes your basic Arabic skills and advances them to the intermediate level. I took away a lot from this course and would recommend it to any student who wants to know arabic. The department really cares about its students and takes many efforts to give students a well rounded education in not only Arabic but also Arab culture. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to explore a new language; in particular anyone who desires the intellectual challenge of learning a grammar, syntax, and phonology that is completely different from that of English. People who want to become fluent in Arabic might be better served taking this class with a different professor, however... ",
            "\u00a0Yes, to continue with Arabic at Yale I suppose you have to. But I think the course is a good continuation of L2 and you will learn without realizing it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to a student who is interested in taking Arabic or would like to pursue Middle Eastern studies. ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend this course especially with Dr. Aziz if you want to learn a great language and achieve mastery. ",
            "\u00a0L3 Arabic can be a great class if you do a lot of the work independently.  All of the material is in the textbook and the online website, but it is very easy to fall behind if you do not do the homework and the textbook reading.  I would recommend staying on top of all the material and vocab in order to do well. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. Aziz is a great teacher and the class is overall very fun and interesting. "
