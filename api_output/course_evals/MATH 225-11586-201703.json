            "\u00a0With linear algebra, I think the main distinction you have to make is between MATH 225 and MATH 222.\r\n\r\nFor MATH 225, the course is very theory-based and hence very proof-based, and it entails being able to think and work through a lot of rigorous proofs. You can definitely go into 225 without any knowledge of proofs, as I think that is probably the background of at least half the students, because, at least, Professor Levit, Pratyush (TF), and Charlie (peer tutor) went slow at first with steps of proofs. The professor does not ever explicitly explain how to approach writing a proof, but the TF and peer tutor, if you have Pratyush or Charlie, are extremely helpful at walking through steps of proofs for psets. I think that with this course, you get a lot, a lot, a lot of practice proving things, and while I definitely still am not great at proofs, I know more than I did before taking this course.\r\n\r\nWith the material covered, we start with vector spaces, then linear transformations, matrices, determinants, and, lastly, diagonalization with eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The amount of material covered seems to depend on the instructor teaching since we didn't seem to cover as much material as some of the previous classes. ",

            "\u00a0You learn what you need to know about linear algebra, although this semester I know for a fact that we covered less than what was covered by this course in previous semesters. You learn how to write a proof, although I felt like the professor this semester didn't really do much of that and the peer tutor did more. That said, linear algebra is crucial to basically any topic in math/stats/CS, so I'm sure the knowledge I learned will be helpful at some point in my future. Taking linear almost kinda illuminates things about math you didn't see before: you start viewing functions and operations and derivatives and integrals and probability density functions and matrices and polynomials all from the perspective of vector spaces. You learn that most things you've encountered in math can be viewed as \"objects,\" formally called vectors, but not in the traditional sense of a vector that has a direction and an angle. It's weird. ",

Lin al proofs are pretty straightforward, so it's a good place to start. We also learned (obviously) about topics in lin al such as vector spaces, linear transformations, working with matrices, and eigenvalues. We didn't get quite as far as I would've liked, but oh well. This class gave me a very solid foundation to go and learn applications of lin al. "

If you're the kind of student who thrives off of asking questions but is too shy to go to office hours, email the professor to meet separately  or this isn't the course for you. ",

            "\u00a0The teacher does not attempt to connect with the students. Having office hours the day that the psets are due is completely ridiculous. In addition, he does complicated proofs on the board but doesn't go over the basics of how to write proofs, and half the class is completely lost during his lecture. ",
            "\u00a0This course was just extremely tough for me because of its emphasis on proofs. I think being able to write proofs is extremely important; I'm just really terrible at writing proofs. I don't think you should let being afraid of proofs stop you from taking this class because you will eventually need to learn how, but it is just that 225 is the class that you will end up having to start to deal with proofs very intensely.\r\n\r\nAlso, I think the way that the course was taught could be improved in that it was so theoretical. If it included at least a bit more on applications or more examples or, most importantly, more visuals, it would've made the material so much more interesting and easier to pick up. ",
            "\u00a0The material of this course was interesting, but the lectures were essentially useless. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: psets were relevant and prepared well for tests, helpful professor and tutors. Weaknesses: a bit slow, sometimes uninteresting, was sometimes unclear how what we were doing was relevant to the rest of mathematics. ",
            "\u00a0The proof-based format made it more challenging, which I liked, but I didn't really feel like there was enough assistance to make us better proof-writers. The peer tutor, Charlie, helped a lot, but he can only do so much  it's really the course instructor's responsibility. The problem sets were really long, although they seemed longer in the beginning  I'm not sure if they actually were, or if it was because proofs were new, or if it was because vector spaces are inherently more abstract and theoretical than determinants and matrices. At the end of the course, we didn't get to a lot of topics, and instead of rushing we just didn't cover them (specifically inner products). We'll have to see down the road whether that proves to be a good thing or if it means I'll have to do extra learning on my own. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that there was a lot of information to go through really quickly and class was mostly just getting through those theorems so there wasn't much time for in depth understanding during class. It was mostly copying theorems that could be found in the textbook. \r\n\r\nThat being said I thought Professor Levit presented the material very clearly. ",
            "\u00a0The system of having section meetings was confusing ",
            "\u00a0I liked the mathematical rigor of the course. Taking Theory over MATH 222 is a great choice because the former gives one an intimate understanding of the material. It is a traditional Math course, and that was a strength for me. Others might have felt that it was not as engaging, but I believe that the material is taught well. ",
            "\u00a0The course and in class lectures were somewhat disorganized. HW help depended solely on the peer tutor. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths-- textbook was quite good, but a little convoluted at times. Definitely the best part was the peer tutor, Charlie Kenney. I liked that expectations were very clear. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses-- sometimes Prof Levit spent class time going over proofs that we wouldn't really use at all later on. Although they were interesting, I wonder if that time could have been more effectively spent on content that we would go on to use and reuse. In addition, notation was a huge issue in this class. I felt like half my confusion came from not understanding notation. However, I'm not sure to what extent this was Professor Levit's fault and to what extent this is just an issue inherent in linear algebra. ",
            "\u00a0Math 225 is a very solid introduction to proof-writing through Linear Algebra. I think that the material is presented very well in the book as it essentially starts from scratch with little assumed prior knowledge and works its way up not too quickly but effectively. ",
            "\u00a0I feel that more examples of real world application of the theory we learnt in class would make the class more engaging. Also, more study materials released by the professor and information regarding the quizzes and exams would be helpful for studying. ",
            "\u00a0Comprehensive psets and good lecturing made important concepts really sink in and flow logically from one to the next. Unable to cover all the topics toward the end on inner product and norms. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Arie is a wonderful professor, and we also had a great peer tutor. Honestly, they were the top two strengths of this course. The material is interesting, the problem sets the right level of difficulty and the right length, the textbook useful. Overall a very solid, straightforward, well-taught class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I thought we could have skipped one or two of the lengthier proofs to save a few days at the end of class for higher-level material. For instance, the proof that you can do expansion for a determinant along any row or column...I get it, it's by induction and is worth going through for that, but...maybe make us do it in section or on a problem set...I think it took ~40 minutes of class time at least.

You might have difficulty understanding the lectures and be forced to teach yourself all of the material from the book. That doesn't really count as teaching or intellectual growth. ",

            "\u00a0Conceptually, the beginning of the course is much harder because the approach is very new and the material is a little confusing but it gets more interesting towards the end. Psets are long and if you want a good grade you'll have to spend a long time at office hours but I would say it is worth taking even if you don't have to. ",
            "\u00a0No. Learned everything from the textbook. ",
            "\u00a0I mean, MATH 225 is such a core class that, yes, if you want to learn linear algebra, take 225. You get a much deeper understanding of the concepts in which so many things beyond linear algebra are based. ",
            "\u00a0Yes--the material of this class was super important and interesting! However it was necessary to teach yourself some stuff outside of class. ",
            "\u00a0I wouldn't recommend this course.  Thought the material was interesting, the lectures were very difficult to follow if you hadn't had linear algebra before.  If you do take the course, online resources and the textbook can be much more helpful than the class itself. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are interested in math. Not sure what it would offer if you were not. ",
            "\u00a0Only take it when Asher Auel is teaching it. Unfortunately, he didn't take it the semester I took it (we had a new professor), and so I didn't get anywhere near as much out of it as compared to what I've heard from others (and what I've read on coursetable). The course is fairly well-designed and gives a good treatment of all the topics in linear algebra, and as for the proofs, if you're taking 225 over 222 then you know what you're getting into. Obviously 225 is more work than 222  you'll gain the same computational skills, but you'll also learn how to think about math in a more theoretical/abstract way. I didn't get as much of that this semester, but if you take it Ashel Auel, you definitely will. Regardless, if you're majoring in anything that's remotely related to math, statistics, comp sci, or data-related, you should take linear algebra in some form, because it's absolutely crucial to those fields. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend it to CS students, because linear algebra is such a fundamental tenet of CS theory and higher level electives. It's an essential. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to another student if they are prepared to do the majority of learning and figuring out the math on their own as class time was mostly just used for getting the theorems down. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is a good beginning course in math ",
            "\u00a0For sure. This course is the gateway to higher mathematics. It teaches proof-writing, and students practice on Problem Sets. The material is interesting and inspired me to do more mathematics. ",
            "\u00a0It was quite rewarding to finally really learn how to prove something, and I noticed this way of thinking filtering into other parts of my life, informing the way I thought, spoke, and wrote. I am an engineering student who would have taken 222 except that 222 overlapped with CS 201...so I took 225 and I'm actually pretty glad I did. Proofs are kinda useless but the way of thinking that you learn from doing them is not. Linear algebra is also kinda nice because it exists in its own self-contained and internally consistent world. This class was tough but not awful. The prof was not good not bad, and psets were hard but doable, especially with the help of the amazing peer tutor, Charlie. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend Math 225 to any student considering STEM major or if he or she simply wants to be familiar with an interesting branch of mathematics. It is also excellent for proof-writing techniques. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I found lots of joy engaging in this level of mathematical analysis. MATH225 showed a glimpse into what proofs are all about and how everything in mathematics is reducible. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to anyone looking to learn linear algebra and who needs a good intro to formal math. I'm an MBB major who was interested in, but a bit apprehensive of, taking a proof-based math class. If that's you, then look no further, this is your class. Also: I don't know much about 222, the applications-based course. But I have friends who took that class and a year later don't remember what a vector space is (which is like, eg, not remembering what a derivative is in calculus). If you want to give yourself a solid lin al foundation, with which you can go out and understand all sorts of applications, and actually read/understand the papers they come from, I would suggest 225, the proof-based class.
