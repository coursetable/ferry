            "\u00a0I learned a lot about Western political philosophy. What is liberty, what is virtue, what roles do property and contracts play in liberty, how is a stable state created? What is its theoretical foundations? and things of that nature. I have a much better understanding now of the evolution of political theory from Aristotle to modern conservatives and I can see with clarity how capitalism played a major role in modern thought. I am a better critical reader, and I hope a better citizen thanks to this class. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to do a closer read of many famous political thinkers; I broadened my knowledge of philosophical thought; and I grew as a thinker.  I learned to better articulate my theories and how to criticize some of the greatest philosophers of all time. ",
            "\u00a0learned a lot of cool things about thinkers i hadn't read before like hayek, schumpeter, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Classics of EP&E introduced me to a variety of different political philosophies. It also taught me how to look at the three fields in EP&E are connected while giving me some insight into how they are discussed at an abstract level. ",
            "\u00a0This course allowed me to develop a greater understanding of the intersections between ethics, politics, and economics in moral philosophical discourse; and how this discourse can be used in our ongoing social and political contexts. ",
            "\u00a0This course introduces me to philosophy and pushes to me think deeper and more critically. A great class that reviews many great philosophers in a chronological order. ",

            "\u00a0The Professor, Boris Kapustin, was a major strength of this course. It's easy for political philosophy to become dry (especially right after lunch), but his knowledge and dramatic delivery keeps people engaged.\r\n\r\nI know that it's natural for a course of this type to have a large amount of reading. Still, over 100 pages of political philosophy a week can be difficult to get through. I think 80 is more realistic for what students can actually manage, simply because readings of this type can take as much as an hour for 10-20 pages the first time through. \r\n\r\nI also think because the material is so dense, having reading responses would be a good simply to push everyone to read. Sometimes I couldn't tell if my classmates didn't understand the material (plausible) or simply hadn't read it (equally plausible). Giving guiding questions prior to reading from a particular author could also serve the role of reading responses by helping students condense and distill what they had learned. ",
            "\u00a0Great seminar. Kupustin is a very animated lecturer.  The material that we cover in this class is incredibly dense and difficult, but he does his best to help us analyze the ideas presented by the great philosophers covered in the course.  Work-load wise, I think this class was very well-paced.  It allowed us room to explore with different thoughts and paper topics before needing to create the midterm and final.  The midterm was very well-structured to make us deeply engage with the texts we had covered up to that point, and the final was a great way to allow us to be more creative and choose to engage more deeply with philosophers that we especially connected with. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: strong reading list, good professor, gives you the grounding you need. ",
            "\u00a0This is an awesome course. I don't know how it could be improved if at all. ",
            "\u00a0This course is hugely benefitted by a professor who is passionate about the subject material. However, this course could have been better had it not been held on one day out of the week, since we did not have sufficient time to cover all of our readings. ",
            "\u00a0Great discussions and interactive atmosphere. Overall a great class. ",
            "\u00a0The greatesr strength of this class is by far Professor Kapustin. Hes brilliant, kind, and enaguar and made every class wonderful and thought provoking. The weakness of this clas was that it felt like there may have been one too many authors. While all of the reading selections were great, we sometimes had to rush through some authors (especially at the end). ",
            "\u00a0Professor Kapustin is an amazing professor that has a lot of knowledge about the subjects and can talk endlessly and enthusiastically about them in a way that is very compelling. However, because of the way the class functioned (primarily him asking us to tell him what thinkers thought or said about an issue), there was a lot of dead time where people kinda sat in silence for thirty seconds before flipping through their books to find highlighted passages. I think having more lecture time from Professor Kapustin could cut down on this and keep some of the dead air out of the class; though I appreciate him trying to keep us more active, I don't think it was as successful as he'd hoped. Also, this is a little beside the point, but he said in the syllabus he'd assign 60 to 80 pages of reading and I'm pretty sure most of the classes were closer to twice that because of how the course-pack is two pages scanned onto a single page; the sheer amount of material made it difficult to digest and we were consistently one class behind throughout the semester. ",

            "\u00a0Yes! This was a good second political philosophy course for me. If it had been my first, the diversity of thinkers and the amount of reading and the limited chance for questions (it's only once a week) would have been difficult. Still, I recommend this course for anyone who is interested in understanding the theories of influential thinkers who question political systems, society, the best formation of the government and the role of people. This class will give you an idea of how to address questions like What is democracy? and Why is it good? Or what is virtue to Aristotle? If you are interested in learning about these major concepts (which however irrelevant they might seem to today's politics in fact pervaded every aspect of politics). There is a significant amount of reading each week and it will take you a while to do, but don't short change yourself by not reading! This is a very traditional course (weekly readings and lectures, and two essays). If you don't do the readings you will miss half the value of the class. You should think of the bulk of the class as happening outside of the classroom. I thought of it as an opportunity to get credit for reading philosophers I had always wanted to with the bonus of getting a professional to explain the texts! ",
            "\u00a0This is a very challenging course.  Kapustin challenges you to engage with complex texts, and there are no shortcuts when it comes to understanding the intricate works produced by these philosophers.  This is a requirement for EPE majors, but if you have a strong inclination towards/want to expand your knowledge in philosophical thinkers, then this may be a good course for you.  It is largely based on engaging with the texts and understanding a broad range of theories set forth by some of the greatest philosophical thinkers to ever live. ",
            "\u00a0yes, but be aware that professor kapustin tends to have more lecture-type seminars, so if you want a more discussion-based one, you might want to shoot for another professor. that being said, his lectures are excellent and he clearly knows what he's talking about. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Taking this class with Professor Kapustin is a must. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to a student who either wants to major in EP&E or is familiar with other works of moral philosophy and would like to dig deeper. ",
            "\u00a0I would totally recommend this class to anyone. This course serves as a survey course that discuss many great philosophers in great details and the small seminar-style classroom is very inclusive. ",
            "\u00a0If you are an EP&E student, I think it was a good class given it's a requirement. I wouldn't take the class unless you have a lot of free time during a semester to spend more thought on the reading. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend the course to anyone who is interested in political philosophy. The course gives you a foundation of knowledge to then tackle higher level classes "
