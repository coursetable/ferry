A lot of the teaching material is proprietary, which isn't just cool but highlights how unique an opportunity this class is.\r\n\r\nSkills: Each week of homework alternated in its focus: one week on financial modeling and one week on legal analysis. To put it simply, we learned how to build project finance models in Excel and how to read challenging legal documents outlining the terms and conditions of a real-world wind project. These skills are not specific to renewable energy, and I'm certain they will follow me to my future work. \r\n\r\nInsights: I would say the biggest gains from this course came from getting to observe the care, professionalism, and expertise that Professor Gross brought to the class.

I also would have liked more best practices for laying out models, since I wouldn't really know where to start on a model I have to build from scratch. We started with a template for operations, which was great, but never discussed the ways in which the balance sheet template was different. Perhaps this could be a TA session. \r\n\r\nI would prefer the optional HW #10 be due after the basic model. I wanted to do a model that was more advanced than the basic model but less advanced than the enhanced model, and maybe HW #10 could be structured a little differently (and timed differently) to be complementary to the basic model. Students could do three levels of cumulative skill-building final projects: the basic model, or basic + HW 10, or enhanced. ",

The course balanced 'theory' with practical skills and contextualized materials in a compelling way. I really enjoyed the final portion of the course dedicated to 'beyond project finance' and would appreciate more time or supplemental materials devoted to applying project finance models in other arenas. ",

As an Econ student, I did not have much knowledge of accounting standards and corporate-sounding documents, or even energy markets for that matter. However, I know that lots of other students had either one of both of those skill sets. The way Prof Dan structured this class meant that people like me were able to not only keep up with, but also compete with the students who had pre-existing knowledge of these concepts.\r\nI found the pace of the class perfect for me, but I respect that some may have found it slow because they knew certain things beforehand.\r\n\r\nI wish we could have more classes with Prof Dan. I believe that if he could teach this class twice a week or teach another course as well students would benefit so much, because he is a really good teacher. ",

Daniel is exceptional as a subject matter expert and teacher alike. I feel that I have an incredibly concrete skill that is specific to renewable energy but can also be applied to other areas. ",

            "\u00a0No major weaknesses with the course -- the TAs were incredible, Dan was great. I spoke to Dan about how some topics in energy feel a little redundant in terms of the overall curriculum (i.e. you talk about certain things in a few classes and it is better to have them build) but most of things feel reinforcing here, especially with Financing Green Tech.\r\n\r\nNo weaknesses -- just a lot of work -- so no complaints. Maybe on the final model a little more help on some of the newer topics (i.e. back leverage) but other than that -- all good. ",
            "\u00a0My only suggestions for improvement is to provide the slides on periodicity earlier in the semester (not necessarily including it in lecture or recitation that early, but just having the explanatory slides). I remember wanting to get started on the final enhanced model during spring break, but having absolutely no idea how to even set up the time periods. ",
            "\u00a0The course could be improved by providing templates for the models. It is likely that in the working world a firm will have a template to work from. If not, it would be helpful to have a professional template from this class to use.

            "\u00a0Only suggestion would be for online mid-semester feedback through something like Feedback Box (www.thefeedbackbox.com). It seems like a lot of labor, energy and human resources to administer paper surveys.  Feedback box can be used throughout the semester as well. So students could submit anonymous feedback to their professors any time throughout the course. ",

The homework assignments were quite challenging, but really important to understand and master. I valued using real-world documents and projects for our assignments. \r\n\r\nAs for weaknesses, I felt that the group Investor Memo could have been a more effective project. A different group project I might recommend would be to have students think about \"outside the box\" options where project finance could be applied to other sustainability challenges (such as the African streetlight example and Elle and Vince's proposal, which we covered in our make-up session). Even though I am energy-focused, this type of project would have given non-energy students an opportunity to begin flesh out the ways in which project finance could apply back to their areas of focus/interest. \r\n\r\nThe final model project seemed to have a few glitches, which I think could be ironed out. Several updates to the final model assignment were made in the final weeks, as students were already working on the model, and coming across issues/errors. I think this is probably inevitable for such a complex project, but some elements could definitely be tightened up for next year. ",

I think the instructor can raise the bar higher here, and provide detailed tutorials in excel wherever applicable. ",

            "\u00a0Well taught and organized. Clear assignments with concrete objectives. I especially liked the \"in the news\" class openers. I know the class is about finance, but I wish it was less about excel and more about how to analyze the value of a prospective renewable energy project. Those two objectives may be similar, but if excel were to fall out of favor in the next 10-20 years, I might have trouble connecting the class ideas to other software given that the class focused so heavily on excel. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - Dan Gross is a freakin' all-star. Lectures are impeccably constructed and delivered, homeworks are challenging but achievable, TA recitations and office hours are very helpful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - a 3-hr lecture on a Monday is killer. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths\r\n- Very good foundation in financial modeling. Funny to see an exodus of MBAs leaving SOM every Monday, going to another school to learn how to do financial modeling. \r\n- Though im not planning on working in renewable energy, really appreciated the combination of project finance + renewable energy. Good to apply the skill set to a worthwhile industry.\r\n- Very much appreciated the pragmatism of the class. Real world topics. \r\n- 3 hour class duration is rough. Can it be 2 hours?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n - I chose to do the advanced model and am happy I did. It was a good level of challenge, but the amount of time and exercises required for the financial model were much too much. When there are dozens of students crowding around the TAs during every office hours, something is off. It seems TAs should be a back-up support if needed, not heavily leaned on by dozens of students.  It took an extraordinary amount of time. I think the level of challenge was good, but there should be fewer components so that it can be completed in a more reasonable time frame. \r\n- Some of the material covered in the later classes was less interesting. \r\n- Didnt find the guest lecture to be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: clear curriculum, gets you financial modelling skills, classes well structured and thoughtful\r\nWeakness: professor is self indulgent, professor complains about taking feedback or boasts about it, professor lays out grades for each assignment as if that would be helpful for everyone in the room, professor made some inappropriate comments about mental health or gender, assignments expect level of knowledge not gone over in class or prerequired, recitation sessions basically make the class five hours a week instead of three, feedback from the TAs also expected a certain level of knowledge just to understand the feedback ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Very clear teaching, assignments that build on one another, sensible structure, great mix of disciplines, very practically focused, accessible to a variety of backgrounds and skill levels\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Three-hour lectures tended to drag (switching between various topics was helpful), guest lecturers were a disappointment (hard to compare to Dan in terms of clarity and teaching ability) ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of the class include the thorough instruction from Dan Gross and the skills gained by building a dynamic financial model on Excel. The assignment I wasn't a huge fan of was the group investment memo. This seemed like a strange assignment to work on over spring break, and I felt like it took time away from building my final model without adding too much value to the class. Otherwise this class was fantastic! ",
            "\u00a0Daniel Gross is an incredible lecturer. He makes dry material engaging and puts together a great group of TAs to help you understand material outside of the classroom. "
