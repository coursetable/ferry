            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the history of architecture that i did not previously know ",
            "\u00a0This was definitely not your \"traditional\" Hist of Arch I class. Kyle was very conscious of this. A lot of performance. The results were mixed. He's definitely invested in the class however. An engaging lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0new ways to contextualize what it means to talk about architecture. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how not only about architectural history, but about how to think of what architectural history even means, and how it is framed in the present. ",
            "\u00a0This course has provoked us to think of architecture through a different lens. Professor Dugdale has woven themes such as material, time, but also critical historicism within the conventional analysis of buildings. ",
            "\u00a0A better grasp of architectural history. ",
            "\u00a0The class is definitely just as it is outlined in the syllabus, giving a detailed introduction to architectural styles from the beginning (a contentious topic) to the baroque. I gained a lot of research experience from working on the final project (a paper on a topic of your choosing). ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think about and analyze the architecture of antiquity to baroque in a contemporary context. I learned different to recognize and understand buildings throughout the world, as well as their importance to the greater scheme of architecture. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a thorough background on the history of ancient architecture. I learned how to think about architecture as not just a structure but as the people who build and use it and the influence it has on its surroundings. ",
            "\u00a0This is an art history course at Yale unlike any other. There is much more of a focus on concepts, rather than specific details. The most important thing you learn in this course is that architecture is not what you think it is. This course isn't about finding a definition for architecture, but more learning to think architecturally. There is an architecture of everything. I think overall, I have an understanding of many different points and places in architectural history, which is what you would expect from a survey course. ",
            "\u00a0I got a great overview of architecture, past and present, from around the world. I expanded my vocabulary, tested my analytical skills as they applied to building design, and gained a huge appreciation for the history of the buildings around me. "

            "\u00a0I loved the way this course was taught, but wondered whether it adequately addressed the issues of whiteness within the field of architecture. ",
            "\u00a0It's just hard to cover all of that time frame within one semester. ",
            "\u00a0This course offered an atypical and interesting overview of architecture from the beginning of history through the 18th century. The material was presented each week in a cohesive and interesting framework, often citing modern or more relatable examples to make old precedents more accessible. Prof. Dugdale tried to break away from the traditional western centric cannon while still conveying the information architecture students will me expected to know. This was not always a successful strategy but the attempt was appreciated and prompted many good section conversations about the state of the architectural field and how we discuss history. The greatest weakness of the course was the Nuttgens textbook, which is around 35 years old and incredibly biased, and did not seem to provide much insight. ",
            "\u00a0This course was strong through its dynamic approach to studying historical structures. It would have been nice to have more assignments throughout the class. ",
            "\u00a0The course was good, but should be less Western-centric. The Nuttgens textbook was subtly but consistently racist and definitely Western-centric, and doesn't do justice to the breadth of architectural history. ",
            "\u00a0Kyles lectures were sometimes hard to follow (this is definitely not a cut-and-dry information course) but the ways he connected older styles and buildings to more contemporary topics (e.g. discussing the Ziggurat of Ur in relation to photos of the U.S. military there) was really interesting. ",
            "\u00a0The main strengths are the lectures which are entertaining and fascinating. I also enjoyed many of the readings. Section was sometimes unproductive but at other times led to interesting discussions. One of the weaknesses was the textbook, which was somewhat antiquated. I think many of the people in my section wished we read something more engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Great course. Never change. ",
            "\u00a0I think it's really hard to fit centuries of architectural development into one semester, especially on a global scale. This is something we struggled with the whole semester, trying to fit everything in and also trying to not favor one subject over another. Each lecture could have had a whole semester dedicated to the topic. I don't know if there's any real solution for this, though. I think one weakness is the midterm preparation. The different sections were being prepared differently, which made it difficult to know what to study and what the format of the exam would be. I'm a bit unsure if an exam is the best midterm assessment. It kind of divided the semester weirdly because after the midterm things became less chronological and more difficult to follow as a whole. It was also difficult to study the lectures for an exam format. I think a great strength of the class is the final paper and how open the brief was was. Having the rough draft due before Thanksgiving break was initially frustrating, but it really allowed me to further explore and polish off my ideas. I felt like I got a lot more research and exploration done because of that timeline. Because of that timeline, though, I think the class could have given more of an introduction/explanation of architectural writing because I find that it is very different from other research essays. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the lectures and the marvelous TAs and the way the course lets you explore a topic of your choice, not too much memorization, rather a great appreciation for the function, aesthetic, design and history. "

            "\u00a0Yes, if you're into the topic, it was a good course to take. Not very hard, but interesting and worth the time and effort associated with the course ",
            "\u00a0I don't know. Some very interesting revelations throughout, but I'm not sure I loved Kyle's teaching style. What he finds interesting and what I find interesting about architecture might just be different. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone interested in architectural history, baring in mind that to enjoy this class you need to be willing to go on an intellectual journey with Kyle. If you are hoping for a by the book survey course, don't take this. But if you are willing to just hear what Professor Dugdale is saying and really think about it, you will find this class rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course is a good introduction not only for architecture majors but also for students in other fields. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend this course if you're in the major or are genuinely interested in architecture history. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Great class, the workload is totally manageable (just readings and a discussion question due for section each week, one midterm with slide recognition / discussion and one final 2000-word paper that is fun to work on). ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to any student who wants to learn about architecture. This course isn't really memorizing buildings and styles and dates, but more of a broad overview of history of architecture 1. I enjoyed it and also wasn't very stressed by it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It was engaging and informative. It helped me grow as a student. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I think this is a really interesting subject matter taught in an energetic way. This course takes you all over the world over the centuries and lets you explore and develop your own insights. I'm always excited to share the facts I learned. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Loved the professor, always enjoyed lecture, and came away with a great base in architecture (as well as a taste for more architecture classes) "
