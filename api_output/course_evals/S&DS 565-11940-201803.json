The homework were also very relevant to the course, and the textbook particularly useful and well suited to work on R. Sometimes the homework were challenging and I felt that the TA hours were not always helpful. I spent a lot of time trying to debug the code, but I guess that's a part everyone has to go through to learn how to code well. But asking questions on piazza was a nice way to get help. I did wish the grading was a bit fairer, I sometimes didn't understand why I got some points taken off (the questions in the homework were sometimes not explicit enough). That was a hard courses but I felt like I progressed a lot. It was nice to be able to do some data analysis  in the homework, before doing some machine learning algorithms on it. ",

It would have been very helpful to have a textbook or detailed set of notes to read that would thoroughly explain the material. Instead, I usually had to google around for explanations of different course concepts, with varying success. I think that the problem sets had value but were too expansive and lengthy. Also, I came into the class with significant experience with R, and yet even I found that too much valuable time was spent messing around with getting data into the right format and wading through package documentation. To maximize learning, just tell students exactly which packages to use, how to get the data in the right format, etc. There will be time later in internships and jobs for learning R the slow way.\r\n\r\nIf possible, future students may find it interesting to hear from a machine learning ethics expert in a guest lecture.
