            "\u00a0Yoruba vocabulary, grammar and culture. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about Nigerian culture. As an american I didn't know much about this subject beforehand. Learning about a new lifestyle thought me new ways of thinking and processing data.  I learned how to speak Yoruba at a basic level and communicate to native speakers. Im not sure where I will use this skill in my life but Im sure it will come in handy. I might end up traveling to Nigeria and trying my new skills out and seeing how I perform. This subject was a great opportunity for me to come outside of my comfort zone and try something completely new. This is what separates Yale from other schools the ability to learn a subject many people don't know about. I really enjoyed this subject and I can't wait to continue taking the next level of this subject next year. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read and write Yoruba at a beginner level. I fell confident in a simple conversation with a Yoruba individual. There aren't that many grammer conventions so learning the language revolves around vocabulary and speaking conventions. I learned a bit of Yoruba culture and it compares to American culture. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the basics for Yoruba language. The curriculum contained a wide variety of vocabulary along with structuring sentences and other grammatical skills. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a ton about the language. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to create sentences and speak in Yoruba at a beginner level. ",

        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The course is structured to give a good/in depth intro to Yoruba. The professor works hard to make sure everyone is up to speed in the class so that the class can learn and improve as a whole. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course has a very loose curriculum and schedule. This is good because we are given time to learn new topics fully. However, sometimes we are given too much time. Moreoever, we focus on specific portions and overlook other ideas that seem important. I don't think the grammer conventions are taught in a sequential, intentional manner. It can seem a little random which the class to be a little scattered. I think the class does really well in making sure the information is taken in well. We are given many opportunities to speak which make us more confident about the use of the language. We are able to engage with the language in multiple ways. ",
            "\u00a0Strong repetition to ensure we practice the material and learn it. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: improves Yoruba writing and grammar skills\r\nWeaknesses: a big amount of workload "

            "\u00a0If you're interested in learning yourba, yes. if you want an enjoyable language class, yes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would definitely recommend this class to another student. As mentioned earlier Yale is a very unique school, one I am very fortunate to be apart of. It offers classes from a wide range of topics and ones that may challenge you in a way you may not have thought before. Yoruba is definitely a unique course one I may not have been able to take if I would have went to a state school or one other than Yale. Students like myself should take classes they wouldn't have thought of because it opens them up to a new culture. I would have never have thought I would be able to speak a Nigerian language, but I looked at the bluebook and thought this would be interesting. The subject along with the instructor were great and if i had to take L1 again I definitely would. I am continuing this language next semester. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course because it broadens your educational base. It is able to familiarize you with a portion of the world that represents such a significant portion of Yale and America, but is often overlooked. Whenever, I mentioned the language I was taking, many people looked at me with confusion and asked the same \"dumb\" questions that people often ask about Africa and Nigeria. I think it would be cool to put more emphasis on these languages (and other \"gut languages) to exihibit their importance and effect on our world. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Professor Adesola is phenomenal and really cares about his students. This is a very interesting language and isn't the typical language students take. Classmates in the class learn the material together and look out for one another. It is a great class that I'd recommend to anyone. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, take Yoruba! Professor Adesola is hilarious and is dedicated to helping his students get better with the language everyday. ",
            "\u00a0Yes because it teaches you about the culture and language of the Yoruba people ",
            "\u00a0Yes, great basic level teaching "
