            "\u00a0Overall, this class was an insightful experience in that I learned about the thought processes driving totalitarianism. I feel as though that I now have a very strong grasp of how Communists and Fascists view the trends of history and the world. ",
            "\u00a0This was the first intellectual history class. It taught me much about analyzing the growth, development, and interaction of ideas and philosophies. Reading memoirs also helped me see the salience of these seemingly obscure ideas in the lives of so many real people. I learned how to look at the influence of an ideology on a personal and national scale. ",
            "\u00a0In this class, I got a chance to read about many topics that have been bothering me for the last year. I learned the theory behind totalitarian movements. I came to recognize what moves the masses, who possesses those characteristics that move the masses, what is to be done. \r\nThe readings we made for the class helped me improve on my philosophical and historical background. ",
            "\u00a0I developed my ability to talk philosophically about works of writing that were not inherently philosophical like memoirs and novels. I also learned a great deal more about philosophy in general than I knew coming into the class. I feel like my ability to discuss in a group has also improved. ",
            "\u00a0Though I came to this course to find answers, I only found more questions, but in the best way possible. Instead of learning how to prevent states from descending into totalitarianism, which is what I was expecting to discover, this course was more like a story that fostered an understanding of the experience of totalitarianism from a human as well as a theoretical perspective. The works we read were inextricably intertwined with complex and fascinating moral issues that caused me to deconstruct my perspective on morality, especially in extreme situations where what is right and what is wrong dont operate based on traditional guidelines. Though this course has left me even more confused as to what I want to study (its taught me how hopelessly varied and connected these big issues and their causes  are), I now feel well versed in major theories on totalitarianism (Arendt) and the reasoning underlying many totalitarian regimes (Hegel, Marx, Lenin), and have the tools and vocabulary to analyze similar phenomena in our contemporary world. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a broad understanding of the foundations of totalitarian philosophy beginning with Hegel, which was the most challenging, but if you're able to push through, this was the most rewarding class I took this semester at Yale. It is a great introduction to managing complex readings but with not a lot of pressure. This class will challenge you, but regardless of your grade, it is definitely worth it. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a great base in philosophy, specifically political philosophy, and the thought processes and modes of thinking that accompany evaluating that philosophy. I also feel I am a better writer because of it and can now write longer form papers. "

            "\u00a0This class would often diverge from more relevant discussions or even begin with discussions on non-historical topics; in fact, much of those discussions would pertain to contemporary American politics and President Donald J. Trump. While I am in no way a Trump supporter, I felt as though the teacher was engendering very biased seminars. I remember how the teacher spent several days on explaining how Donald Trump is essentially the next Adolf Hitler or perhaps could become the next Hitler; I remember how I felt very uncomfortable when the professor mentioned how she had acquaintances that committed suicide due to the election of Donald Trump. Suicide is a very sensitive topic to me that I did not imagine the teacher to talk about in such a partisan manner. ",
            "\u00a0The opportunity to be in a seminar with such an accomplished and engaging professor as Marci Shore is one that every student should try to seek. I didn't realize how lucky I was to be in a first-year with her until she consistently opened my eyes to new perspectives and understandings of history in the first few classes. The greatest strength was the ability to discuss the readings personally with her and ten other students. A course like this needs dialogue, and the conversations require a focus uncommon to many other classes, but they also involve a reward hard to find elsewhere. The class requires a lot of reading, and sometimes the schedule didn't work out perfectly; sometimes shorter sections were assigned over breaks while longer ones came in the couple days between classes. But this wasn't a major detriment and served the course as a whole, because the order of the readings matter. ",
            "\u00a0Everything we learned in this class was relevant to our daily lives. The strength of this class is definitely the quality of the texts and of course, Marci Shore. At the beginning of the term, we set out to understand totalitarian philosophy in Central Europe so that we can recognize when another totalitarian regime is being constructed and hopefully stop it. This course did just that. \r\n\r\nHaving only 75 minutes to discuss each reading was unfortunate. Some readings, such as Dostoevsky's \"The Grand Inquisitor\" has so much material that it simply deserves more discussion time than one class. One way to improve this could be to play with the time allowed for the texts to be discussed. This may be by reducing the readings, and although I enjoyed all of the readings in this class, I feel like we should choose quality over quantity. We should try to get as much as we can from the readings we do. ",
            "\u00a0I honestly cannot think of any weaknesses of this course. It was my favorite course this semester. ",
            "\u00a0I really had no problem with this course. Some of the readings should have been a bit more strategically spaced in my opinion (ie assigning a book over October break instead of in the two days after, when all we read for break was a short essay), but many of my dilemmas with the pacing of the course could have been solved by better time management. I loved the variety of the readings (essays, memoirs, novels, pamphlets) and thought it was an excellent mix of primary and secondary sources, of raw evidence and analysis. The discussion format was very helpful, and the lack of constant evaluations kept me especially engaged in the course because it gave me the opportunity to tap into my own intrinsic interest and motivation. It was incredible to interact with Professor Shore and my classmates on such a close and casual basis, which was afforded by the small size of the class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Shore is incredible and it's wonderful to be in a class with her\r\nWeakness: You aren't allowed to use computers, so if you're a low income student like me, it will be challenging to print out all of the readings so I felt a little behind the rest of the students not bringing them to class. "

            "\u00a0I would only recommend this course to students who are willing to read emotionally disturbing texts and are able to handle the teacher's slanted political views. Also, I should mention that this course contains a lot of reading and writing assignments; make sure you can keep up with the pace of the work. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely!!!!! This is the best class I have taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this course. It provides you the chance to read and think about huge historical texts and ideas in the company of diverse perspectives and the expertise of Professor Shore. It requires a fair amount of reading, but not so much more than most classes. I came into Yale undecided as a major, but after taking this class I'm planning on pursuing a degree in history. The power of the ideas and the stories you read in this class contain a great degree of importance even so many years after they first occurred. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would -and I have been since the beginning of the term. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was a great experience overall. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student who is comfortable grappling with intense moral questions that truly have no satisfying answer, to a big-picture thinker who enjoys close reading and enjoys approaching history from both an analytical and personal lens. That being said, I honestly think anyone who is patient enough with the readings and discussion could get something valuable out of this course. ",
            "\u00a0TAKE THIS CLASS. Absolutely. I bonded with the kids in this class more than any other and gained a great understanding of intellectual history and philosophy. Marci Shore is amazing. ",
            "\u00a0Most definitely. It's timely and informative and exciting. "
