            "\u00a0The topic of this course and the readings provided were fascinating and incredibly topical. I really appreciated the diverse perspectives with which we approached ideas around truth/post-truth -- from philosophy, to anthropology, to current events. We were very lucky to have a class that included international students who were able to share their perspectives and experiences. \r\n\r\nOur class discussions and course learning could be strengthened by more direction and framing from the instructor. While the readings were always interesting enough to spark discussion, and our class discussions were strong on the whole, it could be useful to have the discussion be further directed and framed with key themes/points to take away from the class. The takeaways were not entirely clear from our discussions alone. \r\n\r\nThe reading load was heavier than other courses I've taken at Yale, and it was helpful for the discussion when the instructor flagged key readings to be sure to complete so that we could all engage on those texts.
