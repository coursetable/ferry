We were able to have in-depth conversations critiquing the construction of specific diseases and health disparities. This was an especially relevant insight as racial health disparities are now a popular term within the biomedical/medical fields. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: I liked the way that sections of the readings were divided up week by week, allowing us to focus on the change over time in a certain disease or pathology. \r\nWeaknesses: I think the timeline could be modified, so that it focuses only on broader, more important dates. I also think that if we generated it together in class, it would be more useful for everybody's understanding of the topic. I would have liked having a rough draft of the paper do, so that we could feedback -- I think a peer review could have been useful. ",
            "\u00a0I liked many of the readings. \r\nThe method that we used to create the timeline was not very helpful, I did not find myself going back to review it during other weeks. \r\nI think more emphasis could be put on creating an argument surrounding a primary source throughout the semester. (like we had to do for the final paper) "

            "\u00a0At times in this class it felt difficult to have an opinion that deviated (even slightly) from the majority. About halfway through the semester, I observed that over half of the class had created a group message that excluded the two white students. In this group, students proceeded to comment negatively on what one of the excluded students had said. The comments consisted of lmfao get out, and she did not just say that, insinuating that the student didnt have the right to comment (despite her statement being well intentioned AND well founded from the reading).  Issues in healthcare were decidedly reduced to a single cause, and there was really no way to push the discussion into talking about other problems that might be compounding the original one. Though the topics were relevant and interesting, and Professor Abedin is an incredible instructor, I believe that the climate often resulted in a stagnation in progress/ conversation. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I learned a lot in this course, and enjoyed the discussions. It has changed the way I think about the topic of racial difference in disease. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you have ever wondered about racial health disparities and want to unpack it critically, take this class. You learn a lot about the history of diseases, how these health disparities were utilized, and more. "
