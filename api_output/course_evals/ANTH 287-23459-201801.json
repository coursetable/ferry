            "\u00a0I developed so many skills in this class including those of analyzing ethnographic and anthropological texts and forming my own ideas surrounding analyses. Additionally, this class was so influential to my current view of Japan and its hidden minorities. ",
            "\u00a0Through the lens of minorities in Japan, we discussed various ways in which majorities and minorities are constructed, various dimensions in which people can be considered minorities, and the types of discrimination and experiences that minorities go through. These discussions shed light on interesting aspects of Japanese society that are often not discussed by Japanese people themselves; however, the topics are readily applicable to thinking about how minorities/majorities and marginalization operate in societies closer to home. ",
            "\u00a0The present situation of minorities in Japan. Who are they? How are they living? Why are they regarded as minorities? What are their problems? How can we find the problems and how shall we approach them? "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Sometimes I had to balance the readings with other work for other classes and I wouldn't be able to read with the level of engagement I wanted to and as a result some of my responses were weak.\r\nI love how the class was organized by having a new minority group to study each week, and the readings and films were all relevant and peaked my interest. I had no problem being motivated to do work for this class. ",
            "\u00a0I really loved the readings and content covered in the course. The format of the course was also good; there was a good balance between the professor lecturing and the class discussing issues related to the reading. Professor Lebaron von Baeyer is great in both respects; she helped along and contributed to our discussion when necessary, and was also extremely knowledgable and articulate about the course content. \r\n\r\nIf there was anything to improve, it may be nice to have more small writing assignments to supplement the other coursework. But this is just something to consider rather than a concrete suggestion for improvement. ",
            "\u00a0Well-chosen reading assignments, intelligible lectures and discussions, and the professor's profound feedbacks that allowed everone to figure out how diverse Japan is and what structural violence is hidden in the \"seemingly homogeneous\" country. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes! Your view of Japan will change so drastically and it was so intriguing to see the ways in which Japan treats its minorities both historically and presently. It is also very interesting how we often see Japan as homogenous despite the many marginalized groups and how this belief is upheld through time. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would strongly recommend this course especially to those interested in understanding more about ethnicity/race/anthropology, and especially those interested in Japan. Across the board, the course was strong in terms of presentation, content, readings, and the professor was excellent. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely. Few people know that there are minorities in Japan and this course is almost the only place to think about minority issues in Japan. What you learn throughout this course is not limited to Japan. You can improve your sensitivity to discover hidden tiny suppressions in society, and you can cultivate your potentiality to become a change maker in your society. "
