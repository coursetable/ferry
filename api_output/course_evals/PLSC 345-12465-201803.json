            "\u00a0Overview of many different research designs! Prof. Hierro helped us cover macro-level understandings of research terminology and the processes of developing a research question. ",
            "\u00a0From this course, I definitely gained a greater appreciation for the qualitative methodologies associated with academic research. Given Professor Hierro's background, I think she provided a legitimate source of knowledge and passion regarding the subjects presented in this course. I also liked the substantive readings which were very stimulating. ",

            "\u00a0I loved the breadth that was covered in this course. I think that one thing that could be improved was transparency of expectations. I felt that sometimes I didn't quite understand the logistics of the course and what Prof. Hierro wanted from us in assignments. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course was great in engaging you with material through seminar discussions, book readings and substantive readings. I think to further cement some of the principles covered in class, more hands-on projects or quizzes would help reiterate material. ",

            "\u00a0This. Should. Be. Mandatory.\r\n\r\nEvery PLSC student *needs to* know the material that we cover in this course, particularly given we are supposed to be able to conduct original research for our theses! Prof. Hierro walks through how to design research questions and the types of designs available that would be best suited to answering our questions. You will walk away at the end of the course with a fully-fleshed out proposal and an understanding of how to read/critique other papers. Also, Prof. Hierro is essentially the most supportive professor one could have, and she is responsive to student feedback throughout the course. TAKE THIS!! ",
            "\u00a0I think this course if a great introductory course for those who are not as familiar with quantitative research design. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this class for someone who is writing/will write their senior essay. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are looking to gain the fundementals of research methods in political science "
