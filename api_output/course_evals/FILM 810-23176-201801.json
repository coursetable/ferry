            "\u00a0The course enabled me to develop the necessary skills to work with vernacular (as well as other types of) photography within an academic discussion. Furthermore, it allowed me to gain the necessary set of vocabulary to speak about the material discussed in an adequate manner and encouraged me to go develop my own ideas for future research. In addition, by addressing a broad variety of academic perspectives the course provided a useful set of resources that can be a great starting point for my own future research within the field of vernacular photography. A huge amount of different photographic works in combination with an introduction into the variety of resources (Art Gallery, etc.) our University has to offer made this class an interesting and inspiring experience that I will hold on to and has enriched time here at Yale.

            "\u00a0The class offered a great insight into a broad variety of photographic works as well as academic perspectives. The discussions with the guest professors in class were refreshing and a nice addition to the regular classes. The final project allowed to follow ones own individual interests and despite its challenging nature was a great experience as it forced me to rely on my own skills and interests and enabled me to dive deeper into a subject I am interested in. Sometimes the overall organization of the class could have been a little bit better, but besides that the class was enriching in any way possible. "

            "\u00a0The class was a great experience and I definitely would recommend this class to other students. The selected readings were really interesting, the class discussions was fruitful and the opportunity to work on your own individual topic for your final project was great too. "
