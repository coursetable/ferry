            "\u00a0This course is great if you want to dig very deep into a client project. Strengths include class time being set aside for groups to meet with the professor and get things done and a solid structure and set of projects. The professor has a thought-out way of structuring the class so you can get everything you need to done and organized. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, the course had a very important and meaningful subject matter with potentially significant implications for the communities we were working with. My key problem with the course was the lack of clarity around the use of our findings afterwards. Additionally, I think that the amount of time given to accomplish the tasks required was not adequate or realistic, in order to produce results that would be meaningful to the community thus creating a potentially detrimental situation for the community (i.e. we got 'hopes up' and used their time but without a sufficient promise or possibility of reward or progress). ",
            "\u00a0My main recommendation for this course is that it should be extended into a year-long practicum, and/or be a 4-credit course for FES students. The workload was significantly higher than any of my other courses -- which I think was necessary and important given the community-based projects, but it would have been nice to take on a lighter workload elsewhere this semester and/or spread the work out over a year to manage and to meet expectations, particularly of external community partners. \r\n\r\nGiven the partnership with the Yale Environmental Justice Clinic, clearer expectations, roles and collaboration could have been set at the beginning to ensure that public health practicum students understand exactly what their brief is and how it fits into broader goals of ELC. \r\n\r\nThe opportunity to work on such pressing and challenging issues was an absolute strength of the class. I learned so much from our case study, and felt a real sense of responsibility and urgency knowing that our research was not merely theoretical but could have real-world implications. I really liked working with my group members and appreciated that we were from diverse backgrounds and schools. ",
            "\u00a0This was by far the most valuable experience I have had so far at Yale. The workload was much heavier than initially described but was very fulfilling. ",
            "\u00a0The course is a great opportunity to dive into a project that matters. But with great opportunity comes great responsibility - this course took significant work and definitely added to my stress levels. I think it could be improved by limiting the scope of the projects a little to make it more feasible for a small team of students to complete over a semester. ",
            "\u00a0This course provides an excellent opportunity to work with public health practitioners on projects of climate and health relevance. The workload is significant, but manageable provided that the group effectively communicates and assigns responsibilities. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this course was a great way for students to get involved with a project outside of the Yale sphere and really work in a group team. I really liked that my particular project (PO boat) had a final report that would actually be useful to governing bodies, such as the US Fish and Wildlife Service and SOBA. It was really good to know that there would be a use for the research we had completed. Other projects, however, sometimes seemed to lack a reporting scheme (such as the two air monitoring projects) and the research was not as actionable. It would be ideal if future classes could continue with already completed work, or perhaps if new projects were created that had actionable results, although I know it is probably hard to develop 4 to 5 projects all with stakeholders who know how to use the information/research. The other thing I did not love about the class was the peer evaluation at the very end, although I understand that it was probably put in place to motivate team members to volunteer, be more collaborative, and complete work throughout the semester. I simply felt that this was a tool that could be easily abused, especially if there was an especially judgmental person on the team, or if two team members did not get along for personal reasons. However, I don't know that I have another solution that would motivate teamwork in the way a peer evaluation would. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Provides an opportunity to work on an engaging and impactful real-world project. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Because the project is based in the real world, it is easy to get pulled back and forth between the expectations of the course and the expectations/desire of the outside clients. Clients ended up wanting a much more robust and wide-reaching final report than we were originally tasked with. ",
            "\u00a0This is my practicum. I have learned a lot from this class. We were given a very interesting project, and have the opportunity to apply what we have learned from our program to this project and to achieve the goals of the project, which could benefit the community. ",
            "\u00a0strengths/weaknesses are very specific to each individual team project. Strength for ours was the ability to work on a truly multidisciplinary project with YLS, forestry, and community members. It took our team a while to find our footing as there was very little community involvement, and we went into the field fairly blind. It luckily worked out but the project would have greatly benefitted if more groundwork had been laid before handing off to students. ",
            "\u00a0Overall I was consistently challenged throughout the project, from working with my classmates and the community members to developing and planning how the project would go throughout the course. Overall, I feel accomplished in what I was able to contribute to the project and through this I was able to understand how much work really goes into fixing problems in the world. I have no major critiques of the class. At times I think it was frustrating for my teammates to get feedback on our final report from so many people but I do not see this as a problem that stemmed from how the class was design or from Robert, I think that this is an issue that everyone working on team projects in a professional setting has to deal with and I'm happy to have been exposed to it. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided a great opportunity to work closely with a client on an important topic and provide useful recommendations with real-world implications. Instructions and expectations for the course are clear, and overall the project was enjoyable. This course also provides an opportunity to work on a group project, which strengthens group facilitation skills while creating a meaningful output.\r\n\r\nI did not find the in-class lectures to be particularly helpful, especially for people who already have a background in climate change and/or public health. ",
            "\u00a0This is an excellent course. The projects were interesting and well-organized, and the opportunity to work with stakeholders outside of Yale on projects of health and environmental relevance is quite rare. A major strength of the course is the extensive mentorship that student teams receive from Prof. Dubrow, the project preceptors, and others. Teams are also given lotes of freedom in how they choose to carry out the defined aims of their projects. The course might benefit from having more expert speakers come to give lectures (we had two or three at the beginning of the semester), and by having more frequent class-wide project updates to allow different teams to interact with one another. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Professor Dubrow is a great liaison between clients and students and stepped in when we needed him to and took a backseat enough for us to be the leaders of our project. He met with student groups every single week to make sure we were all on the right track, which created solid communication between group members and the professor. He provided a sufficient amount of feedback and worked along with us rather than just supervising us, which allowed it to be easy to meet with him and discuss comments or questions. He was a great resource and you can tell he really cares about the quality of the projects. He provided some guest speakers to the class that were relevant to our projects and interesting while considering the needed class time for students. Professor Dubrow is one of the best professors I've ever had and I think he puts in a lot of effort into this class and it shows. I couldn't have asked for a better mentor and professor. ",
            "\u00a0The instructor was very attentive and hands on throughout the process. This was both welcome and at times frustrating, as it sometimes created delays around matters that did not seem as consequential, in order to fulfill process, while still demanding a lot of time and effort for very consequential research. I would recommend that the professor allows more freedom for students and trusts that they can meet expectations without as much supervision. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Dubrow has very high expectations for his students. He communicates clearly, provides ample feedback and background information, is very organized in his thinking. He makes himself readily available for questions and feedback and has a wealth of knowledge.        \r\n\r\nIn moments, the volume of information and communication can be overwhelming to keep up with. Edits can be very detailed and particular, rather than focused on overall strategy. ",
            "\u00a0He is very meticulous and demands attention to details--which I feel is a very good thing. However, I would have love more class sessions on the topic of climate change and public health, especially by guest speakers. ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Dubrow went above and beyond any professor I have ever worked with. He provided valuable feedback and was available almost constantly to talk through problems. It is clear that he cares deeply about the projects chosen for the practicum and about the students enrolled in this course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Caring, quick to provide feedback, attentive, and does a very good job to identify and set up meaningful projects\r\nWeaknesses: N/A ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Dubrow provides excellent feedback and is meaningfully involved with each of the projects. ",
            "\u00a0Rob - you're great. I really learned a lot from you! I'm amazed how you pick up on every detail, and give us full feedback. I truly feel like you care about the projects and us (the students). ",
            "\u00a0Professor Dubrow was a very attentive mentor throughout the course of the semester. Because there were very few lectures that he gave, I don't have too much to say about his lecturing style, but as a mentor for each of the projects, I thought he was stellar. He made sure to attend as many team meetings with the preceptors as possible, and always brought up useful suggestions for us to think about as we developed our research aims and methods. ",
            "\u00a0Rob is clearly very passionate about his work and providing a good course structure that results in both student learning and excellent final products. He is very detail oriented. Although at times it felt unnecessarily picky (especially for assignments that were more internal to the class), it helped us produce quality work. There were a few times when I would have appreciated Rob to be more of an advocate for us to temper the preceptors' expectations - in the end, it felt like our final report was a lot more extensive than what we originally thought it would be. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Dubrow provided us guidance, and support us to fulfill our goals.\r\nProfessor Dubrow is very amiable. He provided us great resources and full supports to fulfill our goal. He also gave us advice on how to conduct research in environmental health. ",
            "\u00a0- very invested in students and their success. You know Rob cares about your growth and the overall product.  He is receptive to feedback and student's needs.\r\n- Over managing. In an effort to be helpful it sometimes just made problems more complicated. This is not to say he wasn't helpful, because he was most of the time, but many emails were unnecessary and could be discussed more effectively during our conference calls. This made his more important points hard to parse out. Rob would also get hung up on details rather than the bigger picture ",
            "\u00a0Rob provides lots of thoughtful, constructive feedback.  He was always very responsive to questions or concerns.  It was clear that he cared about the class and his students.  A weakness would be his tendency to micromanage. ",
            "\u00a0Robert is the foundation and the glue that holds this class together. Although there are a lot of people involved in the projects in this course, Robert was able to facilitate every action and conversation. He is always positive, open minded, and available to talk to students. I find his work ethic and careful attention to detail extremely admirable and it has been a pleasure getting to know him. I have no critiques of Robert as an instructor in this course. I think he was always willing to listen to us when we had concerns about the project objectives and what was possible for the project. I think some of my classmates expressed that they felt the project had too wide of a scope and I think that this may have been true but Robert was able to listen and adjust the curriculum when necessary. He also gave incredibly helpful feedback in everything we did. ",
            "\u00a0Robert Dubrow has very high expectations for his students and provides thorough, timely, and regular feedback on the project. He does a good job of checking in with the project throughout the semester and wants to be kept in the loop throughout the process. This can be both a good and bad thing, because it keeps the group on track but also may reduce some of the agency that comes along with completing a group consulting project.\r\n\r\nThe instructor's lectures could be improved by adding in class engagement activities and incorporating images and color in his presentations. The information is conveyed in a logical and thorough way, but is not always the most engaging. Overall, Robert Dubrow is a great professor who cares deeply about his students and their projects. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Dubrow was an excellent mentor for this course. He was always willing to devote time and energy to helping projects move forward, and provided extensive feedback on deliverables at all stages of the project. For a project-based course like this one, Prof. Dubrows teaching might be improved by more clearly outlining the expectations for the projects at the outset of the semester, and by holding students accountable to those expectations. This could help make the course a valuable way for students to learn and practice project execution skills. "

I think this class is different from other practicum courses because this focused on environmental case studies that intersect law, public health, and environmental health while most of the other practicum courses focused on business. I would summarize the course by saying it is a combination of a professional skills workshop and formal course work with the opportunity to make real-world connections. Overall this course has helped me look deeply into the intersection between environmental health, environmental justice, and public health and I've found it to be an extremely rewarding and educational experience. ",
            "\u00a0The learnings and outcomes of this course are highly dependent on the client and project topic. I would recommend reading carefully through the project descriptions and taking the class if the project sparks interest. You will be spending a lot of time diving into this topic so it's important to find something you're passionate about to work on. If the client and project sounds interesting, I would recommend taking this class. ",
            "\u00a0This is an excellent, intensive, project-based course that gives students the opportunity to work with stakeholders outside of Yale on problems of health and environmental relevance. The opportunity to participate in such projects is rare. I would absolutely recommend this class to another student if the projects offered at the outset of the semester interest them. "
