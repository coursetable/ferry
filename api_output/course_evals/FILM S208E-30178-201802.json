            "\u00a0I learned a lot more about the film industry and its history that will be helpful in understanding where any job I may hope to gain has evolved and therefore what it is evolving towards. ",
            "\u00a0Learned the history of film making and how it merged into modern day Hollywood. Learned the costs behind movie production and how studios gain revenue. Used the history of Hollywood to help forecast its future against home entertainment. ",
            "\u00a0The class was segmented into three main parts. The first covered the history of the movie business in general as well as Hollywood in specific, including major studios, moguls, and stars. The second part of the class focused more on the production process of an actual movie, from idea to picture, and all of the marketing and advertising behind that today. The final part of the class covered the disruption that movies are facing from streaming services and other businesses. ",
            "\u00a0Developed critical thinking and reading skills. I developed knowledge on the film industry, past, present, and can make sound assumptions on potential trends for the future. "

        [
            "\u00a0I thought that it was a great way of offering the course by both having lectures and in class discussions. There was a good mix of modes of learning which helped to enforce the lessons taught. At the beginning of the course, I found a few of the readings a bit repetitive, but overall they were useful and the repetition only helped instill the ideas. ",
            "\u00a0The class covered a wide range of topics in sufficient depth, and the use of real life examples helped convey the message. ",
            "\u00a0All of the material is relatively easy to understand and synthesize. However, as there is a lot of it, Professor Johnson lectured quite a bit. I would have preferred to have more room to speak in class to test my understanding of the material. ",
            "\u00a0A key strength is that interesting content was presented through different mediums (i.e., readings, lecture, lecture videos, movies, YouTube videos). A note for improvement is that some readings repeated information from previous readings, which made the consecutive readings dry. This could be improved by having readings from pages that do not overlap as much with previous information. ",
            "\u00a0One big strength of this course was the variety of materials used to teach, from movies to interviews to articles to books. All the different types of sources appealed to a variety of learning styles, although at times I think the pre-class preparations could get a little redundant. It would probably be possible to scale back the readings slightly without losing any content. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I live in Los Angeles and am therefore surrounded by Hollywood, yet was for a long time unaware of much of the learnings of this course. I think this type of knowledge would be very useful for anyone hoping to work in the business. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, not only was it great to learn about the inner workings of a popular activity like moviegoing, but the course also covered important topics for consumers going forward like media consolidation and home entertainment growth. ",
            "\u00a0The class is pretty good. There is a lot of reading assigned, but it's all interesting and manageable. This makes for a good summer class or 5th credit. However, if you're a film major looking for a challenging course I wouldn't recommend this, and if you're a non-humanities student looking for a humanities credit I would caution that there is a lot of content about economics and history. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone regardless of major. It is fundamentally a very interesting topic, The Business of Hollywood. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! I'm not a film major but the course was extremely interesting. You get to think about one of the most prominent aspects of American culture in entirely different ways. "
