            "\u00a0I finally read some classic novels (Tarzan of the Apes!) and I genuinely enjoyed most of the readings, long though they were. The complete lack of secondary sources made me really focus in on the novels, and I feel like my analytical skills were improved as a result. ",
            "\u00a0Continued to improve my critical analysis and synthesis skills in literature. ",
            "\u00a0Everything about the jungle. ",
            "\u00a0Comprehensive overview on the various intersecting perspectives between the western civilization and the indigenous culture with the Jungle serving as the medium, \r\ngreat analysis and thoughts on how they are presented in popular culture, literature, poems, autobiographies, etc. ",
            "\u00a0I came out with a better understanding and appreciation of the Jungle Book literature. I learned how to read more critically and write more coherently. ",
            "\u00a0I developed an awareness and understanding of the Jungle Books genre, gained insight about the significance of that genre as a reflection of European imperialism, enjoyed an opportunity to hone my literary analysis and writing skills, and read some very entertaining and interesting books. "

            "\u00a0Strength: The one and only RGE.\r\nWeaknesses: Days when professor RGE has spread himself thin with prestigious conferences and awards and we have a substitute teacher.\r\nStrengths-Weaknesses>>0 ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Very interesting overview of many books, all the books are connected through a theme yet pretty unique in their own ways so if you don't like one book you'll find others interesting. Good insight and grounded analysis.\r\nWeaknesses: Reading load can be a bit high at times and some books are quite dense, a background in some fundamental philosophy or spanish history can be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0This is a really good introduction to books that feature the jungle and Spanish/Latin American culture. It seems to not have a lot of structure, but overall was pretty interesting. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course are definitely the readings. I enjoyed many of the books and cannot think of very many improvements. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the pacing of the course was very good, and the lectures were insightful and prompted student discussion well. I think the amount of writing was appropriate and the prompts thought provoking. I was surprised and impressed by the diversity of books included in the Jungle Books genre but also interested by the parallels among them, which were strong and invited reflection about the genre as a whole.\r\n\r\nMy only request would be to put it in a room with better windows in the future.

            "\u00a0I found the course pretty fulfilling, and if you need a writing credit or a lit class, I would recommend it highly (if you're willing to do the readings!!!). I know that a lot of people skip readings in seminars, but I would highly advise against that in this case. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely. This was one of the most enjoyable seminars I've ever been in. The surprisingly diverse selection of works within the realm of \"jungle books\" represented an intersection of genres that was placed into historical context. The professor is extremely knowledgeable of the history, culture and the authors surrounding the books. He knew one of the authors (Carpentier) personally. All in all, the course was thought-provoking and led to a surprising level of introspection and inspiration. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely recommend. RGE will make you passionate about whatever he is discussing. He commands the students respect and interest. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. Professor RGE overflows with insight and knowledge on the Jungle Books topics, he is also extremely well informed in the context. The GOAT. ",
            "\u00a0If the topic interests you, this course could be really interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend the class to another student. It was my favorite class this semester, in large part because of the readings and because of the professor's insights on them. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to anyone looking for a refreshing literature experience who is ready to fully read and appreciate the books: the course is truly focused on the reading and driven by enthusiasm for the stories. "
