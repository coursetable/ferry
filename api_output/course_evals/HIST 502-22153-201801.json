            "\u00a0Strengths: Two good professors, a solid group of knowledgeable students with well thought out discussion times and topics.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not many. Maybe provide a bit more background information for each reading group. It was difficult to situate readings inside a history that we are unfamiliar with. ",
