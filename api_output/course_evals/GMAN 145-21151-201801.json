            "\u00a0Intensive German is a strong course - all language courses should be in the two hour format. The book was good, balancing grammar and reading instruction. The amount of time for conversing in German was good as well. The only weakness might be that the book, with its focus on German speaking cities, somewhat limits itself in terms of the vocabulary it uses. "
