            "\u00a0I learned a lot about migrant health and the theoretical frameworks used to evaluate it. ",

            "\u00a0Really great course where I learned a lot of information about public health and policies that affect immigrants. ",
            "\u00a0Understanding of social epidemiology in the United States ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the different theories, conceptual frameworks, and questions related to researching the health of migrants. Most importantly, I learned how to assess the implications of asking a question in a certain way and designing a research study in a certain way. ",
            "\u00a0Going in, I only had a broad understanding of migration and did not know much about its relationship to health. I learned not only about the complex dynamic between health and migration but the various tools and theories to analyze these processes and relationships. I also learned why these types of studies are important and how the field still has a lot of work to do/grow. ",
            "\u00a0Insights into modern health practices and how different migrant groups are affected by policy. ",

            "\u00a0This course is really well organized, and the material you need to know is made very clear, which I appreciated a lot. Studying the health of specific migrant populations was really interesting. I think it might be helpful to have more examples of applying the theoretical frameworks. ",
            "\u00a0Good course but would have liked more in class exercises. ",
            "\u00a0This course was great in regards to exploring research in this field and understanding the reasoning behind researchers' methods and the meaning of their results.  I think there could have more interaction with students during lectures, which would have made classes more engaging.  Some of the topics we discussed were not only interesting but also controversial, and I think it would have been great to have student discussions.  Another way to increase engagement, considering how focused this course was on looking at research within the field, is to have students work together to create a series of questions they would ask a group of immigrants to learn about a specific topic. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the readings were an appropriate amount and that the assignments/exams were very fair. I greatly appreciated the slides being posted online and the review sessions for the exams. Professor Martnez was a great lecturer - her explanation of concepts was always thorough.\r\n\r\nMaybe if the course was presented as a joint lecture-seminar, this may have primed people to participate more (ex: lecture style on Monday, seminar style on Wednesday). Another possible change would be to diversity the reading lists. In addition to academic papers, personal narratives or book excepts (like the one about Ciudad Juarez) could have added to our discussions. I also really enjoyed the guest speakers - unfortunate that the circumstances did not allow for more this semester. ",

            "\u00a0Yes (although Professor Martnez will not be teaching the course - sad!)\r\nI think that the content of this course is really important for all people (including health and non-health professionals, migrants and \"non-migrants\", etc.) to know. We touched on a variety of themes that all play a role in migration and health (broadly defined). I really loved this course and am sad to see Professor Martnez leave Yale. ",
