            "\u00a0This course was incredible! Not only did I learn about autism and the cutting edge of research, I learned a lot about clinical psychology/psychiatry/what the disorder looks like on an individual level through the clinical placement. Would definitely recommend taking it. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about autism as a disorder and how it impacts individuals with the disorder along with family members. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about autism spectrum disorder, including its history, its symptoms, its possible causes, and treatments for it. I also had an amazing experience working with kids with autism every week at Benhaven Academy. ",
            "\u00a0This class was awesome, you get to learn about autism from all different perspectives and the practicum assignment was great ",
            "\u00a0Because I have a sister with autism, this class really opened my eyes to the science behind it and helped me understand more about what she needs and what autism is. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about autism from so many different angles: social, scientific, medical, etc. ",
            "\u00a0I've learnt so much about people with Autism, and some of the challenges they face. The course provided a comprehensive overview on the topic, starting from infants to adults. All the lectures were interesting, and I really enjoyed and learnt a lot from them, such as Professor Volkmar's classes on assessments, to topics about law, to sibling and parent perspective and more. ",
            "\u00a0I learned all about autism--diagnosis, treatment, etiology, legal and social issues. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the diagnosis, treatment, and current research in the study of autism.  We learned about the impact the disorder has on schools, families, and individuals and oversaw it in reality through our placements. ",
            "\u00a0Diagnostic techniques/tools for diagnosing autism, history of autism, different types/levels of impairment associated with autism, accommodations in schools and how challenging it can be to get those accommodations, and just generally learned more about what its like to live with autism.

            "\u00a0Interesting content ",
            "\u00a0There are not many weaknesses. This course was one of the few courses I consistently looked forward to. It is a holistic approach to autism (and health more generally) that takes into consideration the mechanism of the disorder as well as treatment approaches and how people handle it personally as well. Really an incredible learning experience. ",
            "\u00a0It could be more structured. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was very interesting and especially unique in that it gave students a chance to actually interact with the class beyond the classroom. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that this course was good overall, but it wandered between topics a bit much, especially when factoring in the numerous guest speakers. Additionally, I would've liked to have smaller graded assignments throughout the course, rather than determining almost the entire grade with one paper at the end. The hands-on component at Benhaven Academy was excellent, and I could only say that it would be even more interesting if it were directly integrated into the rest of the course. ",
            "\u00a0I thought it was a great course. The only thing is that I wished Professor Volkmar lectured more because he was great! ",
            "\u00a0I think the class would be better if it were smaller and had more of a discussion element. It functions as a small lecture right now, but I would be more engaged if there was discussion about experiences facilitated. ",
            "\u00a0AMazing!! the placements are such an amazing opportunity to interact with people with autism. incredible class ",
            "\u00a0The practicum aspect of this course was cool, but related almost none at all to the course itself. Would have been nice to have the field work integrated somehow into the coursework besides the brief reflection at the beginning. Also, not a lot of incentive to go to class since there was just that one assignment on a topic of choice ",
            "\u00a0It made me a little sad to see how many people were on their laptops during class. It seemed very disrespectful. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are the weekly placements at autism centers and the guest speakers. ",
            "\u00a0The course provides a lot of chances to ask guest lecturers questions, and the course touches on a lot of topics on Autism. The practicum was also very fruitful and I gained a lot of hands on experience and insights from it. It would be great if the class can meet up more for discussions and to more frequently attend practicum. ",
            "\u00a0Strength was that all the lectures were interesting, weakness was that it felt a little all over the place because it was delivered by different people each time. ",
            "\u00a0The practicum placements were fabulous and Volkmar did a fantastic job creating and facilitating those connections.  It was a little unclear at mine (Chapel Haven) the role of the daily diaries and I didn't realize I had to do them until pretty late in the game. That may have been a miscommunication, though.  The guest speakers were all very meaningful and brought great things to the table--it would have been nice to have a smaller class size to make for more of a seminar vibe. ",
            "\u00a0This years class was only offered in the spring and thus the class was double the size it typically is. I think it would be more engaging as a smaller class because this semester there was not much class discussion, which sometimes made it feel like an hour and a half long lecture.\r\nThe placements are The Strength of the class.  I learned the most from visiting my placement weekly and feel like I formed a lasting relationship with the guys I worked with. "

            "\u00a0The practicum portion of the course really made me feel a personal connection to people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The lectures were all very interesting- it covered a range of topics from molecular biology to criminal justice system/autism to familial life of those with ASD. I highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to work in the field of clinical psychology/psychiatry/medicine. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Definitely take it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This is a one-of-a-kind class which gives students to learn so much about autism. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you are interested in autism, but it tends to be a bit boring at times, and there's practically no weekly work except readings and attending the placement (where you work with people with autism in person). I would not say that this course is the one to take if you are interested in the cognitive science perspectives on autism; this falls more on the applied and clinical side of things. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Absolutely! I really enjoyed the entire class and think any psychology/pre-med student should take it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think the class can be very informative and intriguing for everyone. ",
            "\u00a0YESS PLEASE ",
            "\u00a0A fantastic class, especially for those truly interested in diving deep into the topic of autism! Professor Volkmar is an absolute giant in the field (its fun to see his name on all the relevant research papers when youre looking for resources for the final paper). Very low workload during the semester (readings every week, but no discussion of them, and a 15-20 page (including references) final paper. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Especially if you are interested in this topic, and would want to commit the time to go on practicums, which I felt was one of the best experience I've had in being in contact with people with Autism. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. Autism is a very important issue that people should become more knowledgable about ",
            "\u00a0Yes - very cool and unique course. Focus is on learning and getting exposure to lots of different research and also family members of and people with autism. ",
            "\u00a0i'm a psyc major and this class turned out to be a highlight of my semester. the practicum placements were really meaningful and it was great to get into the community and realize new haven is larger than yale. i learned the most from those placements--just working with people firsthand is better than any classroom. i didn't end up writing my final paper about stuff covered in lecture but lectures were always really interesting to attend, definitely go, you will get the most out of the class. we learned about the biology of autism, autism and the criminal justice system, and the guests were always really interesting. definitely take this if you can get in, but only do so if you're willing to commit wholeheartedly to the placements. most of the time and energy is spent doing those, but they're so special. ",
            "\u00a0This is a fantastic course if you want to learn about autism.  There is a lot to learn and the abundance of guest lectures makes it feel more like a lecture series at the NIH than a class, which I liked.  Of course, its great that it meets once a week and has very minimal workload.  Its the kind of class where you get out of it what you put in.  If you dont have anything to put in, you wont learn much, if you put everything in and read all the supplementary readings you will get more out of it than many of your peers, and if you just go to each class and listen attentively and go to your placement weekly, youll learn quite a bit.
