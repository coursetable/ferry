            "\u00a0I learned a much of different Spanish words, grammar, techniques, abilities and more. I also became a better speaker and listener! ",
            "\u00a0I learned more vocabulary and grammar. Also, this class really helped me to feel more confident speaking because most of the activities involved talking in groups. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely had the opportunity to review a lot of fairly basic grammar concepts I had not covered in high school. The basics include comparisons, past tenses, por/para. If you took two to three classes of Spanish in high school, most of it will be review. ",
            "\u00a0Intermediate Spanish, part 1- mainly review of tenses present and past, as well as the present subjunctive. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my Spanish skills to the extent that communicating with a host family in Ecuador was possible and conversation flowed naturally. "

        [
            "\u00a0I would have liked to have focused discussions on the grammatical exercises a little more, sometimes the class was a little slow and only somewhat related to the material. In high school I got a lot out of classes that were fast and focused. But I also recognize that with three hour classes this is hard, and I appreciate opportunities to do a lot of speaking and listening in class. I think all the group work is good, although I wish we switched groups around more because I was often just with the same people again and again. \r\n\r\nIt's impossible to comment on every part of this complex and fast-moving class, but I was certainly happy with it overall! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were that all the activities were very engaging and involved participation. Giseli and Terry were fantastic and very helpful. There were not many weaknesses, I thought the class was well organized and my Spanish improved a lot. ",
            "\u00a0I believe this course did well at getting us to practice in pairs using our Spanish, which helped in improving some of my conversational abilities. I also think the instruction by both Giselli and Seymour were amazing, two teachers who are definitely dedicated to helping you learn Spanish. The only thing was the readings sometimes were very lengthy and complex for our standard of Spanish which was somewhat a drawback at times. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my Spanish. No evident weaknesses, but no obvious strengths either. ",
            "\u00a0This course gives students ample opportunities to speak, write, and listen. I believe that some of the films we watched did not add much value to the course, which was otherwise well-tailored to help students improve. "

        [
            "\u00a0Yes! It's a good, typical class to continue improving Spanish. It's not remarkable but it does what it is meant to!\r\n\r\nI would have liked to have some vocabulary lists to learn outside of Enfoques, as the Enfoques words weren't always the most useful ones to know. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would definitely recommend this course to another student because the classroom instruction was great but the opportunity to take a Spanish class abroad and live with a host family really enhanced my experience because I was speaking Spanish all the time. ",
            "\u00a0If you have not taken Spanish in a while and need a refresher on some fairly basic grammar concepts such as past tenses or por/para, this would be a good class to take. If you feel like you understand the basics well, then probably should not take this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes- Spanish is a great language. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This course is a good way to continue with Spanish at a fast, but not unmanageable, pace. I would recommend this course to students with a genuine and earnest interest in improving their language skills. "
