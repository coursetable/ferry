            "\u00a0-Learned core principles of virology such as progression of the viral life cycle; principles of viral evolution, resistance and adaptation; basic understanding of main viral families; targeted design of antiviral therapeutic approaches and principles of viral oncogenesis. ",
            "\u00a0I gained knowledge about different virus families. I learned how individual viruses replicate, the history of virology, and specific unique things that viruses can do. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about the diversity between viruses. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I liked there were several different professors who brought expertise in the various fields rather than have a few professors go outside of their field. ",
            "\u00a0-Strengths: Course syllabus is comprehensive and well-designed. It follows the order of Field's Virology which allows for a pre-structured design after which one can model the course. Each individual lecture had its own strengths and weaknesses.\r\n\r\n-Weaknesses: Lack of coordination between faculty lecturers led to two main problems 1) faculty members fell on redundancy while teaching lectures (two or more distinct lecturers talked about the same topic) or 2) faculty members erroneously assumed previous faculty members had laid a solid foundation on terms/principles/general concepts that were essential for understanding the current topic of the lecture and therefore did not explain it well. \r\n\r\n-Recommendations: My main concern is with the second problem I described as this hinders class participation, group discussion, the students' ability to make well-thought questions, and note taking. I propose that there be a lecture particularly on the topic of the general viral life cycle before submerging students into the discussion of each particular viral family. This will facilitate learning and understanding the differences and intricacies of each particular viral family. An alternative is to bump Dr. Tattersall's Adenovirus lecture sooner into the course since this lecture did an excellent job of summarizing in a concise manner the main points of the viral life cycle for Adenovirus and could therefore be used as a template to understand other viral families and how they differ from Adenovirus. \r\n\r\nAnother point I think is important is for lecturers to take note of Dr. DiMaio's didactic style. Dr. DiMaio did a wonderful job in explaining in a concise yet detailed manner how different techniques are used in the field of Virology. This included (in combination with an engaging class discussion): clearly explaining what the context of the research question is, outlining the research question, explaining the logic of each approach used by researchers to understand a particular problem and explain how the data of each experiment was analyzed and used to design subsequent experiments. ",
            "\u00a0The course was a good survey of a lot of topics, but I think it would've been nice to have some more standardization across the lectures. It would have been nice to potentially go into one or two topics for each virus in depth, perhaps with the analysis of mechanism or a couple papers, rather than going over a wide variety of topics in short for every virus. ",
            "\u00a0Standardize the lectures such that there are some few key takeaways with each one - memorizing half a semester's material on viruses is so difficult ",
            "\u00a0There was a huge range of quality among the different lecturers. Some were excellent, and some were really horrible teachers. I gained a lot from the course overall, but I would have been much more engaged with the material if it had been presented more effectively across the different lecturers. Additionally, the exams were poorly designed. It was next to impossible to answer the 12 exam questions in the allotted 90 minutes. Thankfully we were given an extra 30 minutes, but if the exam was meant to take 2 hours, we should have been clearly given 2 hours. Otherwise, if the exam was meant to take 90 minutes, then the questions should have been constructed accordingly. Some questions were reasonable, but others were not. For example, it is unreasonable to expect a student to design a thorough and complete experiment with controls and hand write that whole experiment in less than 8 minutes, which is approximately the amount of time for each exam question given the time constraints. Furthermore, there were no assignments or quizzes throughout the semester to check students' understanding of the material. If the goal of the course is indeed to teach students the material rather than focus on exams, then the course and exams should be designed according to that goal. ",
            "\u00a0This course could use some improvement. There was a lot of variation in the depth of information that was covered from lecture to lecture. Some lectures gave  a nice, broad introduction to a certain topic (which may be too basic for someone familiar with virology or that specific topic, but felt appropriate for the course), while most of the lectures skipped over a lot of the basics and went deep into the molecular biology of viruses, and often focuses a lot on the lecturer's research, both of which seemed over the top for an introductory course. I was disappointed in the lack of involvement from the course instructor, as with most other courses I've taken that are team taught, the course instructor is still present during lectures. This allows the instructor to provide feedback to the lecturer's to improve on the course in future years. I also think have a few other assignments besides the midterm and final would be helpful to ensure students are grasping the material or thinking about it correctly prior to an exam. \r\n\r\nOne other comment, and I understand that this may be controversial, however, I don't think undergraduates should enroll in this course. The undergraduate students in this class were often rude and came in late (one in particular came in 20 minutes late to every class), spoke during lecture,  and would often speak poorly of prior lecturers with that day's lecturer in the room. I've taken other courses with undergraduate students, and have never seen this problem before. I think maybe the material being far above \"introductory\" caused many of the students, but particularly the undergrads, to be frustrated with this course. "

            "\u00a0Yes, material was very interesting for someone who had never taken a virology course. ",
            "\u00a0Only take it if you are happy getting a B. Pretty much impossible to get an A (or A- or B+, because grad school grading doesn't translate into A- or B+). No workload except for midterm and final (which are really stressful). ",
            "\u00a0If the student were to audit the course, I would recommend taking it. The material is definitely interesting, but the course was mismanaged. The exams were the only determining factor for your grade, and they were badly designed. Additionally, we did not get much feedback on the midterm, and we did not receive any feedback on the final. There were also no homework assignments or quizzes to improve your grade or check your understanding of the material, which made the midterm and final even more important. ",
            "\u00a0Probably not, which is disappointing. The lectures are far beyond an introductory level, and a lot of the basics are left out, which makes learning anything meaningful rare. "
