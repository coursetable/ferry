            "\u00a0Reading such a great deal of literature at a time was very helpful for understanding the arc of Latin literature. There were more opportunities to connect works and authors to their antecedents and contexts than I'd ever had in a class before. ",

            "\u00a0It was a great, fairly relaxed course balanced with an intense reading load of interesting and rich material. The individual class meetings and the course in general was pretty loosely structured, which gave us a lot of time to cover historical and cultural context which doesn't usually get much attention in literature survey courses. At times the conversation diverged somewhat from engaging with the text itself--it might have been better to have a more balanced combination of historical/cultural overview with close reading of passages in class. ",
            "\u00a0The discussions occasionally veered off into lines that were difficult to follow; giving us a particular topic(s) to focus on beforehand might help. ",
