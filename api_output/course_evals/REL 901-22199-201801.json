            "\u00a0Beth is one of the best TFs I've had, and her abilities as a facilitator were integral to getting the most out of our week over week readings. She asked penetrating questions that led to fruitful conversations. She kept us on track while honoring the often different perspectives of classmates. She was delightful and curious in a way that made it clear that she genuinely wanted to know what we each thought. Beth belongs in the seminar classroom. ",
            "\u00a0Beth was great! She guided our discussion sections, but not overly so. She had a contagious enthusiasm for the questions that our texts were asking and was solicitous of our genuine reactions and opinions. ",
            "\u00a0Well done section ",
            "\u00a0she was wonderful; compassionate, engaged, interested, open, knowledgeable, a perfect TA for Chris Wiman. I sensed she loved the experience and her enthusiasm was contagious. ",
            "\u00a0BETH IS LOVELY. She did a wonderful job facilitating the conversation and asking provocative questions and making sure people each had time to speak. ",
            "\u00a0Beth was an amazing TF! She was wonderful at facilitating discussion and made our section my favorite section of the year! She always came super prepared, with wonderful questions, but was so empowering to give students the chance to participate. I also really liked her strategies for pairing students together to help us get to know one another and get discussion going. She was always really enthusiastic which made it all the more exciting to discuss these works. She was also very helpful when it came time to work on papers! ",
            "\u00a0I really don't like the idea of course evaluations. But Beth did a wonderful job. ",
            "\u00a0absolutely phenomenal\r\n\r\nElizabeth is the best TF I have ever had and is everything a TF should be:\r\n\r\n-incredibly well-prepared and organized (knew the readings inside and out, had her own opinions, had wonderful insightful helpful questions to ask)\r\n\r\n-incredibly kind, funny, and approachable\r\n\r\n-made the sessions not about HER and her knowledge but instead stepped back and acting as an amazing facilitator, helping us to find our own answers together, asking wonderfully helpful questions, promoting healthy discussion, etc. etc.\r\n\r\nI learned so much with her as our section moderator. It was such a joy. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: A deeply knowledgeable, gifted discussion leader. Flawlessly incorporated questions/comments into the overall flow of section, and was always kind and encouraging throughout the semester. Offered meaningful insight into texts that allowed me to see them in new lights. Accessible for paper consultation. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Could sometimes offer more critical questions of the text or of opinions offered in class; it felt like we were all having different conversations or were afraid to offend each others opinions. ",
            "\u00a0Beth was a lovely TF. She ran a great discussion and provided helpful insight into the various texts we read. She made very effective use of small groups conversations and other pedagogical techniques to make our 90 minute weekly discussion very worthwhile. The course was full of rich material but not rigidly structured, and Beth did very well pulling out themes and productive lines of inquiry. (In someone else's hands, this could have been so dreadful.) She was also very helpful when consulting on paper topics. Her enthusiasm for the material was contagious! ",
            "\u00a0Beth was a wonderful TA - engaged, knowledgeable, prepared, enthusiastic about the material, insightful, and wonderful at energizing and directing discussion.  My only suggestion for improvement would be that she consider drawing out some of the more reticent members of the class more affirmatively. ",
            "\u00a0Beth is a phenomenal teaching fellow. She immediately created an environment of trust and collaboration. She provided a wonderful balance of structure (through guiding questions and activities), but also allowed the discussion to flow freely and collaboratively. She was very available outside of class. Her engagement with the readings really helped set the standard for all of us to grapple at a deep level. I wish every teaching fellow were able to lead discussions as well as Beth. ",
            "\u00a0Beth does a very good job of asking probing questions and gauging the group.  She has a welcoming manner that set a great tone for conversation. ",
            "\u00a0Beth was the best Teaching Fellow I have had at YDS. She facilitated discussion with engaging, complex questions about lectures and readings. She encouraged students to share their thoughts and created a space where students felt comfortable sharing them and having them challenged. She was able to synthesize students' comments and questions and move the conversation forward in light of all that was said. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent facilitator, communicator, encouraging of students, good at drawing out more from what students would share, good also at staying on point and keeping a discussion moving along. "
