            "\u00a0This class is kind of like a glorified intermediate micro class.  A chill class for seniors to take.\r\n\r\nYou do less Lagrangian math, but you definitely will see the basic concepts come up.  It's an interesting class that doesn't force too much work, but some of the concepts are far too technical to be discussed in the section.  By this I mean the math is overly complex (with respect to variables and concepts), and you don't actually dive into models, rather than discussing them for a day and moving on -- I'm not sure if I like that or dislike that, because I wouldn't want to have gotten in the weed with the immensely technical stuff, as the professor mentioned, it's PHD level stuff. ",
            "\u00a0Quite paper based, which is not bad but would appreciate more detailed slides ",
            "\u00a0Professor's graphs are very clear and helpful, and expands on the slides a lot. This forces students to come to class and learn actively rather than rely on slides to study for tests, which makes a lot of sense. Too bad many people don't show up, this class does count on attendance to do well. ",
            "\u00a0Not enough practice problems. Solutions and answer keys are hard to understand. I think there needs to be more opportunities to solve problems as a class cause a lot of us had no idea what to expect on the exams. Also grading on homeworks was weird. No idea what a check vs check + means. ",
            "\u00a0Lecture slides could be more comprehensive ",
            "\u00a0The pedagogy was truly awful. This seemed like such an interesting topic, but it turned out to be a really disappointing experience. In the small senior lecture/seminars, the professor should try and engage with the students. I don't think Igami askedthe class a question once during the entire semester. It seemed like he struggled significantly with reading the class. Literally half the class would be asleep, not taking notes, on their phones, or otherwise disengaged, and he would continue with his lecture. It was hard to tell whether he did not care that no one was understanding the material or whether he honestly did not realize. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very poorly structured. I feel that Professor Igami is truly passionate about the economics of innovation but the way he goes about teaching it is pretty poor. Most of the concepts he brings up are far too abstract for undergrads to understand. For example, half of the material we look at complex equations that no one truly understands. I think if he taught the course with more of a structure quantitative focus that people in the undergraduate school could understand that would be best. ",
            "\u00a0Strength is Igami, weakness is lack of problem practice prior to Exams ",
            "\u00a0Professor Igami is an interesting lecturer who does a good job both teaching the concepts and connecting it to the interesting, real-world applications innovation entails. My critique would be an improvement of the grading feedback and how to improve scores. ",
            "\u00a0It should be taught more like a seminar. The class was so boring and the level of engagement with the class was absurdly low by the professor. Topics were not well selected nor taught. More interested in his research than anything of value or interesting. "

            "\u00a0Take this class if you want to knock out a distributional and you're proficient in Microeconomic math and concepts.  While you learn a bit about innovation, it's less about the actual innovations that you might see in business and more about how graphs and economic models change in order to  incentivize innovation from a theoretical level (i.e. you do math rather than discuss concepts). ",
            "\u00a0If you're a junior or senior econ major looking to get a senior req out of the way with as little effort as possible, this is your class. If you're looking to learn a lot, go elsewhere. 3 psets (two were mindless, response-based), midterm, final. Readings not required. On the first day of this \"seminar,\" the professor said attendance is \"suggested, but not recorded.\" 10 of 35 students consistently attended. Professor Igami was useful in discussing his interesting research, but needs to improve on his ability to keep his students awake. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, it was one of he most interesting economics classes Ive taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0My grade was surprisingly good but this was probably the least inspiring/worst class I've taken at Yale. I feel like I gained nothing of value and just wanted to get through it ",
