            "\u00a0The course made me a much more careful reader of poetry and allowed me to better pay attention to references within poems and the historical context around poems. I also feel I came away better at specifying what in a poem moves me. ",
            "\u00a0This class teaches how to think within and beyond the text. Our discussions were incredible and thoughtful and Professor Cole had us thinking hard in every class. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to read poetry in a way that I'd never quite grasped before, part by explicit instruction and part by osmosis. The syllabus is remarkable (not entirely to my taste, but that's probably a good thing). Learning from Professor Cole is a treat! ",
            "\u00a0This course not only introduced me to major Jewish poets of the 20th century, but in many cases made me realize their work as belonging to a tradition of modern Jewish poetry. While I had hitherto read poets like Adrienne Rich and Allen Ginsburg in the context of American poetry, I had not understood them as particularly Jewish poets. The course also expanded my awareness of modern American, European, and Israeli poetry. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided a fairly comprehensive overview of modern poetry written by Jews, arguing that there are common themes and motifs in this body of work. ",
            "\u00a0New ways to engage with texts on microscopic (picking apart words) and macroscopic (putting together poets) levels. An expanded view of what Judaism has meant for Jews involved in some way or another in cultural production that reaches well beyond themselves; an expanded view of what Judaism could mean for me. Ways to read texts that are not considered spiritual spiritually. Ways to use words to approach the unknowable and the ineffable. Ways to use words to make human contact. Ways to use words to move towards real change. "

            "\u00a0The course possessed many strengths  the reading amount was just right; the reading itself was wonderful and challenging; Professor Cole provided interesting, helpful biographical details that allowed us to grasp more fully the poets reasons for writing what they wrote; he opened conversation enough such that everyone could contribute their own reading and then he pushed us to read more deeply. \r\n\r\nI felt there were very few ways the course could be improved. At the beginning of the course, Professor Cole often asked us in what ways we found the work to be Jewish, and I sometimes thought that particular  question was too vague. ",
            "\u00a0This course was one of the best that Ive taken at Yale. The professor was masterful at leading discussion and sharing his insights in a way that still gave room for us to think. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Cole is brilliant and thoughtful and kind, one of the brightest, best professors I've had at Yale. The syllabus is wonderful, too, and the course attracts a quirky bunch of students who add a lot to the class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:  Student presentations are a hit or a miss and probably could have used some more guidance. Canvas posts weren't particularly productive: I think we should have either made them central to the course and required real, substantive posts or eliminated them completely (as we did in the second half of the semester). ",
            "\u00a0Perhaps the chief strength of this course is the diversity of its syllabus. Constantly switching poetic forms, countries, and even languages from week to week ensured that the idea of modern Jewish poetry that we were working with never became stale. Moving from Paul Celan to Yehuda Amichai, for example, engendered a complete change in tone and audience. As a result, our discussions of these poets remained dynamic, especially when we tried to trace continuities from one to another. \r\n\r\nI cant think of any major weaknesses in the course, nor of any specific ways to improve it. Professor Cole not only created a masterful syllabus, but also was an excellent discussion leader who often challenged or deepened our statements on our reading. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the creative writing assignments and thought they made sense with the tone and structure of the class. I wish reading responses had continued all semester, as they were a good way for me to really engage with the material and without them discussions sometimes felt listless. Sometimes I wish we were assigned fewer poems and had been forced to engage with them more deeply. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the many poets, materials, and worldviews / wordviews we were able to cover; the balance between structured learning and open-ended discussion during class; the student presentations in the second half of the semester; the creative, emulative options for the midterm and final. Weakness: sometimes needing to squeeze multiple poets / presentations into one class session. "

            "\u00a0The course was really wonderful, and I would absolutely recommend it to another student. Professor Cole is an incredibly thoughtful and supportive professor, and the material was rich with possible interpretations that he helped us arrive at. It made me into a much better reader. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! Please take a class with Peter Cole. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely, if only to have an opportunity to take a class with Professor Cole. It's an excellent class with room for students with any background. You'll learn and grow a lot. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would recommend this course. It provides a far-reaching overview of Jewish poetry since the early 20th century, and the poets you interact with in the course are fascinating and incredibly diverse with regards to their engagement with Judaism or being Jewish. I learned a lot about Rabbinical scholarship and commentary, as well as Jewish mysticism and Kabbalah, all of which informed not only my reading of poetry, but my own poetry as well! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This course is a gem that fills in pretty glaring gaps within the poetry curriculum at Yale. Every poet that we read is not only a major Jewish poet, but a major modern poet; in no other class could you read Bob Dylan, Adrienne Rich, Paul Celan, and Charles Reznikoff in the same semester. What makes the course great, however, is Professor Coles teaching ability. His manner of providing incisive and illuminating comments opens up these poets work and makes them accessible to people regardless of their prior experience or knowledge of Judaism. ",
            "\u00a0This course was pretty low-commitment. I think you get out what you put in, and the material is approachable from a range of vantage points. The material is probably more relevant if you have some kind of connection to Judaism and/or poetry, but you definitely don't need either of those backgrounds to gain something from the course. That being said I didn't find this to be a super involving course, and it kind of got pushed to the background whenever I wasn't in the classroom. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Anyone interested in words, anyone interested in Judaism, and certainly anyone who falls in the (large) overlapping region on that Venn diagram! "
