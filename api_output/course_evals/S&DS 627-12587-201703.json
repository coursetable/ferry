            "\u00a0Deductive reasoning and how to understand statistics in a setting outside of teaching. How to approach something new and figure out what can be done with it. implementing new techniques and figuring out new ways to process data. Finding out what parts of data are important for experiments. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to use different functions in R as well as the right times to use certain analysis techniques. I was surprised at my ability to learn a little bit about coding more efficiently by watching examples of other people coding. ",
            "\u00a0I got better at going from a problem and some data to a reasonable dataset and something like answers. ",
            "\u00a0It's been interesting to look at all the different problems from different people, dealing with everything from mosquito breeding habits to stroke deaths to refugee camps. It's a great way to practice on-the-fly consulting, see what's going on around all of Yale, and apply the skills we've learned in our more theoretical/computing-oriented classes. ",
            "\u00a0Jay gives us a lot of insights in consulting. Jay approaches problems in a very experienced way, a way that an unexperienced student often cannot really think of.I learned how to handle real world data sets (data cleaning, analysis, especially about how to start the analysis). "

            "\u00a0Jay is fantastic and I dont know how it can be improved. ",
            "\u00a0I really like the structure of this course. ",
            "\u00a0This is more of a casual, applied class, a chance to practice looking at data sets and applying computing tricks and the theory we've seen in other classes to get something out of them. I like its hands-on nature and the opportunity it presents to interact with researchers in the Yale community outside our little stat family. However, sometimes I'm not sure how much value I'm personally bringing. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Interesting topics, valuable skills.\r\nPossible improvement: Require/incentivize/allow for more student participation ",
            "\u00a0The strength is that students could participate in the analysis easily and get very prompt feedback from Jay. Students also have a chance to redo the analysis when they volunteer, so they get more time to reflect on the analysis. The only weakness may be due to the variety of the incoming projects. I personally sometimes find some projects more interesting, so sometimes I may be less focused when the project does not interest me much. "

            "\u00a0Definitely, it is amazing to see Jay work and learn from him and others. It is also fascinating learning about other people's research. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think this is great way to learn practical applications of statistical concepts and also learning the different things that R can do with data. ",
            "\u00a0I would. It's a fun course, it's not a lot of work, but I feel like one learns lots of valuable stuff. ",
            "\u00a0If the student is looking to actively engage, clean data, offer suggestions and consider possibilities as to why code or a technique might not work on the fly, I would recommend this course to him. Probably more to students who are looking to enter the workforce after the program and are hoping to get some consulting-lite experience. ",
