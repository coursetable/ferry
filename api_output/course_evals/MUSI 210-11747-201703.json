            "\u00a0I learned how to perform a functional harmonic analysis of music and compose entire pieces from scratch. I also learned the art of counterpoint. ",
            "\u00a0I developed my compositional and analytical skills and built a solid base on which to further grow my musical abilities. I came into the class with very little previous experience with theory, so it was illuminating to be able to look at the music that I listen to normally in a new light. My knowledge of forms and styles increased as well as my understanding of modulations and tonicizations. I also was introduced to the more nuanced discussions of pitch space and rhythmic space. ",

            "\u00a0I think that one of the great strengths of the course was its compositional focus. Instead of assignments that were worksheet oriented, we were always composing, and I persoanlly loved this. It was a great way to constantly engage with the material in a creative way, and the time committment that it required was worth it. A particular weakness of the course doesn't come to mind immediately. ",
