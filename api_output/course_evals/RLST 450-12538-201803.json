            "\u00a0The experience of this class will depend a lot on the personalities and engagement of the students taking it. I found seminar discussions incredibly rewarding and stimulating, but I can see how it might not be that way. Nancy Levene is really great though, and very helpful. Spinoza too, is a must read especially if youre a philosophy major. "
