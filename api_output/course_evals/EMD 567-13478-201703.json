            "\u00a0This course was very educational and taught me a lot about the big 3 diseases, as well as their history and biology. Professor Parikh brought these topics to life, and his medical experience was a big benefit for the class. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I think this was a good course. I especially appreciated the opportunity to hear about some of the clinical presentations of the diseases. ",
            "\u00a0Fascinating material- one of the more science-heavy classes I've taken at YSPH, but it all seemed necessary to truly get a handle on the epidemiology, prevention, and treatment of each of the Big3. I really enjoyed each lecture, which were nicely supplemented by a reasonable amount of reading. \r\n\r\n I was a bit confused as to the ordering of the lectures (I think this may have perhaps been due to guest lecture scheduling). I think it would have worked better to do the introductory lecture, all of the HIV lectures, all of the malaria lectures, and then all of the TB lectures, if possible.\r\n\r\n The homework assignments were time consuming but were good in that they required comprehension and synthesis of the material. \r\n\r\nI felt that the final project was a bit anti-climactic given the engaging and interesting material throughout the semester. Maybe having each group do a case study would be more relevant? ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the material covered in this course, and think such a course is critical for the EMD curriculum. Strengths include the range of topics covered and Dr. Parikh's easygoing lecture style. Sometimes, though, the course felt slightly unstructured in that I was never quite sure what information/themes from the lectures/power points were the most important. The quizzes in particular felt unpredictable to me, but the homework assignments helped me figure out what to focus on a bit. I particularly enjoyed the focus on epidemics throughout different regions in Africa, and I would have liked to learn a little more about field techniques used to gather data, monitor disease outbreaks, and treat patients in difficult-to-reach settings. ",
            "\u00a0Too many assessments. Did not find quizzes useful for learning. Great assignments and interesting final assignment. \r\n\r\nVery interesting course would recommend if student is interested in the topics. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - very straightforward, content-driven class, amazing instructor, not that much work\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - for the most part, lectures are just Sunil reading off slides, which can get boring, the material also repeats itself a bit ",
            "\u00a0This course has much potential, but is not executed properly. I can't say I learned new things about the three diseases. Most of the course was just statistics being rattled off. Additionally, the course was incredibly focused on malaria (5 weeks of malaria, 3 of HIV, and 3 of TB). However, we often didn't finish the lecture slides so what was only supposed to be 5 lectures on malaria ended up being much more. I wish there were more examples of cases, stories, or anecdotes discussed, rather than just statistics about the diseases.\r\n\r\nThe syllabus was changed at least 10 times with due dates being shifted quite often. I found it hard to keep up with the assignments/when they were due. The assignment due dates were pushed back because we didn't finish the lectures, but sometimes I didn't have time to wait for the topic to be discussed in lecture, so I had to do the assignment blindly, which resulted in lower grades. The quizzes (a new addition this year) were supposed to be on the \"nuts and bolts\" of the diseases. Instead, they involved incredibly minute details barely discussed in lecture. They ended up needing to be drastically curved because everyone would have failed. I felt like I did not get much out of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Great course, learned so much about such a wide, contemporary problem facing the world. Would liked to have a better thread connecting the Big 3 diseases and understanding why they are considered the Big 3, which seemingly implies that other diseases are less impactful. However, given that it is a term that exists outside of just Professor Parikh's syllabus, the course did a great job of tackling the problems it said it would explicitly. ",
            "\u00a0Really interesting class, but the assessment system needs to be improved. (Homeworks were long and quizzes were a little too specific.) ",
            "\u00a0The course was very comprehensive, which is a rare find at YSPH. This year, the quizzes were new and they were extremely specific and challenging. I would recommend broader scope quizzes or clarify expectations on what students should know to successfully complete quizzes. "

            "\u00a0Professor Parikh was great at presenting the information in a fascinating and engaging way, and helped us think critically about different studies and interventions, as well as historical precedents. His quizzes were extremely challenging, but they forced us to think more critically about the material. He was a wonderful professor and I really enjoyed the class. ",
            "\u00a0Very nice, some weaknesses in presenting material in lecture however.  The slides are usually just either epi data or maps of Africa. ",
            "\u00a0I think Dr. Parikh explains things well and takes his time to go over the concepts. I think his time management could be better so that we can get through all of his slides more. Overall, he is a good professor. ",
