            "\u00a0Really enjoyed a lot of the readings.\r\nA good general overview of epidemiology\r\nGreat lecturer in terms of charisma and knowledge and ability to explain difficult concepts\r\nImprovements suggested - lectures set out in a clearer manner - like biostatistics, so you can use the lecture notes as summaries of the topic. Don't freeze the room so much - had to take 2 sweaters to class every day in the middle of summer! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: It is an excellent course for public health people to take\r\nWeaknesses; Only one person presenting the course, so monotonous. \r\nImprovement: More even distribution of course material through the curriculum for example less time on studies and more on the other aspects which were rushed over during the last few classes like effect modification and confounding ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Mayur is a great instructor and make us think critically. He has useful examples from the literature and stimulates discussion in class.\r\nWeaknesses: A lot of important concepts and models are reviewed really fast in class although I understand that time is limited and that we can expand the concepts outside the class with books and articles. \r\nAnother weakness are the assignments feedback. These are really well done and applicable to our learning. I did my best to solve all the assignments and to apply the concepts that I thought I learned. However, my assignments scores were really low and my TA did not provided strong feedback so I felt my learning was not strong and felt frustrated with the assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Good course.  I really liked the instructor.  With a research background/inclination it was very thought provoking.  A couple students without a similar background, brought to my attention that the instructor assumed that some basic concepts were self explanatory and failed to address these which hindered their comprehension of the material.  The teaching assistant did not engage the class in any capacity --> she was not present during lectures, made no attempt to get to know us, and my sole interaction with her was her asking me to move from the space where I was studying so that she could have office hours. ",
            "\u00a0This course covered essential concepts of the epidemiology, and helped me to interpret public health journal articles in a more critical way. However, sometimes I felt the pace of the course was somewhat fast. I think it was because it was an accelerated course, and some of the concepts were related to biostatistics we did not learn. ",
            "\u00a0The course was helpful and useful. My one suggestion is on the pacing of the course as a whole - we spent a few weeks on course design, which I felt could have been condensed into fewer lectures. The concepts towards the end such as bias and confounding were a little rushed through as a result. ",

Given the nature of a lot of dual MPH/MBA students in the summer course, could be improved by ensuring content is completed before the MBA compulsory things begin ",

            "\u00a0This class was a helpful introduction to epidemiology. It is difficult to cover everything in the short summer semester, but I think the lectures are well designed. I think having the TF participate more in class would be a great improvement. Also, it might be beneficial to add a 5-minute break in the middle of the class to refresh mind. ",

I think having more practice problems available to try out before we had our final exam would have been helpful to ensure I was understanding the material correctly. "

There was no time for personal reading and understanding course material. ",

I really enjoyed the discussion held in class on relevant research studies and how he guided us through critiquing the papers. I like the general course structure, but it was quite fast-paced towards the end. Maybe throwing the simple OR, RR calculation lectures before going over all the study types. This way students can have more practice on calculation. ",
