            "\u00a0Dylan is a talented thinker and I have no doubt that he will become a great scholar and a marvelous professor. ",
            "\u00a0It would be helpful to have more time in section devoted to preparing for the quiz/tests. I think Sara's method of having someone assigned to present on the readings would also better facilitate discussion and create less tangents on to topics such as Buddhism ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Dylan brings a refreshing perspective to his sections. He is able to clearly articulate the abstract concepts in the text. He made sure every voice is heard in section, and I appreciate his helpful feedback on papers/quizzes.\r\n\r\nWeakness: our sections were often disorganized and didnt follow the weekly questions to prepare us for the quizzes. ",
            "\u00a0Great section leader. Harsh grader ",
            "\u00a0I loved how Sarah prepared each section with intentionality and creativity. Sometimes, I felt that a bit too much emphasis was given to Jewish thought, but not too much. ",
            "\u00a0Sarah was awesome!  She truly cares for the students and makes herself available for students to get help.  Thanks! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: organizing the classes well, showing respect for different voices. ",
            "\u00a0Sarah is brilliant. I am extremely grateful to have had section with her. Shes a great teacher and was always patient with me. She excels at creating an environment where discussion, questioning, and exploration are encouraged. ",
            "\u00a0She could be overly strict and demanding sometimes. However, it was clear she cared a great deal about students and understood the subject matter thoroughly. Her office hours and open communication was very appreciated. ",
            "\u00a0Sarah was an incredible Teaching Fellow who always had a plan for our discussions. This I would say was her greatest strength that she had a clear and concise teaching plan for each discussion. She also made herself available through office hours throughout the term making it easy on students to approach her and ask plenty of questions. She was exceptionally knowledgeable and a wonderful teaching. The only weakness I can attest too is that sometimes Sarah speaks incredible fast and I was not always able to keep up. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the innovative approach to discussion sections. They were always very task/skill focused which was much appreciated, in addition to an opportunity to engage in discussion. "
