            "\u00a0I learned so much about the art of Ancient Rome and also got a good idea of the history and politics of the period we studied. I now know about the artistic style of each emperor and period in Roman Art as well as the implications of that style. Now, I notice Roman influences on art and architecture everywhere I go and get a lot more out of going to museums. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about ancient roman culture and history. The course helped me develop my analytical skills. ",
            "\u00a0I have learned so much about Roman Art, from its chronological development, to the changing styles, to the influences, and the reflections of what was important to the Roman people throughout their history and how they expressed it in art. ",
            "\u00a0This class taught many art interpretation techniques that are quite applicable in our current political world that is so strongly tied to visual imagery. The portraiture analysis in this class teaches students to be more thoughtful and observant and to recognize underlying messages within art and state propaganda. ",
            "\u00a0A thorough survey of Roman sculpture and a good overview of history of Roman empire, as well as of Roman society, politics and religion. "

            "\u00a0This course is interesting and Professor Kleiner is clearly incredibly knowledgeable about the subject. The lectures are good, but I feel that the online discussion forum that stands in for section could be improved. It wasn't utilized much and didn't add much to the class until basically the last week when everyone was scrambling to get their 12 posts in. ",
            "\u00a0While I really appreciated having extra time to work on discussion section forum posts, I wonder if having a 1-post-a-week or 1-post-every-2-weeks requirement would help students to sustain and more deeply develop forum conversations throughout the whole semester. ",
            "\u00a0This course is not very engaging. While the material is super fascinating, the lecture style of the course does not lend to discussion and participation among the students. This led many of the students to be become less engaged as the semester went on. I also believe that there are too few assignments, which means there are too few opportunities for students to prove their knowledge about the course material in a fair manner. The course did not cause its students to grow in any manner, the class is almost entirely memorization. ",
            "\u00a0This course is particularly strong because it encourages students to discover for themselves, to make connections. Student observation of the art is key, so it allows more independent students to remark on works of art in their own ways. On the other hand, the bulk of the work for the class lies in being attentive in lectures and performing well on assessments, allowing for less margin of error. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very well-structured, and all the material was available and easily accessible on Canvas. The lectures were fantastic and we got a lot of help with the exams and final project.\r\nThe study trip with the whole class to YUAG would have been really exciting, since some of the monuments and portraits we studied are at YUAG.

            "\u00a0Yes, this course was interesting and taught by a great professor but had a relatively low workload. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This is a really fascinating class, Professor Kleiner is awesome, and Roman rulers are really fun to learn about. This course will challenge you to dissect the present moment in new, interesting ways. It will prompt you to think about state power and propaganda. It will encourage you to think critically about the spaces you enter and the art you encounter in the future. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but no. I would recommend this course to a student who is looking for a class with an easy workload, but may not end up with the greatest grade. While the class has very little work, it is hard to ensure a straight A in the course, the tests are more difficult than they should be. ",
            "\u00a0If you like history or art I would definitely recommend this course. I am not the biggest fan of either but I learned a lot about the subject and can now say that museum visits will be enhanced because I took this course. Overall I enjoyed it and would recommend it. The only difficult part was the9am start time. ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course to any Yale student. Though it is particularly relevant to Classics, Archaeology, and Art History majors, it has taught me so much about Roman Art and its development, and I would definitely encourage others to take it - they might be surprised by something more unorthodox to them. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to every student. The close analysis and observation it teaches are useful in all areas of study and helpful to anyone who seeks to be a well-informed citizen of the world. ",
            "\u00a0It's a really great course. Professor Kleiner is so inspiring. It's a 9 am and there's a lot you have to memorize for the exams, but I never regretted taking this course, and it's relatively easy if you put in the work! Take it! "
