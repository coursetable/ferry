            "\u00a0Microbiology techniques. Learn more about conjugation, antibiotic resistance, and identifying microbes in general. You learn to do various staining techniques. ",
            "\u00a0I found this lab was one of the most practical labs I have taken both in regards to the skills that we used and in regards to the content we were learning. I loved that we personalized the activities such as taking bacteria from our bodies or from common surfaces. ",

            "\u00a0I learned a lot about techniques for culturing microbes, analyzing microbes, identifying microbes, and more. Overall, great course. ",
            "\u00a0We learned a lot about microbes (mostly bacteria) by doing many different laboratory techniques - lots of culturing microbes, different biochemical assays, DNA testing, etc. The topics were fun and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Microbiology lab techniques - I think I have these down and will have a good background knowledge to be able to pick up tasks in microbiology labs if I went to one. ",
            "\u00a0This class was great for developing lab techniques in addition to learning how/when/why these techniques are used. The labs were split up into four different modules, each of which focused on different aspects of microbiology and required learning new techniques. The ones I found most common were plating agar plates and staining cells/ viewing them through microscopy. In addition, we learned how to extract DNA for a PCR, which is crucial. ",
            "\u00a0Outside of class, I work in a lab that mainly uses yeast as a model organism. In this lab class, I was really pleased to have a lot of exposure to working with bacteria instead, which sometimes require slightly different techniques. I thought it was especially useful for me to learn about the differential and selective agar media used to culture bacteria (for example, using MSA to isolate Staph species). Although I had learned the format and scientific writing style in a previous class, it was useful practice to write a few lab reports over the course of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Basic microbio lab skill set, how to write things up in a concise and clear report, how skills I learned in lab would be applied in the real world, simulating real-world problems to be solved in lab ",
            "\u00a0I learned applicable microbiology lab skills. My favorite labs had to do with taking samples from the environment and also from the human body. We followed each experiment from start to finish, and I think it really went well with our material from lecture. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a strong understanding of many of the tests used by clinical microbiologists to assist in identifying microorganisms as well as the basis for why each test is used. I also acquired and practiced many lab techniques including streaking for agar plates, deeps, and slants, various cell staining techniques, and other procedures. "

            "\u00a0It was fine. It was necessary but not as painful as other labs ",
            "\u00a0Strengths is the support you get during lab from professsor and TA. Weakness are the pop-quizzes. Would be better to have an online quiz before assigned day of lab to prepare. ",
            "\u00a0I didn't like that the quizzes were unannounced, but that is a strategic technique if you want to ensure the students read the handout. I also liked that it wasn't a heavy workload overall. ",
            "\u00a0The labs are well designed, do not take an excessive amount of time, and the lab environment is relaxed which I really enjoyed. ",
            "\u00a0Clear assignment. Short, but very informative lab sessions. Prof. Dawson is great to work with. ",
            "\u00a0Very well coordinated with the corresponding lecture class--techniques covered in lecture were then performed in this lab. Well-organized and well-taught. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: super interesting material, Dawson is a great professor, really engaging material.\r\nWeakness: Lab reports felt like feeling your way in the dark - grading was incredibly unclear and it wasn't obvious what they were looking for in the reports. ",
            "\u00a0It is very well designed. Often times, I went through the step by step process of the lab comprehending only vaguely what I was doing, but when I was writing a lab report in the style of a publication, I was forced to think critically about what I did, which meant I needed to understand the steps well. I think the course can be aided by a guideline on the lab report from the TA (who will be grading) from Lab Report 1. When Luying did this for subsequent lab reports in addition to Professor Dawson's general guidelines, this was very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0This class was really good at keeping students active each week - there was never any moment when we were sitting around watching or waiting for one person to finish using an instrument before we could use it. Instead, Professor Dawson was really great at having several experiments going at once, so if you couldn't image your slides on a microscope, you could at least be performing gram staining. I also really liked that the procedures were provided to us ahead of time so that we could be prepared and ready to go as soon as we walked into lab. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - wonderfully laid out, very clear structure with clear goals for what they wanted us to learn! I loved how labs carried over week-to-week and culminated in a report, and how we built on skills that we learned from the start of the semester and used them in each lab. I felt that the length of labs was very reasonable, and I very much appreciated that I felt like I could take my time and produce good quality data instead of feeling like I had to rush to finish everything in the lab on time and then produce worse quality results. It was clear what the goal was with each thing that we did, and how it was relevant.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - very few. I really enjoyed this course! ",
            "\u00a0I loved every experiment and thought the flow of the course was excellent. This was my favorite course of the semester. Professor Dawson put in time outside of the class to make sure everything ran smoothly. ",
            "\u00a0The course is excellently organized, and all of the labs have meaningful applications to real life. Dr. Dawson and the TA's were always ready to answer questions during lab, and we got to see some cool results from all of the labs. Lab reports were challenging, but doable. "

            "\u00a0The grading in this course is not straightforward. Instead of having exact reasons for docking points, the TA would grade on a overall scale. This meant it was incredibly difficult to increase my grade since one of the main things they looked for was your ability to write in the style of a scientific paper. This skill can obviously not be adequately developed in a few weeks, so holding this over students as the expectation is unreasonable. Additionally, there are no specific actions I can take to do better, so I ended up just giving up on the last lab report and I got the same grade range. A more clear grading scale is necessary. Also, the TA had a different standard than the professor which again was not clear with the lab reports. ",
            "\u00a0Its a decent lab class to take if you have taken microbiology, pretty interesting and not too time-consuming. ",
            "\u00a0Take if you want to learn staining techniques and other techniques necessary to identify microorganisms. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah I would recommend this course to another student. I think something helpful is to have a good relationship with the TA or make sure the TA is willing to send out guidelines about what they expect in regards to grading. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great lab option for MCDB students. 4 lab reports, 4 quizzes. The lab reports are very time consuming and the quizzes can vary in difficulty depending on which TA you have, but the lab course itself is well designed, engaging, and more relaxed than other labs. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Great MCDB lab! ",
            "\u00a0If you have to take a biology lab, this lab is well-organized and not too challenging on a day-to-day basis. Topics were relevant and engaging, and Professor Dawson was FANTASTIC--very prepared for each lab day and extremely responsive to questions. ",
            "\u00a0The course was awesome! You learn so much about microbes, the vast variety of them, and techniques for analyzing and identifying them. You take samples from your own microbiota (which was SO cool) and deduced what lives on/inside you. The only issue was that the grading/objectives in the lab reports wasn't entirely clear, and make sure to study for the few \"pop\" quizzes. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this lab. The topics and lab work were interesting, and it complemented the lecture course nicely. The work load is very manageable - four lab reports and a few quizzes. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely take this course as an introduction to laboratory techniques in a wet lab. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This course teaches crucial skills for working in labs involving microbes in a way that is engaging with the use of different modules that teach different techniques while emphasizing universal ones. ",
            "\u00a0This is a good introductory course to the world of research in bacteria. If you don't know how to culture, maintain, and extract information from bacterial species, then this class will teach you everything from the ground up. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this course! Prof Dawson is one of those amazing STEM professors who actually cares about you, and about the course. He and the TAs put in an incredible amount of time to have everything neatly set up for the students when they come to lab, and the syllabus and labs are clearly written. Unlike many other premed-req labs I'd taken at Yale, I never felt rushed to complete everything in a lab, so I actually had enough time to do everything and put in effort into quality of data, which was so relieving. The labs we did were interesting and fun. I really enjoyed this and thought it was one of the more stress-free, learning-oriented labs I've taken at Yale! ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student interested in microbiology or interested in medicine. I gained skills that I can use in other scientific areas. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is a great lab! Professor Dawson is great and super helpful. He always does so much to prep for the class so that the students do the relevant science and not have to watch too much time setting up things. The content is also pretty interesting and well organized. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this lab. You come out of with a lot of useful knowledge about how tests and procedures done in the clinical laboratory work and why they are important for healthcare. The labs themselves are occasionally long, but you are given advance warning for long labs; overall, you will typically be done within the 3 hour time slot. The lab reports are challenging, but you have plenty of chances to talk with or email your TA if you have questions, and the grading is fair. Overall, it is an enjoyable lab, and I highly recommend it for all premeds. "
