I wonder whether chapter-length perspectives from those might do better sprinkled through the syllabus rather than book-length in one week each. And for that matter maybe exposure to the direct critiques from political actors on the other side? \r\n\r\nThe instructor's inclusion of commentary on current events at the start - e.g. Catalonia, the Brexit negotiations - was insightful, and he brought an evident volume of knowledge on whatever was happening at any given time.\r\n\r\nSubsequent discussions tended to be very free-form, which sometimes could be good and sometimes could wander or drag. Maybe dividing the subject into sections somehow at the start and going through them sequentially might help? All that said, I learned a lot from the discussions and there was a really varied set of perspectives and experiences in the class - more than has been typical in most of my classes. ",
