            "\u00a0We picked off from L1, finishing chapters 6-13 of Al-Kitaab, and learnt a lot of grammar and vocabulary, and applied it in speaking, reading, listening and writing. ",
            "\u00a0Learn Arabic, a lot of Arabic, quickly. ",
            "\u00a0Continuation of building knowledge about Arabic grammar and vocabulary in mostly MSA with some Shaami ",
            "\u00a0An incredible foundation for the Arabic language. Well-developed speaking, writing, and listening skills, with a special emphasis on improving grammar. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much Arabic; this class was incredible. I am much further than I could have imagined this time last year. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a ton of Arabic skills during the course. The class is tough but I definitely learned new aspects of the language, especially in grammar. ",
            "\u00a0Learned how to speak, write, read, and listen to Arabic at the intermediate level. ",
            "\u00a0I deepened my knowledge of the Arabic language significantly and vastly improved my writing skills. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I really appreciate the combination of Modern Standard and Levantine Arabic; it keeps the class fresh on a daily basis and also enables students to get the broadest education possible. There is A LOT of work, though. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:  Ustaaza Elham is the best Arabic teacher Yale has had for a while, and pushes you to do to learn well. The class is well organized, there are a lot of resources available for help, and you are given enough opportunities to practice your Arabic.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Class sizes were rather large, so we perhaps missed out on having some more personal attention. This also meant that feedback was also returned late. Investing resources into the Arabic department is necessary! ",
            "\u00a0The textbook is badly organized. Each week is broken up with Mon-Thurs being taught by the professor, and Fridays being taught by TAs which is nice. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: speed, thorough, comfort speaking/writing/listening\r\nWeaknesses: Not enough teachers/classes so its hard for the teachers to keep up with homework, lots of work ",
            "\u00a0This is a very strong course that needs little improvement. The structuring of class time and TA sessions creates an environment wholly conducive to learning. ",
            "\u00a0There is a lot of work to do, but it always goes towards helping you learn. There are also a lot of students, but Elham did a wonderful job of keeping the class organized and still giving thoughtful attention and feedback. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that the class should be more discussion based, I feel like the lecture parts made class a bit too high strung at some points. Strengths of the class were definitely the constant feedback and review from ustaatha. The homework assignments were redundant and time consuming, I feel like they could be better if they were different. Such as writing a brief paragraph every night using new and old vocabulary words and developing questions for the next class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the mixing of both dialect and formal Arabic. Daily homework keeps students constantly engaged with the material. Thorough focus on all skills (reading, writing, speaking, listening). \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes homework was TOO much. Also grades were not given back in a timely manner (actually she of my test grades and assignment grades from weeks ago still have not been submitted even as SIS shows a final grade has been submitted). ",
            "\u00a0Cant be improved. The course is excellent as is. "

            "\u00a0Yes! At least with Elham, the language is taught very well. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely! If Elham is teaching it, don't hesitate (but of course be ready for a lot of work). ",
            "\u00a0YEssss take Arabic it's great ",
            "\u00a0Yes! But only if they are interested in taking the time to learn Arabic. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend because I learned a lot. But part of the reason this class was so incredible is because of Elham, and since I don't think she is teaching it next semester, I don't know if it will be as good. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would, this question is a bit different considering that its a L2 language class, but Ive recommended thats other students take Arabic. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. There is not a better place to learn Arabic. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class! There was a ton of work but its worth it! I hope the rest of the department adopts Elhams teaching style so that we can continue to learn as much as we did with her. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. Its a well taught course that facilitates learning and Im a big proponent of studying Arabic. "
