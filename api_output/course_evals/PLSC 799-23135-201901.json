            "\u00a0I felt like I left the course with a deep understanding of the natural experiment methodology, but more importantly with a broader understanding of the nature of causal research in general. By the end of the course, I began to be able to discern between well-executed studies that present convincing theories and evidence and weaker studies. I feel like I could now come up with experimental designs on my own and evaluate them. I also appreciated the practical focus of the course. The GIS assignment and the text analysis tutorials were hugely helpful. "

            "\u00a0I really liked the way the syllabus was divided up. Reading several different approaches to one subject was a really effective way to teach us how to evaluate research designs. It also made it so you could see the evolution of the field and understand the current important questions. I also appreciated the practical focus of the course. The GIS assignment and the text analysis tutorials were hugely helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked this course but I would have liked to have learned about qualitative methods in more detail, especially how to incorporate qualitative data into a quantitative project. We did cover this in terms of text analysis, and it would have been great to have hands on experience with other examples. "

            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. One helpful aspect was that it gave such a broad overview of different subjects and research questions. While focusing on a particular set of tools, we were able to see how they would apply to questions from all over the field. This left me feeling like I had a real sense of what the important questions are in the field, something that usually takes years to start to understand. I would also recommend it because it helped me think of several projects I want to undertake on my own and made me believe I could accomplish them. ",
