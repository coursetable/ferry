We were taught about different empirical methods used to conduct economic research and what kinds of scenarios these methods are most appropriate in.  We also read many economic research papers not only to learn what the conclusions of the results were but to have a chance to critique them and think critically about how to write a good economic research paper.

            "\u00a0lectures very clear and thorough ",
            "\u00a0This course is great! No changes! ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: It can be a lot of work since it is 3 papers, a midterm, and a final exam. If you spread out the papers throughout the seamster you should be fine. ",
            "\u00a0Need prior knowledge of econometrics. Should have mentioned more. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the last few topics we discussed - I thought that they were fascinating. \r\n\r\nI think that just timing wise, there were some topics that we rushed through but were featured heavily on exams. ",
            "\u00a0This course was super cool! I really liked it. The material was engaging without being too much work. \r\n\r\nThe only problem is that the grading scheme for papers was so TA dependent. \"Nice TAs\" would give out more As for papers than \"mean TAs\" so it really depended on who happened to be assigned to grade that topic which is a bit ridiculous and not particularly fair. ",
            "\u00a0The material is slightly boring and repetitive. The whole course is centered on 11 different topics throughout US history, but each topic is just reading/discussing the methods and findings of various econ history papers. The critiques get a little repetitive and lecture can feel like paper summaries. ",
            "\u00a0Bring back Prof. Lewis. Hes so wonderful, really cares about his students, and covers a lot of American economic history in a single semester. ",
            "\u00a0Good class ",
            "\u00a0The material is interesting but just very high in volume; if we spent more time diving into the papers, models and economics, students would feel less pressured to make this a last-minute memorization course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: decently interesting material, clear lecturer\r\nWeaknesses: talking about slavery/race in America when there are very few non-white non-Asian students in the class is uncomfortable ",
            "\u00a0I really liked it! I think it's more work than the average econ class, but honestly didn't think it was too bad. Maybe the midterm could be removed and the final could be made longer? ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the class, however didn't have much prior experience with empirical techniques and econometrics. I found it hard to critique research papers when I wasn't sure what techniques were used and why in the first place. ",
            "\u00a0It was overall a very good course. ",
            "\u00a0Very good at making quantitative, math-heavy research into easy to understand, qualitative material. Professor Lewis does a good job of explaining the math that is behind the research that allows to have this historical knowledge of what caused what in American economic history, but  it is not necessary to the course in any way shape or form. No real weaknesses that I could see, other than maybe a bit more guidance on the papers. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, the strengths of this course were that it allowed students to learn a great deal about American Economic History through a lens of research. I think it could be improved a little by cutting the research papers down a little (maybe take one out per unit) and focus more on background for the periods as well as the implications of the research. We discussed the researches conclusions but I wish we discussed more what this meant more for America in the long run. Additionally, this class could be improved by having each student's TA grade their papers. Overall, I felt grading was somewhat inconsistent across TAs and by having the same person grade a students work that student can better learn what the TA is looking for. ",
            "\u00a0I think one big strength of the course is that the material of the course is interesting and the workload is not too overwhelming. ",
            "\u00a0A weakness would be that the papers were not that interesting and often lacked a clear focus or explanation. They were also not that approachable, even from someone who has already taken econometrics. ",
            "\u00a0the papers were challenging because some of the papers were hard to come up with original critiques for. Also I know many of the students, myself included, felt odd having to critique these papers because we were not qualified. When I used critiques mentioned in class my grade was penalized. The questions on the midterm and to some extent on the final exam were also phrased in ways that made it hard to understand what kind of answer was wanted. ",
            "\u00a0This course has a lot of dense content, so if it were broken down a little bit more it would be easier to process. ",
            "\u00a0More interactive, seminar style would probably be a lot better but all in all still slightly engaging. ",
            "\u00a0More feedback ",
            "\u00a0The material in this course is very interesting and every topic was substantial ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course was the instructor. I felt that Professor Lewis's teaching was incredibly engaging. The biggest weakness of the course was engagement -- the students weren't as engaged with the course because it was a large lecture, and it is an aspect which could be improved. ",
            "\u00a0Very dry because only look at papers/studies. Could be spiced up a little or taught a little more enthusiastically with more variety. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:  ability to apply what you've learned in other economic courses in real-world and historical settings\r\nWeaknesses:  material is somewhat dry and depends on your level of interest in topic (e.g. Civil War/Reconstruction, Great Depression, health standards/fertility, etc.) ",
            "\u00a0I thought the teacher's enthusiastic presentation of each lecture was a big plus. The material can be admittedly a little dry, but the right lecturer can make all the difference. He also made sure that all the materials and assignments were organized, something I've really learned to appreciate here at Yale. Lastly, the ability to choose which 3 of the 11 topics to write your essays on was a BIIIIIIIIG plus. I would not have learned as much nor have been able to write essays as well if that option was not available. "

It may seem like a lot of work on paper, but if organize your semester it is quite relaxed, because there are no psets. It is also just a cool mix of history and economics and gives an interesting introduction to a new sector. ",

            "\u00a0Yes!! I loved this course and learned so much both in terms of general economics, econometrics, and American history. Ive taken two WR already and hate writing, but the course more than made up for that! Professor Lewis is an outstanding Professor. It was my favorite class and I was actually sad every time when it ended. It wouldnt be the same with a different Professor, and I think they alternate for the course so maybe look into that though. ",
            "\u00a0Good ",

            "\u00a0If you are interested in the economic history of the United States or are an econ major that needs a writing credit, then definitely.  Otherwise, I would recommend shopping it and trying to feel it out a bit.  It is definitely not a good fit for everyone. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you need a writing requirement or need it for the Econ major. Professor Lewis was great, but I don't think they've been as good in the past, and it is a rotating professor. ",
            "\u00a0Decent writing credit for an econ major. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, this course and simple and interesting ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student, if they're looking for an elective as a history major. As an economics major, it is not as related to the specific practice of economics and you might expect, but only conceptually related. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely. It's a great course for people interested in history or economics, or both. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are interested in the subject. If not, it is very dry. ",
            "\u00a0a good course to pick if you need a WR credit and/or ECON elective ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this student for two reasons: 1) I believe every econ major should have a basic understanding of economic history, and 2) I have yet to encounter a course that allows you to practice applying economic theory to the analysis of real world problems as much as this class.
