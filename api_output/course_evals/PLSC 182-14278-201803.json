            "\u00a0Learned about international cooperation and the mechanisms for solving cooperation problems. The first part of the course was spent on international cooperation theory and why fundamentally it is hard to achieve cooperation/what mechanisms are in place to counteract it while the second half focused on real world examples and expanding our understanding of historical/modern international cooperation. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about theories of international cooperation, especially about realist theory, structural realist, constructivist theory, etc....Through the readings, I learned to identify which theory was being utilized in a particular argument. ",
            "\u00a0In depth introduction to international relations and the international realm ",
            "\u00a0This was one of my favourite classes at Yale to date. The readings were always so interesting and Professor Pratt broke down and presented the complexities of international cooperation in a very comprehensible way-- coming from someone who did not have much background knowledge on international law and relations. The first part of the course is pretty basic theory that I felt equipped me with such an interesting and useful toolkit to approach really any international cooperation problem. The course also goes into detail about how major international organizations function and gives you the space to evaluate the existence, or lack thereof, of the same. Loved this class and would definitely take it again if I could! ",
            "\u00a0The mechanics of the international system from a historical and political perspective. ",
            "\u00a0In this class, I was exposed to the world of international politics and even more generally how to think like a political Scientist. I learned about numerous theories in the scholarship and different institutional organizations and how they function. Beyond the content area, I developed critical thinking skills and application skills. ",
            "\u00a0Understanding of international organizations, why it occurs and why it is difficult to achieve ",
            "\u00a0This class was a really good introduction to how international cooperation works and how it looks in practice. The course was organized pretty well, with most of the theory in the first half and introductions to major institutions that facilitate international cooperation in the last half. ",

            "\u00a0This course was fantastic and I loved every bit of it. The material was very interesting, the professor was super engaging and made it all easy to understand. The only weakness, if it can be called that, was there was a lot of material per lecture so we frequently went over or did not have time to complete it all. I would just say that perhaps it can be portioned better but I did not mind since it was so enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0The first part of the semester was extremely vague, and I didn't really understand what I was supposed to be getting out of the course. At that point, everything seemed theoretical, and it was difficult to engage with the readings. At least for the first part of the semester, there was too much reading. The amount of reading in the first half of the semester was equivalent to the readings in a higher level seminar. After we got into more applications of theory, I was able to comprehend more of what had been taught. The readings are excellent, and I hear them referenced in my other political science classes quite often. The professor is adept at explaining complex subjects. However, sometimes he would spend too much time explaining simple ideas and not enough time explaining complex ideas. ",
            "\u00a0The amount of reading is higher than in a normal class but this was understood from the beginning and good summaries of the most important pieces are provided. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were extremely clear and conveyed the theory, policy, and framework of the international system. More focus and case studies on how to increase cooperation would be extremely helpful. ",
            "\u00a0This course started off rather reading heavy in the beginning of the semester, often more than I could manage and I fell behind in the beginning. But after the first midterm, the reading shifted a lot into less dense, more applied, and additional forms of media beyond the written word, and the class got a lot better and more manageable. Possibly making the reading load a little less heavy in the beginning when the content is so dense will be very helpful and make the class much more manageable. ",
            "\u00a0An amazing lecture and great professor, awesome discussion section\r\n\r\nMore class involvement/ presentations ",
            "\u00a0I think this class was very straightforward, and the content was presented very clearly. I personally thought the readings were a bit longer than they needed to be, but the lectures were interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Had helpful/engaging readings, thorough lectures. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: applicability to current events, always good to be aware of what is going on in the world and how it can be improved\r\nweakness: lecture heavy, a lot of material covered each class so not much time for questions "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend if you are interested in gaining a solid understanding of international cooperation. The course goes over all the basic concepts/literature and provides a great foundation. ",
            "\u00a0Ultimately, I would recommend this course, as it has so many great readings that are crucial to any political science major's repertoire. Grin and bear it through the first part of the course. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in political science or global affairs who wants a strong basic understanding of the economic, social, and political factors that affect international cooperation. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Really good professor. Would definitely recommend to anyone interested in foreign policy or international relations. We covered a lot of IR basics and theory as well as more complicated aspects of the international realm and practical applications of theories of cooperation. ",
            "\u00a0This is the best introductory international relations class at Yale, hands down. It combines the framework and history of the subject in a way that provides solutions to international challenges. As an incoming student in the field, this is a great class to see whether or not youd find it interesting. I can guarantee you will. Professor Pratt also goes to great lengths to apply the content to the real world; each class begins with a discussion of current events. Id highly, highly recommend taking this course as a first or second year student interested in the field, or as an upperclassmen who needs to refocus their studies/thoughts in preparation of a senior thesis. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is a great class. Professor Pratt did a great job this semester. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a great, a lot to learn and apply and is crucial for any student thinking about the role that they play in this rapidly globalizing world. ",
            "\u00a0Yes it was an amazing political science class ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course if you are interested in learning about what international cooperation is, how it works, and where it exists in international politics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Course is exactly what it sounds like and provides a generally applicable framework through which to view subsequent global affairs / political science classes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes -- interesting course material and helpful global perspective ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely. The readings and theories addressed throughout the course have helped elevate my understanding of the foundational mechanisms of cooperation in global politics and law. Professor Pratt did an amazing job cultivating a class environment that felt open and engaging, and I genuinely looked forward to coming to class. "
