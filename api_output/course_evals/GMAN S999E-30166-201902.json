            "\u00a0Reading ability of German, especially through translating sentences and paragraphs into English. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to strategize approaching a text written in German; having reviewed the basic grammatical forms and rules, I developed facility in looking words up and understanding from context and case rules. ",
            "\u00a0By taking this course, I developed skills for reading German.  I learned about German grammar and vocabulary in order to translate words, phrases, and sentences from German to English. ",
            "\u00a0My reading skills in German were greatly strengthened by this course, which did a great job compressing a lot of potentially complex material into its own month-long format while foregrounding the most important practical knowledge for academic research. The class also did a great job maintaining an interdisciplinary vocabulary so that students from across a range of different subject areas will benefit from the training. ",
            "\u00a0Can read basic german now, and know where to find things if I hit a passage that seems to contain something unfamiliar. ",
            "\u00a0Over the course of five weeks I learned German grammar in order to break down and read a sentence and began to build my vocabulary. ",
            "\u00a0A working knowledge of German grammar, syntax, and vocabulary, a set of procedures for translating numerous sorts of writing from German with a dictionary, a sense of how the language works and how to approach a range of constructions it often uses. ",
            "\u00a0The course did its job well, by which I mean that, at the end, I felt fairly confident that I would be able to make my way (albeit very slowly) through any German text that I'd encounter in my research. I felt that I had a good basic vocabulary, good knowledge of verb forms/tenses, and a good sense of German sentence structure, though a weak grasp of adjective forms and noun endings. That had more to do with the sheer difficulty of the German declension system, and the small amount of time spent discussing it in the textbook, than with any fault in the course. \r\n\r\nAll that being said, I do think that we ought to have a broader discussion about foreign language requirements for graduate students. Learning one (or more) languages is very important, even for students whose work will be almost entirely in English--partly because it's important to engage with academic traditions outside of our own. But it's only possible to acquire a very, very limited knowledge of a language in a semester; and what with Google translate and other online tools, I think it's questionable whether or not it's even worth spending the time to get to that limited level of understanding, without any followup or intention to learn more of the language. Many of the students who I spoke to after the course was over told me that the felt they STILL didn't really know German. Either the requirement ought to be made more rigorous, or it should be eliminated. Imposing it in a token way is insulting to those who teach the languages and a waste of time for students. Obviously there are financial considerations. Perhaps a way of doing this that would minimize this problem would be to allow graduate students to take undergraduate language courses as a way of satisfying the language requirement, which I think is currently discouraged.

            "\u00a0This online course is very flexible. Offered in the summer, one can take it anywhere and anytime desired. But not being there in class with classmates and instructors rules out spontaneous questions. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were its clear guidelines for completing assignments on time, its helpful PowerPoint videos to accompany chapters, and its excellent team of instructors. ",
            "\u00a0The course design was structured well, working to convey a considerable density of information at a pace that was manageable to absorb. The instructors were friendly and helpful, and the feedback on assignments generally offered useful guidance.\r\n\r\nThe flexibility granted by the online format was a great asset, although at times, it felt as if it could stand in the way of communication as well as facilitate communication. It could be harder to deal with some of the basic, day-to-day questions that might come up in a language classroom, those times when being able to point to the page and explain your own thinking aloud is easier than typing it into an e-mail message or forum posting. It just might have been nice, and made things a bit less awkward, to have a face to put the name to, if only from an opening orientation day or something.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed the course overall, though, and learned quite a lot. Thanks to the prof, and the grad TF's, who I know must have been kept very busy! ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated that this course was self-paced but would have liked some built-in time for the whole class to come together, perhaps an online lecture where we were expected to log-in at the same time. I think something like this might help clarify questions and concerns with greater speed than emails and voice discussion threads. Furthermore, I would be grateful if the German Department considered offering the reading course during a regular 13-week semester. I think it would have helped me absorb the concepts and vocabulary over time. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was excellentboth Prof. Schenker and the teaching fellows who commented on my translations, Elisa Ronzheimer and Thorsten Wilhelm, gave a tremendous amount of thorough and clarifying feedback on every daily written assignment. I'd never have expected I would get such prompt and extensive line-by-line notesI was very grateful for that. I was grateful too for the course's self-paced structure and for the care Prof. Schenker and the TFs took to make sure we had opportunities to raise and clarify whatever confusions we had. ",
            "\u00a0Given the obvious limitations of working online, I thought that the course was quite effective; though I think that there might be better ways of encouraging people in the class to get to know each other than creating weekly videos. This was fun but time consuming (certainly not practical to watch everyone's video), and the questions asked (one, I think, was \"what is your favorite translation tool?\") tended to prompt a series of the same answers from every respondent. I think collaborative translation activities (when we commented on each other's translations in Google Docs, for instance) were more effective at prompting dialogue between students and at giving us a sense of who else was in the class. \r\n\r\nIn a similar vein, the chapter videos (which were, admittedly, optional), while useful in giving a second exposure to the material (in addition to reading the textbook), were basically verbatim repetitions of the chapter--that is, they didn't generally communicate any *new* information. \r\n\r\nThe system of translating with Google docs worked very well.

            "\u00a0Yes, because it helps one build an important specific skill (German reading) and general skills like time management if you take it during the summer. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student as long as that student had lots of time.  This course is accelerated, so it really can be one of the only things that a student does while enrolled.  The instructors were very accommodating when I had to have some extra time due to a death in my family, but under normal circumstances, this course takes up most of the student's time.  If the student is determined and ready for a difficult few weeks, the course is a good decision. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend the class! It's a great introduction to the language on a short timeframe. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! For the reasons outlined aboveif they'd like to get a basic foundational reading knowledge of German I'd definitely recommend this. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course, though see above: you must keep up with the language after the course is over, or your five weeks will have been a waste of effort. "
