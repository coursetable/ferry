            "\u00a0Improved exposition, dialogue, and overall writing skills. Most significantly, improved ability to read fiction in a craft-oriented lens. ",
            "\u00a0I dont think I really became a better writer, mainly because I think thats all about practice. But I did learn a lot of tips and tricks for writing fiction, but obviously thats not going to make you an amazing fiction writer. ",
            "\u00a0How to read and write fiction from a critical perspective, and how fiction as a craft is structured by the author. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read writing from the perspective of an author, to evaluate every word, phrase and sentence as a choice and not just a word, sentence or phrase that \"appeared\". I learned how to write using these skills, to take care in every word I write. I learned to put characters first, to make sure everything is a narrative and has a clear conflict before everything else, and how to write in order to ensure people will want to actually read. ",

            "\u00a0This is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale! Prof Sexton is great at leading the class discussion. The critiques towards the end are really helpful to learn hands on about writing. The reading load varies a lot week to week, and I wish I had been able to engage more with some of the readings, but the discussions were always interesting. Honestly, can't really see how this course could be improved. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the teaching. Professor Sexton is really engaging and supportive when it comes to creating your final project. To improve, some discussions could have been led with more control to ensure we covered all the material in the allotted time. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Sexton is awesome, quirky, funny, and a great teacher. The writing exercises are extremely helpful.\r\nWeaknesses: The fact that we only write one full short story and the length of the texts. I think that reading the full texts did not necessarily help my writing more than reading part of those texts would have done, and I rather would have read a greater diversity of guides to writing craft instead. ",
            "\u00a0Its strengths are the writing workshops, and its weakness is in the amount of readings we sometimes have to do in only 2 days or so. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the selected readings in this course are great. Many of the books Id heard of, but never read. Overall it was pretty well organized although sometimes I thought it was unrealistic to expect us to read a full 300 page novel in 3 days. I also really enjoyed workshopping everyones stories and getting a taste of everyones styles.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I felt that the class discussions were slightly inorganic on Professor Sextons end. I think the class would benefit if he switched up the readings because sometimes it appears he came to class with a script for the discussion, and he had been using that for countless semesters before. Professor Sexton was engaging, but oddly felt disingenuous at times, and I feel that could be because hes bored with the material. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the workshop aspect of this course! It was so helpful to hear other students' input and help each other craft short stories that grew better and better. ",
            "\u00a0This course uses novels and short stories very successfully to tie into a greater discussion of fiction writing. The writing exercises are also very helpful for development of students' individual skills. The class had a tendency to overextend at times, so we weren't able to get to some of the books on the syllabus. ",
            "\u00a0Taught as a small seminar, you are constantly reading and writing and being held accountable for your responses and your work, while freely bouncing ideas around in an open discourse that was allowed in the class. We read amazing books and got great assignments to pair with our readings, as well as the Master Class book that drove the whole class. I probably would've liked a few more writing assignments to work a little more on my craft and get responses, but I also understand why we had only 7-8 in order to make sure we put care into each work. ",
            "\u00a0It was really helpful to deconstruct our idea of what a story is through Professor Sexton's book. At times, it felt like we didn't refer back to it enough or integrate specific aspects of the chapters into what we were reading. "

            "\u00a0Yes - despite the low workload this course provides valuable information for students interested in writing fiction. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This was a great class! I got to read some classics without the pressure of analyzing them in a literature class or having to write essays about them. Also, Prof Sexton's approach to teaching writing is extremely practical. I find myself analyzing movie dialogue and thinking about whether it is believable. I've never written fiction before, so it could be challenging at some points, but it was always fun! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to any student interested in creating fiction regardless of whether they have experience with writing or not. Professor Sexton is great and the readings are interesting. Be warned that it does take a fair amount of time to read all the readings some weeks. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's a lot of fun and a great way to improve your writing! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are looking for an easy class, this is good. The readings are also great; I would actually read them in my free time. Professor Sexton is nice and the writing assignments arent obnoxiously long. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Professor Sexton's syllabus was composed of an impeccably-curated collection of texts that enriched my understanding of the key concepts of fiction writing, and the time spent workshopping each others' essays really helped me fine-tune my own sense of reading and writing narratives. ",
            "\u00a0Yes- The course is very interesting for anyone who likes fiction, even for people who are not writers or majoring in English. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I feel this is a great English course to take for all writers, both English majors and not, as it teaches all literature from a brand new perspective. You learn to read from the purpose of the author instead of the purpose of the reader. You also learn to write much better with much more intent on every word. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who wants an introduction to fiction writing. The readings are interesting and Professor Sexton gives you a lot of time to write your final paper. "
