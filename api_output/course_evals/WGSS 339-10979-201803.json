            "\u00a0Most importantly, I came away from this course with a much broader understanding of the evolving roles of gender and sexuality in Western literature and society since the 18th century. In addition, I improved my close reading and analytical writing skills. I also enjoyed practicing my research skills for the course's final assignment. All in all, this course presents a diverse range of opportunities and challenges and required me to think critically, and in different ways, about some of the world's -- and literature's -- most urgent social and political questions. ",
            "\u00a0This course really expanded my view of literature as a medium of social change. I learned to be more aware of narratives that traditionally have been lacking in the canon. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about how to connect the themes, questions and voices of works from separate periods of time. By that, I mean that I was able to understand the ways in which literature and history are deeply intertwined, and how the Picture of Dorian Gray and Sula, for example, both commented on the treatment of the woman in literature, but in vastly different ways. I became much more conscious of my own writing and its strengths and flaws as I analyzed these connections. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Homans is really willing to work with you on papers/read drafts and talk over ideas which I think helped my writing a lot. She really gives comprehensive criticisms and I appreciated that a lot. ",
            "\u00a0-Critical reading of key texts in various feminist movements\r\n-Comparative analysis of literary texts\r\n-Incorporating social and historical context into the analysis of a work "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I really liked the three-paper syllabus, with each assignment asking something different of students -- from a close reading to a comparative analysis to a research-based essay. I also enjoyed the works we read. In particular, I appreciated seeing how the course's themes evolved over the term -- observing how different works talk to one another, whether by means of criticism or revision. One weakness of the course is the speed with which we read some works. For example, I am not sure you can really do justice to Jane Eyre reading it in just one week. That said, the fast pace allowed us to cover more ground and approach a deeper understanding of the evolution of gender and sexuality into 21st century literature. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: class discussion, engaging Professor, interesting readings \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: it was very challenging to keep up with the readings at some points ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n-Selection of texts was incredible! I loved the readings for this seminar as they exposed me to writers and movements that I had either heard of briefly before or never heard of. I have gained so much from the breadth of the readings. \r\n-Work load - I really appreciated the structure of the class so that the heavy reading was mainly for Tuesdays (which gave us the weekend to finish the novels) and the shorter articles or excerpts were for Thursdays ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are the reading material, Prof. Homans's kind and compassionate attitude toward her students, and Prof. Homans's flexibility with the course's direction. I really enjoyed the class, and I feel I learned a lot from it. However, I think class discussion could be improved by sending out discussion topics in advance or requiring reading responses. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend! The material is fascinating, the syllabus is well and carefully crafted, and Homans is deeply knowledgeable and skilled at dissecting the texts. She's extremely conscientious and makes sure that we're covering all aspects of the texts we read and topics into which we delve, with women of color being heavily featured in the syllabus, and the intersection of race and gender a recurring theme. She's also extremely committed to her students' success and intellectual development, and is more than willing to go above and beyond to help her students (meeting, reading drafts, discussing topics). The only downsidesometimes it felt as if Homans had a way she wanted the discussion to go, which meant it wasn't as free-flowing and student-directed as it could have been. There would be disagreements or discussions that felt as if they had the potential to continue on and delve further, but we were then redirected to another topic. However, given that Homans is brilliant and has studied these works in depths, the places she steered us towards were more often than not very interesting and fruitful. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course, even if just to work closely with Professor Homans. She is an absolute powerhouse, and was just a joy to learn with and from. Go to office hours! Talking with her - about papers, about the material, about politics, etc - was one of the highlights of this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This class is a wonderful survey of gender and sexuality in literature -- and a helpful investigation of the overlaps among literature, society, and politics. Every work on the syllabus is a must read. And, most of all, Professor Homans is a fantastic professor. She is brilliant and deeply cares about each and every student. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I loved every moment of this course. I would just warn the student that the reading load is extremely heavy. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! It is intellectually challenging, and a significant amount of reading. You have to know that it will not be easy going in, but that it will challenge you, and Professor Homans will certainly make you a better thinker and writer. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Conversation was great, and the reading list was fantastic. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to English and WGSS majors, as well as anyone who enjoys reading literature and getting to know more about the topics covered. ",
            "\u00a0Would definitely recommend! Professor Homans is delightful, and all the material covered is really fascinating. "
