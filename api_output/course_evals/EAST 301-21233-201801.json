            "\u00a0This course was an eye-opener in how history is meant to be learned. I really felt like there wasn't a \"curriculum\", but a set of sources that show the complexity of history itself. ",
            "\u00a0WOW WOW WOW this class is so amazing!!! As an EAS double major concentrating in China, it is so important to know about Japan and this was the perfect class to get a taste of the region. I really learned to consider history from different perspectives rather than purely just the mainstream-- Prof Drixler has a really kind soul and heart so he really pushes us to look at history critically but with an open heart and compassion. It means so much when you learn about history but then can tie it to the human condition. ",
            "\u00a0The course by definition sounds really niche--one specific country in one 250-year period of time. That said, you will probably be hard-pressed to find a better introduction to history or history elective. Many people in the class are not history majors and mostly initially there for the rating/workload ratio, but it's literally the kind of class that turns people into double history majors or reinforces their commitment to the subject. Professor Drixler makes the course as accessible as possible, with interesting lectures, good readings, 2 painless 1500-word essays, and fair exams (though then, your hand will cramp afterwards from the amount of writing). You learn so much about Japanese history, but also so much about how history is actually approached by historians (contingency reaccs only). ",
            "\u00a0Best of both worlds, historical depth and breadth. You also get a good idea about how people lived at the time rather than just the political machinations of big figures/the shogunate. ",
            "\u00a0Hist 307 is a good introductory history lecture. Drixler covers a lot of the foundational concepts and themes that historians work with and think about. ",
            "\u00a0Aside from learning the history of a geographic region that I had little knowledge of, this course (and Professor Drixler) pushed me to question many global assumptions about historical narratives that I was bringing to the class and I learned how to parse and examine these more closely in determining what is universal and what is unique in the human historical experience. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt a lot about the history of Japan from the Jomon period all the way up to the Tokugawa period. The course placed a lot of emphasis on the latter and really worked towards equipping us with a granular understanding of what life was like in the Tokugawa period. The readings were always really interesting (the best one by far was Musui's Journey) and added to the lecture content very well. A true testament to this course is the fact that despite missing a few lectures, I was able to catch up on the required reading and level of understanding completely due to the level of thought and care put into designing the class by Prof. Drixler.  The class gave me a solid primer on how to write an academic (super short!) essays in a history context as well. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt a lot about the history of Japan from the Jomon Period to the Tokugawa Period. The majority of the class focused on the latter and I left leaving the course feeling like I had a granular understanding of what life was like for people during the Tokugawa period. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about this time period in Japan. ",
            "\u00a0Exposed me to a part of the world and its history I was largely ignorant of--it was such a delight to enter class each day and experience Professor Drixler's imaginative, gripping way of capturing the class' attention. Loved Professor Drixler's historiographical approach...always thinking about the lessons we can learn in our own time from analyzing the Tokugawa period in a different way. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a whole lot about Japanese history! ",
            "\u00a0This class gave me a a general sense of ancient Japanese history, and a solid grounding from around 1000 to the Meiji Restoration. It also addressed more general themes in historical thought, like contingency vs. determinism. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about a part of the world I'd never studied before, and saw how art, literature, and material culture can provide information about this time period. ",
            "\u00a0A very in-depth study of Tokugawa Japan. First one third of the course is a mostly chronological overview of how the Tokugawa peace was consolidated, starting from the Sengoku period. The second third of the course is more thematic, and deals with the issue of sustainability in Tokugawa Japan, be it demography or ecology, the way society functioned in Tokugawa Japan, etc. The last third of the course deals with how Tokugawa Japan dealt with other countries/powers, and is a more chronological overview that ends at the Meiji Restoration. Insights gained include how to think about societies that are radically different from ours, and how the historical example of Tokugawa Japan might be an impetus for radically rethinking our assumptions about the present, such as demographic transition theory, etcetera. ",
            "\u00a0A strong understanding of Japanese culture, history, and our current imagination of it in the West. Excellent course. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of dense history about this period of history. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about ancient and pre-modern Japanese history, a topic I was not well-versed in at all before taking this class. We focused on the Tokugawa or Edo period primarily, and it was so interesting to learn about how peace came to be established and how it was maintained when many history classes can be about nations during times of war and conflict. ",
            "\u00a0Besides an detailed knowledge of Tokugawa era culture and survey of Japanese history, I gained a better understanding of the study of history and its importance.  This class enlightened me on diversity and universality of the human condition from the case study of Tokugawa Japan. ",
            "\u00a0Great insights into Japanese history and culture! ",
            "\u00a0Average course but able to gain the ability on note taking from little information. ",
            "\u00a0This class gives a great overview of Japanese history during the Edo period and was a great intro to history course at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0An illuminating survey of Japanese history up until the end of the Edo period, and the ways we can use such history to analyze other regions and concepts in world history. Some of the papers had creative prompts, and I enjoyed the challenge of writing non-conventional essays (like designing a museum exhibit). ",
            "\u00a0This class is billed as an intro course to Japanese history - and certainly it filled that. But more than that, I appreciated the lessons in how a country can be governed in such a way as to avoid major conflict for over two hundred years. The concepts of omote and naisho also show us that even in Tokugawa society, all was not necessarily as it seemed on the surface. I was amazed at how many of the concepts and policies we learned about in this course could be applied to my own studies of modern European history. An outstanding course. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about the historical development of Japan up until the Meiji Restoration. Super fun and interesting class! ",
            "\u00a0This course provided an overview of early modern Japanese history. Due to the well-documented nature of this time period, we were able to cover a wide variety of topics in relation to life during this time, across social classes, different regions, and different aspects of life including foreign relations, material culture, urbanization, etc. Overall, it was a basic history course so we also gained some experience reading historical sources, both primary and secondary, and making arguments. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt so much about premodern East Asian history and how to study time periods from different perspectives. ",
            "\u00a0On top of an immense gain of knowledge of early modern Japan, I learned a great deal about connecting historical events across the globe with common themes and how to interpret singular events as those of both inevitability and contingency. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about Tokugwa Japan! I feel very comfortable with the material and have developed a much more nuanced view of history in general. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This course is certainly very fun, and the professors and TAs are top-notch. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: lectures are super organized and thematic, the teaching style is great, very cohesive, you walk away really having a solid grasp of the time period so long as you put in the work!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Prof Drixler has a tendency to go about 5 minutes over every lecture, which isn't such a big deal to me but might be annoying for students who have class directly after ",
            "\u00a0Though the lectures are all great, some of the topics were a bit less interesting than others, although Prof. Drixler as a historian would probably consider them vital, e.g. demographics. Since this is Yale, a bit more discussion about identity in Tokugawa Japan might be well received (e.g. homosexuality, role of women, etc). Otherwise, no weaknesses! Professor Drixler and the TAs do try to engage you with Japanese history as much as they can. For example, in the second half of the semester, they offer a trip to the Peabody where you get to see and literally handle a lot of artifacts from Japanese history, which is super cool  and an amazing taste of what it's like to academically interact with history :) ",
            "\u00a0Super interesting time frame to study, just limited enough to go into depth while retaining a sense of its larger historical significance. Readings were manageable and interesting and complemented the lectures really well (do the readings!). Lectures were engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Prof Drixler is a wonderful person and a brilliant scholar, but the lectures were not the best. They often felt superficial, vague, and too general  high on flourish and anecdote, but low on vigor. I often was not engaged. To be fair, some of the subject matter  military history, for example  was not to my taste.\r\n\r\nProf Drixler's powerpoints were wonderful. The images were incredibly thought provoking, illustrated each lecture's core themes perfectly, and will definitely stay with me. ",
            "\u00a0The first half of the course is much more biographically, chronologically, and factually based than the second half, which is more thematic. While both have their strengths, I found myself becoming a bit unmoored in the second half and wish there had been a bit more grounding in historical fact. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are definitely the professor (Prof. Drixler) and his team of teaching fellows. The varied readings and incredibly well designed course packet (available for free!!!!!) are a huge plus as well. I did not have that much interest in Japanese history prior to taking this class, but Prof. Drixler and George (my TA's) enthusiasm and care for the subject really, really had a huge impact on me. I highly recommend anyone to take at least one class with Prof. Drixler in their Yale career -- he's absolutely the most wonderful professor I have had the pleasure of working with in two years here! ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are very definitely the teaching crew: Prof. Drixler and George (the TA!). The course was incredibly well designed for learning -- a true testament to the course was that despite having missed a few lectures, I was still able to catch up really quickly due to the fact that the Professor had published the slides from lecture online, and had also prepared handouts that contained the key summary from lecture as well. It was a huge plus that the course packet for the course was available for free and that the majority of the extra readings could be found online (Orbis) or taken out from Bass/Sterling. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n1. The professor and grad students are so incredibly engaged with the material, and really love talking about it. Its crazy to see these guys look so proud while reciting 400 year old samurai suicide poems, but that level of interest is contagious. The professor is so absorbed with the material, that during lecture he has this pauses where it seems like he is lost is the awesomeness of it all. \r\n2. The readings are pretty light per week, and are all very interesting, especially the various first person readings. I really enjoyed the Musui's Story (a samurai's memoir). \r\nWeakness:\r\n1. Because the class is pretty easy (which is good, I hope they don't change that) the level of engagement by a lot of the students is pretty minimal, which just makes group discussions less interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Great overview of a fascinating period of Japanese history, with an interesting thematic rather than linear structure. ",
            "\u00a0Primarily only strengths; really have little to criticize. The readings, section discussions, and lectures were seamlessly integrated to facilitate student learning. ",
            "\u00a0Drixler is a gem. I know some people might find his lectures a bit wandering, but I actually really enjoyed them. Finishing the lectures more often would definitely have been good, but I never felt like I missed particularly critical information because of it (especially since he never hesitated to send an email if he thought he missed something important). I think section could maybe be improved, but I think that I was in an especially small section that wasn't particularly talkative, so I don't think it could be fixed from above. Honestly, this was 110% my favorite course I took this semester, so I don't really have anything negative to say. ",
            "\u00a0I wish it were possible for the handout sheet for each lecture to be distributed the lecture before, or posted online. Even after doing the readings, I found it difficult to follow unfamiliar terms in lecture, which impacted my understanding of the \"story\" of the lecture as a whole. However, the lectures were all extremely insightful, engaging, and well-delivered. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Very thorough. You will end up knowing more about Tokugawa Japan than you might actually want to. (e.g. some very esoteric subtopics) The good news is that it will make you very knowledgeable!\r\nWeaknesses: The demography and environmental sustainability part of the course is rather dry. Some lectures could be reworked so that it's more explicitly connected to the rest of the course, e.g. on the Dog Shogun and the laws of compassion, on Japanese aesthetics of wabi-sabi. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: breadth and depth of learning, museum visit, connection to the current world; Great TAs, helpful feedback on essays and ease of meeting with the TAs ",
            "\u00a0The course was great. The lectures were engaging and dense. Readings were useful. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Drixler is wonderful and engaging, the material is interesting and probably new for many people, the grading is straightforward, and there are not too many assessments. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There are a lot of readings, so be prepared for those, but the majority of them were interesting. ",
            "\u00a0An amazing course, this class was engaging and informative.  The strengths were definitely in the lectures, from the artistic imagery of Professor Drixler to the thoughtfulness of the topics he choose to discuss. ",
            "\u00a0This course it seems has been through many iterations and I think professor Drixler has it down to a science, but the lectures often run a bit long. ",
            "\u00a0TFs could improve. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Drixler is a great lecturer and makes the class super engaging ",
            "\u00a0I have a very hard time imagining how this course can be improved. As far as history lectures go, it was borderline perfect. ",
            "\u00a0Prof Drixler is an enchanting lecturer. I think it is best expressed by saying that Prof. Drixler has an imagination; you will be enraptured by his storytelling, and eventually you will be left with a profound historical lesson. The readings are equally engaging even though I had no knowledge of Japanese history prior. George is an outstanding TA, and being able to handle historical artifacts was incredible. ",
            "\u00a0Great readings and interesting lectures to attend. ",
            "\u00a0The content of this course is very interesting, and presented in an accessible yet engaging way by Professor Drixler. The readings, discussion sections, and lectures are all well-integrated so that the topics covered in each don't exactly overlap, but still serve to mutually reinforce each other. The Professor and all of the TFs were passionate, fair, and reasonable. \r\n\r\nSometimes, I thought the readings were a bit boring; I also felt that perhaps it would have helped to spend a little more time analyzing each source and the argument it made, but there usually was not enough time in section. It would've been nice to space the essays more evenly, perhaps moving the first one and second one a little earlier, so as not to overwhelm students at the end of the semester. Another thing that might have made the course material a bit more rewarding would be to incorporate some short, mandatory independent research writing assignment that forces us to engage with primary sources and secondary sources on our own, and maybe to devote some time in section to focusing on how to find sources, how to write such a paper, etc. Especially since Tokugawa Japan left behind such a rich historical record. ",
            "\u00a0The course is generally wonderful, and the different sides of Tokugawa Japan that Professor Drixler addresses are fascinating. The distribution of TAs is not quite even, but the material and presentation are fabulous. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a great cultural and political history of Tokugawa Japan.\r\n\r\nAt times, it felt that professor Drixler spent a lot of time talking about things that were not necessarily part of the main narrative of the class, but these were often interesting. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strength is grading scheme: two papers and two tests gives you adequate opportunity to demonstrate your knowledge while also not eating too much time (thereby leaving more to get the readings done each weekwhich are some of the greatest readings I've had at Yale). ",
            "\u00a0Great! No suggestions. Strengths in that Drixler is an amazing teacher and very passionate/knowledgeable about his material but also teaching. He seems to really enjoy being a teacher and interacting with students. "

            "\u00a0Yes! Prof Drixler is amazing. My TA was so helpful and kind. Basically everyone is just really, really NICE about everything and so understanding. Also, the class is just so interesting- everyone should take a history class that isn't about Europe. This is the one to take! ",
            "\u00a0Yes!!! Regardless if you're academically invested into history or if you already have an interest in Japan, this class is worth it! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This course is engaging and interesting. It has more of a narrative than other history courses I've taken. Just be aware that there are 2 essays, an in-class midterm, and a 3.5h final - totally manageable but more than I expected compared to other survey courses I've taken. I learned a lot and I really enjoyed the course. ",
            "\u00a0It's an okay course.  Dull at times, and not very challenging. However, Drixler is incredibly invested in his students, and the teaching staff was excellent. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course. Speaking as a senior history major, it was perhaps the most well-organized and enriching of all the history courses I have taken. I was even able to take things I learned from lecture and from the incredibly well-selected readings and apply them to other classes and my thesis that were on vastly different subjects and from vastly different parts of the world. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to any student who either needs a humanities credit or is interested in Japanese history. Usually I really don't like history, but this class was presented in a way that was really interesting and approachable. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would recommend this course to another student. It was one of the courses where you got out what you put in, and unlike many other courses I have taken here at Yale, it made it very easy and enjoyable to want to put in the time outside of class as well. I don't think I have enjoyed studying for any final as much as I did for HIST 307 -- the course packet, the lecture slides and handouts were all pristine and super super super super conducive for independent learning. Please take this class! ",

            "\u00a0Amazingly fantastic history lecture. Drixler speaks eloquently, engages his audience, and really supports students. Exams covered much material but were fair, and papers provided a creative approach to grappling with course material. Quite excellent. ",
            "\u00a0This course is absolutely amazing. The professor and the grad students are incredibly interested in the material, and this makes it a delight to learn from them. Professor Drixler will get so excited while explaining things during lecture that he will have to pause to collect his thoughts. The material is super interesting, and honestly this is one of the few classes that I actively looked forward to going to. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course is truly eye-opening; it will make you look at history differently, and will teach you to appreciate the depth of what might seem like mundane details. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, would highly recommend to a student interested in stretching his or her knowledge on a different culture and time period. ",
            "\u00a0This was one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. Professor Drixler is incredibly knowledgeable about Japanese history, of course, but he was also a thoughtful lecturer who seemed to take genuine interest in his students. He organized an optional trip to the Peabody to view items from Tokugawa Japan, and every lecture ended with a thought-provoking insight or connection to modern times. The workload is also very manageable (2 short essays, a midterm, and a final + weekly readings). ",
            "\u00a0Yes, you learn a lot ",
            "\u00a0I adored this course. Professor Drixler invests an incredible amount of time into developing his lectures and I learned so much about an area that I previously knew nothing about. More even than the actual knowledge of Japan, the way that history is taught here is phenomenal. I cannot recommend this highly enough. I am shocked to say that this is among my favorite classes ever taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0This course is definitely one of my favorite history courses I've taken. Drixler is an wonderful professor, both because he's incredibly knowledgeable and because he's incredibly engaged in his student's learning. He's probably one of the kindest professors I've ever interacted with, and always made himself very accessible if people had questions or comments. If you ask him one question after class he will probably greet you by name anytime he sees you on campus after that. Honestly, he's just an angel and is a good enough reason to take the course by himself. Beyond that, I found the layout of the course quite enjoyable. I know some people don't like the more thematic lectures after the midterm and would prefer a more chronological structure, but I thought it was fine (even the trees lecture). The lectures do get a bit wandering for some people's taste, but I never felt like I missed critical information because of it, and the lectures always felt oddly serene and calming, which may just be Drixler's voice but also might be the thoughtful way he presents information. I also think that the course does a great job of interspersing the particular history of Japan with broader trends in historiography in a way that is really nice. Two papers and a midterm and a final might seem like a lot, and the papers kind of are a lot, but they're also super flexible (you get to choice 2 out of 3 possible dates, and all of the papers have a bunch of options for prompts) and a lot of the topics are actually pretty cool. Overall, this course was just fantastic and I would highly recommend it. It might not be everyone's vibe, but definitely worth at least going to the first lecture to see if you're into it. ",
            "\u00a0I would say that this course is more difficult than other history lecture courses I have taken while at Yale, mostly because exams require that you answer all (or almost all) ID questions, instead of picking your favorites. Without background knowledge about Japan, it was difficult to keep names and events straight in my head. Do not take if you are looking for an easy course to fill out your schedule, but if you are willing to study effectively, this course is great! ",
            "\u00a0100%. Professor Drixler truly teaches history as an engaging, interesting, and relevant narrative. ",
            "\u00a0Take it if you're any bit interested in Tokugawa Japan. You will learn a lot! Maybe more than you wanted to, because some of the topics will feel really esoteric. (Professor Drixler tries very hard to show that the esoteric topics are relevant, but honestly I wasn't entirely convinced.) The really good thing about this course is that the assignments are SUPER flexible, so if you have a specific area of interest you definitely get the opportunity to flesh it out! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. If you want to know more about Japanese history and civilization, look no further. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I loved this course and recommend it all the time. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I would definitely recommend this to another student, whether you are a history major (which I am not) or not and whether you have any background in Japanese or even Asian history! ",
            "\u00a0Yes!  This course was amazing and I would recommend it to everyone!  Professor Drixler is thoughtful in his discussion and an amazing teacher.  You can tell he cares deeply about his teaching and research.  Case in point, he even learned everyone in the class' name. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting lectures but more work than you would be expected. ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely, even if you have no prior experience with Japanese history.  Professor Drixler delivers great and engaging lectures! ",
            "\u00a0Possibly, would have to be willing to put up with a professor so enfactuated with the culture. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely, one of the best classes I have taken so far at Yale. Tests do require knowledge of a lot of info. ",
            "\u00a0This is one of the best history lecture courses I've taken at Yale, and considering the strength of the History department, that's saying something. I was a bit lukewarm on the first few lectures, but by the third or fourth week the lecture really hits its stride and takes off into fascinating (and the fascinating mundane). I've been interested in Japanese history for quite a while but knew little about premodern Japan, so this lecture consisted almost entirely of new material for me. It did not disappoint. \r\n\r\nProfessor Drixler is a fantastic lecturer. I wasn't sure at first how much I appreciated his soft-spoken, understated style, but it quickly grew on me. He's a great storyteller, and has such an obvious love for the material that you can't help but appreciate it too (and his slightly off-kilter sense of humor imbues lecture with a whimsical charm that isn't immediately obvious). Drixler has a real eye for the odd but illuminating, and he consistently drew attention to the minute idiosyncrasies of Japanese history that reveal a lot but that a lesser historian (and teacher) might have missed. The result are lectures that were almost always enthralling (seriously, the hit rate was quite high) and always surprising, almost fantastical. Bureaucratic, paper-shuffling samurai? Human excrement as a profitable commodity? Infanticide as a virtuous act? We've barely scratched the surface. \r\n\r\nThese weren't just highly successful as standalone pieces, but rather linked an overarching thematic narratives that pushed us to contemplate, on a more macro-level, what the Great Peace tells us about the trajectory of history, the social and moral underpinnings of human society, and the nature of human condition. It's ambitious stuff, and Drixler pulls it off. This is historical era that might seem excessively and oddly specific, but Drixler succeeds in demonstrating the universal insights that we can glean from Japan's Great Peace. \r\n\r\nThe workload is very manageable. Weekly readings (which occasionally erred on the heavy side) and section, two short papers, a midterm, and a final. Everything is graded quite fairly, so there shouldn't be much to worry about on this count as long as you study for the exams and prepare for the papers in advance. \r\n\r\nTake this class. ",
            "\u00a0Look, you simply have to take this class. It's practical for the history major in that it fulfills area requirements, but more than that it has been one of the highlights of my Yale career. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was great to use information in this class as a history and political science major and use it in other classes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Professor Drixler is extremely knowledgeable and organized. He made the course very fair and fun to take. 10/10 would take it again. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course covers a lot of information and will be interesting both to those who have no prior knowledge about Japan and those who have a lot. The presentation of information and the professor's personality and lecture style are also big plusses. Overall, it was a very interesting course. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this course!! It's a great first history class, and I'm sure you can get even more out of it with a deeper background understanding. Professor Drixler is amazing and will inspire you to learn more about Tokugawa Japan. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to know more about Tokugawa Japan, this is a great class. However, if you are only planning to take one East Asian history class at Yale, I think that taking a class on Modern China is more essential to understanding some of the major dynamics of today's world. ",
            "\u00a0It is an absolute Yale College must, regardless of major. Professor Drixler's lecture style may seem dry upon first glance, but over the course of the semester you'll find his carefully cultivated lessons to contain a trove of historical gems and timely laughs. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I learned so much about Tokugawa Japan and about historical projection. Drixler does an amazing job of zooming into the details about Tokugawa Japan and zooming out into a broader significance. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course. Professor Drixler is amazing and you learn so much about Japanese history and culture. "
