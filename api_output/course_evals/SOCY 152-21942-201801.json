            "\u00a0Professor Eyerman's course broadened my knowledge of contemporary social theory with the assigned reading that covered many important topics and theorists. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to be an impeccable sociological thinker. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a loose understanding of some theoretical frameworks and an overview of a diverse range of modern authors in sociological theory. I also improved my ability to read and write about theory. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about paradigms and theories related to contemporary society. Developed a better sense of how social theorists approach modern issues. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about social theory and how it can be applied to modern social issues. My writing abilities improved, as did my analysis skills. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a more in depth understanding of the theories which we discussed, and how they related to one another, and the overall context in which they were written. ",
            "\u00a0It is an incredible overview on sociological thinking. The readings are very interesting but you truly get out of the class what you put in. If you don't properly do the readings you can always sweet talk your way through class discussions but in this class whats the point? You learn so much by engaging so don't cheat yourself out of that. The discussion goes beyond the purely theoretical and professor Eyerman helps guide you to view the modern world and events through this lens. ",
            "\u00a0This course was fantastic. It opened my eyes to incredible social theory, and was incredibly applicable to the world today. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a really solid foundation in social theory that I dont think I wouldve gotten otherwise. Also, this class has shown me how much the topics learned here apply to other academic courses and life in general. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a survey of a number of seminal texts within the social sciences in general. Almost all of these books were truly fascinating reads, from Horkheimer to Foucault to Bauman. Although the course is designed so that you finish the class with a working knowledge of some of the most important concepts with sociology and the social sciences in general, this course is special because you learn from reading the texts that inspired the concepts directly, rather than any textbooks that distilled the information. It is really a journey of intellectual discovery, where you might learn a lot about yourself from a rich canon. The course was designed around a number of key themes the semester I took it, namely power, surveillance, and moral responsibility of individual agents. I would definitely shop it if any of these are of interest to you. "

            "\u00a0Professor Eyerman created a very open and comfortable atmosphere for class discussion. I really appreciated the class to be able to understand aspects of the texts I either didn't understand or didn't pick up on. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of the course was its expansion beyond the traditional canon. A weakness was the strained effort to tie everything back to a single theme, which was 'power.' ",
            "\u00a0This course was well-organized and gave us exposure to a good range of theorists. I thought that the curriculum was clear and transitioned well from one seminar to the next. However, I thought that the weekly reading responses and the final paper could have benefited from some more specific guidelines, especially for those who weren't as experienced with reading and writing about theory. I really enjoyed the balance between Prof. Eyerman's teaching and our opportunities for discussion. ",
            "\u00a0I think at times the workload was very heavy, particularly with dense texts. Other than that, it was well structured and challenging. ",
            "\u00a0Great readings. Great discussions. I enjoyed having such open ended essay questions where you truly make what you want of it.\r\n\r\nYou get out what you put in and if you put in the full amount it is a lot of work. ",
            "\u00a0The only weakness in my opinion is that the course requires a very large amount of reading. I think its understandable considering how much is covered in the course, but advertising how much time this course requires during Reading Period is necessary. ",
            "\u00a0A strength is certainly the quality of the assigned material. The books are long, but were for me always great reads that inspired lots of thought.\r\n\r\nBecause we were not reading these texts for any particular reason other than the ideas they contain, class discussions could sometimes lack direction. Discussions could tangent quite severely, although the seminars for the better books were exceptional. In terms of being a writing credit, I received very little feedback as to how I could improve my writing. Actually, I received very little feedback to assess my learning in general. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course as a good introduction to contemporary social theory, and not to be afraid of it since it's required for the sociology major! ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend. Great for majors and non-majors. Assignments (as taught by Eyerman) allow you to tailor your work to your own strengths. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course for anyone with an interest in sociological theory and theoretical applications to daily life. The course is a lot of weekly reading and writing (about a book per week, and a 2-3 page double spaced reading response), with midterm and final papers, but the material is engaging and it's graded pretty leniently. If you're interested in discussing these types of questions, take this course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student who wants to learn the basics of social theory or who enjoys theoretical discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! \r\n\r\nI think it is a class that has changed the way I think and I loved every second of discussion and work, even if it was a lot in moments. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this if you have the chance. The material is fascinating, and is so applicable to the world around us. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to someone else who is both interested in sociology and has the time to do the readings for this course. ",
            "\u00a0Personally, I would not recommend this course. Although you may never do it, most of these books can be read on your own and you can gain a similar insight. Due to a lack of a specific topic, seminar discussions did not always feel fruitful and relevant. This may just have been a product on my cohort, so maybe shop the class to get a feel for the other students if the syllabus excites you. "
