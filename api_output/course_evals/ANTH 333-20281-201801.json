            "\u00a0Learned about methodologies and current studies in linguistics and anthropology, addressing bilingualism in the micro and macro context. ",
            "\u00a0The course taught me how to think about language in the broader landscape of social interactions and social forces. I learned to critically look at discourses around language and the details of language use. ",
            "\u00a0This was my first course in anthropology, and Im sad that it will be my last. Anthropology is such an incredible field, and having my introduction to it through a linguistic anthropology class was particularly special. I learned how to put into words what I had for so long wondered regarding my bilingual upbringing and my social transition into the United States through this lens. It was all-around one of my favorite classes at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0You will definitely end up learning about bilingualism in this class. Not just on the political side, but also how bilingual individuals interpret themselves. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Incredible use readings to frame our conversation around bilingualism, beginning with a larger sociological context and ultimately narrowing our lens into a micro biographical context. Great structure in terms of work, culminating in a personal research project. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is the good materials the course offers. The readings are very interesting. The weakness is how little there was student discussion. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a little unorganized and it was difficult to know when assignments were due, what was expected of the assignments, etc. The syllabus wasn't really used, and each week class changed or diverted from the topics we were meant to be discussing. As the content was so technical and there was so little reading, it did not feel like there was much opportunity to engage in conversation during class and it felt more lecture-style than seminar.  \r\n\r\nStrengths of the course were that the assignments were very flexible and student-driven, allowing us to do what we wanted with the material instead of being told explicitly how we should be engaging with linguistic anthropology. ",
            "\u00a0I wished we had spent more time discussing the readings, but Prof. Erringtons presentations were extremely helpful especially for those of us who had not taken an anthropology class before or had not been exposed to the material. I also loved the method of doing in-class presentations on our research because I learned so much from my classmates through it. ",
            "\u00a0Since I don't have anything close to a full command of the literature, I'm not sure how feasible this actually is, but I wonder if the syllabus could be updated to include a few more studies of bilingualism issues and debates currently unfolding. Not to be presentist or anything, but it does seem that we could have done a better job connecting the issues we studied to the world we currently live in. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is that the readings are well chosen and the research you do will help you understand any bilingual topic of your choice. I'd say the only weakness is that there is not much in-class discussion, but you are free to ask whatever questions you want at any point in class. "

            "\u00a0Yes, if you have an interest in bilingualism, and might have a bit of background in linguistics or anthropology, although it is not necessary. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in linguistic anthropology. Also take this course if you were disappointed with courses in linguistics. Linguistic anthropology may well be what you were looking for!!!\r\nAlso, make sure to go visit Prof. Errington during office hours. He is the kind of professor who is generous enough to let you exploit him (for intellectual and educational purpose). Use him! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely!!! ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Errington is very up-front about the way he conceptualizes this course. He understands it as a vehicle that students with a pre-existing interest in a topic related to bilingualism can use to further explore that interest. He throws stuff at us from the anthropological and linguistic realms of bilingual studies, but I think most students in my class took away much more from their final project than they did any of the course readings. If that sounds like an environment you'd do well indo be aware, of course, that one needs to be fairly self-directed to do so, although Errington is always available to helpyou should definitely take this course. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. You will learn more or less what you would expect, and some other surprising things. dont; worry about the workload, it is very manageable. "
