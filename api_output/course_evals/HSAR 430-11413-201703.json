            "\u00a0The biggest strength is Professor Rizvi--she is kind, but she is also very precise and very thorough. She also did a great job moderating exchanges between undergrads, grads, and the other people in our class, which was not an easy task. "

            "\u00a0I definitely recommend it. It was interesting and fun, and there were students coming from a variety of fields. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! I did not have much of a background in art history before this course, which made it scary to discuss the material with HSAR pHD students, but it turned out great and I don't regret my choice! "
