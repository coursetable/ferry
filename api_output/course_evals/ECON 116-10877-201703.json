I heard words, and could write them, but something was just not clicking with me, and I ended up learning all my information from the text book and my TA. I think a strength though is the cold-calling with the news stories! I have never been so engaged in the news before so that was cool. ",

Or at least it feels that way.\r\n\r\nMarnix, the TA, on the other hand, did a great job during section. I can't emphasis enough how much better he taught the material. he really broke stuff down and engaged with the students.

",

Also, you really don't need to go to lecture.\r\n\r\nThe main weakness of the course is that Prof. Fair, as smart as he is, is horribly boring and ineffective as a teacher. I am interested in economics and would have gone to every lecture if I thought I needed to. As the semester progressed, it became clear that the hour and a quarter block occupied by Econ 116 would be better used napping, eating, clocking work hours, studying for other classes, or just relaxing. Yale needs to do something about this problem. ",

It would also be useful to improve slides, so that it is easier to follow as a student, who has never engaged in macroeconomics before. ",
            "\u00a0The problem sets were helpful in understanding the material. Section was often very clear and provided a great deal of help with the problem sets. The textbook was very digestable and well-written. However, lecture was a complete waste of time. It was disorganized and ver very dry. I often left lecture feeling less comfortable with the material than when I entered, so for the second half of the semester I didn't even go. And I was not alone. During exams it was amazing to see how many people actually took the class because once their name had been called to report your economic news one time, people just stopped coming, except to drop off their problem sets once a week. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures could certainly be made to be more engaging. The slides also contained very little useful information, or if there was information, it was not clearly labelled and thus difficult to understand outside of the lecture setting. I think the class would benefit immensely from more explanatory and well-planned slides with pertinent information.  The PSets were helpful however, in reviewing and attempting to understand confusing material. ",

            "\u00a0The course is taught very poorly. The pedagogy is so painful that people don't show up to class but instead read the book. It's truly a shame to have such lackluster teaching at such a fine university. ",

            "\u00a0The strength of this course was definitely my TF Marnix. He was very knowledgeable and brought new insight to every section. I really enjoyed going to section to learn more about the material to learn in class and to receive a comprehensive review of the in class lecture. The weakness of the course may be the way the lectures were organized. I had difficulty keeping up with the slides and going back to the slides for reference because they were really brief. I ended up having to rely on the textbook for help on problem sets and for studying. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Fair is extremely knowledgeable and a very interesting person, but his lecture is also very boring. His style is low energy and attendance/engagement was often low (I'm not sure which direction the causality goes). I had a really excellent TF, but there seemed to be significant variation in their quality. The textbook was co-written by Professor Fair which helps, but there is also no good way of checking the answers to the practice problems. There is a course administrator which I'm not sure I love because it seems to increase confusion about division of labor re: content and grading policy. ",

            "\u00a0I definitely learned a lot from this course, so material-wise there isn't much improvement I can think of. However, the reason I was able to learn was because I put in the time to read the textbook and go to section; lectures were confusing and disorganized, and really difficult to grasp if you had no prior knowledge of the material. I would say this course needs MUCH more well-organized lectures (real power points/ lecture notes would be a great starting place). ",

Lecture slides were three pages of sparse scribbles on the professor's part and he'd mutter random things to fill up time and that was lecture.\r\n\r\nWhat a waste of time.\r\n\r\nDon't go to lecture and just read the textbook or read it during class. The textbook is a fantastic teaching tool. Section is also essential because you'll end up learning a lot of material there, too. ",
            "\u00a0I think having the final worth 50% makes the weeks leading up to it seem less significant, so it would be better to put more weight on the midterm to balance out the course. I thought section was really worthwhile which was great. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in learning more about the macroeconomy. The professor is highly respected in his field of work and extremely knowledgeable. If you do take this class, consider going to office hours and learning as much as you can from the TF's and professor. ",
            "\u00a0I think it's a very manageable version of introductory macroeconomics. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to students studying economics, and anyone interested in understanding how the macroeconomy works. ",
            "\u00a0Unless macroeconomics is something you're super interested in or you have to take this as a prerequisite, I would not recommend this class. You will definitely learn a lot, but only if you put in the effort to do that learning outside of class (in section or through the textbook). ",
            "\u00a0Of course you should take Intro macro if you are looking to have a basic understanding of how markets work, but if you have no background in econ from high school I do not recommend taking the class with Ray Fair. ",
            "\u00a0No, not unless you have to, and in that case take it in the fall. The curve helps less but the material is a lot clearer and it ends up being easier. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend to anyone who wants a basic understanding of macroeconomic principles. ",
            "\u00a0Only take if it is a requirement for you. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course for the material, but with the understanding that you will be reading the textbook on your own time and teaching yourself the course.\r\n\r\nThe teaching from the professor is nonexistent. It may be helpful to go over problem sets with TAs though. Section and office hours were very helpful for material. ",
            "\u00a0I think this class gave me a good baseline understanding of macroeconomics. I really got a lot out of weekly section and now have a genuine interest in the activities of the Fed. "
