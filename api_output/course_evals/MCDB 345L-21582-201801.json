            "\u00a0How to perform biomedical cellular techniques, how to adjust our plans if something falls through, how to stay positive, how to understand cellular and molecular biology so thoroughly that you can understand why something might go wrong in an experiment ",
            "\u00a0I learned to critically approach scientific problems and how to perform important biological research techniques. Being in a small lab setting was crucial in developing these skills. I also learned how to present science in front of an audience which is a very important skill to practice early. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a variety of lab techniques in cell biology, and a lot of things about life in general. ",
            "\u00a0I learned various techniques applicable to cell biology research, and I learned a lot of key facts behind these techniques. ",
            "\u00a0Basic biochemistry lab techniques. Very comprehensive. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think critically about approaching hypothesis driven research. I also learned the techniques necessary to begin to piece together research plans and carry out experiments. \r\n\r\nMost importantly, I learned how to speak confidently and present research. ",
            "\u00a0Giving effective presentations and thinking on your feet are two skills acquired in this class. Dr. Wolenski, Don, and Koen are INCREDIBLE!!! ",
            "\u00a0I loved this class because it taught me more about what it meant to conduct experiments in the lab. For example, a lot of the experiments that we did (SDS page gels, microscopy, etc.) I had done before in a laboratory setting, but this course really helped drive home the fundamentals, that is, the reason why we use this particular buffer or chemical to accomplish this particular goal, or how to troubleshoot if something goes wrong during an experiment. It was really helpful, especially for those of us who are going to do research for a lab at Yale. "

            "\u00a0Strengths\r\n1. A nurturing environment in which to learn cell lab techniques; you won't be afraid to ask questions or mess up, since you know (and Dr. Wolenski insists) that it's all part of the learning process\r\n2. Meets twice a week. It might seem like a long time to spend in lab, but having a set rhythm in this lab allowed me to get to know Dr. Wolenski, my TAs, and my classmates better, truly making the class seem like a family\r\n3. There is a great emphasis on being able to present scientific ideas to your classmates, through a \"chalk talk\" and a \"job talk.\" The chalk talk is a 5 minute presentation on the white board during which you explain a cell bio lab technique; the job talk is a 15 min powerpoint presentation on a paper that you pretend you've written yourself. Being forced to understand such concepts and present them as if you were an expert is an invaluable lesson in the sciences, and I'm so so glad I had the opportunity to do so in this class\r\n4. Dr. Wolenski himself is a phenomenal professor, and I hope Yale recognizes this and hires more professors like him. He genuinely cares about our learning and about our growth as students and people. He encourages our professional aspirations (knowing that so many of us were pre-med, for example, he brought in various Yale-New Haven physicians and researchers)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n1. Sometimes lab ran longer than it needed to, particularly in the last few weeks of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Best class I have taken at Yale ",
            "\u00a0The course could not be improved. It is perfect. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly don't change a thing. I really loved the community and mentorship that I found through the course, as well as the knowledge and laboratory skills I acquired. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Great introduction to biochemical research.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Time. Meets twice a week for 5 hours each. ",
            "\u00a0There was a lot of individual attention. The guest speakers were amazing. I genuinely can't think of any way to improve this course. "

            "\u00a0As you've already seen from past evaluations, the question is not so much whether you WANT to take this course, but whether you can get into it in the first place. It's got an 18-month wait list for a reason. There's not much I can add that hasn't already been said.\r\n\r\nTake this course not only if you want to dabble in learning cell lab techniques, but also if you want to do so in an encouraging learning environment, with one of the best professors Yale has to offer, with some of the most caring TAs you'll meet in your life. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to any student applying to medical school or planning on doing a career in biomedical research. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is a wonderful class that anyone should take if they possibly can. ",
            "\u00a0Best class at Yale! ",
            "\u00a0YES YES YES A MILLION TIMES OVER. If you are not on the waitlist, email Dr. Wolenski and get your name on the waitlist RIGHT NOW. This was by far the best class I've taken at Yale. Not only did I gain a LOT of knowledge that will help me with my future research career, but I also gained a lot of friends and mentors through this class. Dr. Wolenski puts so much of his personal time and resources into this class, and the end result is incredible. Please, please, whether you're an MCDB major, a pre-med, or just curious about biology, take this course. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this class to another student (if you can get in). Make sure to sign up during your first year so that you can take it your junior year. Wolenski is a gem of a teacher, and you'll learn so much about science. There is always food, your classmates will incredibly smart, and you will love the ten hours you spend in lab per week. ",
            "\u00a0This course expanded my perspective on biology as a whole, and I am a better scientist having taken this class. "
