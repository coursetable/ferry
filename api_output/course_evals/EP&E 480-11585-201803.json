            "\u00a0I learned about misogyny, animal rights, and other philosophical topics. ",
            "\u00a0This was a great class for showing how moral philosophy can be applied to relevant political and social issues. We spent half of the course reading work on misogyny and animal ethics, and spent the rest on arguments for egalitarianism. All the readings and discussions helped teach students how to apply ethical theory and philosophical thinking to pressing issues in a non-pretentious way. Also, Darwall maintains a relaxed classroom atmosphere so it teaches you how to talk about philosophy in a casual way. ",
            "\u00a0how to write a philosophy paper and analyze philosophical texts ",
            "\u00a0This course took us through an array of recently published works of moral philosophy: from Korsgaard and Kate Manne to Elizabeth Anderson and Darwall. Under Professor Darwall's guidance, I learned to pay more rigorous attention to each component of a complex argumentin the case of Manne and Korsgaard, because their arguments spanned the length of a book, it was important that we parse the book apart bit by bit. I learned to notice and think about distinctions between terms. This class also gave me a solid introduction to moral psychology, which Professor Darwall has a leading foothold in, and found that moral attitudes like contempt and pity and shame permeated all our texts. It was fascinating to read Professor Darwall's papers on contempt, pity and respect and to have him bring up ideas about these attitudes throughout all our texts. In that sense, I learned a lot about our moral emotions and am excited to explore the topic further beyond this semester. ",
            "\u00a0For Fall 2018, this class spent a good bulk of the term focusing on two main books: Kate Manne's Down Girl: The Logic of Misogyny, and Korsgaard's Fellow Creatures. The rest of the term, we spent each week on one or two articles on different topics including egalitarianism, Cavell's concept of acknowledgement, and so on. It was a great in-depth look at two philosophically important books, and then illuminating touch-and-gos with the articles. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me improve my skills in analytic discussion of advanced texts in philosophy. The discussion sections are very effective in teasing out key ideas from readings and also uncovering further questions for debate. ",
            "\u00a0Read two books published in the last year (feminist philosophy and animal rights) as well as thematically related articles from the last two (or more...?) decades or so. All of my previous philosophy courses basically stopped at 1970 and it's so so good and engaging to read more recent work. "

            "\u00a0The seminar was not engaging at all, and discussions went all over the place. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of the course: extremely interesting material that applied longstanding ethical theories to relevant issues, an incredibly kind and relaxed professor in Darwall, intelligent and engaged students, and a very doable reading load.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not many. The main issue was the general structure of how discussion was conducted. Darwall is very kind in appreciating student points and  helping their comments lead the discussion. However, instead of going through a list of points, it would have been more useful to begin each class with an overview of the main arguments of each text. Some of the works -- Korsgaard's especially -- were difficult for those without background in Kant, so would have appreciated more instruction than discussion at some points. ",
            "\u00a0While I appreciated the two books efforts to present popularly accessible philosophy, I thought it would have been helpful to include some more technical papers alongside them, as I thought Manne and Korsgaard sometimes moved too quickly or worked at too high a level. The papers in the final third of the course were detailed while still driving toward practically relevant, even political, conclusions. ",
            "\u00a0interesting texts and thought provoking discussions, the class is a bit large for a seminar but no one really dominates the discussion ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: That this class is taught by a leading moral philosopher Professor Darwall, who is also an attentive, engaging teacher and seminar leader. Every class was saturated with intellectual excitement, I found my mind most awake and engaged in our readings. Professor Darwall asks the most incisive questions and seminar truly elevated each reading for me. The readings were so current and felt extremely relevant. Unlike many philosophy classes, where the material does not directly discuss our social and political world, this class was incredibly pertinent and the ideas and insights we discussed applies directly to our engagement with our social and politicalnot to mention morallives. I enjoyed the format of discussing two books for several weeks, spending time on each book, before moving into papers. The selection of readings was truly outstanding: the material was current and in touch with the times. I also appreciate how Professor Darwall gives everyone a handout that maps out the seminar agenda, as this keeps us on track and gives us a sense of progress as we move through seminar. The structure of having reading responses was nice as it ensured everyone ideas were heard throughout semester, and was a helpful way to stay grounded in our readings. The inclusion of Francey Russell's piece and the film screening gave this class an extra edge, as did the inclusion of all of Darwall's papers on the moral atittudes! This seminar also had particularly good seminar participantsgood in that everyone listened to each other and seemed to do the reading thoroughly. As a result, seminar was just an incredibly fruitful and fulfilling experience, probably the best class of my semester, and one of my favorite classes I have taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0This was a great course! I really liked the mix of papers and books we discovered, and how we referred back to previous ideas that we had discussed in the course. It was larger than some seminars I've been in but it didn't feel large: participation was good and everyone got a chance to speak. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Darwall is an amazing, kind, funny and famously brilliant professor who has the absolute right kind of weight to hold a big seminar together and point our attention to the right sorts of things. The seminar was on the large side, somewhere between 20 and 25 of us, and I understand that Professor Darwall wants everyone to have the opportunity to be in his class -- and it wasn't so bad -- but I think class discussion suffered very slightly for it, just because most people wouldn't get the chance to talk. The course content was very very cool and I loved that we did feminist philosophy and animal ethics. It was handled with sensitivity and grace and I felt like I learnt a lot. I'm very happy I took this class. Professor Darwall could do more to give feedback, I think. We write 3 reading responses, and he does give comments on those, but no grade so it's a bit unclear how one is doing until one gets the final grade back at the end. ",
            "\u00a0The best part about the course is the seamlessness with which each student's participation was woven into the curriculum. "

            "\u00a0Probably not. It wasn't organized well, and most of the readings weren't very good. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course, though students should have a decent background in moral philosophy. This is a difficult course if you haven't taken DS, Intro Ethics, Normative Ethics, or some combination. Though class engagement didn't refer to foundational theories often, you will get more out of the course if you already have some training in philosophy.\r\n\r\nI would recommend the course for two main reasons: it touches on pressing political/social issues but in a rigorous philosophical way that few other  classes do. Very few other courses will expose you to moral dilemmas like misogyny and animal rights while encouraging in-depth theoretical discussion of these issues. This is a fantastic option for those who have already done the standard philosophy/ethics courses, so they can see how to apply the classic theories to ethical problems we face today. ",
            "\u00a0yes, the syllabus changes every year so whether you take the course or not depends on how interested you are in a given years text selections ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Darwall is THE person to learn about moral philosophy with. His personal scholarship, and his choice of scholarship to read, makes philosophy feel so relevant and important. We talked about feminist philosophy, animal rights, equality and the moral emotions in this classI leave this class feeling like not only have I been challenged and invigorated intellectually, but I have new thoughts and insights to take away with me in my life as lived. This class made me want to be a more ethical person, and gave me the tools to start thinking about what that person may look like. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it to anyone interested in ethics. Its a great chance to study contemporary ethics with an amazing professor. Seminar is very well run, participation was good and everyone got a chance to speak. The amount of reading wasn't overwhelming but covered enough ground to be challenging in class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would highly recommend taking this course or any other course in moral philosophy that Professor Darwall takes. He is very famous for a reason: he's brilliant, but also kind, warm, and funny, with no pretentions whatsoever. He's also great in office hours. The content of the course will likely change in subsequent semesters so look at the syllabus and see if you're interested in what's being covered. We're lucky we got to do feminist philosophy and animal ethics. ",
            "\u00a0A very nice course and an excellent opportunity to study with dedicated, insightful philosophy students. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. You get to engage with contemporary work, which is just so much more gripping, and Darwall is a great professor. "
