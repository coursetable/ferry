            "\u00a0I really developed my skills in connoisseurship of fine objects. ",
            "\u00a0Curatorial skills; I learned about how museum collections are handled and analyzed. ",
            "\u00a0This class will help you to become an amateur silver connoisseur, a closer looker, and a deeper thinker. ",
            "\u00a0Being able to learn from an incredibly engaging teacher, John Stuart Gordon, is always a pleasure at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0With American Silver, students can immerse themselves in a complex but coherent art historical tradition. Studying the developments in silver art and craft becomes both an examination into a particular tradition as well as a view onto larger art historical trends and movements. Combined with the opportunity to handle Yale's unparalleled silver collection, Professor Gordon's captivating expositions, and the common fascination with silver, the course provides a valuable education in the history of art. (You might also learn some silver identification party tricks on the side.) "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: You get to handle some really incredible objects. Prof. Gordon is enthusiastic and good at relaying information, answering questions and engaging in discussion. There isn't very much work. The final project is fun (an exhibition proposal), and a good deviation from standard research papers.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Readings are very bland. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are that this is a class localized to Yale and what the universitys collections have to offer. The learnings hands-on. Weaknesses are that, a few classes in, the material can start to feel a bit redundant. ",
            "\u00a0This is an incredible class that students felt privileged to take. The fact that students were allowed such intimate access to Yale's silver collection is really amazing. Professor Gordon is a great speaker and wonderful professor. It might be interesting if the course were to also require students to present on their final project ideas before reading period to learn what everyone else is working on. ",
            "\u00a0Yale is fortunate to have a great collection of silverwork. This is clearly taken advantage of in this class. Getting to handle the pieces in person is the highlight of this course. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the course could be improved with clearer study materials and review sessions. There is a lot of information and the style of writing is so different from what I have seen before, and while I did use office hours it would be great to have regular review and help sessions for the group. ",
            "\u00a0I cannot think of any possible improvements. The defining strengths are Yale's esteemed silver collection, Professor Gordon's inventive presentation style, and the rare opportunity to directly interact with the silver objects. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend. You get to handle some really incredible objects. Prof. Gordon is enthusiastic and good at relaying information, answering questions and engaging in discussion. There isn't very much work. The final project is fun (an exhibition proposal), and a good deviation from standard research papers. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend taking this. Professor Gordon is fantastic, and very dedicated to the subject. ",
            "\u00a0I would if theyre looking to take advantage of license to Yales art resources, yes. ",
            "\u00a0You are missing out if you do not take this class! Touch [almost?] every piece of silver in the YUAG! Learn about American history through a material culture lens! Become an amateur American silver connoisseur! This class includes a syllabus of really enjoyable readings that you will look forward to doing, and exposes you to objects that you probably wouldn't have heard of before [mourning art made of human hair!? Crazy!]. Professor Gordon will challenge you to think about the museum and its objects in new interesting ways. ",
            "\u00a0This course and its instructor are both great. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! Why not? Sure, American Silver may appear a peculiar topic, but Yale's collection rivals that of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Boston MFA. (Otherwise, it's peerless).  Exploring the collection provides a unique perspective on the formation of American identities and artistic traditions, as the subject interweaves a close exploration of a single coherent tradition with broad trends in American fine arts, decorative arts, and craft-ware. For this collection, Professor Gordon then serves as an exemplary instructor. His commentary proves erudite but never overbearing, humorous and sharp but always welcoming of new opinions perspectives. In short, he may be the ideal guide for silver's achievements, complications, and eccentricities. Lastly, students have an exceedingly rare opportunity to directly handle all of the objects discussed and presented. Yes, this means a semester passing around exceedingly valuable silver objects across the entire collection, but more importantly, this provides the means to intimately discover how objects are constructed, designed, and ultimately intended for function or display. Simply put, take this course if you enjoy art history, lively instruction, or the chance to expand your liberal arts horizon. "
