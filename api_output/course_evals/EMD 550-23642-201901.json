            "\u00a0This was by far my favorite class that I have taken at YSPH. It was interesting, engaging and I learned a lot. Some weeks the abstracts and required readings seemed like a lot, but I definitely learned and retained more for reading and then writing about them. Great practice reading and presenting on papers and understanding, plus analyzing and critically thinking about the articles. This was an excellent class. I loved the hands on experience of the dissection as well. d ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: 1) gives you a nice overview of vectors, 2) class discussion was always interesting and everyone seemed engaged\r\nWeaknesses: 1) abstracts were a little much. I found them helpful to understand the material, but there was no need to do two a week. Having them the same week our grant proposal was due and midterm released was unnecessary, as well as on weeks that we had presentations to do. 2) The exam was way too long given that we only had 90 minutes. Even with studying, I think we all struggled to finish 10 essay questions that had multiple parts in the given time (that's only 9 minutes per question!). This should have also been an in class exam or released on Canvas with the set timer to ensure that everyone actually abided by the 90 minute time limit. ",
            "\u00a0To me, the content of the class was quite boring.  The pedagogy did not help with this.  Most lectures were just powerpoint slides being read to you.  The class wasn't very engaging.  We were expected to read long papers each week and write structured abstracts for them which took a lot of time and effort and then we never even discussed them in class. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course is a great way to be introduced to arthropod-borne diseases and their respective pathogens. One will definitely learn a lot. Also, some of the guest speakers for the course are quite informative and experts in their field. ",
            "\u00a0It is a strong course. It could be improved by finding a way to make discussion of research papers more interactive than hosting presentations. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this course. It was incredibly interesting and I was so happy to take a course this specific especially when we have such a good collection of insect vector work done at Yale. The weekly summaries helped me hone my ability to efficiently read, digest, and evaluate research which I know will be helpful for the rest of my career. The only critique I have is about the midterm. 90 minutes for 10 questions, some with multiple parts, is not reasonable at all. I suggest shortening the number of questions or doing something in class that's shorter. ",
            "\u00a0This course covered some very interesting topics but I was frustrated with the midterm and we never received feedback on the presentations we gave. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Interesting guest speakers and enjoyed doing the dissections of the tsetse flies. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: We had read long articles and present on them during class time which did not add much to the course. The summaries and presentations were graded very easily; however, the actual exam and research proposal grading was ridiculous (70% averages). We had a self-timed take home exam that was 10 questions long with multiple parts. There was not way you were actually able to finish the exam unless you cheated and went over the hour and a half. Even if you managed to complete all the questions, you still received a poor score because the professors asked for you to expand on all your responses (even though they asked for short responses). \r\n\r\nIf you are looking for a vector biology course that has a strong emphasis on entomology, this is not it. ",
            "\u00a0The course was challenging by mainly learning the material through reading and creating scientific literature which allowed for a greater understanding of vector biology and the diseases. It was definitely helpful to improve my scientific writing and think about how I would create my own experiment while forming my own grant. Having to give oral presentations was also helpful to improve overall presentation skills on difficult vector biology papers, however I also would have liked more discussion on lecture information. ",
            "\u00a0This class was very interesting and brought up a lot of topics I was not familiar with. The lectures were great, and the articles assigned were very interesting. My only critiques for the course are 1) The 90 minute time constraint on the midterm did not allow enough time to fully answer all the questions, some of which had 2-4 parts, and 2) the lack of feedback on our proposal outlines when we were explicitly told we would get feedback was disappointing.

            "\u00a0Brian is amazing. He obviously has a strong passion for vectors (he even has a tsetse fly shirt he wears) and he really conveys that enthusiasm in class. He wants us all to succeed and goes above and beyond to make sure that you get the most out of the class. By far one of my favorite professors ever. ",
            "\u00a0Brian is very nice and a great guy.  His pedagogy, though, could use some work.  Again, just powerpoint slides being read to us. Not very engaging lectures.  In a two hour class it's easy to get bored and distracted, so it would have been nice to have a more engaging lecture. ",

            "\u00a0A must for EMD students. Lots of good guest lectures that give you a good overview of vectors. Would recommend. Just be prepared for the amount of weekly work. ",
            "\u00a0This class was very boring and a lot of work. I didn't get a whole lot out of it.  Brian and Serap are great people and I'm sure very good researchers, the class was just seemingly unorganized and pretty boring.  Due dates for things were usually mentioned in passing and brought up later than they should have been and I never really knew what was going on in the class and what we were supposed to be doing.  I think the class needs some reorganization.  I would not recommend this class to others.  I wouldn't recommend most classes at YSPH to others, though, so this isn't particularly atypical of a class at YSPH. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to a student, but I would think they should look at the syllabus to make sure they are interested in the pathogens discussed. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend, it is a great course and introduction into vector borne diseases. ",
            "\u00a0I do not recommend this course to future students. We learn a lot of these topics in other classes at YPSH (infectious disease epi). ",
            "\u00a0Overall this is a fantastic course that allows students to gain a broader understanding of vector biology while simultaneously improving their presentation skills and scientific writing. The lectures were always very interesting and provided various discussions. The instructors were always extremely helpful and clearly wanted their students to learn and gain as much as possible out of the class as the they could. ",
            "\u00a0This course gives a broad background in vector biology and the new research in the field. The lectures are very interesting and give a good mix of public health and biology. I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in diseases transmitted by vectors. I would recommend the student actively seeks out feedback, as it is not freely given, however the instructors are very helpful when approached. "
