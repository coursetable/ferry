Experiments are poorly designed and even the TAs admitted most of them were fairly pointless.  Lab reports are based on how well you can avoid careless errors on a fill-n-the-blanks format, which does nothing for student learning and mostly just a waste of time.  Previous reviews said that this course was a dumpster fire; I couldn't agree more.  But yale doesn't care at all about STEM  teaching, and Dr. G's mere existence at yale is evident of this fact. ",

For instance, the course teaches students to perform titrations, set up an electrolytic cell, and other similarly basic procedures. Most students have already learned these things in their high school chemistry courses. If they have not, the amount of time and frustration that this course generates does not make these skills worth it. Lectures are unhelpful, as they review concepts from General Chemistry without highlighting anything new about the content, or revealing an interesting angle. The process of completely lab reports is not educational, as they are graded based on Dr. G's extremely particular preferences (that students just have to guess until they get a stupid number of points deducted for highly specific and irrelevant things). The experiments themselves are also not designed for efficient learning. They seem to be more geared towards forcing students to take repeated measurements than anything else. ",

The weekly labs were repetitive, and sometimes were basically the same procedure as the previous week, just with different reactions. Actual experimental technique wasn't emphasized except for the last two lab reports, where a certain percent error was required. We were told what results to expect and there wasn't room for creativity. The experiments were literally just following a set of instructions and knowing what to expect, so it wasn't very interesting.

",
            "\u00a0A strength of the course is its structure, with a prelab lecture, quiz and then the lab itself. It could be improved by always having lab equipment which works and is not old, as this has on occasion made lab difficult for me. ",
            "\u00a0Experiments are interesting and pre-lab lectures are helpful and enriching. It is a great course however it is quite time consuming. Grading policies focus too much on format rather than content. This class should definitely be 1 credit (I realize the instructor has no control over this). Also, lab reports are not graded until the next one has been turned in. This means that if you are marked down for making a mistake on one lab report, you cannot change your mistake for the next lab report since it has already been turned in. ",

I didn't feel like I learned more from getting a value within 3% as opposed to 5%. I think the class should focus more on learning experimental procedures than getting the exact right results. ",

Additionally, the lab reports were extremely tedious and seemed like they were not graded for content but rather for the inclusion of certain \"buzzwords,\" and even small details being omitted or mistake would cost you a lot. Additionally, we were often assessed on material that we did not learn in class. For example, one of our quizzes featured a concept that had yet to be introduced in Chem 161, and the instructor said that we should have known it from high school. That really doesn't seem fair or educational to me. ",

            "\u00a0While I definitely took a lot out of the course in terms of reinforcing chemistry concepts and learning how to use lab equipment, I think the course has a lot of room for improvement. While many weeks we used classical procedures such as titrations or calorimeters, I think that there was no need to force values to be within 3% of the accepted value because that made the lab very stressful and many students ended up forging data, thereby teaching the wrong values of science. Additionally, I though the lab deriving the universal gas constant, while cool to understand the gas constant, was extremely painful and tedious, making for an unpleasant time in the lab. I think a strength was that Dr. G was very helpful when writing up lab reports and explaining concepts relevant for the lab and being flexible with rescheduling lab. ",

Sometimes the lab lectures were a little long, but the lab quizzes (usually) focused on the relevant / necessary / important concepts of the lab. I don't think I learned how to do anything spectacular or significant during this course, most of it was just weighing things and mixing things together. This course needs to be a whole credit. I often spent more time in lab than I did in lecture. Similarly, the lab report takes just as long as homework from lecture. Also, I found the lab grading to be somewhat inconsistent throughout the lab reports - sometimes points were taken off for a particular detail, while, other times, points were not taken off. I never really knew what was expected for lab reports, even though I followed instructions listed in the syllabus. ",

I know several students who could not get in the range, but they didn't seem to be doing anything wrong. ",

In response to criticism about the time this class takes, the professor said \"maybe you should improve your work habits\" and that the quizzes \"are meant to be stressful\".

It was also far too easy to lose points on weekly quizzes. ",

Also, sometimes I felt like the labs were graded inconsistently. On some labs I would do a specific part of the lab correctly, then on the next lab I would get points taken off for the same thing. ",

Everything about this course was made in a formulaic way, which also isn't how real science works. Lab manual was very dense, which I feel didn't have to be the case. The main strength of this course was the clarity of the pre-lab lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: It only meets once a day.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The lab reports do not get graded fast enough, so you do not have enough time to correct subsequent mistakes because you don't know what you did wrong on the previous lab report.

The Chem 163 students don't learn the same material as 161, so we have to learn extra material just to stay on par with the rest of the class. It's very stressful. ",

            "\u00a0I found the time spent in the lab in this course to be relatively interesting and even fun. The experiments were clearly designed with a lot of thought and care. \r\nDespite this, I found this course to be one of the most unenjoyable courses I have taken in a long time, probably since middle school. There is a ridiculous amount of time spent outside of the lab completing lab reports that are intellectually uninspiring and unimaginably tedious. I can confidently say I gained absolutely nothing out of any of the 3-4 hours (one lab report took many students and I 10 hours to finish) I spent on each lab report other than becoming skilled at plugging numbers into a calculator and typing in the results into an excel spreadsheet.\r\n\r\nI have nothing against the idea of assigning students lab reports after they complete an experiment. If designed well, such assignments can help students develop their scientific writing skills, better understand the relevance of what they did in the laboratory, understand the equations they used in their work on a deeper level, and learn how to present data in a clear and concise manner. The only thing Dr. Ganapathi's lab reports attempt to do is teach students to present data clearly. Other than this, the lab reports fail in every one of the areas I outlined. They are simply fill-in-the blank worksheets in which students have to mindlessly plug numbers into formulas, write out all of the equations they used in a word processor, and fill in tables. All of this takes a very long time and is highly unrewarding and unpleasant. The \"concept\" questions at the end of the lab are an attempt at trying to get students to think a little more critically, but they are usually very surface level and are not a significant portion of the work done. I would suggest that there should be much less emphasis put into these tedious calculations. All the students are going to forget what they did anyway, and it is just a waste of time. I think these labs would have been much more rewarding if there was more of a writing component involved that forced students to demonstrate that they actually understood what is happening in the reactions they are performing and why they are using the specific measurement techniques that they are. ",
            "\u00a0The time spent for this course was way too high for half a credit. It should either be worth more or the reports should not be as meticulous. ",
            "\u00a0I think the steps and instructions for every lab were very detailed and specific, but sometimes the information can get a bit convoluted. I also feel that the expectations from the professor were also made clear. I did find some of the work and some of the information in the lab reports to be a bit tedious. ",
            "\u00a0The course often complemented Chem 161, so it was interesting to see ideas we learned in class actually carried out in an experiment. I found that the weekly pre-lab lectures were very useful, and, though the weekly quizzes weren't exactly pleasant, they were generally helpful. I took issue with when the quizzes required a degree of memorization which seemed unnecessary. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very engaging and a great supplement for the material I learned in chem 161, however, the grading for the lab reports was unreasonably harsh. ",

            "\u00a0The course challenges your patience and effectiveness in the laboratory. \r\n\r\nHowever, I retained very little from the course and found that its setup facilitated a transactional and somewhat empty class experience. ",
            "\u00a0The experiments are very applicable to what we learn during Chemistry 161 and are very helpful to learn about various chemistry topics, ranging from oxidation-reduction reactions to the gas laws. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths of this course included engaging and fun labs that I was actually interested in. Dr. G's enthusiasm for chemistry was also prevalent throughout the entire course. Additionally, Dr. G answered any questions I had quickly and with great answers.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses of this course were that towards the end of the course, the labs ended up not being as fun as at the beginning of the semester. Additionally, the quizzes that we all took before each lab didn't always seem fair. The material of these quizzes were often graded harshly and they often didn't really seem to go with the lab at hand. ",
            "\u00a0The course forces students to type out lab reports in such a way that it takes approximately 7 hours to complete what should be a 3-hour lab report. The only strength of this course would be having hands-on experience in topics we are learning during the general chemistry course. ",
            "\u00a0This course is just not great. It's fine, everybody gets through it, but the grading is kind of arbitrary (what's even more annoying is that the grading is delayed so you don't get one lab report back before you submit the other and so you have no way to know about/fix the errors you made on the previous one so they don't carry over to the next lab report) and the experiments don't really help you understand chemistry all that much more. I would say the workload is definitely a half-credit, but not a full credit. The only real way that I see to improve this course is to make it less concerned with having lab reports that conform to Dr G's high standards, which causes a lot of stress among students, and make it more about enjoying chemistry and having fun with it. The best lab day was when we had to do a bunch of reactions to figure out the identity of \"mystery\" solutions because then it was about problem-solving. The problem with the experiments was that they were already set out for you and so you just stood around for a long time in the lab not doing anything interesting, and you would already kind of know what the results would be (like in the gas lab). That definitely lowered the engagement and made it somewhat uninteresting. ",
            "\u00a0for students taking 163 there wasnt enough support in preparing for the quizzes because I hadn't seen these topics since high school and would have liked more than a brief lecture the day-of to review quiz topics. Seeing more practice problems reflective of what was going to be on the quizzes prior to the actual day of the quiz would have helped. Also, I was rarely able to view feedback on labs and/or there were no comments given to me so I could not improve if I didnt know what I was doing wrong. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course focuses a lot on the particulars of chem lab which is great. I found myself very intently reviewing the lab manual and attempting to understand procedure. I think Dr. G is doing an amazing job of making sure students are engaged and fully challenging themselves in a course that easily presents itself as an easy course. ",

It's literally the name of a company/brand. Other than that, it was nice that our lowest lab report and quiz could be dropped, but the class was still pretty stressful.

            "\u00a0A weakness of this course is there is not much room for creativity or trials that are not meticulously planned out in advance.

The inconsistency in grading among the TAs ",

The labs sometimes do not relate to the contents learned in Chem 161 at the same time, some are too early in the semester, some are too late. Most procedures are not exciting at all and the material/instruments used were often poor quality. ",
            "\u00a0The lecture component of the course is fine. Dr. G is a strong lecturer, and presents material efficiently and effectively. Everything else about this course is horrendous. Student feedback is extremely low, so it is almost impossible to improve your performance over the course of the semester. The grading is unreasonable, mostly because the standards by which students are graded is detached from the actual content, and has to do with wording minutiae or the layout of one's graphs, which is honestly a pedagogically horrible way to evaluate student's knowledge of an experiment.

            "\u00a0The most memorable moment in class was when Dr. G enchanted the class with his laser and vial of colored solution to demonstrate that different EMRs are absorbed on the spectrum. At these moments, the course becomes less about the mechanical actions of filling out lab reports and I learn the most. However, the grading on lab reports is unfair as different TAs grade differently and take off for small things that another grader may not. Since the course curves down, these small differences in grading serve as the difference between an A and a B. Dr. G says that he's willing to give As to every student who deserves it, but this is not manifested in the actual grading. Finally, many students, myself included, feel unnecessarily stressed with the quizzes. Although in some contexts, quizzes are essential for learning/ preparing for a lab, this course's quizzes do not add much to the learning experience. Perhaps trading the weekly quiz for an online open book pre-lab quiz due before the lab day will be beneficial. ",

            "\u00a0The course was effectively taught as the professor was readily available to answer the students' questions. An area of improve would be condensing the wording on the lab manuals. For instance, the manual would ask questions before answering them instead of getting straight to the point and providing useful information for the students. The large volume of nonessential text on the manuals slowed down the student during labs. ",
            "\u00a0The weaknesses of this course are the quizzes and the grading of the lab reports. The instructor is incredibly picky about grading, so I found that I had to spend lots and lots of time worrying about details that were irrelevant to my learning of chemistry.

The TAs were somewhat helpful but sometimes the purposes of each of the steps had to be determined alone. ",

Other experiments seemed to be extremely repetitive. The lab reports were incredibly long and tedious, but for no apparent reason. Dr. G was never helpful but rather he rarely responded to emails and seemed to try to make our lives harder. ",
            "\u00a0This is a class that you take because you have to, not because you want to. Dr. G was a good lecturer, but the stress of the impending quiz made it impossible to enjoy the learning process. \r\nThere is absolutely no reason that every week we spent 5-12 hours typing up lab reports. I gained nothing through this painful process except a better understanding of the hoops one has to jump through in order to remain on the pre-med path. ",

            "\u00a0The strengths are that we get to do a lot of experiments and the expectations are pretty clear. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very heavy, the lab reports take a while and need a good chunk of time to complete. The labs themselves arent terrible and some are actually pretty interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: the labs are diverse and cover a lot of topics.\r\nWeakness: the lab reports are graded very strictly and points are deducted for minuscule mistakes. ",
            "\u00a0With the manual and prelab lecture slides on Canvas, it is easy to know what material you're accountable for and what you should study for a given week. The actual prelab lectures themselves aren't super helpful. The routine of quizzes and labs is steady and good. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting labs, learn lots about conducting experiments.\r\nWeaknesses: time consuming and only half credit. lab reports can be a lot. Grading is annoying often.\r\nDr. G needs to loosen up his requirements on grading. He has random and arbitrary policies that serve no apparent purpose. I'm sure he could justify them and say that he has reasons for them after years of teaching, but EVERYONE agrees, students and other teachers, that it is not good. Too handle it, all you have to do though is figure out what Dr. G wants from the lab report instructions and your TF and just follow it religiously. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is Dr. G. Although I rarely hear him given praise, he is easily one of the best instructors of chemistry I've ever encountered in my life  and I've had many. He follows what I think should be the golden rule for all teachers everywhere: assume the students know nothing. The pre-written lab reports were also a strength. Weaknesses include a recurring emphasis on producing \"results\" (less than 3% error, for example) rather than genuine data (this encourages dangerous habits!) and somewhat long and tedious lab reports (can range from 6-10 hours each, mostly depending on the fickleness of Word and Excel and Dr. G.'s demands). ",
            "\u00a0One definite strength is that the course goes over a lot of the introductory chemistry topics we ought to learn but in the context of a lab. This was especially helpful for me because we didn't really touch on most of those topics in CHEM 163, but did more advanced subjects in chemistry like organic chemistry and quantum mechanics/orbital theory. That is also it's weakness, though, that there is not a lot of overlap between this course and what is taught in CHEM 163. From my understanding, it runs pretty well with CHEM 161. Maybe for the future, having some of the labs be more related to the material be related to both courses would be helpful for students to say chemistry's application, in both classes. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths include the broken down instructions for lab procedure and lab report. One weakness I can think of is that I often found it very challenging to finish lab reports, especially in the beginning. So, I hope they could have tutors. ",
            "\u00a0I felt zero connection with the instructor because the class was so large. I found the labs to be tedious as the TAs were unengaged. The general attitude surrounding this course was that everyone just had to get through it as a premed requirement, rather than making it fun or interesting. I found the lab reports to be tedious and not a test of our actual understanding of the course; rather, they tested how well we could carry out rote calculations and write out chemical equations. I found the grading rubrics ridiculous and nit-picky. The course seemed more about collecting points rather than making connections and understanding overarching ideas. As such I found it very disheartening. ",
            "\u00a0A major weakness of this course was the lack of organization and consistency. TA's weren't well prepared, and the actual lab itself often took longer and was inefficient because no one could really figure out what was going on. Grading of the reports took a long time, and wasn't standardized, so some TA's would mark off points for certain things while others wouldn't. Also, the actual grading was so confusing: missing one sig fig or not including a reaction in the procedure would mark off absurd amounts of points, while very few points would be taken off for answering questions incorrectly. Considering the fact that Dr. G makes up his own rules for sig figs in his class, the huge emphasis on them for grading is ridiculous. \r\nThe lab manuals and syllabus say to reach out to Dr. G or your TA several times if a concept is confusing or if you have questions. However, Dr. G is very intimidating and not easily approachable, and doesn't share information with the TA's, which is very hypocritical. Also, the lab manuals are not written clearly, and don't do a good job of easily explaining the procedure, which makes it difficult to figure out on your own. \r\nAdditionally, all the materials that had to be purchased for this course added up to quite a lot. I had to buy a lab coat, lab notebook, pay to print out the manuals every week, a lock, a flash drive, and a calculator, which came out to a little less than $100. We weren't told about where we could find cheaper or used options, and for a student who has to pay for everything herself without help from parents, it was a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were good research labs but long, sometimes tedious lab reports. ",

            "\u00a0Dr. G is a good lecturer and yes, he is open with his hours. But there's literally no point in the quizzes. It definitely creates a disparity between those in Chem 161 and those in Chem 163 because we are learning different types of material. Though the labs did enhance my understanding of class material, I believe the quizzes were superfluous. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:  The TAs were very helpful and nice with helping during the lab and completing the lab report\r\nWeaknesses: Labs felt very tedious. Some of them coincided with the class material, but most of it seemed kind of out of order. Only a 1/2 credit for doing the same amount of work as some full credit classes ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The course was very well organized and clear. The pre-lab lectures were effective and helpful. \r\nWeakness: I don't believe that the pre-lab quizzes were effective for my learning experience in the course. ",

            "\u00a0The instructions on the lab reports were clear and the TAs and professors were usually helpful, although sometimes the instructions of the TAs were not very clear during the lab. Also, they grade lab reports very harshly. The lectures before the lab were helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths within this course could be found in Dr. G's prelab lectures, which I found to be very helpful and informative, and my TF, Arjun, who was incredibly helpful and allowed the students to feel confident within the lab.  There are multiple problems that lie within this course: grading on a curve where students grades may be rounded down, weekly lab quizzes without adequate ways to prepare, and the subjectivity of TF's grading of lab reports.  I believe that a student's grade should not depend on how his/her peers do.  By putting a grading system of this type in place, it creates a more cut-throat environment.  Why would an individual help his peer when ultimately that could hinder their own chances?  I believe that if a student earns a certain grade, they should be able to keep it.  I do not believe it fair, for example, for a student who earned an A- in the class to get a B+ because the class average is an A-.  Hypothetically, if the class average to be an A, it would clearly seem ridiculous to make the grade of an A equivalent to a B.  \r\nNext, I do not believe lab quizzes should be given without the adequate tools necessary to prepare for such quizzes.\r\nLastly, I never was able to fully understand what I did wrong on lab reports considering certain TF's graded stricter than others.  What was okay for one TF was not necessarily okay for the next.  Because of this, it became challenging to learn from my previous mistakes and fix them.  Perhaps in the future, a TF can be assigned to grade the lab reports for another specific group.  By doing this, a student can improve and receive a better grade. ",
            "\u00a0The course was good in giving first hand experience in how to use lab equipment and properly handle tools. It was weak in that the lab reports were not conducive to learning how things work in actual labs and grading was very particular for issues that were not very important. ",
            "\u00a0Some strengths are that it is very intensive and requires a lot of concentration, allowing for focused laboratory work. Weaknesses include the fact that Dr. G uses a different method of significant figures, which is confusing when taken alongside the lecture course, and the seemingly arbitrary grading criteria used by the lab TFs when they grade lab reports. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\nWe were able to work with some cool chemicals and observe amazing demonstrations.  \r\n\r\nWeakness: \r\nThe lab reports were difficult to complete because we often did not know what the graders were looking for. ",

            "\u00a0It felt as though no matter how much attention I paid to detail on my lab reports, I couldn't get above a B.\r\n\r\nAlso, this isn't a flaw of the course itself, but it should be worth a full credit, not a half credit - four hours a week plus the intensity of the lab reports ",
            "\u00a0The course could be improved in: longer time for the quizzes, time before the lab starts to discuss the entire procedure, practice exercises for the quizzes during lecture. I would also recommend more TA's for smaller groups. ",
            "\u00a0This lab is the only option for students enrolled in Chem 163, despite not being related whatsoever to the material presented in lectures. One weakness of this course is that not enough review is given for students in Chem 163 prior to taking the pre-lab quizzes. Although the content of the quizzes is well within the realm of knowledge students in Chem 163 should have, the time gap between learning such information and the quizzes is often too large to guarantee that these students are given a fair chance when asked to remember specific equations that are not needed to engage with material in Chem 163. A more thorough review of equations should be given, or included in the pre-lab material. ",
            "\u00a0This course did a good job of teaching me how to use lab resources. Often, the content covered in lab didn't line up with the content taught in my chemistry lecture, which probably would have been helpful. Another weakness of the course is that it is only worth half a credit toward my distributional requirements, yet the class took up just as much time (both in lab and outside of lab with lab reports and lab prep) as many of my other classes, with grade deductions for things that didn't really seem to have any impact on my actual understanding of the material. That said, a strength of the course was the grading policy that allows one lab to be dropped. One of the biggest strengths of this course was the TF's. My TF was Arjun, and he was fantastic and made lab a more fun and easier to understand experience, but most of the TF's that I encountered were helpful and very nice. In addition to the TF's, a major strength of this course was that it allowed (and in some ways necessitated) that I connect with other students, most of whom were fellow pre-med students who I was able to collaborate with and become friends with. ",
            "\u00a0I think its good, the work you put in is the work you get in return ",

",
            "\u00a0Some quizzes were unnecessarily difficult and specific. Its impossible to know for what information points will be given or deducted on the lab reports.

            "\u00a0Firstly, I believe the course should be worth 1.0 credits, rather than 0.5 credits, because it is incredibly time consuming. While it was not always intellectually challenging, the combined time of typing up the lab report, preparing for the next lab and the lab itself, was more than what a full credit course required I found. I thought the pre-lab lecture often cleared things up. \r\n\r\nHowever, feedback was very limited and it was never in a timely fashion.  lab reports were returned two, if not three weeks after the deadline. The lab report grades and comments came out two weeks after the due date, at which point the feedback was not very useful, since many experiments were similar to the next one. By the time the feedback was available for the first one, I had already submitted any lab report that would have made the feedback relevant and helpful. ",
            "\u00a0This class was really draining and took a tremendous amount of time (5 hours a week just for the class, plus a lot of out of class work). I think the prelab lectures could be way shorter, and the quizzes are unnecessary. ",

Dr. G taught us well, he taught us a lot, and he taught us fast. The lab quizzes were a good level of difficulty. I loved that we got a detailed template for each lab report. The lab manuals were also nicely detailed. One weakness of this course was that the feedback on the lab reports was not always very clear. Also, the workload was too much for the course to only be worth half of a credit. The course's meeting time was also very long, making for an exhausting day. The large size of the course made it easy to get lost in the crowd and fall behind. ",

They are also graded unfairly where a simple mistake in one calculation but with the correct problem solving/theory is docked all points.\r\n\r\nThe lab reports are graded unfairly. Little mistakes like significant figures should not be deducted so many points if the student understands the purpose and the calculations for each report. ",

I also thought the lab report pages were very helpful since it was basically just a template you had to fill out, and there wasn't a lot of typing out a whole lab report that we had to do. I will say the grading of lab reports was very picky. I thought a major weakness was this course is geared towards students in CHEM 161.

",

Therefore, a \"sloppy report\" with a 0.2% error analysis is likely to receive a lower grade than one with a 60% error analysis that is presented with a better format. In this way, to be successful in this chemistry lab minute details such as lab formatting, partner names, dates, sig figs have a higher emphasis than a correct procedure. Another weakness is that some students know that extra credit is given for standard deviation, while many more do not. This seems unfair to me that the same knowledge is not given equally to all. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes the amount of work to be completed in a given class period was quite large and difficult to complete. ",
            "\u00a0Hands-on experience is fun, but the lab manuals were sometimes confusing and/or poorly edited and there was way too much focus on significant figures. ",
            "\u00a0The course is a comprehensive introduction to lab practices and it manages to walk students through a lot of different lab techniques during the semester. Nonetheless, I believe that as a student of CHEM 163 this lab course was completely disjointed from what I was taught in my introductory chemistry lecture course. There was no clear connection between the topics taught in CHEM 163 as opposed to the intimate connection that existed between the topics of CHEM 134L and CHEM 161. This may have made the lab course seem pointless at times, as it did not build upon the concepts that were taught in lecture in order to analyze in an empirical context. Another weakness of the course was for me the way n which the lab reports were graded. And by saying that, I do not purely mean the way in which points were deducted from the lab reports; rather, I focus on the fact that the lab reports were corrected slowly, not allowing for improvement in a student's work. More specifically, there lab reports were returned to us corrected two weeks after we submitted them. Bearing in mind that a lab report was due on a weekly basis, it was many times the case that the mistakes that were made on one report were repeated on the next one, as the students were unable to identify their mistakes and correct them promptly. Furthermore, the many times excessive focus on detail caused frustration in the students and created a tense relation with the lab course that was unnecessary. Another frustrating aspect of the course, were definitely the pre-lab quizzes. I believe that the quizzes had no other aim other than purely testing how good a student was at retaining the information that was taught in the pre-lab lecture for several minutes and reproducing them at a ridiculous speed in the quiz. There were no skills or critical thinking tested in the quizzes; it was all a matter of mere memorization, something that caused frustration at times, especially when paired with the very harsh grading. All in all, although the course was a thorough introduction to lab practices, I believe that it is necessary that some of its weaknesses are corrected in order for it to be a more effective in its aim. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that the class is very well structured.  The weaknesses are that for some people the responsibility of knowing whats actually happening in the class is entirely one themselves. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are the teaching and the amount of material examined, however, I believe the testing and extreme time constraints for completing each laboratory experiment are severe weaknesses.  To address the weaknesses, the material could be taught prior to the quiz day, and to complete the experiments more comfortably in the given time, the experiment could consist of fewer objectives. ",
            "\u00a0The course effectively teaches the basics of the chemistry lab. The pre-lab lectures provide a good understanding of not only the subsequent labs but also of chemistry as a whole. I often used the information learned in the pre-lab lectures to study for the exams in CHEM 161. \r\n\r\nThe major weakness of this course is that it fosters an environment of cheating. The strict requirements inside and outside the lab (both while following the procedure and while writing the lab report), coupled with the time constraints of lab time and the accuracy requirement for laboratory results (for example, when all calculated R values had to have a percent deviation of less than 3%), encouraged students to alter their results to produce results that matched with what the instructor wanted to see. For instance, some people, when calculating the gas constant R in the Lab #9, obtained a value of R that deviated from the accepted value of R by greater than 3%. These people then altered the measured volume on their data sheets so that the calculated R would fall within that 3% range, without redoing the trial. Faking scientific results, especially in today's society, is totally unacceptable, and I believe that this course could be taught in a way that would discourage, rather than encourage, this falsification. The practice and enactment of true science should always be more important than the results received. ",
            "\u00a0A strength is that you get to apply the knowledge learned from chemistry lecture in lab, which helps to cement that information. A weakness is that the class time is pretty long, partly due to pre-lab lectures and quizzes that last up to an hour. Most of the information covered in the pre-lab lecture is already covered in regular chemistry lecture and in the lab manual we have to read before lab so it is not really necessary to have such a long lecture right before the lab. Also the quizzes expected us to memorize really specific, kind of random, information that was on the lab manual, which was pointless since we were allowed to use the lab manual when carrying out the actual experiments so we did not really need to have the information memorized. ",
            "\u00a0They're should be better feedback regarding what is expected of lab reports. In addition, what is required of lab reports is rarely ever clear before they're due. The expectations should be made more clear. ",
            "\u00a0This course just seemed like an unnecessary weed-out. The curriculum did not correlate to my chemistry course at all, so there was little learning. It was really just about sig figs. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, this course should absolutely be worth more than a half credit. If you add it up, I spend more time physically in lab than in chemistry lecture  classes all week, we have quizzes every week, and the workload is much greater than chemistry. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were all the resources that ensured you knew what to do during the lab itself. While the prelab was sometimes confusing, the lecture and your teaching fellow made sure you knew what to do during the lab and what steps to follow, so while you may walk into the lab anxious, you would still be able to complete the lab. A weakness of this course, I believe, is the disconnect between the lab itself and the lab reports. Often, even if you followed all the steps for the lab and wrote everything down, you would still be missing information needed to write the lab report. In addition, the teaching fellows do not all grade to the same standards. That being said, Dr. G's office hours are a huge help. "

Although most people are just taking it as part of some pre-STEM major requirement, it's usually enjoyable once you get into the lab and get your hands on whatever the experiment is that day.

            "\u00a0A good number of majors require this class, so you'll probably be forced to take it like I was. If you can help it, however, make sure you take this class with some professor other than Dr. G. There are a number of problems with this class - which I'm sure Dr. G. is aware of, as he took the time at the last day of class to stand in front of each of his lectures and beg for a positive review (\"Please put aside any complaints you have about the class, and review me as an instructor who is competent enough to teach chemistry :)\"). Footnote, Dr. G. somehow has learned to speak the smile emoticon - that is how condescending he is. He chides the class for not being prepared when nobody has a question, but when someone does ask a question it's met with \"oh, honey, bless your soul\" levels of condescension (which he delivers only after moving across the entire lecture hall, if necessary, to stand directly in front of you. To ensure you're in striking distance, I assume.). \r\nRegardless, this class will serve as an excellent intro to the phrase \"twice the work, half the credit.\" Dr. G. has bizarre sig fig rules that he expects you to memorize and use for his class, which directly contradict the rules used by the gen chem lecture classes (and, coincidentally, the rest of the world.).\r\nQuizzes are given on the laboratory technique prior to the lab, which makes sense and I suppose helps with being prepared before the lab, but are nonetheless inconvenient and because I am petty I will complain about them.\r\nI did learn a number of basic lab techniques, and for the semester I was in a cohort of 300 or so people who had similar complaints about the class, further reinforcing  my comfort with my Yale Family(TM). In this course, you will also learn how to control your blood pressure while you run through 8 trials in 2 hours because Dr. G. has decided that you must calculate physical constants using experimental results to an insane degree of accuracy: Avogadro's constant with 3% error or less is not the best way to spend your Friday, so don't subject yourself to this class on the pre-weekend if you must subject yourself at all.\r\nIn summary, I complained. You will witness and experience a lot of that if you take this class. ",
            "\u00a0If you're reading this, it's probably too late. Maybe you want to go to medical school. Maybe you want to pursue a degree in chemical engineering. Maybe you just want to feel like a scientist. Either way, one semester of this course will be enough to defile your enthusiasm for chemistry and strip you of any scrap of mental sanity you think you might possess. I did not learn how to balance a redox reaction in this course. I did not gain any new insight into the electromagnetic spectrum. Instead, I learned how to anxiously triple-check my significant digits on a graduated cylinder, and more memorably, how to hold my breath in pure terror when Dr. G walks into the lab. \r\n\r\nIt is not impossible to get an A in this class. You can reap academic success if you allocate your time proactively and strategically. More specifically, read every single word of the 28 page syllabus and befriend your TA; it'll save you dozens of points in the long-run. However, even though there are steps you can take to do well in this class, this half credit still managed to impose an irreparable mental burden on my first semester of college. So, if you feel like you're just shopping this class on a whim, please, please, PLEASE critically ask yourself if you actually need to take CHEM 134L for your prospective major and / or career path. Run, if you still can. ",
