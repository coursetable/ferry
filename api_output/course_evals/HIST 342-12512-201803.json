            "\u00a0I learned a lot of the history of India, and gained are greater understanding of the culture and history of the 2nd largest country in the world. I also learned a little bit about modern day India, and how they view their history. I also feel that I have gained a greater insight in how an Islamic nation can function, and how it has changed. Lastly, it helped me realize how similar India's history and the history of other nations in the area actually is to European and Western-centric history, and that there are less differences than most believe. ",
            "\u00a0Prof Gandhis instruction of history is revolutionary. I thought of historiography in a very different light after this class - felt like an analytical approach to the Mughals that simultaneously read like a bedtime story. The readings are excellent and you should definitely take this course if youre interested in philosophy, arts, and cultural showcases that are so so different from whats common in the West. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a wonderful expose into history that I'd never learned before. "

            "\u00a0I greatly enjoyed the lectures, and how there was at times the class acted as almost a seminar. I think there being so few students was beneficial, as the class felt more personal and connected. I also enjoyed the readings, and felt that the lectures did an excellent job on both covering the materials in the reading and expanding on new information not covered in the readings. The only issue I had was that at times it could be difficult to hear what was being said, but that is in part due to being next to the road and often construction would take place intermittently. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing class- super informative about this period and engaging all the way through. It could be improved with a tighter syllabus ",
            "\u00a0The small seminar size facilitated good class discussions and engagement with the material. It was easy to ask questions and learn more about any particular subject. I especially enjoyed our trip to the museum, and wish we could have had more like it! "

            "\u00a0Very much. I loved this course, and found it engaging throughout the year. I also recommend it because explanations on how this part of India's history is viewed and affects modern India are also useful, since India is going to be more and more important as my generation grows older. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely - amazing class about one of the most fascinating periods of non western history. Philosophical, theological, political- this class covers so much ",
            "\u00a0100%. Totally a gut and super interesting too. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to another student. I learned a lot of fascinating material, read good scholarship, and engaged in interesting discussions. "
