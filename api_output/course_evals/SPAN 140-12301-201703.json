            "\u00a0I appreciated the ability to speak Spanish every day of the week, I feel I made significant progress towards developing greater comfort with the language and a comfort with conversation. In general this class improved my Spanish skills to a high degree. ",
            "\u00a0We learned complex grammatical structures and read a short novel. Even though students presented about Mexico in the 1950s (the setting of the novel), I didn't really learn a lot through those presentations. But I did learn a lot about Spanish this semester. ",
            "\u00a0Great improvement of Spanish grammar, including use of subjunctive, compound tenses and sequence of tense activities. Improvement in writing most noticeable. ",
            "\u00a0I refined the Spanish skills I had, building on a strong base understanding of the language to getting me to a point where I feel completely comfortable speaking, writing, and reading the language. ",
            "\u00a0I became a much more confident writer in Spanish. Also, I became very comfortable with all of the grammar that previously I felt shaky about. I also learned a good bit about culture in Spanish-speaking cultures. I learned the most, however, by listening to Professor Diaz speak. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to speak and write a whole lot better after this course ",
            "\u00a0My knowledge of grammar improved and some of my conversational ability improved as well. I think my writing ability improved the most though. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I think it was well structured, all of the assignments help to build fluency in the language. ",
            "\u00a0We could practice more speaking during class and receive more feedback from the professor. \r\n\r\nWe did do a lot of presentations which were straightforward enough. \r\n\r\nThe novel Las Batalles en el Desierto took up too much time in the course and was not very relevant to today's events. Also, there were a lot of slangs in Mexican Spanish and I would not be able to use those vocabs anywhere but Mexico. ",
            "\u00a0I think this class moves too fast for the level of almost all of the students in it. I understand that spanish II classes have to be uniform across the board to be fair, but I think its problematic that the class doesn't give the professor room to tailor it to the needs of the specific students in the classroom and what they need to review in order to not be lost or left behind. Though we were learning new complex tenses, many of us continued to make very basic mistakes that went unaddressed. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student interested in building towards fluidity in Spanish however I found it required a significant time commitment in order to get the most out of. I would also recommend that students interested in taking this class seriously consider pursuing Spanish at the L5 level afterwards. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student to fulfill the language requirement or if they're really interested in learning Spanish. The course is a lot of work. It's not very challenging, but for the last six (maybe more) weeks of class there's some type of assessment every week, a presentation, composition, quiz or exam. Professor Diaz is a fair grader, but not great at explaining the grammar structures or answering students' questions. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this class helps you learn Spanish more so than any class I've ever had. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it as a way to make sure you keep Spanish in your life as it does force you to think about it consistently, but I would not rave about this class, all in all it seems pretty standard. "
