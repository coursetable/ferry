            "\u00a0Linear model theory from a geometric perspective (i.e. the geometry of least squares estimation where the data are thought of as random vectors). We derived estimators and their distributions (expectation, covariance matrix) of the simple linear model, multiple linear model, and a general linear model. We also derived the hypothesis tests involving linear models. The second half of the course is a final project with student presentations on special topics related to linear models (such as topics in data analysis, other types of regression, etc.). ",
            "\u00a0I learned about linear models, which are critical in statistics. ",
            "\u00a0This courses teaches the fundamentals of linear models, which are really important. We first started by thinking about just fitting data, approaching this in two ways: observations and variables. Then, we moved on to modeling data, looking at the linear model and introducing random variables due to the randomness from errors. Lastly, we moved to taking on a greater assumption of Normality in the errors, which allows us to derive more results, such as with hypothesis tests and confidence intervals. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the fundamentals of linear models. Our study of linear models proceeded in 3 stages--1) Deriving the equation for the least squares regression line in both the single and multivariate cases, 2) Considering the addition of an error term to our model (i.e. viewing our regression line as the estimate for some \"true\" line), and 3) Placing certain criteria on that error term (i.e. errors are iid normal with mean 0 and constant variance) and looking at the implications for statistical inference on some of the estimators (i.e. for points, the slope, etc.) as well as the ANOVA decomposition. We then very briefly covered linear models in R and how the material of the course might extend to L2-probability spaces before moving onto student presentations at the end of the semester. "

            "\u00a0The material was not super engaging and the homework basically asked students to copy their lecture notes. I would like to see more application based problems. ",
            "\u00a0I liked Brinda's visual approach. However, I can't say I learned the material well. The class format of being done with conent at the midterm was not good. I think we would all learn more covering topics as a class, rather than doing individual projects.\r\n\r\nAs a common theme in the S&DS department, a big weakness is the overlap between undergraduate and graduate students. Because every class has so many graduate students, the class moves more quickly and leaves some behind. I think, at least for fundamental courses, there should be separate courses, where the grad classes are much more rigorous. ",
            "\u00a0The course incorporates theory and application, which is a strength. A weakness is that the material is pretty confusing and the homework seemed impossible to do on one's own. ",
            "\u00a0I initially felt that the class was going at too slow a pace and didn't understand the relevance of some of things we were learning. However, I think the material fit together quite nicely once we got to about a third of the way through. In the second half the of course, we did final project presentations. While I think the notion is nice, the presentations were very hit and miss and also very briefly touched on a bunch of topics. I would have appreciated more lectures from Prof. Brinda, who was a great lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0The last few weeks were just dedicated to presentations, which were fun but obviously not as instructive as class time. I think it would've been better to keep the instruction by Dr. Brinda/psets throughout the full semester. ",
            "\u00a0The second half of the course was basically all project presentations and I was very disengaged. The first part was strong and clear. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: lectures are pretty engaging and the professor make a lot of effort to make sure students understand\r\nWeaknesses: not a lot of practice problems, psets and the midterm were pretty difficult ",
            "\u00a0One of the strengths of the course is its reasonable pace; Dr. Brinda took the time to build up theory while reviewing what we had done previously, and he cares about making ideas intuitive, even for those who do not have a lot of theoretical math background. The workload was also quite reasonable. The problem sets helped solidify the ideas from the text (which Dr. Brinda wrote) and a lot of the answers were either done in class or could be found in the text (which I suppose is not so great). However, we only had 3 actual assignments. I think we could have benefited from more assignments with fewer problems spread out (i.e. one due per week instead of one due every 2-3 weeks). I wish the course covered more material. For example, the theory we developed involved pretty basic assumptions about linear regression, and we didn't spend a lot of time on violations of those assumptions, which is important. I also felt like we had to depend on the student presentations to learn these \"additional topics\", which was not that effective because students only had 10 minutes to present on a topic and many presented the same topics. ",
            "\u00a0It covers the fundamentals of linear models and you get to apply it for a final project. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely loved this course. In particular, I absolutely loved the teaching. Professor Brinda is such a great professor. He teaches so clearly, so I was able to finally learn the material. I really loved the textbook, which Professor Brinda wrote, because it is very clear and walks through material in a very understandable manner; you learn the logic behind how to think about and approach the material. I also really, really loved the teaching philosophy behind the homework problems, which Professor Brinda also wrote. The homework problems are of the type that build on one another. They aren't like other classes where they just try to stump you with extremely complicated trick questions. The homework problems for this class are designed so that you can actually learn. This is how homework should always be! All courses should follow this teaching philosophy.\r\n\r\nIn terms of improvement, the suggestion I have is to have just continued learning more material after the third chapter. I didn't particularly enjoy the last weeks of class with the presentations because it wasn't as structured or organized. I think it would've been better if we just kept continuing so that we could learn more material in a more structured way so that it would've been easier to contextualize everything. I also felt like the pace of the class when we covered the third chapter was a little bit too fast; the material was much more difficult to understand in the third chapter. ",
            "\u00a0This was a fantastic course overall that gave me a clear and thorough understanding of the basic theory behind linear models as well as the opportunity to investigate a topic of my choice in more depth in the final course project. Professor Brinda's explanations were usually very clear and well done, and I especially like that he chose a geometric view for this course (representing the variables in the model via pictures) which really helped to encourage my own understanding. Through tying the math back to this intuitive geometric view as well as building up the linear model in layers (i.e. adding additional assumptions), it made the material much more easily accessible. \r\n\r\nI have just a few suggestions: 1) I felt like the pace of homeworks could be a little unclear. Ultimately, we only ended up having 3 relatively large/time consuming assignments (plus a fourth mini-assignment) in additional to a midterm and the final project. However, sometimes it could be a little challenging to know in advance when the assignments would be due as Professor Brinda was writing the textbook concurrently with the course. I think having a few large assignments rather than many smaller ones is okay, but it would have been helpful to have had a better sense of what they'd consist of/when they would be due from the beginning of the course (having the class Piazza from the beginning would also have been helpful). 2) Having some form of practice midterm exam would have been very useful as I had little idea of what to expect from the midterm. The midterm also felt incredibly long, so it would have been helpful to have cut it somewhat. 3) I would have preferred to have covered more content in the final weeks of class rather than watching student presentations. While I enjoyed the opportunity to present (and really really liked having a final project over a final exam), I felt I didn't get as thorough of an understanding of any of the concepts that students presented on (other than my own) as I would have if they had been covered in class. There are certainly many many topics that could have been covered, so I think picking a few to cover in the final weeks and having students present on their own time during reading week or in office hours would have been more helpful. The L2 probability space material was also incredibly interesting, so that could have been a good alternative choice of something to go into in more depth in the final weeks. "

            "\u00a0Personally, I didn't find this class of tremendous use. ",
            "\u00a0Perhaps the class would be better with a different instructor, but definitely don't take the class with Brinda. He's a good teacher, but the way he organizes his class is very poor. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it if Dr. Brinda teaches it because he cares so much about the well-being-being of students and is eager to take time out of his day to ensure that students understand the material. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. It is a very useful topic to understand. If Prof. Brinda is teaching the class, he is a great professor and teaches the material very well. ",
            "\u00a0If youre interested in learning more about linear models (in-depth) and need another credit for AMTH or S&DS, this is a great option. Dr. Brinda has a nice dry sense of humor and is highly enthusiastic about the material. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take it! It's a relatively low-key stats class with minimal homeworks, one exam, and a project. Brinda is a super chill professor, and so long as you put effort in, I think you should do fine. The one thing you need for the homeworks and exam is to brush up on linear algebra--that is the steepest learning curve if it has been awhile, as you need to relearn material. Otherwise, the class is great!\r\n\r\nI will clarify, though, that I am not positive how useful this class is for S&DS in that I'm not sure you'd really need to explain theory behind modeling, but since it is pretty chill, there's no real reason to avoid the class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend. It's a good class to take as a stats major because it gives an interesting and new understanding of concepts in regression. It's pretty hard though. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Historically, people have complained that this course is too theoretical, but for me, this helped me strengthen some of the ideas I learned in statistics and linear algebra. Even though the theory breaks down, linear regression models are still used as an exploratory tool in data analysis, and understanding the theoretical basis for linear models will help you interpret these explorations and move forward. It is a great supplement to machine learning, econometrics, and biostatistics, and the workload is reasonable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn about theoretical statistics. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Linear models is a great class. The material is also pretty useful. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student as I think it gives a good sense of the underlying foundation of linear models. It is also possible to take this course (at least as it was taught this past semester--I cannot speak to future semesters) without having taken S&DS 242 (although I would caution that there are a few concepts from 242 that do come up/that you would have to learn on your own such as MLEs and some components of inference/statistical distributions).
