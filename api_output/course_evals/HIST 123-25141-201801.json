            "\u00a0I learned so much in this class! I think I know more about American history than I learned in my entire life. I learned how to properly take notes-- especially when he would talk fast-- but it was worthwhile. I also learned more about the courts, public opinion, history, and political matters than I thought I would. Rutkow does an incredible job teaching this course, and it truly made me think about American history in a new way!! ",
            "\u00a0This course provided an overview of the development of American legal and political trends since the civil war. ",
            "\u00a0Broad-strokes understanding of evolution of American law in historical context. Interesting stuff. ",
            "\u00a0A general overview of American law. Good general survey course. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely developed the skill to read court cases in a meaningful way. It was very interesting to see the reasoning of all the different cases. I also learned a lot about the Supreme Court and what their role actually is. I learned a ton about the Consitution and multiple court cases along with different kinds of arguments. I also learned a lot of American history. ",
            "\u00a0This course allowed me to practice reading legal documents and understanding complex arguments with the featured case each week. Because the course is also more or less a survey of American history with a legal lens, I was also about to solidify my knowledge of American history that I had learned in high school. ",
            "\u00a0The course is meant to explain the history of the law in America since the Civil War. What I received instead was a disjointed Wikipedia summary of various social movements and legal schools that have existed since 1865. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a great survey in American Law. I learned a lot more about the legal history behind many different parts of history that I had examined in other classes. Professor Rutkow did an excellent job taking us through a long time frame in a coherent way. ",
            "\u00a0Developed greater understanding of legal concepts, cases, and trends. ",

            "\u00a0The course was more or less a rough overview of post-Civil War American history. I did not learn much new information except for the few lectures and readings which focused specifically on schools of legal thought. ",
            "\u00a0Very fast paced but covers a ton of important SCOTUS cases over the years. ",
            "\u00a0I had previously taken Constitutional Law with Akhil Reed Amar, so I already had a solid foundation of knowledge regarding constitutional law in America and its development. This course reinforced that knowledge and provided me with extremely valuable historical context. Con Law with Professor Amar is essentially a close-reading of Supreme Court decisions, while this course is a much more circumspect bird's-eye view of how the American legal system developed over time. I loved this class, and I especially loved the discussion sections, which were the best I've ever had. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about legal history and trends through this course, especially focusing on landmark federal laws and Supreme Court decisions. The lectures were hard to follow, but I ended up learning a lot through doing the readings and section discussions (which were very helpful). The biggest focus in this course is on major supreme court cases and some federal laws. It's very much a survey course. ",
            "\u00a0Cursory overview of the development of the American legal system. All lecture; focus on Supreme Court cases which defined various legal regimes. "

            "\u00a0I think the lecturers were organized really well! I think the beginning lecturers started off a little rocky, and I think it takes time to learn your lecture style-- sometimes the slides were unclear or unhelpful, so more information on those may help-- but you learn quickly. I really appreciate the use of study guides and review sessions before exams. I learned so much in this class, and I'm thrilled we touched on so much. The readings were heavy, but necessary. The assignments and grade breakdown was also great. ",
            "\u00a0I get that it's a survey, but really too much material is being covered too quickly, so that only a superficial understanding of most topics is gained. Maybe focus more on court trends and decisions, and cut from the policy and presidents. ",
            "\u00a0This course felt like it tried to cover so much that everything was presented in a cursory glance, and nothing felt in depth. I have ultimately left the course not really knowing anything more than I came in. ",
            "\u00a0History 123 was a pretty ideal history survey for a STEM major looking for a humanities credit. Relatively light workload, interesting material, and not much prior knowledge assumed. ",
            "\u00a0I wasn't always fully confident this course knew exactly what it was about. While the majority of the lectures and readings were indeed legal history, there were moments when it would drift off into political or cultural history. I often appreciated the digressions, but they occasionally felt unnecessary. There was certainly a nice structure to the class  three modules, each covering about 50 years of history  but that felt constrictive. We spent too much time on the age of laissez faire, for example, and not enough on the long civil rights movement. When there was extra time within these modules, I thought the digressions were more common. ",
            "\u00a0I think the strengths of this course were that the subject matter was interesting, the professor was very knowledgeable, and they injected some different things into the course including videos, short stories, and present issues. There were a lot of readings, and sometimes they could be very dry. Also, lectures were really hard to keep up with sometimes and the things on the exam didn't always match up with the stuff we went over the most. This is probably hard to avoid though. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the material covered and a lot of the assigned readings, especially the weekly featured cases. I felt like way too much information was jammed into the course though, and each lecture felt like a race to fit as much material in as possible. I feel like a lot of important themes and events were barely covered because there just wasn't enough time to dive into them. Overall, the course was interesting but felt too rushed. ",
            "\u00a0Poorly taught: the lecturer never gave theses or nuanced arguments, but rather rattled off various events that had taken place. The point of a history class is to help students understand the past through a specific lens; in this class, the professor told us that certain things had occurred on certain dates, which is not academic history but rather a list.\r\n\r\nPoorly organized: the lecture slides contained far too many words/bullets to be useful. The professor often included quotations (of dubious importance) that occupied the entire slide. Moreover, the syllabus was poorly organized - my legal history class in high school was done better than this. The brief units on women, race, imperialism, etc. made it seem like the professor was only interested in covering those topics to appease those on campus who might otherwise complain. Those topics are unquestionably important and central parts of American history, and he should have done a much better job of weaving them into a broader narrative (which, sadly, was also absent). ",
            "\u00a0The class seemed like APUSH, with more emphasis on court cases. I think it could be greatly improved by cutting some of the historical context and instead going more in depth on the legal rational/precedent behind court decisions ",
            "\u00a0Great course. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures weren't as strong as they could have been, but the readings were very insightful and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Great themes and lectures\r\nWell organized course and syllabus\r\nA manageable amount of reading per week\r\nUse of primary and secondary documents\r\nUse of multimedia, such as films, photos, etc.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nReadings were often not mentioned in lecture or very briefly mentioned. ",
            "\u00a0The readings were often really incredible-- I loved the variety of secondary and primary sources. I also liked the broadness of the course, and felt like I got a really great survey of American history through the lens of law. However, lectures were often more a list of facts and events rather than a clear argument, which I felt was a lost opportunity for deeper learning. ",
            "\u00a0I was frustrated by the shallowness of the course and the feeling that I was not learning anything that hadn't already been taught to me in my high school US history class. Perhaps 150 years of history is simply too much to cover in biweekly 50-minute lectures, or maybe the focus needs to be shifted much more narrowly to specific cases in legal history. ",
            "\u00a0It could be consolidated so topics are covered in more depth. ",
            "\u00a0Great course and excellent content. Professor connected themes, events, trends etc well.  Could use meatier slides and slower pacing. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the focus on one specific case in each section and thought that added a depth of learning to go along with the breadth of material covered in class, creating a good balance. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were really hard to follow. Professor Rutkow would have slides with a bunch of different laws, people, and cases for us to remember, but would cover them really quickly or wouldn't get to them at all. I would have to go back to teach myself the information on the slides, or expect to be caught up during section discussions. I would suggest improving the format of the lectures to make them more engaging and understandable. I understand there's a lot of information to cover, but I would recommend making them a bit slower in pace and really focusing on the most important details of laws or cases. I would also recommend putting more information into the slides, so they aren't just lists of cases and laws. ",
            "\u00a0It's a basic lecture course. Rutkow is a fairly engaging lecturer,  but the class doesn't go beyond a Wiki page. Rutkow loves academic jargen; more background in things he assumes we all know would be helpful. However, overall an interesting fifth class, easy A, and good introduction to American law. The class does a great job of taking things you vaguely know as an American and explaining why things are the way they are. "

            "\u00a0This class was great! I went in very unsure-- both because the class was a little messy in the beginning and because I had never taken a law class-- but fell in love with the course. Prof. Rutkow is such a nice, passionate professor, and he does a great job on his lectures. I can tell he puts his heart and soul into his work. The topics we covered literally hit every angle of a particular time period. We never missed a single talking point! His lectures are so thorough-- you discuss everything from early American cases like Marbury to civil war cases like Plessy to 20th century flashpoints like Roe-- all while learning from history as we go. He's also very unbiased, which I loved. The workload is a 2 page paper, a 5 page paper, a midterm, and a final. Fantastic course! ",
            "\u00a0The course suffers from being too broad in scope. It provides a near complete political history of the U.S. from the Civil War to the present, with important policy decisions, Supreme Court cases, and legal trends sprinkled in. Can be a bit boring at times during lecture, though Professor Rutkow tries to keep things engaging. The readings are mostly very interesting and easily accessible, the two essays are straightforward, and the tests weren't difficult either. ",
            "\u00a0No. Professor Rutkow is great, but this has to rank up there as one of the worst classes I have taken at Yale. To start with, the class itself was basically a glorified AP US History course in terms of content. Professor Rutkow tried to bring some specific legal focus to the class with the weekly case readings, but all in all I don't think there's anything I encountered in this class that wasn't an APUSH topic and I don't think this class lived up to being a purely \"American legal history\" class by any means or brought any analysis beyond just merely glancing over terms and specific events. Second, lectures for this class were really quite unengaging and disorganized. There was so much that Professor Rutkow tried to put into every lecture that often times he would merely just print the name of some event or some person on a slide without ever discussing it- but there were sometimes slides with huge quotes that Professor Rutkow would read verbatim. The course structure overall just felt really incohesive. Sections for the course were also incredibly unhelpful. All in all, I felt like I could have achieved roughly the same education experience if I had just read an APUSH study guide than spending the last semester in this course. I recognize that this was the first time the course was offered, but unless this course substantially changes, I would not recommend it to any Yale student- there are much better classes to take in the history and political science department if you are interested in this topic. ",
            "\u00a0Would definitely recommend. Pretty sure this is the first year History 123 is being offered -- keep it around. Awesome option for a chill humanities credit for someone even tangentially interested in law/policy and the way the law interacts with history. A little bit like Akhil Amar's Con Law, but also a humanities credit and second semester. Take it if you need a humanities credit. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great class for first- or second-year students who are interested in legal history or a survey American course, more broadly. Do not take it after Con Law, and don't take it if you're a history major concentrating in American history  it's too broad and not rigorous enough to be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I'd definitely recommend this class. Excellent professor and good TFs who genuinely care about student learning. I looked forward to lectures bc they were super interesting. Workload is not too heavy, although the course does cover a lot of material which needs to be reviewed before tests ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in American law and don't know much about it, then yes. But its pretty easy and I wouldn't take it if you already know about American law unless you just want an easy course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course because you really do gain a lot of knowledge and skills from it. It really gives you an appreciation for law, but there are just some issues with how the class is set up and run. Overall, still worth it though. ",
            "\u00a0This was probably the best lecture class I've taken at Yale. The material aligns with APUSH (AP US History) in a lot of ways, but goes far beyond just memorizing facts to seeing how things connect and analyzing the real impact the legal system has on US culture, foreign policy, and political trends. Highly recommend. ",
            "\u00a0yes, if they want to take it ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to someone who is interested in more of a survey of American history and is prepared to cover a lot of material. I probably wouldn't recommend this course to someone who really wants to dig into the law and American legal history though just because it didn't have the time to go into great depth. ",
            "\u00a0Not unless the professor and TA's are changed ",
            "\u00a0Of course. Rutkow will be a legendary professor at Yale one day due to his acumen and delivery, so consider this your chance to see history in the making. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!!!!!!!!! I loved this course!!! Professor Rutkow is amazing! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I think it is a great survey in American Legal History. ",
            "\u00a0pretty easy. A good fifth class. Sort of like apush but more focused on the legal aspects. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because it is interesting to read about a variety of different Supreme Court cases and learn about how they shaped society then and in the future. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was one of my favorite courses this semester, and Professor Rutkow made it very entertaining to learn about the legal history of the United States. He is a clear, engaging lecturer and has a great sense of dry sense humor. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend taking this course, especially if you had a subpar civics department in high school. Its such a great survey of law in history and I really appreciated our section discussions! I felt like everyones opinions were respected and that we all engaged with one another really well ",
            "\u00a0I did not think it was a particularly worthwhile course and would not recommend it. The lectures were far too rushed and disorganized for much information to be gained, the weekly readings were (I thought) a bit excessive and arbitrary, and I did not leave the class feeling as though I had gained much. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It will open your eyes to how the American legal system developed and became what it is today -- invaluable knowledge in today's political climate. If you've taken Constitutional Law with Akhil Reed Amar, this class is very similar, but with added historical context. If you love thinking about American history and/or the law -- or you simply want to deepen your knowledge of the American legal system -- then don't hesitate to take this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes- good 5th class, not too much work but interesting to learn about ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to another student unless they were very set on pursuing law or legal history. The lectures are too hard to follow and you end up putting in a lot of work outside of class just to figure out what was taught in the lectures, not even counting the many readings you have to do. I wouldn't recommend this class to a history major unless they were 100% sure they wanted to go into American law/legal system, because it's just not engaging enough. However, the sections were awesome and I really learned a lot through them. ",
            "\u00a0It's a basic lecture course. Rutkow is a fairly engaging lecturer,  but the class doesn't go beyond a Wiki page. Rutkow loves academic jargen; more background in things he assumes we all know would be helpful. However, overall an interesting fifth class, easy A, and good introduction to American law.
