            "\u00a0I developed the ability to more critically analyze arguments and more clearly understand how various political theorists see the world and approach the question of what it means to be human. I also developed stronger paper-writing techniques that will definitely serve me in the years to come. ",

            "\u00a0Critical thought regarding readings; Tracing themes throughout texts across eras;  Critical and Moral Thought both about my actions and the actions of the political system in which I take part; Development of comparative arguments across texts ",
            "\u00a0Major works of Western political philosophy from 1500 to the present. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to not only approach the texts in a nuanced manner (i.e., playing close attention to the arguments and the contexts surrounding the works), but also how to better organize my papers so that the central arguments are clear and each point flows to the next in a logical way. ",
            "\u00a0DS H&P has greatly improved my writing skills and ability to read more comprehensively, effectively and quickly. The seminar-style classes allow us to develop our speaking skills. ",

            "\u00a0Weaknesses: often did not effectively grapple with key questions of the texts; instead got bogged down in fundamentally unsolvable details. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very rigorous, which comes with benefits and weaknesses. The final exam portion is the most worthy of criticism, as any quote based examination is asymmetric with the rest of what DS is about and should be reexamined. For instance, the final could consist of more essay questions or there could be a final essay for each DS course rather than a strangely formatted final exam. ",
            "\u00a0Just like all of DS, the course is well organized and has essentially no weaknesses, as they've had 50 years to perfect the structure and timing of the course. ",
            "\u00a0The relatively little amount of time given to each work is a downside but there's really no way to circumvent that. Yet, given the small space of time, I still felt that I was able to engage with each of the works in a thoughtful, detailed manner. ",
            "\u00a0DS as a program is excellent with breadth, but not with depth. That is okay, because it is still the best way to get introduced to western intellectual tradition. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: really passionate and engaging teacher, content was interesting, readings were hard but doable\r\nWeakness: We went a little too fast through each book, so even if i could keep up with the readings, it just didnt/doesnt stick in my mind. "
