            "\u00a0I learned most importantly how to read a foreign text critically. I also greatly improved my analytical writing skills, which I came into the class feeling self-conscious about. I also gained a strong love for French literature that I didn't really have prior to this course. ",
            "\u00a0I can now understand a lot about French culture and literature as a result of all of our class sessions. ",
            "\u00a0Lots about French literature, writing and discussing in French ",
            "\u00a0We read at least a dozen works this year and the breadth and depth of the French literature we studied allowed me to better understand French culture, history, and literature. We focused on the themes of love, gender, and memory and I really enjoyed being able to analyse these themes across different authors and time periods. The essays and final oral exam in this course also encouraged this type of connection which I enjoyed. ",
            "\u00a0Through this course, I have gained a strong understanding of several great works of French literature, and have been able to discuss and evaluate them critically in French, both written and orally. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: This course was manageable and the texts were interesting, dynamic, and diverse. Prof. Sanjabi was kind, understanding, yet expected highly of her students. Overall this course was very enriching and enjoyable.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class routine became somewhat repetitive. ",
            "\u00a0So many strengths! The professor, the material, and the assignments were all amazing. But, I do think that maybe having more diverse authors might be pretty good. All the same, the selection was amazing!! ",
            "\u00a0All of the texts are really great and you get to read a ton. My only complaint is that you don't get to go very deep into any of them so sometimes don't do the readings justice. ",
            "\u00a0I wish we could have spent more time on the works that we read. Other than that though, Mme Sanjabi was a great teacher: cares a lot about her students and is so knowledgeable! ",
            "\u00a0Although we read a lot of material for this course, the reading assignments were well spaced out so that I never felt that I was being overwhelmed with reading, especially if you budget your time well. The frequent short homework responses also encouraged me to do the reading and analyse it on a deeper level. The success of the course depends in large part of how involved the students are, so I felt that the structure of the course was perfect. ",
            "\u00a0This course is strong in the way students are asked to engage with the texts, through written essays as well as in-class presentations. The literature felt very cohesive and followed generally a lot of major themes in the course.  One improvement might be to add more literature from French authors that come from all over the francophone diaspora (like from Africa or the Caribbean) , and not mainly European France-based authors. "

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another students who is proficient in French. Learning to read literature, rather than non-fiction texts like newspapers or journals, is an exciting challenge. I feel that both my oral and written French has improved with this class. Professor Sanjabi is a wonderful woman, and she cares for her students greatly. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, of course! They should come in with a strong French language foundation in order to contribute to discussions, but the only real requirement is to come ready to engage with the material! ",
            "\u00a0Overall a good course. Reading is interesting, Sanjabi knows her stuff and runs a good discussion. A few caveats: workload is highly variable. You will have next to no work one week and a lot the next. It averages out to be very manageable but is quite inconsistent in terms of length of reading / whether you have an essay. Also Sanjabi tends to ask a lot of leading questions and isn't satisfied until someone says what she's thinking specifically. On the whole, however, you read some really cool stuff and the class is well structured and Sanjabi is a very nice woman. I'd say take it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would highly recommend this course to another advanced French student. It provides a good foundation of French literature while also examining the tough themes of gender, love, and memory. We did not just analyse the literature itself either but we also discussed the background of each author and how their upbringing and contemporary culture influenced their work and the interpretation of their work. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course was very helpful in developing my understanding of French and would be for any student taking the course. Through reading these texts I was able to improve my own writing and become more skilled at analyzing and later discussing works in French "
