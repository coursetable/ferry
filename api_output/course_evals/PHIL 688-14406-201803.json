            "\u00a0The course overall was a delightful survey of multiple fields within contemporary philosophy (and the problems therein as discerned by MDR), and I learned quite a bit in every topic we covered. I also learned quite a bit about the history of analytic philosophy and metaphysiss which was incredibly helpful. Outside of this, my ability to construct cogent, concise and well crafted arguments drastically improved from this course. In short, I learned what real philosophy in the modern day looks like, and it was an exhilarating experience. "

            "\u00a0This was one of the greatest courses I have ever taken, not only at Yale but in my entire career as a student. With that said, I wish we spent more time on the material addressed at the end of the course-- particularly methodology, taming the PSR, and metaphysical explanation. I think the course would have been a little stronger if we spent more time on these topic and less on the Kripke's paradox. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the class was engaging with fresh and interesting philosophical content. The main drawback of the class was the difficulty of establishing the state of play in the areas discussed prior to the interventions. This was a class in which the divide between the needs of undergrads and graduate students was very apparent, so it was at times frustrating when it was difficult to sustain a graduate-level discussion. The graduate section itself unfortunately didn't make up for it; for whatever reason, the energy  level and level of engagement was pretty low (I hold myself and the other grad students responsible for this; in my view it is our responsibility, not the instructor's, to make the graduate section what we want). I often found myself wishing we had gone deeper in a more systematic way into the central issues. So while the class was good, it also showed some serious structural issues. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this to a student who would actually take interest in the material and is intellectually ready for it. In such a case, I certainly would recommend this course to anyone. "
