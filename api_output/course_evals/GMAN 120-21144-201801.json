I believe that the course was a good mixture of speaking, grammar, and culture, and that it was also strong in terms of the diversity of coursework (written exercises, speaking tasks, planning and acting out skits, listening to music, watching movies, etc.). Professor Stockloev was also a huge help and made the class very enjoyable. "
