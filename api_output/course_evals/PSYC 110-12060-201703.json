This course gives you a great overview of psych in a chill, easy to follow manner. You really need to learn to keep up with the material though because it can be an overwhelming amount if you put it off.

            "\u00a0As a student who has never taken Psychology before, this course gave me a basic, wholistic understanding of the field, and provided a solid base for me to build my knowledge upon. I am not interested in being a Psychology major  I took the course hoping to gain a better understanding of how my own mind, and the minds of those around me, work. This desire was absolutely satisfied. In every lecture, I learned something (sometimes many things) that I could apply to my life, and left feeling as if I had reasons for phenomenons that I had always observed but could never pinpoint the cause of before. The course made me think more carefully about my interactions with others, and to always consider other people's motivations and thought processes. ",
            "\u00a0I knew nothing about psychology before taking this course, but I learned and actually retained so much of the taught material. It was extremely interesting to me because I was able to apply these to my social interactions and to understand how the people around me and I think, and why certain strange things happen. ",
            "\u00a0This class offered a strong overview of psychological principles, accessible to someone like me who is studying an unrelated field. Guest lectures from Yale faculty doing research in this field also helped provide insight into the kind of work that is popular in psychology today. ",
            "\u00a0I learned quite a breadth of knowledge about the field of psychology, and I discovered I have quite the passion for it. I found myself fascinated with the mind (and its tricks!)  after this course, constantly researching recent psychological studies. I may choose to major in psychology after this course and PSYC 179 this semester. ",

This method of teaching also forced me to take detailed notes and ask questions of my TF when necessary. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about many different aspects of psychology, mostly experimental over clinical, including social, developmental, and other psychology areas. I learned a breadth of information about the human experience and the scientific breakdown of human behavior, from how we grow and develop to how we interact in communities and groups to psychological disorders.

            "\u00a0This class is very set to the lecture slides.  The exams were sometimes difficult because they were very specific to the exact definitions explained in lecture and were always looking for some specific word.  Even when you showed full knowledge of a topic on an exam, you would still get point marked off due to missing a specific word that Dunham said in his lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Interesting material\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: many students in lecture and no section, so there are limited opportunities to ask questions. However, you can always go up to the professor after class or email a TA/professor to get a question clarified. The questions on the exam also sometimes don't accurately represent what we learned in class/in readings. ",
            "\u00a0This course is mainly based on memorization and the content can be very interesting. However, there are many aspects of the course that is lacking. The professor provides very limited preparation for exams, not giving us any practice exams, except a few questions that didn't illustrate the difficulty of the exams. There was no comprehensive syllabus describing what we needed to know for the exam and everything was very vague, so it was more of a guessing game when it came to what we needed to know. ",
            "\u00a0I feel that the lectures of this course were very helpful and were very important to attend in order to understand the topics being taught but I feel like the test focused very much on very specific topics that were covered very quickly in class and that did not have very much emphasize placed on. ",
            "\u00a0I don't think this class has very many strengths, and there were a number of weaknesses. First, the material was presented at a surface level and was not difficult; the material felt like it was at a high school level. Second, as a result of having such easy material, the sheer amount of material was rather overwhelming. Thus the class turned simply into an exercise in memorization. For anyone who's not a psychology major, you'll forget everything you learned in the class within weeks. Third, on anything that wasn't multiple choice, the grading with incredibly unfair and very nit-picky. If something was correct but not one of the options on the answer key, it was marked wrong. Clear expectations for assignments were not provided ahead of time, and assignments were graded so slowly that it was often difficult to apply feedback from one assignment to the next -- if it was given at all. Fourth, Professor Dunham likes to say he grades by a curve to help differentiate students and small mistakes don't mean a lot. However, his tests are, relatively speaking, rather easy, so there is not much differentiation. For example, on the second midterm, an 85% was a B+ and an 81% was a B-. Very similar performance on the midterm netted very different grades. Fifth, the curve is very difficult. For example, a 93% on the second midterm was a A-, not an A, and about 25% of people will end up with a final grade of C or D. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course include interesting topics paired with real-world applications. The weaknesses include long lectures that are often hard to engage with. Also, the final exam is cumulative and is given just a week after the last lecture that is included on the test. ",
            "\u00a0The teaching staff did an excellent job creating midterms and finals that cover the information we learned thorughout the course. The powerpoints prepared by the teaching staff were excellent since they contained both the lessons from the textbook as well as additional examples of expirements. I did not like the ambiguous grading rubric of the weekly reading responses. One week, a certain response could earn you a 2/3 while in another week, a very similar response could earn you a 3/3. ",
            "\u00a0The course is super interesting and isn't a super high workload. ",
            "\u00a0Yarrow was great and the lectures were really fun and engaging. I wish I had received grades in a more prompt manner and had a better idea of what my overall grade in the class was. The tests were fair and readings were interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Fantastic lectures. Would maybe like to have a section for the course so there could be more TF involvement. Wish there was more exam prep like a study session. Also would like the exams to focus more on reading material. ",
            "\u00a0The 10 page paper felt a bit pointless to me, and lectures were definitely not as interesting as an intro psych lecture could be. ",
            "\u00a0Even though it was a lecture, Professor Dunham did a good job engaging students with his lectures and I always did enjoy attending class. However, there are a good amount of reading responses (and a 2000 word popular press assignment) which I did not expect, especially since this course wasn't a writing credit. Another weakness was that grades took a long time to get back. Understandably, it's a large class but many people went into the final having not received the majority of their reading response grades. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: great material, engaging lectures, and challenging yet fair tests\r\nWeaknesses: one page responses were not helpful, the TA's did not seem to grade the same for every response ",
            "\u00a0I think that there should be more of a focus on how we can apply what we learn to our everyday lives ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very typical weekly routine - no surprises, balanced coverage of a variety of topics, engaging professor, standard structure for all exams\r\nWeaknesses: unclear/inconsistent grading of reading responses, slow grading/feedback (though most likely due to a large number of students for very few TAs) ",
            "\u00a0The material was extremely interesting, but the course itself is poorly structured with little to no avenues for help. Yes, you could schedule a meeting with a TF, but I would appreciate a discussion section to better understand the material. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course is very standard. However, I did not particularly like the structure--reading chapters from the textbook and then listening to summaries of the same material in lecture. This process was redundant and boring. I would have preferred a range of material and more stimulating lectures that provided new knowledge. I also did not like the structure of the exams; they were either too easy or unreasonable. ",
            "\u00a0The best part of Intro Psych was definitely the lectures. Professor Dunham was very engaging throughout, with well-organized PowerPoints that included diagrams and fun videos to illustrate the concepts we were learning. There wasn't ever a topic I found boring, and I credit that to the lectures.\r\n\r\nI think there was a weakness in the required reading responses. They required that students choose 2-3 topics from the reading to respond to every week, which sounds pretty simple, except that it is difficult to respond to a textbook with information consistently presented as facts. I wish we had gotten more specific prompts to respond to each week (maybe a pool of them that we could choose one of to write). This would also have given more practice for how to write answers on the exams.\r\n\r\nGrades on assignments, particularly the paper we had to write, came back very slowly, and we were not allowed to have our midterms back. This made preparing for exams and understanding our standing in the class particularly difficult. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course is a very manageable, broad introductory class. It does a great job exposing students to many different fields of psychology, and keeping them entertained. I'm not sure how it could be improved, other than potentially finding a way to make students solve problems rather than regurgitate information. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Extremely engaging material and lectures\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None noticeable ",
            "\u00a0The course is taught efficiently and is well organizedclasses often ended early. However, the course is largely just rote memorization. Exams could benefit more from analysis or application of information to novel scenarios. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the class was extremely interesting in that the subject matter was really intriguing and the lectures held my attention well. The reading can be a lot, but most of it is interesting, especially the reading that's assigned outside of the textbook. The reading responses could be frustrating because it seemed like the grading was really specific, and it was sometimes hard to tell what you were doing wrong. The level of intensity also seemed to vary widely across the TA's. ",
            "\u00a0For the most part, the course material is interesting and offers a broad picture of psychological topics.\r\n\r\nI found that the grades on weekly reading responses and on the mid-year writing assignment were given a bit randomly. ",
            "\u00a0The class itself was pretty great - course material was interesting, although because we covered so much, we were not able to do any in depth analysis of one topic. But nonetheless, it was an enjoyable, well taught class - reading responses did what they were meant to: ensure that you at least tried to keep up with reading and class material. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were great - I loved Prof Dunham.\r\n\r\nLOTS OF BS WORK. Weekly reading reflection were very pointless and waste of time. Also if you are unlucky, your TA will use them as a way to dock points. The midterm essay was also WAY longer than it should have been. Most people end up BSing and it takes the TAs forever to read through them. Too much unnecessary work. ",
            "\u00a0Faster grading. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were good. I didnt really enjoy doing all the reading responses and felt that doing 6 was unnecessary, considering that I wasnt interested in every single weeks topics. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the lectures and I think having us do reading responses helped me actually complete the readings on time/in full. I would have liked more one-on-one attention, especially around the tests. Perhaps having some review sessions? ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: course was laid out well, with reading responses due every week that reinforced concepts in lecture; Professor Dunham's lectures were all very interesting and he gave the right amount of examples and definitions to balance out\r\nWeakness: It's difficult to keep every student engaged (nature of lecture style class); grading wasn't always consistent and left many students wondering how they're doing in the class ",
            "\u00a0The course was nice to take, but I thought the reading responses were a really arbitrary assignment to give. I understand that it was suppossed to encourage us to read and delve further into a topic of our interest, but I don't think they're a more accurate assesment of whether or not we did our work then multiple choice questionsor something of a similar nature. In addition, the grading system seemed very random. I wasn't sure what  gave a response a 2 and what warranted a 3. The one page on the syllabus telling us what was expected from a reading response was not very helpful either. ",
            "\u00a0Not sure if this can actually be improved on, but, as a freshman from a small community, it's difficult competing with most of the class--most of whom are sophomore premeds who will all be aiming for an A. Even though I feel as if I know the information quite well, I will most likely be getting an A-, an admirable grade but despite the amount of studying I put in/knowledge that I feel I know and took away, it doesn't quite feel right to me. ",
            "\u00a0I think a weakness of the department is that Intro CogSci cannot substitute as the Intro Psych prerequisite for the major/higher level courses when the courses felt very similar. I definitely think I would have gotten more out of Intro Psych had I not already taken Intro CogSci. \r\nI also think that Intro CogSci is a generally better designed course, largely because of the readings. I found the Intro Psych textbook to be relatively unhelpful and that it tried too hard to be funny. Reading responses also felt superfluous since I wasn't trying to digest particularly difficult material. Sometimes I looked up primary sources on my own based on the textbook reading, but I generally think it would have been more beneficial and more interesting to be reading particular articles as case studies of the concepts we were learning than to be reading textbook chapters--something that Intro CogSci does very well. \r\nThe Intro Psych lectures however were very well organized and Professor Dunham was an excellent lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n\r\nGood, organized lectures!\r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n\r\nTerrible grading. As in, I had no idea why I was getting the grades I was and also the grades would come in like months after I finished an assignment. My TA was super distant and cold and would barely respond to e-mails asking if I could see midterm scores, or why I got grades that I did.\r\n\r\nThe lectures are good but I was so frustrated by how arbitrary all the grades felt. Practice what you preach when it comes to good learning; I got barely any feedback all semester. I feel like people who are experts in psychology should know better about how to handle these classes. Yes, it's a large lecture, but having been in too many giant intro STEM classes, the grading could have been handled better. ",
            "\u00a0Needs discussion section. ",
            "\u00a0Dunham is a good lecturer, but curve is so rough (average to B-/B) that you basically get whatever your raw score is in the class. Also, turnaround for assignemnts is incredibly slow despite it being the TA's only job (no section). Still haven't received a small reading assignment grade from November 10th (it's December 22nd). ",
            "\u00a0The course covered a lot of information well and the activities run in the class kept students involved during class. It was really hard to study for the exams though because it was difficult to tell what was important for them. ",
            "\u00a0The grading of reading responses out of 3 points felt very arbitrary and really harmed the grade if 1 or 2 points out of 3 were given, since there were so few reading responses and not much room to recover. I think dropping the lowest grade is a better system rather than not doing 1 of the responses. I also think grading out of more points would be a better system as well. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were interesting, but the text was terrible. It oversimplified all of the material, to the point of making cute little jokes to explain concepts in the dumbest way possible. This made reading responses particularly difficult to do, because you were supposed to engage with the text and talk about some interesting aspect of it, whens most of it was not very interesting at all. I preferred the supplementary papers that were posted as readings for some of the lectures - these papers actually went into depth and treated their topic with more attention and thoroughness. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were the teaching and lectures.  They were really cool and supplemented with cool videos that keep things interesting despite the long class.  Guest lectures were also cool!  Weaknesses include the grading on the exams.  It was super unclear what was expected and points were taken off for dumb things like not explicitly saying one word despite otherwise fully answering the questions.  They also took FOREVER to grade things.  So you had no idea where you stand in the class.  Starting off credit/D it was hard to make a decision given we had gotten pretty much nothing back. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Lectures were extremely interesting and relevant to day-to-day life. Really changes the way you think about your brain and how the world works. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Curve is really unforgiving. Also, the long written assignment can be quite annoying and unnecessarily long. You also get very little feedback about how to improve on writing assignments. ",
            "\u00a0I think the class is structured well. We learn a lot of material and the tests are not hard. However because the tests are not hard the curve is very bad. I don't think this class should be curved because if everybody has achieved an A level understanding of the material then they should be rewarded accordingly. ",
            "\u00a0The course is well taught, and lectures are very clear and engaging. The most obvious weaknesses are the sometimes strangely written test questions and the very, very slow grading speed, which makes it difficult to improve based on any sort of feedback. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is that the content itself is interesting. Prof. Dunham is, although maybe a little calm and dry, entertaining and usually has a good story to tell with every lecture. Lectures were actually fun to go to and they were always filled with interesting information. The course is excellent in giving a great survey of the field of psychology, and it even made me consider majoring in psychology.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of the course is that, in terms of grading, assignments are not graded fast and many times you don't have any idea what your grade is. Reading responses have a certain format that need to be followed, but if you don't uncover that format, then you'll be getting middling scores for all of your responses. Maybe it was my TA in particular, but comments left on responses were very vague, and it was hard to improve when they were graded at such a slow pace. Even if the comments were life-changing, they came a month after I turned the assignment in, and I would have already turned in three responses, and they would be subject to being graded as if I knew what to fix. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are definitely Prof Dunham. He really knows his material and I'm impressed by his ability to lecture without hesitation. He truly comes prepared and he also has a good sense of humor. I really liked the pictures/videos he showed of his daughter. In terms of the midterms and final exam, I think it was really fair the way the test is written. I really appreciate that Dunham posts a few sample questions for us because the actual test is pretty close to the format. \r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses are hands down the grading system of this class. I think there are clear discrepancies in the way TAs grade. I also just feel that this class is set up in a way that it is easy to do poorly. For example, you have reading responses, but because they are only out of 3 points, if you lose even one point, that will harm your weighted average of these reading responses. You really don't have a large margin for error in these, and it becomes a bit hard to think of creative ideas for these reading responses because I felt that once I found a way that earned me a 3, I was too afraid to venture to say new things in each of my responses. I also really disliked the research component we were required to do. I wish it could be a part of our grade because I think this was a lot of work, and would have been nice to have gotten credit for it. (For those who don't know, you're required to do 5 hours of research participation for this class, and it does not help your grade; it can only hurt your grade by a full letter grade if you do NOT complete all 5 hours). ",
            "\u00a0Professor Dunham is an outstandingly clear and engaging lecturer. The material itself is fascinating and fun. The readings, though, felt like a waste of time since, although they were a pleasure to do, they never appeared on any exam. ",

            "\u00a0This class is very subjective and unfair. There is not a lot of continuity in grading across TF's. Also, I did not particularly like the experiment requirement in the class. It seemed like a waste of time and I did not really learn nor engage with the experiments that I did participate in. Moreover, this class is essentially just a memorization class. The majority of your grade is exams, which are essentially just a test of what you can memorize. Lastly, the popular press article was harsh in that it was an unconventional paper yet little help was given on how to do well on it. ",
            "\u00a0The course was extremely straightforward yet very interesting, which was a major strength. The lectures were extremely engaging. However, I felt like we covered so many topics that it was hard to get more than a cursory look into many interesting topics. Of course, that may just be the nature of an introductory class but perhaps having time to really commit things to long-term memory instead of just to working memory might be interesting to consider.

            "\u00a0The course provides a strong foundation for the field of psychology; the implications of this is that some lectures are more interesting than others, and sometimes the lectures may not go as in depth as desired. One important note is that computers were not allowed in class for the purpose of taking notes, only pencil and paper. ",
            "\u00a0This course does a good job presenting the raw material, like facts, historical information, and the views of eminent figures. The information is comprehensive, and the class appeared to not cover any more information than was necessary. This was also somewhat of a weakness for the course, since the rote absorption and memorization of information could become exhausting towards the end of the term. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were very engaging and readings outside of class (especially the journal articles) were helpful and enjoyable. Textbook readings were less useful and more redundant of in-class material. Tests generally felt very reasonable, while grading of written assignments felt much more arbitrary. ",

            "\u00a0This class seemed typical of an intro course, but it often seemed like the tests contained information that had been very briefly mentioned in lecture and were never touched on again. It was also incredibly frustrating because the TFs were absurdly slow to grade assignments, so reading responses would not be graded for weeks after they were due. The same occurred with the tests. Also, I received no feedback on the majority of my assignments. ",
            "\u00a0TAs were brutal. They all graded differently, slowly, and often harshly. I think it is so hard to do well in this class that it took away some of the enjoyment. The material and instructor are so fascinating and I wish I could have embraced that more freely. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were engaging and often involved videos or stories about real people that exhibited the prevalence of the things we learned. They were also very organized and easy to take notes on and understand. The course was straightforward and interesting. However, the grading was a bit confusing at times. For me personally, my TF had a busy schedule and was slow on grading, so I didn't get frequent feedback on reading responses, and I wasn't quite sure what the expectations were for the popular press writing assignment. ",

Thus, I did not know how to improve my work, and felt that maybe they weren't putting any actual thought into reading and grading my assignments. \r\n\r\n- some of the outside readings (particularly the article on heuristics) were very difficult to follow, and didn't seem necessary to the course \r\n\r\nWays to improve: \r\n\r\n- ensure that teaching fellows are required to give substantial feedback \r\n- cut out any reading material that is unnecessary to the course ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are that the professor was extremely good, and that the material tested was identical to the material taught (no completely abstract thinking). The only weakness, in my opinion, was that the assignments were graded extremely slowly. I understand that it is a large class, but that is why there are TFs. Some assignments took months to reach Canvas, and I just found that to be a bit too much. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Dunham's lectures were thorough and understandable, and the course overall was very well-structured. All in all the class was pretty  low-workload (two midterms and a final aside), but it is on a curve and it's far from an easy A. I did find that the weekly reading responses didn't help me all that much -- I think that something like writing weekly summaries of recent psychology papers might be more effective, and give students a broader overview of the field and what kind of research is popular today. ",
            "\u00a0I believe this course is very strong in terms of content and engagement. I think the lectures were fantastic--Professor Dunham is amazing. However, I believe the curve is graded partially unfairly. Since every student has a different TF, their reading responses are graded differently. This means that, if one TF grades more easily, those students get an advantage on the curve. Additionally, some TFs give a lot more feedback on reading responses, and this compounds the disparity. I believe if this course took a note from ECON 115, where every single students' pset was graded by a single TF, then the next pset was graded completely by another, this would make it more fair and it would leave the same amount of work on the TFs' shoulders. This was my biggest issue with the class, as those few points from reading responses can bump you up a bracket on the curve--something that should not be left up to alphabetical chance. ",
            "\u00a0There are very few strengths to this course. The material was generally good for an introductory course but this was not reflected by the material on exams, where an obscure detail in a lecture slide would be tested on. The feedback in this course was absolutely abysmal. There is no chance for a student to see how their work could be improved upon before completing new assignments (mainly reading responses). Grades were released after excessively long periods of time. There was absolutely discrepancy amongst TAs in grading standards. The short answer and essay portions of exams were graded unfairly in my opinion, with subjectivity of the grader a big portion of this problem. I think this class has great material and is important but many of the ways in which it is run can hurt students depending on your TA. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were the lectures, which were engaging and well organized. The weaknesses were the long time it took to get feedback on assignments and the ambiguous grading on the popular press article and the reading responses. ",

As it is, there were only two or three questions per exam that relied on understanding the text (not just the lectures), so I didnt want to waste too much time studying the entire huge textbook when I knew I probably wouldnt remember whichever two or three random details in it were tested anyway. ",
            "\u00a0This class was great except for the required participation in studies. I understand why they do it, but it was inconvenient and unrealted to anything we studied in class. ",

            "\u00a0The strongest aspect of the course is that it forces students to stay engaged with the material that is presented in class. The lectures, reading responses and essay encouraged students to check their level of understanding constantly and consistently. The weakest aspect of the course is the sheer level of material that is presented. It was difficult sorting through the chapters in the textbook to recognize which information was most relevant to the course. On several occasions there was material from the textbook that was noted as unnecessary only after the fact. ",

I would say the class should have more than 4 TAs, as giving each TA 30+ students cuts back on the feedback they can provide to each student individually and makes it take much longer for students to get feedback. For example, I would get scores on my reading responses so far after I turned them in that I never really took the opportunity to use my past results to modify my responses going forward, as it was just too late.

            "\u00a0The course material is very interesting. A weakness of the course is the TA system; without having any actual sections, I didn't know my TA at all and found it difficult to communicate with them. Optional sections should definitely be available. Also, students shouldnt have to participate in studies to get credit - I don't think I really learned anything from the studies. Students should, of course, be encouraged to participate in the studies of their own volition.\r\n\r\nAlso, the questions chosen to test us in the midterm and final were annoyingly designed to test rote learning of minute details or exact definitions in the textbook. A better, deeper and more interesting way of testing knowledge would be to have questions testing a more conceptual understanding of the material rather than memory of the exact words of a definition (i.e. fewer multiple choice!). ",
            "\u00a0It was really interesting, and the lectures were very helpful. I didn't find the textbook to be very helpful in terms of success on tests and other assignments. Mostly, all of the information came from lectures and what he had said, and this made it hard for me to make sure I knew all of the information for tests. ",
            "\u00a0One strength is the variety of topics covered during this course. In addition, it was taught very well through the main professor, in addition to several guest lectures. The information was organized well and correlated well to the textbook material. One weakness might be the lack of discussion section to summarize material, but this is mainly due to the self-taught nature of the textbook material. ",
            "\u00a0It was just hard to take this along with other hard classes. Thought would be easier. ",

            "\u00a0I think that this course would benefit from a section, in order for students to discuss the readings and formulate reading responses. Other than that it was a very interesting and informative course. ",
            "\u00a0This class is not hands-on at all. I think a discussion section could facilitate this, but at the same time I think a discussion section would not be holistically beneficial. ",
            "\u00a0Overall I really liked this course! I thought that lectures were vere very engaging and enjoyed the opportunity to delve further into the the material through assignments. I felt that the popular press assignment was especially effective at giving choice to examine psychological research of particular interest. I also really liked the opportunity to hear from guest lecturers who are active in the field. \r\n\r\nIn terms of weaknesses, I wish there had been more ways to interact with the material and teaching staff. I think an optional discussion section could have been a nice addition in order to increase engagement. I also feel as if the exams emphasized rote memorization over conceptual understanding. Therefore, I think it would have been helpful to have replaced an exam with an additional paper and/or to have made the exams more conceptual in nature. Also, I felt like I didn't gain that much from participating in the psychological research studies. Perhaps each study could have counted for more credit time and included talking to the researchers about the study and writing a brief report which ties it into course concepts. ",

First, the material was presented at a surface level and was not difficult; the material felt like it was at a high school level. Second, as a result of having such easy material, the sheer amount of material was rather overwhelming. Thus the class turned simply into an exercise in memorization. For anyone who's not a psychology major, you'll forget everything you learned in the class within weeks -- you'll get nothing out of it. Third, on anything that wasn't multiple choice, the grading with incredibly unfair and very nit-picky. If something was correct but not one of the options on the answer key, it was marked wrong. Clear expectations for assignments were not provided ahead of time, and assignments were graded so slowly that it was often difficult to apply feedback from one assignment to the next -- if it was given at all. Fourth, Professor Dunham likes to say he grades by a curve to help differentiate students and small mistakes don't mean a lot. However, his tests are, relatively speaking, rather easy, so there is not much differentiation. For example, on the second midterm, an 85% was a B+ and an 81% was a B-. Very similar performance on the midterm netted very different grades. Fifth, the curve is very difficult. For example, a 93% on the second midterm was a A-, not an A, and about 25% of people will end up with a final grade of C or D. I would strong recommend avoiding this class. ",

            "\u00a0It is a great introductory class and the lecture is really cool and had lots of videos of fun and interesting experiments.  I actually wanted to goto lectures.  The exams are not hard and straight memorization.  They are a bit harsh and nitpick on the grading though which is super annoying and probably ended up being inconsistent.  They also took FOREVER to give back grades.  you basically have no indication of how youre doing ever. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, Dunham is a very good lecturer who will make sure you enjoy going to every class. Well-worth the hassles of the weekly reading responses and long writing assignment. The class is curved pretty harshly though, so your experience will depend heavily on how the TA grades your assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was a great overview of human psychology, quick paced enough to keep you interested but detailed enough to leave no gaps. Professor Dunham does a wonderful job in lecture as well, very engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend this course. It is a good course that let's you understand yourself and others better. There are some pretty interesting topics that we cover. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course, both because psychology is a generally interesting and important subject to have a basic grounding in and because the course is well taught. However, be prepared to get assignments back weeks or months after you turn them in. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The course is relevant to our daily lives and teaches students things that are important to keep in mind. Discrimination, conformity, and violence can all be boiled down to fallacies of psychology, and it was eye-opening to think about how important it is that we all realize that our own prejudices are but mere consequences of misguided psychology. I think that everyone should take this course, if only to get that. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you need to take this class, that's one thing, but if you just want to learn more about psychology or need a So credit, really consider this class. I will say I heard that the spring semester is usually taught better, but I think Dunham did a fabulous job. ",
            "\u00a0PSCY 110 is a truly outstanding course. The material is engaging and the lectures are fun, clear, engaging, and insightful. Its grading system and workload are reasonable. I would recommend this course to any student looking for an enjoyable and intellectually fulfilling course. ",
            "\u00a0if they are interested in psyc, sure. I was not, and found it difficult to engage ",
            "\u00a0I believe this is a great introductory course because it is so straightforward yet interesting. The current set up of the class rewards the student that takes the time to attend class and read through the textbook in a way that is not the case in many other classes. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course -- Professor Dunham is a great lecturer and makes the content really captivating. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Super interesting and a fun class. ",
            "\u00a0It is a tough intro level course because alot of topics are covered over a short span of time but it is interesting so yes, I would recommend it to another student. ",
            "\u00a0Hell yes! Yarrow is the best, and the class is both simple and straightforward as well as informative. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student who is interesting in gaining an overview of the field of psychology and may be interested in delving further into the field in the future. The workload for the course is really manageable, and it provides an introduction to the main topics of psychology. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. This course covers a wide variety of interesting concepts that are also relevant to everyday life. The class is well structured for learning, and the coursework is light enough that you can actually enjoy the material taught. The information is taught and presented in a way that makes it manageable for any student, even those with absolutely no experience with psychology before. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It was very easy to follow the material and actually an enjoyable things, something I often forget about learning, ",
            "\u00a0The content of this course, namely in the textbook, was quite interesting and I would recommend any student thinking about psychology to take the course for that reason. However, I would caution them about grading for the course, as grade distribution often seemed very strict, and discourage students who value feedback from taking the course. ",
            "\u00a0I don't know that I would - unless they want to major in psychology. Taking the course a fun way to learn new things seemed to backfire on me. ",
            "\u00a0If you're at all interested in psychology or haven't taken a class before this a good course to take. It will bring you through the basics of what you should know and introduce you to interesting articles and ideas. The course isn't an automatic A. Understanding the concepts isn't difficult, but there's a lot to remember and this presents the real challenge of the course. However, as someone without an academic psych background, I found the lectures and reading consistently engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in the Psychological field, whether this interest is big (a major) or small (simply a desire to learn). Psych 110 is for everyone. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student simply because it is so interesting. It is not that difficult and the tests are manageable as long as you show up to lecture. ",
            "\u00a0This class is unrelated to my major, but I found the content to be accessible and incredibly interesting. Professor Dunham is a fantastic lecturer, and the class requires relatively little time commitment. The class is on a curve though, so it's definitely not an easy grade -- I would certainly recommend shopping and perhaps taking it Cr/D/Fail. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. It provides the best overview of psychology and allows people to figure out if they have any further interests in psychology.\r\n2. Professor Dunham is amazing!\r\n3. I enjoyed the course.\r\n\r\nI would not recommend it to a student if they already knew basic psychology or they knew they weren't interested, as the problems with grading makes taking this course almost \"risky\" to a student's GPA. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to other students. If you like not having an idea about where you stand in the class throughout the semester, then this is the course for you. TA discrepancy is at an all time high here. ",

            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course to any student regardless of major. Its really not too difficult and youll learn so much information thats relevant to both your own life and insights in whichever field youre majoring in (i.e. econ, political science, biology, really anything). ",

            "\u00a0It was fine, not too heavy of a workload, but they're a bit picky with grading. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this was an interesting and beneficial course. ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course to another student. Being that the course was intro level, I expected to have a lot of information thrown at me without any consistency; this was not the case, however, because I was able to make connections between all of the chapter and the material was presented in a cohesive way. I also enjoyed going to class and I was always interested in what we learned in the lectures. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a great way to delve into psychology and get a broad but in-depth overview of the field. The workload is very manageable and the lectures are entertaining. ",

            "\u00a0Absolutely not. I did not like this course at all. The lectures were slow and nearly put me to sleep. Also, the lectures are only pictures, so if you miss any slides while taking notes you are screwed. I find this to be unfair. ",
            "\u00a0Would recommend to anyone interested in the working of the mind ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's a very interesting topic. ",

            "\u00a0Definitely ",
            "\u00a0I would, but only if they want a survey of psychological topics. Apparently it isn't really needed as a prereq for further psych classes, and I wish I had known that. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if interested in psychology. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a great introduction to psychology, and it is really well-taught. Even if you have previous experience in psychology from high school, you will still learn some pretty neat stuff in this course. The workload is reasonable, and grading is fair. If you are interested in the processes that make us human, this is the class for you! ",

            "\u00a0I absolutely reccoment this course to anyone who is interested in studying psychology who has not studied the subject in depth before. I would also recommend this course to students who are not interested in studying psychology specifically, but who have a scientific background/interest and might want to receive an extremely exciting overview of the foundations of psychology as a subject. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student interested in psychology, both as a major and for fun. It's a very broad course, much like AP Psychology in high school, but in much more detail than the AP course. ",
            "\u00a0Truly outstanding course. The perfect balance between detail and general concepts ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. I think that the large lecture format/survey nature of the course mean that it won't necessarily be one of the most inspirational/mind-blowing courses at Yale. However, that being said, Professor Dunham is a really wonderful and engaging lecturer who helps to make the material come to life. Also, I feel as if I learned about some really fascinating studies in psychology and certainly hope to continue learning about the field. ",
