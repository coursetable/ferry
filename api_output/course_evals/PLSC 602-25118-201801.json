            "\u00a0The basics of political and social epistemology and epistemic accounts of democracy. The course provides an excellent overview of debates about truth in politics spanning a wide range of perspectives including normative political theory and perspectives from critical race theory. Landemore is excellent at taking texts familiar to political theorists and examining them afresh with new questions in mind. "

        [
            "\u00a0The course's biggest strength was Landemore's approach. She was always open to disagreement and her acknowledgement that these are not settled questions made the course especially instructive. The readings were enjoyable and manageable, and the intimate discussion made it yet more fruitful. The course had no real academic weaknesses. Looking back, it might have helped to spend more time on Epistemic Injustices than the syllabus permitted. "
