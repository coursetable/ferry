            "\u00a0I loved exploring Biblical storylines from a critical perspective, tracking interpretations of the text throughout history. It was a new and refreshing way for me to explore Torah. ",
            "\u00a0I gained the skills and knowledge to better appreciate the methods by which Midrash performs exegesis. ",
            "\u00a0I broadened and matured my understanding of types of Biblical interpretation. My textual analysis and critical thinking were improved. "

            "\u00a0This is an incredible class! Professor Hayes is an amazing scholar, a kind person, and a great pedagogue- three things that are not often combined! The content of the class is fascinating- it is the kind of class you look forward to attending. ",
            "\u00a0I liked that the class was small and that we got to have intimate, in depth conversations about the texts. However, we pretty much only looked at primary sources, which I sometimes felt like we exhausted. There was a point at which I felt like we had done all the thinking there was to do about a given biblical story and its midrashim/targums. Maybe that wasn't accurate, but it felt like that. ",
            "\u00a0This course was structured well. The workload was manageable and I appreciated that most of the learning happened during class. "

        [
            "\u00a0Absolutely -- Some of the topics we covered dragged on a bit, but overall, it's a fun course that offers insight into Midrashic interpretations of the Bible. Just a heads up -- you're technically not required to know Biblical Hebrew, but it was used a lot in class. ",
            "\u00a0YES! This course is intellectually engaging, the content is fascinating, and professor Hayes is brilliant. ",
            "\u00a0This course offers a great framework for thinking about the midrashic process as a whole. It changed how I go about interpreting the construction of rabbinic texts. Each student is tasked with presenting a subsection of text each seminar, which facilitates discussion and in depth understanding of texts nicely. Writing assignments are manageable. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student! Prof. Hayes is an amazing professor, and brings a unique perspective to studying Jewish texts. I learned so much with her. The course was engaging, interesting, and fun! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to people looking to expand their understanding of the function of midrash. "
