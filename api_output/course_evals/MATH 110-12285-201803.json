            "\u00a0I felt I gained a more in-depth depth understanding of functions and how they work, and learned many different ways to look at them. I learned how to take the derivative and approximate, maximize and minimize, graphing, and many other skills. ",
            "\u00a0Derivatives. ",
            "\u00a0Exactly what the course title says. Math 110 is the bridge between high school and college level mathematics. A solid way to review functions while being effectively introduced to concepts of calculus at the same time. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me a lot about derivatives and functions and how to apply that information. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Course provided students with the tools and resources to fully understand the material, (textbook, ULA office hours, workshops)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lack of clarity on how to answer test questions. Answers seemed to be very specific in wording and this skill was rarely taught for questions. ",
            "\u00a0I had a lot of strengths in the course however my top weakness was definitely the optimization word problems ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Great teachers and awesome ULAs, office hours, ULA hours\r\nWeaknesses: Some discrepancy between sections ",

            "\u00a0I think the strength was definitely in the resources provided. I attended office hours every week and they helped me greatly. The weakness was in the teaching. I felt as though the professors and their teaching was very confusing. ",
            "\u00a0I would like to be able to work on the problems in the book in order to prepare for the tests, i.e., for example, get an answer sheet for all even numbers of problems in the book and then have the problem sets on all the odd numbers or vice versa. "

            "\u00a0Yes I would because I feel like it challenges you to think in different ways and will be very useful in the future. ",
