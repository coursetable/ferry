            "\u00a0I learned how to write thesis statements, read academic texts, and research a specific, important topic. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read more critically and how to develop my own original claims and arguments when writing a paper or a thesis instead of merely summarizing the author's claims. I also learned a lot about the subject-- how self-care is constructed in ways that reflect the experiences of race in the US through our engaging and interesting readings. In my own writing, I learned how to be more concise and direct with my phrasing. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about forming original arguments and theories. I also had never experienced studying racial theorization so the content of this course really changed how I thought about marginalization. ",

            "\u00a0I found the beginning of this course challenging because we dove straight into reading scholarly articles and engaging with highly academic vocabulary, which I had never done before. I felt like I was being plunged into the deep end rather than eased into shallow waters. I think the organization of readings could be altered to make the class a better overall experience. ",
            "\u00a0The organization of the readings was a bit too face paced towards the beginning of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Very interesting subject material and readings, instructor did a great job with teaching us how to do close readings and develop original claims (office hours were a big help as well)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not necessarily a weakness, but wish we would have had more draft processes before turning in the final draft in order to continually revise and build upon our writing and see the places where it needed improvement through multiple stages of instructor feedback (kind of like the research paper writing process, where we had multiple drafts) ",
            "\u00a0I thought the material was fantastic but that until the very end of the semester the classroom did not really expand on the potential of the material. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend it, but I would warn them that there is a big time commitment, and you get out of the class the work you put in. I don't think I would have felt as rewarded by the end if I had slacked off at any point. ",
            "\u00a0I recommend the course though it was much more teaching you to write an essay than actually reading and examining the texts. ",
            "\u00a0This course was great. The professor is incredibly helpful. She's familiar with even the most obscure theories and cultural references. Plus, she's young enough to understand the style of humor we liked to incorporate in papers. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely! Of course critical reading and developing a strong, original argument are writing skills that could be learnt in any English 114 course, this specific section's subject matter was SO fascinating, and I really enjoyed doing all of the readings and discussing them in class. I feel like my perspective and world view have been broadened so much through taking this course-- highly recommend! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I think course like this one are very important not only for writing skills but also for personal growth. ",
            "\u00a0Yes because it helps to improve your writing skills in a beginners course. "
