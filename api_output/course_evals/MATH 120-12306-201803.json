            "\u00a0Multivariable calculus was honestly taught very straightforwardly ",
            "\u00a0I had taken multivariable calculus before this class during high school. In that class, we often used graphing programs to see surfaces and even coded within the program itself to demonstrate visually like gradient vectors and fields. This class made me relearn that material in a way that was more more mechanical rather than visual and intuitive. This process, although it made it harder to understand the concepts at first, ultimately made my math skills much stronger because it forced me to understand the concepts through quantitative analysis rather than visual intuition. ",

            "\u00a0I think the course covered a lot in a very short span of time, and so clarity was essential in making sure that lessons were clear. However sometimes there were concepts that I feel were skimmed over very quickly that needed more repetition or clarification. ",
            "\u00a0It seemed unfair that some classes got lecture notes and supplemental materials while others did not. In general, the use of technology and visual aids would have helped a lot with the intuition behind many of the topics we covered. Also, although I learned material, I didn't learn how to improve the mistakes I was already making. This is partly my fault because I didn't review mistakes on my PSET, but it meant that my grades on the exam reflected the number of bad habits and mistaken information I had rather than my general understanding of the material. The exam grades reflected the degree of precision rather than general understanding. ",
