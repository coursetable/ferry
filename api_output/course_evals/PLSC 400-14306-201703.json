            "\u00a0Learned all about the region known as the Balkans from the 1990s to present. About their internal and external conflicts and democratization. ",
            "\u00a0This course developed my knowledge about Southeastern Europe, which I had not learned much about previously. It also provided a valuable foundation about democratic consolidation. ",
            "\u00a0Developed a lot of interesting knowledge about Southeastern Europe and communism and its legacy throughout the region. Very interesting material. Also developed writing skills, both taking the exams and writing the critical case studies. ",
            "\u00a0This class was amazing. The class not only covered past problems in the Western Balkans but current and possibly future problems as well. The class is highly applicable in the world today. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the Balkan region's history which is incredibly interesting. Learning about the US and NATO intervention during the Bosnia and Kosovo war helps understand why military interventions were the way they were in Afghanistan and Iraq. "

            "\u00a0The course is extremely interesting, can be confusing at times due to material but great overall. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Aldrich is extremely receptive to student feedback, and took into account our mid-course surveys accordingly. She was also very helpful in slowing down to go over particularly difficult topics. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength of this course was that the material was extremely fascinating, and students learned a lot; furthermore, the professor facilitated a positive learning environment among the class as well. The learning environment was very positive with a classroom of only about ten students, and the professor was very willing to help students learn as much as possible. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Great content. I actually learned things from this class. Expectations are clear, assignments are thought-out and balanced.\r\nWeaknesses: Reading selections could be better selected, but this will come with time. ",
            "\u00a0Harsh grading "

            "\u00a0I would, it's very interesting and you learn a lot about places that are sometimes overlooked in other history courses. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to any other student who has an interest in political science or history, especially since it is a region that still has a lot going on in the present. Even if a student doesn't have a background in either of these subjects, it is very approachable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. Very interesting political science credit where you learn A LOT about the Balkans and the communist legacy throughout the region. While you learn some theory, you are mainly learning about the history of Southeastern Europe. Also, the work load is relatively easy, with only two short essays, a midterm, and a final. Professor Aldrich also allowed students to take the exams open-note, so as long as you studied the material well, it was not hard to do well on the exams. Great course! ",
            "\u00a0Fantastic class. It was a small lecture, which sounds like the worst kind of class, but the format was incredible. It is an interesting class with an easy yet fair workload. Aldrich knows her stuff and communicates it clearly and with passion. Good class for both PLSC and non-PLSC majors! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The professor is great, the readings are great, the lectures are great! ",
            "\u00a0Great class if you wish to learn more about Europe, communism in the Balkans and military intervention. "
