            "\u00a0Honestly, I feel like this course is geared a student without much experience writing analytical essays. I spent a lot of time in this in high school, so sometimes the skills we went over (especially in Lunsford) felt basic. Though this is a writing course, my reading ability improved most. The texts we read are interesting but (warning!) dense and long -- a good preparation for college-level English classes. The readings all build on each other, so it was cool at the end to have a full idea of the history of the interpretations of a book. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a lot of useful writing skills as a result of taking this course. My writing has greatly been improved because of this course. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much this semester, it is hard to believe! I learned a lot about the topic of \"What is a Book?\", but in a broader sense, I learned a lot about the history of ideas, value, and origins. I learned a lot about myself as a writer as well as my strengths and weaknesses as a member of a classroom and discussion group. I gained insight into the extensive process of revision, the importance of annotating and asking questions as I read, and the value that one places on having great discussion with others. This class taught me to look larger at the world outside of my narrow lens of personal experience. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the things that I have to work on and what parts of my writing need work. ",
            "\u00a0I grew so much from taking this course. Not only did my writing style improve, but my ability to structure and write essays has gotten DRAMATICALLY better. James \"Eric\" Ensley does an absolutely amazing job bringing out the best work in people. I can confidently say that without having taken this course, \"What Is a Book?\" specifically, I would be nowhere near as confident in my writing skills for the future of my Yale career. Eric is a truly kindhearted and gifted teacher. If you want a deeply helpful, fun, fascinating introduction to college writing at Yale, TAKE \"WHAT IS A BOOK\"!!!! ",
            "\u00a0I learned to think more critically and approach subjects in a more open and flexible way. Additionally, I felt that my skills as a writer improved. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write college-level research papers and creative essays on the topic of my choice. ",
            "\u00a0How to properly frame my arguments in a logical and fluent method. ",
            "\u00a0This course goes over basic standards for college writing. I was really insecure about my writing skills and wanted a class that would put me in shape for college writing, and this class definitely achieved that. ",
            "\u00a0What is a Book? made me think more carefully about my use of words, and it made me appreciate the delicacy of language. ",
            "\u00a0I developed my writing skills and gained a better, but no more complete understanding of what a book actually is. "

            "\u00a0I liked how the class was organized and very clearly walked us through the interpretations of the book, from materials to authors to audiences. The choice of readings was very intentional, and they all built on each other well. Since the readings are so open-ended, the discussions we had were interesting (but sometimes were not entirely based in the text). I still feel confused on some of the readings as a result (though the professor did change his approach halfway through the course to try to correct for this). The overall structure of English 114 is nice because it builds up your skills until you can write a long academic paper but also may feel basic if you already have experience doing so. ",
            "\u00a0There were many strengths to this course. One was that we always followed the syllabus. I found myself checking the syllabus every week to prepare for the upcoming readings and assignments. The fluidity of the course was also appreciate. For the most part, we were always given the space to discuss as a class how we saw fit, leading to fruitful discussions of the readings and topics at hand. I loved the essay assignments, and for the first time in my academic career, I was able to write about topics that were interesting to me, improving both my writing and enjoyment of the class. The only weakness to the course is the pace. There were times at the beginning of the semester that felt a bit rushed, especially when we were assigned long, challenging readings along with challenging essays. However, the fast pace at the beginning was remedied with the slower second-half of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0The set up of starting out with small papers and then getting to larger papers has been effective. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Eric is one of the BEST teachers I have ever had the pleasure of learning from. He takes a concept that might make one pause - what is a book - and makes it absolutely fascinating and so much fun. I was definitely cautious going in, like 'I know what a book is, this is simple,' but the course is so much more. You approach the topic from several different angles and Eric makes space for us to have guided, electric classroom conversations. Eric is also an AMAZING human being and great at taking feedback: when our class wanted to spend more time discussing the readings on a deeper level, he made worksheets for us to take a deeper dive. I cannot say enough good things about Eric Ensley: other ENGL 114 may have snappier titles that grab your eye, but the professor should guide your ultimate decision. Eric Ensley was the best possible professor to guide us into academia at Yale. He is so smart, amazing at making difficult texts accessible, and is always willing to listen and help you grow. Have I made it clear yet? TAKE THIS CLASS! Take it to have Eric as a professor, take it to become a better writer, take it because asking the question 'what is a book' will inform how you approach meaning in the world in ways you cannot even begin to anticipate. Weaknesses: I mean this genuinely and fully - there were no weaknesses ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- interesting readings and discussions, workshops were constructive and helpful\r\nWeaknesses- timeline for each essay felt very short; I felt like I didn't have enough time to write the best essay that I could. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is that the class is small, so you definitely receive individualized attention from the professor. Eric is also very helpful, and meeting with him helped me along my research process. The expectations are clear, and I understood the ways I could improve my papers. The weakness is that readings are long, and can take forever. ",
            "\u00a0There could be more discussion about how the readings tie into one another as to keep the information relevant. ",
            "\u00a0-Strengths: the material of the class ties in very well together. It is a very cohesive course. The in-class discussions were dynamic and they were lead very well. The way the class was lead encouraged a lot of collaboration, and I think this is the biggest strength of the class. How much we learned from each other's weaknesses and strengths. \r\n\r\n-Weaknesses: not enough time to discuss the readings, and some we never fully understood. ",
            "\u00a0The readings were agonizingly abstract, so much so that they were largely unintelligible, but the instructor artfully tied all of the concepts together and made me appreciate the abstract beauty of the world and of the human mind. ",
            "\u00a0The readings were challenging and very interesting. Also visits to the Beinecke were always fascinating and gave us real example to use in our discussions of what a book is. "

            "\u00a0I'd recommend this to somebody looking for a section of English 114 with a teacher who cares a lot, but I would only recommend English 114 to a student who doesn't have as much experience with academic reading/writing or a student looking for a course with a lighter workload. You get as much out of this class as you put in. If you want to treat it like a gut and not read the readings, you probably could, given that the essays aren't all explicitly based in the readings. However, if you take the time to appreciate the readings and how they are all in conversion with each other, you will learn a lot. The same goes with the essays. If you take time to read all of the professor's thoughtful comments, you will grow as a writer; otherwise, you may not. Make sure you like the topic enough to spend a semester on it, and you'll end up getting a lot out of it. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would recommend this course to another student, perhaps all students! It is a great introductory writing course at Yale, allowing me to get a feel for the academic rigor that is the English department here while getting to read and write about intriguing topics. We has many laughs as to what we really should consider a book, and I walked away with a different definition of not only the term 'book', but an understanding of the value we place on definitions and terminology in society today. This overarching knowledge will be something that sticks with me throughout my time at Yale and beyond, making this course totally worth one's while. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend taking a writing course because for me at least, I realized that my writing had to change from high school. ",
            "\u00a0YES YES, A MILLION TIMES YES! Eric is an incredible teacher and makes anything and everything interesting. You will leave this class a better writer, a better thinker, and far more prepared to approach writing at Yale. Even if you're thinking to yourself, \"I know what a book! Thank u, next!\" take this course to have Eric as a teacher. He makes the entire class SO WORTH IT and it will be an amazing opportunity I promise you will not regret. The subject matter is actually fascinating and in addition to improving your writing, you will leave this class with a fundamentally new and fascinating framework for looking at books, objects, words, and culture in 2018. The classroom conversations are some of the best I have ever had at Yale, the subject matter is fascinating (trust me- everyone walks in skeptical and walks out convinced of the deepness of the titular question), and Eric is actually incredible. This is not hyperbole, this is a reality. In conclusion: TAKE THIS CLASS! I COULD NOT SAY ENOUGH AMAZING THIS ABOUT THE SUBJECT MATTER OR ERIC. It will be one of the best choices you make in your young Yale career. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This course does a great job honing your writing skills! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend to another student, especially a first-year. I improved my writing skills and feel like it was a nice transition into college-level writing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ! I think this is a great class to get into college writing because the content is interesting and the essay topics can be tailored to basically anything. The readings are interesting and overall, it is a very engaging class. Eric is great, and the will help with basically anything. ",
            "\u00a0Great instructor, interesting themes and ideas, light workload, and fantastic feedback on my writing. A great course overall. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a fun and interesting first English class to get used to college writing. I would definitely recommend it. "
