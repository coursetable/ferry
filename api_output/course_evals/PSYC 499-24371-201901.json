            "\u00a0I learned to see a research project of my own from start to finish, all the way from coming up with a research question to writing up the results. I also improved my scientific writing skills and learned how to present my work effectively to my colleagues. ",
            "\u00a0So proud and satisfied to have been able to conduct my own research as a undergrad, from the earliest conceptualization of a research question to the execution and writing up of the study. Love it. ",
            "\u00a0This course was an excellent opportunity to better my research skills and scientific writing. ",
            "\u00a0Over the course of the past year, I improved my ability to read and write academic papers, learned how to use Qualtrics and Excel, improved my time management skills, improved my statistical skills, and learned a lot about social development and the origins of culture in humanity. ",

I think the senior essay could be improved by requiring all advisors to provide helpful and timely feedback. I had a great experience with my advisor, but some of my friends did not receive feedback until right before the deadline, which is not conducive to creating a quality essay. As undergrads, we will need consistent guidance to conduct research effectively. ",

            "\u00a0I think that the Psychology department, in general, could really benefit from providing their instructors and advisors with more structure for thesis development with their students. It is nice to have a lot of creative freedom and agency, but not at the cost of logistical barriers. I think there should certainly be a collaboration between the department and the IRB to make sure that theses are approved with sufficient time to conduct good research. "
