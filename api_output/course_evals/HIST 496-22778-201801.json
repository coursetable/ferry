I learned so much about how to research effectively, how to break down a large, intimidating project into something manageable, and how to write a narrative in 50 pages. This was unlike anything I had ever done before, and it was incredibly rewarding. ",

            "\u00a0Extremely laissez faire. This is probably a good thing, but there were moments where I felt unmoored. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I thought that this yearlong essay-writing process was extremely rewarding, and I am very glad that I did it.  However, the most frustrating part of the whole process were the intermediate deadlines throughout the year required by the department.  I did not find these useful, and, instead, found that they actually distracted from whatever other analysis/writing I was doing at the time so as to be able to get the milestone assignments completed on time. ",
            "\u00a0Your experience with the senior essay will depend immensely on whom you choose as your advisor. I can only speak for my own experience with my exceptional advisor, but I know that many other history majors had experiences which varied drastically from mine. \r\n\r\nOne specific suggestion I would make in terms of the timeline of due dates that seniors are given would be to add a deadline for an outline. ",
            "\u00a0Advisors make all the difference, and if yours doesn't really care about you, you have no way of really engaging fully. Also communications are very poor and there are a number of meaningless checkpoints that actually detracted from the finished project in my opinion. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed working with my adviser because she added even more structure to the existing framework of the thesis process. ",
            "\u00a0Would be useful if more writing took place in the first semester; I found that I was writing nonstop for about a month during the second semester, which was fairly stress-inducing and all-consuming. ",
            "\u00a0Fantastic in every way! Very well organized and the expectations are clearly delineated. ",
            "\u00a0The due dates throughout the year seemed a bit arbitrary, and while the handbook was helpful in explaining how various parts of the essay fit together, a little more detail at the beginning of the year would have been useful. ",
            "\u00a0The deadlines and requirements (specifically where and when to turn stuff in) listed on Canvas and in the PDF senior essay handbook often conflicted and caused many students stress. ",
            "\u00a0The process for the senior thesis is incredibly flawed in the history department. The handbook has things in it that have been there for two decades or more, and the grading structure is outdated. You get some random reader at the end of the year, and the grade is completely arbitrary. There is no rubric, so your grade is generally going to be up to a tenured professor who may decide they just dislike the subject you are writing about. Whatever your advisor says might not actually happen. \r\n\r\nYou could get an A if you do really well, or if you just get an easy grader. You could get a B if you get unlucky with the grader. I believe this structure needs to be fixed because most other departments let the advisor grade the paper. Be prepared to lose distinction with no good explanation other than the grader didnt like the topic you spent a year on. ",
            "\u00a0I think that having deadlines along the way are helpful to ensure that you're following along and are keeping up with researching and writing the paper. I feel like there could have been more check-ins along the way in the second semester, though. It felt like we were just all of a sudden told to go write the entire thing. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - chance to work with an advisor on a year long research project.\r\nWeaknesses not many, but some of the assignments in the first semester don't seem all that helpful towards progressing towards the final product, specifically the 3-page primary source analysis. ",
            "\u00a0It would be helpful to have an actually meeting time to workshop with other history majors. ",
            "\u00a0The process is pretty unorganized on the department's side and puts a lot of impetus on advisors to make things clear for students. ",
            "\u00a0Having to write an essay in the spring of senior year is stressful for many of us and takes a bit away from our last year at college. "

Start doing your research early, start your writing early, start your editing early!  The amount of time you have to complete the project feels like it compresses as you get the end, so be sure to leave enough time at the beginning to get going on it!  Also, remember that you have to have the entire thing bound by Tyco before you hand it in, so leave time for that too! ",

            "\u00a0Yes definitely! I would recommend the year-long essay, as it really gives you a chance to comprehensively evaluate your topic, travel once (or maybe even more) to collect primary source information, and produce the presumably longest academic work of your Yale career. I am very grateful I did the year-long essay and know that I will cherish my final product for years to come. ",
            "\u00a0No, I would not recommend this to another student unless the history department fixes their grading process. The process is outdated and is completely arbitrary. Your grade depends on a random reader. If Professor Jennifer Klein is the director again, she tends to give a random reader not even on your recommended list. This could be good or bad, but you have no way of knowing until after you spend a year putting together your work that can be quickly dismissed. \r\n\r\nI recommend doing the 1 semester thesis rather than the full year and just get it out of the way. Until they fix the year long thesis process, it is broken and not worth the time. You get absolutely nothing out of it. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I know that it's required for a senior history major to take this, but I still think everyone who writes a paper will enjoy this process immensely. ",
