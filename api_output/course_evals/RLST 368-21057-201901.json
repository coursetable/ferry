            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about the history of thought surrounding the interpretation of the Biblical narratives of creation and the Great Flood as well as how those past interpretations affect the current societal landscape surrounding earth history. ",

            "\u00a0Some of the readings for this class are great and very interesting, though they can be dense and difficult to read through at times. Greater discussion in class that brings in the opinions and perspectives of students would make for a more rich learning experience overall. The professor Ivano is wonderful and very knowledgeable as well as passionate about the topics. ",
            "\u00a0I found the readings long and confusing at times, and our discussions often not as interesting as I wished. However, I found my mind much broadened by several of the topics that we touched upon, and I loved our analysis of artwork! "

            "\u00a0Absolutely, especially if you are interested in life history and natural science and need a writing credit. This class helped me understand much more about the foundation for a variety of views/values and gave me a deeper appreciation for the study of history. ",
            "\u00a0I would, if the student was very interested in human evolution and geology. "
