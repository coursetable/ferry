            "\u00a0Strengths:  He added so much value.  He is smart, relatable, and very knowledgeable of the subject matter.  He is fabulous in meeting one on one with the students to help hone a paper topic.  A real gift in this.\r\n\r\nHe needs to be brought on to be this course instructor. ",
            "\u00a0Justin was outstanding. He should teach Anglican History by himself next year. He knew so much and at times felt that he was the instructor of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Justin is very approachable and available for help and guidance. ",
            "\u00a0This was my second go with Justin Crisp. I was privileged to have Justin as my teaching fellow during Medieval in Spring 2017, where he led informative and engaging section discussions. His deep knowledge of the subject matter was incredibly helpful as he led us (me!) through challenging theological mazes.  So I welcomed his voice and intellect during Anglican II this Fall. His presentations and discussion leadership were excellent.  His extensive and detailed knowledge of the theology, ecclesiology and the search to locate authority within TEC was apparent and so helpful.  As in Medieval, Justin leads a lively and challenging discussion which clarified and advanced my thinking.  His commentary on my written work, always encouraging, enables me to see where and how I fall short and raises the bar for my future attempts. ",
            "\u00a0I found my meeting with Justin about my final paper topic to be one of the most helpful meetings I've ever had with a TF in thinking about how to do the academic work that I'm interested in. ",
            "\u00a0Justin was a great resource. He is knowledgeable and approachable. He has a good presence in the classroom. I would have liked to have heard more from him. ",
            "\u00a0Justin was the perfect teaching fellow for this course, and he seemed invested in the topics we discussed.  He always made time for students, and offered helpful paper advice, and extensive comments. ",
            "\u00a0Very bright, very knowledgeable about the material and easily accessible and helpful. I think he should be the instructor. ",
            "\u00a0Justins lectures were very good, and his written comments on papers were helpful and thoughtful.  I really enjoyed his teaching. ",
            "\u00a0Justin was an excellent guide to the material and methodology of the course in the classroom and outside it. ",
            "\u00a0Justin was very knowledgeable and helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Justin was the warmest of the 3 people leading class. He only got to teach a bit but he was wonderful when he did and very engaging. He would respond to emails and be as helpful as he could. ",
            "\u00a0Justin responded to email and graded work in a timely manner. He also was thoughtful in his written feedback, even when I disagreed with the point made. He also made himself available to students to discuss their work and upcoming assignments. \r\n\r\nIn the first paper, the expectations were very high for the tightness of the argument, which came as a surprise since this was a contrast to the expectations expressed in the assignment directions and the laissez-faire tone of class sessions themselves. Thus, I felt that the paper had greater expectations for what I felt was reasonable for the 5 pages. It also felt that perhaps Justin was trying to establish himself as a \"hard grader\" rather than just being about the expectations for the course assignments. I have yet to see the grading comments on the final assignment of the term, but I anticipate the comments will be useful and descriptive. I hope the grading on the final assignment seems more reasonable. \r\n\r\nJustin is knowledgeable on the topics and provided a much-needed, essential consistency to the class. It is my understanding that having a TF was an addition to this year's class. I can't imagine this class without a TF, especially one as competent as Justin Crisp. ",
            "\u00a0Justin's strengths: knowledge base, good discussion questions, making himself available to meet and discuss the class with students\r\n\r\nJustin's growth areas: sometimes Justin moves too fast... His brain goes at speeds I sometimes can't keep up with. It would be great if he would slow down at times of discussion. ",
            "\u00a0I thought Justin was fantastic and wished he had had even more in class time. ",
            "\u00a0Justin was an enthusiastic and well-prepared discussion leader, available for consultation, and provided useful comments on assignments.  I would offer two suggestions for improvement, however. The grading of assignments seemed longer than usual and it felt like we were undertaking the next assignment before receiving feedback on the first.  In part, this had to do with the size of the class and wasn't Justin's fault.  Second, sometimes the discussions felt like Justin was herding the discussion to a particular, pre-decided point rather than letting the learning merge organically.  It often felt like the discussion questions were formed to elicit a particular answer and once someone produced that answer a new question was asked, leaving those who produced the wrong answer feeling somewhat stupid. ",
            "\u00a0Justin is excellent. Knowledgable, accessible, fair, and clear about his own viewpoints. He was an excellent TF. "
