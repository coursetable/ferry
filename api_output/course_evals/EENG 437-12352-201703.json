            "\u00a0This course did not only teach me convex analysis and various optimization techniques, it also sharpened some of my linear algebra and general math background (regarding subdifferentials, dual spaces, and other advanced topics). Furthermore, this course provided me with the second mathematical/ computational research project I ever had to design independently, which was a valuable, albeit challenging, experience teaching me about the research process. This course covered a ton of material optimization, as we finished Boyds Convex Optimization textbook with over a month to spare and thus got to explore advanced topics. ",
            "\u00a0Optimization techniques ",
            "\u00a0You learn a lot about convex optimization, which is a very interesting field (though in recent years has been a bit eclipsed by the deep-learning craze). Sekhar says this course effectively covers TWO semesters of Stanford's optimization course (which is the gold standard), so you end up learning a lot of material. ",
            "\u00a0Learnt a lot about optimization techniques from some convex analysis and gradient descent and newton's method at the beginning to proximal gradient and subgradient methods later on. This was a very useful course with applicable material. ",
            "\u00a0A survey of a variety of methods of mathematical optimization.  Class is VERY linear algebra intensive - so make sure you're comfortable with it before taking this class.  The lectures (and problem sets) are mostly theory based, though you can get some practical experience wit hthe final project. ",
            "\u00a0Strengthened my linear algebra a little, learned a lot about the maths behind gradient descent and other optimization algorithms. ",

            "\u00a0The material and the course structure are a major strength of the course. We covered a lot of material on Optimization, a topic that is so useful in conducting computational research. I also think the course assignments were suitably challenging. As a math major in his senior year, I walked into the class thinking it would be a piece of cake. The problem sets were challenging and rewarding but not impossible, and the final project was difficult, but a valuable experience. Another strength of the course is that Sekhar is an incredibly kind and approachable teacher. Never had I felt so comfortable in a class to go to a teacher's office hours and set up meetings with a teacher. I think a weakness of the course is that it moved a bit too fast, sacrificing a deep intuition of the material for quantity of material taught (allegedly we cover double the material that Stanford students do) ",
            "\u00a0The best part of this class was the excellent instruction provided by Professor Tatikonda. He is a truly remarkable instructor. ",
            "\u00a0I think the homeworks had too much variance in difficulty -- some would be relatively trivial and others would take my hours to get a grasp of. The amount of material covered in this class was absurd, and made it hard to keep up. Sekhar would write nebulous things like \"skim this 100 page math paper before class\" and you'd end up needing to know something crucial from it for the homework. And, oftentimes, we would have homework based on material he hadn't covered yet. All this being said, I think the class was very interesting, and I probably learned more in this class than in any other class at Yale. \r\n\r\nI also think this course had a bit of an identity crisis: Sekhar constantly emphasized that it was meant to give us the tools needed to apply to problems in our own field (i.e. an applications-oriented class), but the actually class was basically only about the theory. If you took this class if you wanted to learn how to apply optimization to your own field (the raison d'etre he provided in the beginning of the class), you'd kinda be out of luck. But as a course covering the theory of convex optimization, this is excellent. ",
            "\u00a0This was a very useful course. The material was interesting and applicable to a wide range of fields. One great thing about the class was that it focussed a lot on the intuition behind the material rather than only proofs, and also looked at the practical side by considering a range of applications in class and in the readings. One weakness was that the we were sometimes fast in class, though this was fine since we could then cover more material. ",
            "\u00a0I think the biggest weakness of the class is that we didn't get much exposure to the areas of application of the methods that we learned.  The final project was a nice way for me to explore one particular area but I still feel like I don't have a broad exposure.\r\n\r\nBiggest strength of the class is that Sekhar doesn't try to baby the class.  The problem sets really force you to understand the material well and grasp the intricacies behind the math that (sometimes) gets glossed over in class. ",
            "\u00a0Great course, gets a little too fast-paced near the end. Should have an in-class exam. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very math intensive, which can be a positive and a negative. The lecture and key material are excellent, but towards the end, the course can be a bit fast paced. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course but with caution. It is a difficult class if you do not have a strong math background. As a math major in my senior year, I expected the course to be quite easy, but I found it to be very challenging. The project is also quite stressful if you are not good at starting things earlier. Sekhar even warns students that they should only take the class if they have a specific reason to be there (i.e. a type of project they are interested in). I didnt follow this advice and took the class anyway which made the project stressful. That being said you learn a ton from the class, and Sekhar is wonderful. He is probably the most approachable teacher I have had at Yale and strongly encourages students to bug him in office hours or email him to meet. The material is taught well, though perhaps a bit too quickly for many students. Also, it seems like optimization is incredibly useful for any computational research so it is worth learning. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, recommend ",
            "\u00a0If you want to learn about optimization (which is a hot topic), definitely take this course. But be warned: this is about convex optimization, not deep learning. So most of what you learn in this class isn't applicable to that. That being said, learning on a deep level about stuff like gradient descent (which are used in nonconvex domains as well), and learning the deep level of characterization possible in convex spaces versus nonconvex spaces, makes you really appreciate how far we must go to actually *understand* deep learning in the same way we understand Linear Programming and other convex tasks. Be warned though: the course is extremely difficult -- you are expected to learn a ton of material and answer oftentimes absurd homework questions about them-- and full of graduate students with a much deeper math background than you. DONT take this course if you aren't *extremely* comfortable with Linear Algebra. There is no final exam, which is nice (though I don't know how you could write a fair final exam considering how much material we covered). The final project is pretty low-effort too, which is nice. But the homeworks are killer. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The material is mathematical and very interesting, and the treatment with pictures is very intuitive. Also, we look at a range of topics, and near the end of the class, we look at some state of the art topics. Also, the final project gives us a chance to explore some interesting topics. Sekhar is also very willing to help his students with the final projects, and takes great interest in what his student are doing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!  A good gateway to higher level applied math classes and a great survey of techniques in the field.  Would recommend if you're into applied math and want to beef up your proof skills or a pure math person who wants exposure to a more applied area.  Sekhar's great and really wants everyone to know the material well.  The final project at the end is also a great way to build up a practical skillset to complement the theory that you learn in lecture/problem sets. ",
            "\u00a0Great, fun mathematics class for those interested in learning more about the details of optimization. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. This was by far the best course I have taken so far at Yale. "
