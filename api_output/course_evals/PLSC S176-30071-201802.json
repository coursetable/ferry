            "\u00a0I learned a very comprehensive history of the Cold War, including US domestic policy & culture during the Cold War, the Korean War, China's relations in the Cold War, Latin American history during the cold war, anticolonial protests, detente, the end of the Cold War, and perspectives/philosophy from the Cold War. I developed a lot of insights into how people from all over the world viewed the Cold War, including counterculture in different countries. I learned about different ways to think about the Cold War. Most importantly, I used how to use the Beinecke to do archival research, which was super helpful! ",
            "\u00a0Basically speaking I now have an initial understanding of a framework of Karl Marx and Max Weber, and also some theories of other methodologists. Reading from 100 to 200 pages a day my reading skills have been improved a lot. And hopefully it gets me ready for the college. ",

            "\u00a0It felt disorganized and jumped around which was very confusing. It was, however, such a compressed summer course that I understand to some extent why it was felt so choppy, but I felt it could've been more efficient. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:The teacher will adjust the teaching method according to the Suggestions of the students. A visit to libraries for archives is a very impressive experience. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Discussion section can let people really get involved and the screenings are nice. (Dr. Strangelove Yeahhhhhh)\r\nWeakness: No PPT or other way to remind students the key point, so that sometimes it's hard to catch up. ",
            "\u00a0the instructor  is very kind; readings are illuminating and thought-provoking, present history from different perspectives.\r\nbut it would be better if the content of lecture could be sent to us before the class, and in the class the instructor could focus on some important or interesting points instead of just reading the manuscript word by word. ",

            "\u00a0I would say that the main weakness of the course is its lenght. If we had had another week or two we could have covered the cold war during the 80s a bit further. We only had one class left for that topic. ",
            "\u00a0There may no a coherent logic between each events, so it is quite confused about why we are talking about such kind of things. ",
            "\u00a0I really appreciated the broad scope of the course in terms of the different geographic areas and perspectives that we covered. The lectures were a bit hard to follow, unfortunately, because there was so much information to learn. I would recommend having (minimal) powerpoint slides or writing all the key terms on the board before lecture. Alternatively, it would be helpful to have handouts with the outline of the lecture and key terms to make the lectures easier to follow.\r\nAlso, there was an incredible amount of reading, and it would be great if we could focus in on a few readings. ",
            "\u00a0Overall it is good... The professor is charismatic and his teaching is fascinating. He is perfect. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very lecture-heavy. This is clearly the correct way to teach an information-heavy history class, but the lectures were at times hard to follow due to a lack of visual accompaniment. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, it presents the Cold War in multiple angles, and can help you have a basic understanding of today's international political structure. (especially in US, Russia and many third world countries involved in the Cold War.)\r\nYou can access to a huge amount of Cold War materials (protesting poster/ brochure / first hand materials / screening) in the Yale library and get help by the professor and the Liberians. ",

            "\u00a0No. I think taking this course is a waste of time. Almost all of the knowledge I get in this course is from the reading. The lecture is worthless to take. I cannot figure out the reason to spend so much money only for reading the materials which I could have found on the Internet. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to another student. You're bound to learn something you didn't know before! Also, the archives brochure project is awesome. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I myself become a Marxist after taking this course... and I have determined to keep on learning Marx after this session. Others probably may be interested in Marx as well. ",
