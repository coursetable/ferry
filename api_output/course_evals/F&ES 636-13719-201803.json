            "\u00a0In this class, we systematically learned the knowledge in impact investing, ESG analysis, and sustainable finance. The first time I know about this concept came from my internship experience at China Development Bank. In China, green finance became popular in recent years, and no matter for government or entrepreneurs, they realized the importance of sustainable development, and I reinforced the knowledge on this class. ",
            "\u00a0More broad understanding of ESG, broad overview of what is there, good green bonds sections & some data analysis ",
            "\u00a0This was a fantastic course. I only wish they would have gone into more depth with the financial analysis and evaluation of companies. ",
            "\u00a0This course was designed to give students an overview of the various different types and styles of sustainable finance and to display where that field is heading. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a very general understanding of the shortcomings of ESG metrics. ",
            "\u00a0fluency around finance\r\na sense of impending doom in the corporate sector \r\nthe lack of influence ESG can have on a company, in that alpha is still more important\r\nhow few metrics there are for measuring companies' sustainability reports, and how this yields to greenwashing\r\nGreen bonds, conservation finance, and final project with other SOM students were more helpful "

        [
            "\u00a0I thought I'd learn more concrete financial skills. I had to teach myself how to do valuations (DCF, multiples), how to understand ratios, how to find financial data, and many other concepts. I wish the instructors would institute a prerequisite or help us learn this material better--add more TA sessions, provide more materials for outside study, and connect the dots for us between abstract sustainability concepts and concrete valuations. It's OK if there aren't clear answers; help us learn how to make hypotheses like pros in the field do. ",
            "\u00a0I would say on the whole it was pretty good. Todd had great lectures. It did feel a bit diffuse sometimes versus figuring out what may be the core skills to know. ",
            "\u00a0Very well aligned. ",
            "\u00a0This class didn't quite meet my expectations for the financial knowledge I was hoping to gain. I found the class to be to broad in what it was attempting to cover with very little depth. ",
            "\u00a0Less than expected. "

            "\u00a0The strengths of this class include:\r\n1) Instructors invited a bunch of sustainable finance practitioner in industry to give lectures for us, so as to make us understand the practical issues in this field. 2) Two instructors in this class are full of knowledge, and prepared pretty well before each class. ",
            "\u00a0Course would benefit from more structure and flow from one topic to the next. It jumped around quite a bit, didnt have a clear direction. \r\n\r\nThe course leaned heavily towards public equity markets. That wasnt clear from the course description; I would amend the course description and syllabus to provide clarity on that, especially since some students more interested in private investing in the sustainability space. ",
            "\u00a0They continue to work on it which was good. I would say maybe more focus on the stock pitch earlier (i.e. pitch earlier, group formation earlier) and the Midterm was super stressful yet interesting but didn't feel like I knew what to take away from it. ",
            "\u00a0Can't think of any way to improve it. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course should begin with a quick overview of basic financial concepts and should incorporate papers throughout that focus on the strictly financial aspects of the course in addition to papers that focus on the ESG components of the course. I think one of the major weaknesses of this course is that the basic financial concepts were not covered in the class very well which made understanding the ESG part of the class a little more difficult to apply to a real world situation. I think if the class tried to cover less topic and instead tried to focus on a few and go more in depth that would be an improvement. ",
            "\u00a0The course could use much more structure. Each day was about something seemingly unrelated from the previous, and there was not much linkage throughout the class. The slides from class (if there were any) were not organized in any way and instead were just a collection of words or way too much text with no insight. The readings were all scattered, way too long, and it was unclear what we were supposed to be taking away. Overall, an incredibly disorganized class. ",
            "\u00a0There seemed to be a fair bit of repetition in the class, and I wonder if there could be a half semester sustainability finance class offered. \r\n\r\nAs a non-finance individual I felt immediately left behind without introductory finance vocabulary and spent and extraordinary amount of time looking things up. Either a requisite, or recommended class beforehand -OR- taking the first two or three classes to talk about just finance would have been more inclusive of my ilk. "

            "\u00a0If you are not a finance majored students, and you are interested at finance,  especially impact investing, I strongly recommend you to  select this course. Since it seems more like an introductory class, without strong perquisites. ",
            "\u00a0You may be graded on financial concepts that aren't taught in class. The lectures are vague and unstructured (especially Cary's, which feel like streams of conscience). Not sure this is really worth your time/tuition dollars, especially if Cary stays involved. ",
            "\u00a0Take it to gain exposure to ESG but be sure to know that you won't get everything out of it. Lots of homework assignments of moderate effort in each. ",
