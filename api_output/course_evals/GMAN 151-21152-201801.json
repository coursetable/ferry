            "\u00a0I learned so much from the course through important insights into German cultural experiences (ranging from the experiences of Turkish immigrants and their families in Germany to the Green Germany movement) and I also greatly expanded my vocabulary. I also learned new grammatical structures and began to feel more comfortable with writing papers in German. ",

            "\u00a0The strengths of the course were that it had particular relevance to today's climate in Germany and in the U.S., and it was very interesting to explore these aspects in a German course setting. I think that the class could be improved through a little more clarity about what is expected for different assignments and, since I really enjoyed reading the book, maybe more reading of books could be an improvement on the class.
