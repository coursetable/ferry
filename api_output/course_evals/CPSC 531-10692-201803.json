            "\u00a0More organized content and more assignments.\r\n\r\nI felt we couldve started markoff chains right at the first half of the class and have more in depth study on different methods. We could also have assignments on using arduino and the different tools available in the studio. All in all, make the workload higher! ",

(I heard an AI helped compose an album recently) "
