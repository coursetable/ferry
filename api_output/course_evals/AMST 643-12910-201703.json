            "\u00a0I gained knowledge about the intellectual history of African American Studies as a discipline, and the theoretical contributions of numerous scholars spanning the 19th-21st Centuries. Additionally, I developed sophisticated analytical skills that helped me consume challenging epistemological arguments that are central to contemporary intellectual conversations. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a familiarity with the discipline of African American Studies- its rise, the questions it addresses, and its thinkers. ",
            "\u00a0I better understand my interests and the relevant archives and I am more aware of the kind of teacher I would like to be. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this introductory course with Professor Brooks. "

            "\u00a0One strength of this course is that it provided students with opportunities to consume challenging material and learn from dialogical communication with their peers. Another strength of this course is that is gave us broad exposure to a variety of subfields within the broader discipline of African American Studies to nurture/encourage diverse intellectual interests. Additionally, the course assignments supported our professional development and enabled us to begin cultivating ideas for research projects. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated the diversity of the themes we covered as well as the wide selection of readings. Writing the weekly blog posts was incredibly helpful, and each of the assignments felt valuable and necessary. Class discussions were vibrant and generative. Loved the speakers who came to class and appreciated the Endeavors series. The library visits felt only somewhat helpful -- the Beinecke one was more helpful. The Sterling library visit could have been made better by more specificity instead of just an overview of the library's resources. Wish feedback on the journal surveys came quicker. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the course. It was put together in a really thoughtful way (built well over the course of the semester). Discussions were helpful to understanding the texts. My only real complaint would be that the weeks we read a bunch of articles, it was really hard in discussion to truly engage with all the texts in class. Certain ones just faded into the background or fell away. ",
            "\u00a0No improvements. I wish we had been able to get to some of the denser theoretical texts earlier in the semester. "

            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to all graduate students that are open to the intellectual rigor and topics germane to African American Studies, the Social Sciences, or the Humanities. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. If you want a solid introduction to the field of Black Studies/African American Studies then you should take this course. Interesting readings on topics that are cross cutting. ",
