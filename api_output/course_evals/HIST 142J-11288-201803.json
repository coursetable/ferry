            "\u00a0I received an incredible, inside look at how females have established themselves in the medical world as well as the professional world from decades ago to the present. I enjoyed starting from the beginning of women healers and experienced the evolution of how we have grown as a society (through readings, articles, and books). ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge of how to read about historical actors and situate them in a larger historical context. ",
            "\u00a0Great intro to womens issues in medicine. ",
            "\u00a0fascinating history of women healers, midwives, public health professionals, and physicians in the history of America ",
            "\u00a0I gained an understanding of case studies of women in medicine and, of course, significantly improved analytical skills and my writing. ",
            "\u00a0Love , love, LOVED this class. Professor Rogers is an amazing professor, and she's incredibly knowledgeable. "

            "\u00a0The most outstanding thing about this course is the professor. Professor Rogers is SO enthusiastic and truly LOVES what she is teaching. I looked forward to this seminar every week and loved contributing in lecture. One weakness was the amount of reading we had. Most weeks we would have to read an entire book plus other articles in one week and with juggling 5 classes and extra-curriculars, while trying to stay sane, it proved quite difficult. I, oftentimes, became very discouraged feeling as if I did not have a sufficient amount of time to do the readings and that i was trying to \"just get through\" rather than actually enjoy what i am learning. ",
            "\u00a0It was a writing credit but we received almost no instructions and no feedback on assignments. There was an excessive amount of reading assigned and most of them were not discussed in class. ",
            "\u00a0Overall loved it, no complaints! ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course include mostly interesting readings and discussion, a relatively light writing load, a lot of freedom on writing assignments, and good feedback on them. Weaknesses include a very heavy reading load, (due to the freedom of writing assignments) more pressure to research interesting topics, and sometimes a lack of balance in the secondary sources (e.g. reading J. Marion Sims, and then a secondary source that contextualized his practices in a positive and abstract way, not focusing on the women and their bodies he mutilated). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- Based on class engagement, and the class was quite engaged! The material was incredibly interesting and spanned a great deal of medical history. "

            "\u00a0Yes, take any class by Professor Rogers. She cares. She is enthusiastic. She cares about you as a student and person and makes time if you want to grab coffee or meet with her. She is very straightforward and uses constructive criticism to better you as a student. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I thought this course was super interesting and an extremely manageable work load. ",
            "\u00a0no, the subject matter was interesting but i would not suggest this course due to the intense frustration and low level of engagement. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This class provides a rich perspective on a specific slice of history and professor Rogers has structured it very well to facilitate personal engagement, a lively and productive classroom, and provides opportunities for students to significantly improve their writing. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely if you are at all interested in the role of women in American medicine! ",
            "\u00a0If you have the time to read 200-300+ difficult pages a week, then yes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Rogers is an amazing professor! "
