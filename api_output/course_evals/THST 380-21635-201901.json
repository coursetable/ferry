            "\u00a0The course is a great survey of trends in twentieth century American dance. I feel like I got a great sense of the major choreographers. I also definitely improved my writing; Prof. Seibert conducts writing workshops for each assignment. ",
            "\u00a0So much about the evolution and history of dance as well as how to critically analyse and understand dance itself. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about writing about dance and describing motion through text ",
            "\u00a0Writing skills, vivid descriptions "

        [
            "\u00a0The strengths are the sheer amount of material covered and the organization of the course. Seminar time could have been more structured. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: great learning opportunity to improve writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0I like that we had guest lecturers come in and teach us how to dance. I like that we had feedback on our work. I think the writing workshop process could be better. Since it is a writing class, I think it would also be valuable to deliberately improve on a piece of writing and have to turn in a revised draft to ensure we understand the corrections. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend it. I feel like I have enough background to go see live dance with a critical eye. And, not only do you learn the history but you learn the craft of writing about dance, which is an interesting exercise. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Only if you are really interested in dance "
