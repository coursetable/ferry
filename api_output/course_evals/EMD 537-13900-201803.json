            "\u00a0The course encouraged me to engage with the topics, especially as many of the topics were outside of my study area. There were a significant number of assignments, particularly as reading responses and group meeting notes were expected every week. ",
            "\u00a0Weekly group project meetings are useless. A presentation is extremley important, however meeting every week is excessive and I heard from other students that was the reason they did not take your class. ",
            "\u00a0-Strengths - She try to engage the class with questions\r\n-Weaknesses - Given the format of just 'speaking at the students', it was difficult for students who are not in the Environmental Health concentration to become more interested in the material ",
            "\u00a0You are required to meet with a group every single week and submit a weekly write up starting at the beginning of the semester, all for a 20 minute presentation during the last week of classes.  I will admit that the forced time for background readings did help the presentation come together in the end, but I still think weekly meetings starting right at the beginning of the semester is unnecessary overkill and a poor use of students' time.  The early meetings were unproductive as we had learned very little material in class so far and did not know what to focus on.  I believe it would be highly useful to move these required meetings to every other week or even less frequently, especially at the beginning of the semester.  This would still require groups to think about their projects early on, but would be less of a strain, especially when early meetings are less productive.\r\n\r\nClass was engaging overall.\r\n\r\nThere was a 3rd woman who appeared to be grading the class.  She could often be seen with rubrics during presentations and taking notes on student participation.  It felt very unfair to be evaluated by somebody who was not announced to be a professor or TF.  Students should be made aware of who is contributing to decisions regarding their grades.  I feel uncomfortable lacking background on somebody who is evaluating me. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Ying & Elsio are great and the class atmosphere was overall interactive\r\nWeaknesses: Unnecessary assignments (weekly meetings for group projects, weekly write-ups to prove that you've done the reading), lack of feedback on group projects, lack of \"flow\" from lecture to lecture (concepts not always related to one another) ",
            "\u00a0Poorly organized, a lot of busy work, too many assignments and not enough direction for what is expected ",
            "\u00a0I liked the class, and Elsio is great. However, the requirement for groups to meet weekly for one presentation is overkill. ",
            "\u00a0There was a lot to like about this course: the professors are extremely knowledgeable and clearly care deeply about pedagogy, which is always appreciated. It was an extremely friendly class environment, so I always felt comfortable asking questions or expressing an opinion. The most beneficial aspect of the class was probably the final project: it is a phenomenal opportunity to do a deep-dive into a WASH case, and it was fascinating to see other student presentations as well.\r\n\r\nThere's also a lot of room for improvement... most of which is structural. I think this class maybe tried to cover too many topics, so on the one hand we were exposed to many aspects of WASH, but on the other hand it often felt a bit disorganized or disjointed. I actually think that a case-based approach might work better... the final presentations were so interesting; what if they were spread out through the semester, and each paired with a lecture on some of the basic principles behind the case? For example, learning about heavy metals side-by-side with the Bangladesh arsenic case, learning about bacterial disease side-by-side with the Haiti cholera case, learning about water treatment systems side-by-side with the Flint case, etc.\r\n\r\nI also left the class feeling like I don't know as much about water-related diseases as I would have liked. Getting some clinical perspective on what these diseases are like, how they present clinically, the toll they take on communities, etc. would be really helpful. I wonder if this course could even be organized around clinical disease, similar to how the Big 3 class is?\r\n\r\nOne last piece of feedback is that having a weekly write-up as well as a weekly group meeting was quite burdensome. I think that the weekly group meeting is more oversight than we need as graduate students, though we did really appreciate the feedback along the way. Perhaps in lieu of these meetings, we could submit a mid-semester progress report? Or an attestation at the end with a list of our meetings and topics covered, and how everyone contributed? Or a required office hours with the professors 2-3 weeks before the presentation to get feedback?\r\n\r\nOh actually one last thing--the extension on the grant proposal was much appreciated but I think that you will generally get higher quality work if the paper is not due the same time as the final presentations. ",
            "\u00a0Great course - I got exactly what I was looking for and expected.\r\n\r\nStrengths - dives into a range of topics associated with WASH, while not spreading too thin and maintaining a common thread. ",
            "\u00a0This class covers a wide range of topics on WASH from the microbial and environmental perspectives. The assigned readings and lectures discuss large WASH issues in the United States and globally. It brings speakers from the WHO, government, and academics, which provides lots of interesting and comprehensive ideas on WASH. In addition, the waste water treatment pant visit was fun and was a great learning experience. The class requires a semester long group project, which takes a lot of time for meetings outside class. It could be improved in the future. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very interesting and we covered a lot of important topics. There were a ton of tiny assignments that I think distracted from really engaging with the material; instead of focusing on the content, I was trying to just complete the weekly write-ups. "
