            "\u00a0I read a number of good works of short fiction, poetry, and drama. I also brushed up on the basics of writing each, remembering the elements of a good story and poem. ",
            "\u00a0I developed better editing/revision skills and got exposed to many interesting writing pieces. ",
            "\u00a0Effective strategies for writing fiction; poetry, and drama ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to be a more well-rounded writer overall, and how to look for inspiration and find joy in writing in styles I had not previously explored. ",
            "\u00a0I learned that I still love to write. I think I do well with dialogue and my stories are interesting, but I can do more with them. I tend to hold be self back. maybe it's some fore of laziness, but I just need to dive head in, get dirty. I need to submerge myself in creativity, turn off the phone for a while and read more books. ",
            "\u00a0My writing has improved significantly and my view of the world has evolved with constant provocation from the class and from the readings. "

        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: generally a good structure. Each part feels short, but I suppose there's little that can be done for an intro course of the kind.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the course felt very disorganized. I was never quite sure when things were due, and if you missed a class or lost a handout (let alone a draft with commentsa grade-killer that didn't get flagged for its importance early enough in the semester) you'd be at a loss for how to do, or when to turn in, an assignment. Organization matters supremely in this class. I don't think the students or instructor were clear enough on that. ",
            "\u00a0strength- good overview of fiction, poetry, and drama; learn some basics about each genre and read great pieces from each.\r\n\r\nweaknesses- the time spent on each genre felt too short; perhaps this class could be a year-long sequence so that students can delve more deeply into the three genres. I'm not sure if I would enroll in a whole semester-long course on drama or fiction, but I would appreciate a couple of extra weeks on them. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoy creative writing. However, trying to accomplish three styles of writing in one semester was a little overwhelming. Especially in the poetry unit, I felt like I was barely learning what one style was before the assignment was due. Also, Professor Chapman did not always provide guidelines for assignments and it led to multiple students getting confused about assignment parameters (did not seem to impact people's performance much though). ",
            "\u00a0I wish we spent more time on poetry, but the time constraints make it difficult. Overall an amazing class and we got a good survey of creative writing. ",
            "\u00a0The units towards the end of the course felt a little rushed, but that probably can't be helped as the nature of the course is that it's an introduction to writing in each of these styles. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths included strong discussions (though it took a few weeks for discussions to really get going), engaging and varied readings outside of class, and guest lecturers. Throughout the course we had three different authors visit the class to talk about fiction, poetry and prose. These readings/discussions did an excellent job of reinvigorating the class, and ensuring that the first-month momentum of the course remained throughout. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The guests brought in new insights and made me think differently. The course is versatile and I liked how it explored more than one type of writing.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I'm not really sure. I loved it. Clearer directions for projects. Sometimes I wouldn't know what I was supposed to be doing during the assignments and I just improvised. ",

            "\u00a0This is a fine, but not incredible, class. A great Credit/D for anyone looking to dabble in creative writing but not looking to wreck their semester or spend all their time agonizing over poetry. Professor Chapman is kind and quite knowledgeable, particularly of poetry, her specialty. She's also a talented writer, if a bit disorganized as an editor. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this class if you're interested in the basics of drama, fiction, and poetry! Note that this is an introductory course, so if you already have a decent amount of experience, you may not gain as much from taking this. Look up your teacher's background--if you're more interested in poetry, maybe enroll in a section that is taught by a poet. Not too much work and you get constant feedback on how to improve your writing. ",
            "\u00a0Creative writing is definitely an area where your mileage will vary depending on how well you click with the teaching style of the professor. I thought ENGL 123 was a fun class, but I don't know how much my writing improved as a result. There are a bunch of manageable writing assignments, but I wish that instead of many exercises in different areas, we instead focused our energies on just two areas. I also wished that assignment guidelines were more clear, especially in the poetry unit. ",
            "\u00a0It's an amazing class. So much fun. I loved it. You will not regret taking this class. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Eng 123 is a phenomenal course that is very trying but incredibly rewarding. The grading may be offputting for some, but at the end of the day, I have not taken a class that has taught me as much is this one has. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! However, the course is an *introduction* to writing in each of these styles, so if you have prior in-depth experience with one know that some class times might be a bit repetitive. Overall, the course goes quickly through each unit, so I would advise students taking the course to truly invest their time in each assignment and class meeting, and try to take advantage of office hours outside of class so that they can actually get something out of this class that covers a lot of material and only meets twice a week for 1.5 or so hours each time. ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this class to other students, regardless of major, experience in creative writing, or year. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It is fun and really encourages creativity and originality. The professors are full of excitement. ",
            "\u00a0This class is amazing. It built my creativity through necessity and improved my grasp of story as a whole. It should be taken by anyone who wants to begin to master creative narrative. "
