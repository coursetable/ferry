            "\u00a0I improved my Russian reading, writing, and speaking skills. I also learned a lot about Russian culture, in particular the history of Russian art. Finally, I gained greater appreciation for contemporary Russian ",

            "\u00a0There is no weakness in this course! Very good course. ",
            "\u00a0This course was fantastic for an upper level language course. Irina is a phenomenal instructor and she does a wonderful job catering the calss to the interest of the students. One weakness was that the second semester of this course had too many students which made each class session seem less useful than in the previous semester. Also some of the homework assignments were not particularly helpful. ",
            "\u00a0All in all, this is an excellent course. Discussions were very engaging and I was often pushed to contribute, which helped improve my speaking skills. One strength is the diversity of homework assignments--we read articles, watched news clips and movies, did grammar worksheets, wrote short essays, and so on. This course really builds on all facets of language comprehension and retention. The course is also very fluid, which I liked. Students have a lot of freedom to contribute and express what interests them. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course lie in Irinas teaching. She prioritizes ensuring that her students have a deep understanding of the language far higher than evaluating that language in a written form, which is actually very useful in studying Russian, as the complexity of the language make assessments an ineffective way to gauge students dedication to and comprehension of it. The weaknesses are based in the fact that the homeworks, while thoughtfully crafted, sometimes show that Irina doesnt always understand that because an assignment is easy for her, doesnt mean it will be so quick for her students. She generally could do better at respecting the time of her students, both in that the assignments are often very long and that class almost always let out about 5-7 minutes late. In any event, a wonderful class and an even more wonderful professor. I will miss her until I am in her class again. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course, because the professor is very good and organised. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Don't hesitate to take this course if you want to improve your Russian. Irina is a kind, intelligent, and helpful language instructor. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This is a great course--an excellent way to build on your knowledge of the Russian language, to practice reading, writing and speaking, and to gain insight into 20/21-century Russian culture. Highly recommend! "
