            "\u00a0A basic understanding of star formation and death and how we as people can detect this. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a pretty strong basic framework for understanding astronomy and developed / recovered physics skills that I had long since given up on. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about astronomy in depth for the first time and came to appreciate the field more. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a lot of knowledge on the processes with which stars develop and the astronomical methods that are used to study the universe around us. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a thorough breadth of information on astronomical concept. ",
            "\u00a0Telescope and lens physics, blackbody physics and the physics of light, the history of astronomy, methods for finding exoplanets, the evolution of stars and their classifications. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me a broad introduction to the field of astronomy, and dove deeper into the lives and evolution of stars. ",
            "\u00a0This course gives a broad introduction to astronomy. I learned the basics about the properties of light, the solar system, the sun, exoplanets, black holes, and star formation. ",
            "\u00a0I didnt learn that much to be honest. "

            "\u00a0There's probably no great way to improve the lectures. Maybe if the powerpoints weren't white with so many words on them, class time wouldn't be as dry as it was. But overall I learned a lot and I think the class does a good job of presenting the information. ",
            "\u00a0The course gives a broad understanding of many interesting topics: the historical overview and significance, the formulas used to approach these problems, and the intuitions behind them. It can be, however, difficult to separate out which of these is necessary for actually succeeding in the course (probably the formulas). ",
            "\u00a0The amount of material is just right for a semester long class, and all of the material I found interesting. However, most of what we did in class was theory while our problem sets we math-heavy. ",
            "\u00a0The concepts are explained well, however, the lectures weren't that engaging. ",
            "\u00a0The material is not presented in a very engaging way and for it being such a small class it was treated as a lecture with very little student engagement. ",
            "\u00a0A bit dry at times ",
            "\u00a0I think that we could do more math and lesson history. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a great introduction to astronomy. Professor Zinn sometimes mumbles and just sort of runs on tangents with his powerpoints but they are extremely thorough and teach effectively and not in a boring way. ",
            "\u00a0The course material was very interesting, and the problem sets and exams did a great job covering all of the material. The classes sometimes moved a little slow, and the powerpoints sometimes felt a little repetitive. Perhaps some example problems, videos, or other methods to change up the lecture a bit each day would help. ",
            "\u00a0The title of this course can be a little misleading, as star formation is only a brief fraction of what you will actually learn. I believe this course could be improved by shortening or removing the section on astronomy history (a pretty useless unit), in order to give more time to cover star formation. ",
            "\u00a0Content is disorganized and a bit too simple for actual astronomy majors. "

            "\u00a0It's a good QR/science and doesn't actually require the calculus and physics that it says it does. The most advanced math we used was logarithms, and we had calculators for that. Overall, it taught me a lot about stars, and we also had a few awesome lectures on relativity and quantum mechanics that were just fascinating. ",
            "\u00a0This course is really designed for students who are interested (to any degree) in astronomy -- it does not bill itself as, nor should it be taken as, a fun and broad Science credit for anyone looking for one. This isn't because the course is horrendously difficult, but mostly because the material is presented in a way that is interesting for those with an assumed interest in astronomy. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course only if you are comfortable with working with formulas and have a strong physics background. Although the course focuses on stars, we also learned about other astronomical objects, but if you are looking for a normal introduction to astronomy class, this is probably not it. ",
            "\u00a0Unless planning to major in astro, I would recommend the 100 level astro courses to other students, not this one. ",
            "\u00a0Yes but especially if it is still taught by Zinn, hes very knowledgable and interesting ",
            "\u00a0Yes, even without an intended astro major this is a very cool and engaging class. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This class is pretty easy, but not so easy to make you feel bad for taking such an easy gut. You will do homework and such, but not too much, and you will actually feel like you're learning about something entirely different from other things you've learned ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course, it really is very interesting. The trip to the observatory was also really fun, it was great to observe interesting targets with the telescope. Although the workload is a bit higher than other intro astronomy claseses, it is worth it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students wanting to major in Astronomy or Astrophysics. I would not, however, recommend this course to someone who is just simply interested in astronomy and wants an introduction to the field (which is what I did). I believe there are better courses at Yale for this purpose of understanding and appreciating how cool space is. A lot of this course involves just learning equations from the lecture slides and then applying them to word problems in the homework and exams. The lectures can be very boring and rarely interesting. I do not necessarily regret taking this course, but I do regret not looking into other options. ",
            "\u00a0If youre an astronomy or astrophysics major, this is a required course. Unless you havent taken any other Astro class at Yale I recommend you ask to skip this one and take a higher level course instead. "
