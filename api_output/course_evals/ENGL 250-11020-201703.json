            "\u00a0This course gives the student broad-ranging survey in Romantic poetry. Scope and breadth are balanced so that each of the major, and some of the minor, poets of the era are covered, and covered in a good amount of depth. Skill-wise, this class focuses on the analysis of poetry and the reading of and writing about poems. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read poetry better with closer attention to the language. I learned how to ask the right questions an ",
            "\u00a0A thorough overview of Romantic poetry and its central ideas, with some attention to major critical perspectives. ",
            "\u00a0As its name would suggest, Romantic Poetry gave me a solid introduction to the major Romantic poets (Blake, Coleridge, Wordsworth, Keats, and Shelley). Not only did we read a wide selection of their work, but we also discussed the themes that they passed among them, focusing especially on the problems that they struggled to resolve. Alongside improving my knowledge of the Romantic era, the course greatly developed my ability to understand and write about poetry. Professor Brisman emphasized the idea that writing about poetry should not be thetic but rather exploratory, conclusions, if they arise from the exploration, coming at the end. Having taken this course, I feel both equipped to take other poetry courses at Yale and more comfortable in the particular style of writing that literature demands. ",
            "\u00a0This course allows students to sharpen their analytical skills through real close-reading -- an approach that roots discussions in the poet's words, rather than theoretical abstractions that are used much too frequently in humanities courses outside of the English department. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read and appreciate the great poets of the Romantic period. I learned how they interacted poetically with each other, and how the grand Romantic sensibility developed. "

            "\u00a0This course is a model English class. It combines rigorous standards with strong material and a strong teacher. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Brisman's superb teaching, and his passion for the subject, is the chief strength of the course. The only weakness was the complete lack of attention to historical and biographical elements in our class discussions. It would have been very useful to have at least some sense of the biographical factors at play in the poems we read, or to have a better understanding of the Romantic poets in their respective historical and intellectual contexts (even if only as a minor supplement to our close readings of their works). In addition, more than a single class discussion on Byron would be very welcome (perhaps at the expense of a couple on Wordsworth). ",
            "\u00a0My only complaint is that I wouldve liked to have spent more time with some of the poems, but such is the nature of a survey course ",
            "\u00a0The poets themselves have to be the greatest strength of this course. Their work is stunning, and many of their lines have stuck in my mind. As regards the class itself, I think the structure of the essays and grading was tremendous. Professor Brisman encouraged us to develop themes over the course of the three essays, which allowed me the ability to trace a particular problem through the various poets that we read. The withholding of grades, moreover, from the essays decentralized the grade, meaning that I did not feel pressure to write a conforming essay and was able to take greater risks.\r\n\r\nStructurally, the course is excellent. I do wish that we could have spent more time on Byron, but because doing do would have forced us to cut from the other poets means that this wish is more a complement to the course than a criticism of it. ",
            "\u00a0Mr. Brisman is a brilliant discussion leader, who truly listens to his students. I particularly enjoyed tracing the differences between the poets' philosophies. If Wordsworth and Keats were to sit down at dinner, for instance, they would certainly have a heated discussion about the role of memory, our treatment of mutability, and the particularities of that mysterious bond between nature and the human spirit. ",
            "\u00a0The structure of the course is excellent. Starting with several introductory classes before plunging into studies of each of the individual poets allowed us to do those poets justice. The selection of poems for each poet was also wonderful. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely. Romantic poetry is incredible, as is Prof. Brisman. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Professor Brisman has been teaching this course for years, and it's clear that he not only knows his stuff but also knows how to teach it in an engaging and meaningful way. He also gives thoughtful comments on papers and will help improve your writing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially if you already like, or are curious about, Romantic poetry, and/or want to take a course with Professor Brisman (as you should!). ",
            "\u00a0This is a fantastic course. Its certainly challenging, but Prof. Brisman was a wonderful guide. Id recommend It even to those whose primary interest is not Romantic poetry and to those who are afraid to tackle the Prelude. ",
            "\u00a0Anyone who wants to spend a semester reading probably the most beautiful poets in the English language should take this course. Not only should take it, but they should take it with Professor Brisman, whose insights into these poems and generosity in giving advice and comments are beyond compare. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This course offers students the opportunity to dive into the heart of English Romantic poetry through a close reading of the Greats: Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Keats, Shelley, and Byron. Whether you are discovering these texts for the first time or keep Ode to a Nightingale by your nightstand, you will gain a lot from Mr. Brisman's class meetings and assignments -- I promise! Take this if you like to stimulate yourself intellectually and to think about what it means to be a human (and an artist). The readings are relevant to our day and age, and the poets can teach us lots about true human sympathy.\r\n\r\nOne word of caution: the essays require time and thought. Mr. Brisman's grading may come off as tough, but this is only because he cares about our actual learning. Please do not let this deter you from taking the class, it's absolutely worth it! ",
            "\u00a0These are fantastically great poets who will change the way you think and the way you experience the world. "
