            "\u00a0I learned survival Russian! This is pretty impressive given the complexity of the language. ",
            "\u00a0There are, of course, the obvious language skills one learns while taking this course and they cannot be understated. Professor Muravnik does a great job turning the complex aspects of the Russian language into concepts that are universally understandable, which makes things like aspect, motion, and numerals engaging to learn. Additionally, Professor Muravnik often shares anecdotes about his experiences in Russia and the interesting etymology of various words that kept me wanting to learn more about the language and the people. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of Russian. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of Russian ",
            "\u00a0My fluency level in Russian went from nonexistent to a point where I feel confident carrying on conversations/making small talk in Russian. "

            "\u00a0This course is fast-paced and intense, which is the best way to learn the language. I would have liked to have more time to solidify concepts before moving on, but the professors are very willing to clarify points of confusion and the materials are very cumulative. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this class certainly lie in the classroom setting. Russian is a complex language and as such it is especially helpful to have an instructional environment that allows for clarifying questions to be deeply addressed. The weakness of this course is in the work outside of the classroom. The homework is especially useful in practicing, but office hours were limited and sometimes unclear. ",
            "\u00a0This was a very good introductory language course. It started out at just the right speed to get acquainted with the new alphabet and language and continued at a good pace throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent professors and in class instruction. Textbook/workbook is fine ",
            "\u00a0Evert portion of this course was incredibly engaging, and I felt that I learned a lot.  I felt that at times, the course moved very rapidly over content and my brain needed a chance to process the information before it was tested on that information, but due to the pace of the course there wasn't much time to grow comfortable with a topic (i.e. verb aspect) before it was tested on. I also feel that, sometimes, the vocabulary used during class didn't match up with the vocabulary that appeared on the test. This course could be improved by addressing the vocabulary issue - the issue with the pacing is, I feel, unavoidable due to the rate at which content is covered. "

            "\u00a0This course is a wonderful way to get a crash course in Russian. I highly recommend it! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who enjoys learning language. It is a serious time commitment, but mostly in the waking up early for the class every day sense. That is of course part of why it is such an effective program. Spending the early hours of each morning hearing, reading, and speaking Russian may not immediately sound like the most exciting way to begin the day, but Professor Muravnik brings an energy that will keep you engaged. This combined with the homework means that you will most likely not have to put in the extra effort to study tremendously hard. The constant nature of the class is actually very beneficial in this regard. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student who wants to start taking Russian. I think if the course had been taught at half the speed, it would have been too slow. Taking the intensive course allows you to dive into the language and learn a lot quickly. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely - I really enjoyed taking the class and learning the language. I am glad I did it and would recommend. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student.  I feel that the professor and TF for this course are outstanding, and I felt that the amount of knowledge that I gained was worth the larger workload for this course. "
