            "\u00a0Jamie was available to meet to discuss the readings and advise on paper topics.  Sadly, of the 25 students in the class, only two of us took advantage of this.  I found Jamie to be knowledgable, articulate and generous with his time.  He lectured for part of one class and was engaging and interesting. ",

            "\u00a0Jamie stayed quiet in the classroom most often, but his insights (when he did speak up!) were engaging and lucid and helped to clarify the subject matter at hand. I attended his lunchtime breakout session once which was very helpful in identifying my final paper topic, and in his comments on my final paper I was impressed by his engagement with my writing and themes.
