            "\u00a0Prior to taking the course, I had very limited knowledge of Russian literature and film in the said period, which really has changed by now. As well as learning about specific writers and films, I developed such transferable skills like discussing and writing about literature overall. The course was also really helpful in a sense that it made a strong case for cultural developments happening against the backdrop of the Communist revolution. ",
            "\u00a0I further developed my analytic skills in terms of film and literature. I also further developed my knowledge of Russian, since our readings were usually uploaded in both English and Russian. Before taking this course, I knew the politics of this period, but it was very interesting to further learn about the cultural aspects of this period. ",
            "\u00a0I was exposed to a great deal of literature that I previously had not read. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a considerable amount about the period, despite that I have already studied it for years. ",
            "\u00a0Most significantly, I feel that we were exposed to a significant amount of Russian literature and cultural theory from the 1920s and 30s. I feel that I have a much better grasp on the literary scenes of the time period and the context preceding and succeeding them. Additionally, I felt that the film component of the course was extremely fulfilling and paired perfectly with the literary aspect of the course. "

            "\u00a0The course covered a good variety of movements and trends in the culture, which is a strength. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very organized. The syllabus, for the most part, ran chronologically throughout the period and each reading was interesting and relevant to the topic. Each reading was brought up in class discussions and the movies outside of class were all relevant to the course as well. ",
            "\u00a0The course was great. I would not change a thing. \r\n\r\nProfessor Clark and Daria worked incredibly well together. They were engaging and inviting. They presented the material in an organized and interesting way. \r\n\r\nNo need for improvement! ",
            "\u00a0There could have been some improvements in terms of making sure all of the students had the readings for each class. Sometimes they were hard to find. ",
            "\u00a0The course was wonderful. Our readings were engaging and were always followed by a focused in-class discussion which tied together the primary texts and films with relevant cultural context. Presentations were engaging and effective and always paired nicely with the larger class discussion. "

            "\u00a0Only if they are interested in the topic, because it may be a little too heavy on details for someone not engaged in the subjects of Russian history, or film, or literature. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. Some readings might be somewhat challenging for those who aren't specifically focused on film or literature, but if you have an interest in this period and/or topic, I would recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Such a great course. Fun, challenging, enriching. \r\n\r\nThe students were given a great amount of respect. Their opinions were valued and this led to productive discussion! ",
