            "\u00a0The scope of the course and the accessible teaching style of the professor are both to be applauded, but its pace makes the course less intellectually accessible to many students.  Although the scope of the course might render its faster pace necessary in order to cover all of the material, I nonetheless encountered at-times significant trouble in learning the material solely due to my inability to take notes or transcribe formulas fast enough.  On a side note, a review session in preparation for the final exam would have also helped! ",
            "\u00a0The course is rigorous enough that you dont really have the option to slow down or fall behind. This is a gift and a curse: motivation is not a problem in this course, but its easy to fall behind early before you realize that and pay for it the rest of the semester. Its such that now that the dust has settled, I realize I truly havent retained anything, because of how much your mind has to be set on plowing through the next test or p-set. I think this is partly just how the p-set system is, and partly because of how Prof. Reuning-Scherer teaches the course. Because the name of the game is getting information off fast, you really dont learn much in class - the real learning is in review & office hours, and so if youre like me and cant really take full advantage of office hours for one reason or another, this class will be a rocky road for you. My suggestion would be that future incarnations of the course slow down, and find ways to make things more hands-on - break up every step of a new concept with a problem dedicated to driving that step home, and get students working directly as its introduced, instead of just watching the process. Also, if possible, break up the class into shorter meetings. ",
            "\u00a0It's a fast-paced class so it definitely helps if you've taken some sort of stats beforehand. But it's great in that a lot of the homework assignments involve playing with real data sets which for me helped connect the subject to the real world and made it more interesting. Because the class is quite fast, there are a lot of things that I needed to go over again in section, but sample midterms and finals are posted which really help. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- although I didn't try the full flipped classroom model, I only attended one or two lectures and watched the rest from Canvas at home. It was really convenient with a busy schedule and I felt like I had been in class the whole semester.\r\n- Jonathan is an incredibly engaging lecturer considering the size of the class\r\n- homework feels very practical and intuitive to work through\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- the particular \"social sciences\" track didn't really feel like it made a strong conceptual connection to the social sciences and focused more on procedures\r\n- I was somewhat thrown by the structure of questions on tests compared to the homework but I adjusted over the course of the semester ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Reuning-Scherer is pretty good at explaining concepts. I felt like I was able to learn without a ton of stress, which is always nice. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The homework material and the test material were so different that it felt like two separate courses. On the homework, we used Minitab (or another stat program), and on the tests we did everything by hand without a program. This disconnect between the tests and homework felt weird for me. I think I would have been able to understand the more complicated concepts better if we learned about them in a more integrated way.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how this statistics class for the SOCIAL SCIENCES was really for social sciences beyond the fact that the data we used was social science related in the second half of the course? I guess I don't fully understand how this is different from any old intro stat course. Could be worth making it more clear why what we're learning is relevant to the field that we've \"specialized\" in for the end of the course. I think I'd be more invested if I understood why this was relevant to fields I'm interested in.\r\n\r\nProfessor Reuning-Scherer says from the first class that he's receptive to feedback. For this reason, I felt particularly upset when a friend of mine pointed out TO HIM that some data he was using and made a joke about on the frequency that different people think about death depending on different factors like poverty level. 1. It's not funny that lower income people are so underprivileged that they literally think about death more. That's just upsetting. 2. Data like this is inevitably going to be upsetting to some of the people that any good professor or kind person should care A LOT about not upsetting--those who have experienced death in the family or of a close friend recently, or those who have experienced suicidal thoughts or actions. I don't at all think that the professor wanted to trigger these dangerous thoughts. But I really wish he had taken student concerns about this data more seriously. Using different, non-harmful data really isn't that hard. ",
            "\u00a0This course is amazing. Great lectures, and it really helped me to understand statistics. ",
            "\u00a0Although I loved my professor, I sometimes found his speed a bit hard to follow. As a visual learner, I relied heavily on the slides to clarify what had happened in class and sometimes found that it was difficult to interpret the slides. However, professor Reuning-Scherer is a highly engaging lecturer, and I had a lot of fun in class! He very much encouraged contribution-- I very much wanted to participate, but was also too scared to most of the time since the class at no point (whether it be general lecture or section) felt small enough to regularly contribute without utmost confidence. Additionally, all lectures are recorded are made available online, which was very useful. Including relevant Minitab directions in the slides was helpful for when we were doing problem sets. \r\n\r\nThe way that statistics classes are set up at Yale makes it so that you would need to take almost every class in order to leave Yale saying that you're competent in statistic analysis. For an intro class, things are done pretty well. However, I wish that I would have known from earlier on in the course the general breadth of statistics, so that I could better contextualize what I was learning in relation to all the things that can be known and done/performed using statistics. Having a clearer sense of what one doesn't know how to do (from the get-go) makes it easier to identify what the course is aiming to teach, as well as what student can expect of themselves. \r\n\r\nThe effort to make office hours almost always available was very much appreciated. I don't know how well attended other sections were, but I regularly attended Gena's sections in Bass, and both found them helpful and well-attended. ",
            "\u00a0The course was engagingly taught. I wouldn't say that the course moved too fast (there were often a lot of repetitive examples) but JDRS just talked a bit too fast for me to pick up everything. ",
            "\u00a0A lecture dedicated solely to how to learn the computer program Minitab would've been super helpful. I found Professor Reuning-Scherer's style to be at times a bit confusing. In an effort to be funny, he was not straightforward at all. TF's were super helpful though and picked up the slack. I appreciated how you could go to any of them for help on the psets and questions about lecture content. Additionally, a textbook for this class would have been helpful. While Professor Reuning-Scherer did recommend a few, there was no one single source that could be used to clarify topics. ",
            "\u00a0The best part of this class was the professor, JRS. He really made statistics interesting, bringing real life examples for us to work with and using humor to keep the lectures interesting. The material was all very straightforward and was explained well! This was a very good stats class. ",
            "\u00a0Solid course I took as it is a requirement. ",
            "\u00a0Really fantastic professor, really clear lecture slides, great TAs. Which more review or practice problems were available though! ",
            "\u00a0Very comprehensive and at a good pace. Good support network but sometimes feels detached. ",
            "\u00a0The course doesn't need to be improved honestly. It's great! ",
            "\u00a0Strength: eh it does its jobs\r\n\r\nWeakness: eh its stats ",
            "\u00a0Take the flipped versioN!!!! ",
            "\u00a0Please move the class further down science hill! The material is a little dry, but too be expected in an intro Stats class! ",
            "\u00a0The course is very well-taught. The lectures are recorded so they can be easily referenced. The homeworks are in themselves instructive, but only really if you take them to office hours to figure out what big concepts the course is really hitting with them.\r\n\r\nThe questions of the homeworks, especially on the first ones, can be a little vague sometimes. The following are three specific examples I noted.\r\n\r\nFor homework 1, question 3b, the questions reads: \"See how these values change when you remove the largest value\"; however, the answer also expects you to make a comment on those changes. A clearer wording would be something like: \"Comment on how these values change when you remove the largest value.\"\r\n\r\nFor homework 2, question 2, the question reads: \"Calculate the correlation between these two variables\"; however, the answer also expects you to name the strength and direction of that correlation. A clearer wording would be something like: \"Calculate the correlation between these two variables and nominate the strength and direction of the correlation.\"\r\n\r\nFor homework 3, question 6, the question reads: \"Show how to compute the probability of a getting a hand with four of a kind\"; however, the answer also expects you to also calculate the probability. A clearer wording would be something like: \"Show how to compute the probability of a getting a hand with four of a kind and calculate the probability.\" ",
            "\u00a0I think it's a good intro course if you want to have a basic understanding of stats. ",

            "\u00a0The notes were excellent, comprehensive, and having all the lectures online was very helpful. The course was fast-paced, sometimes to a detriment, but overall I think was a good thing because we covered so much. ",
            "\u00a0The material is not very applicable to real life. ",
            "\u00a0The classes and powerpoint presentations get a little bit off topic, which made it very difficult to know what was important and what was not. I thought that the notes were very unorganized. I spent more time trying to figure out which information in the notes was important and which was just filler instead of actually learning and mastering the concepts. ",
            "\u00a0The course is useful in giving an overview of statistical methods available to use. Some of the kinds of statistical tests learned towards the end of the course that we were introduced to we couldn't learn how to apply completely unless we took a more specific statistical course in the future. I think that the overview was helpful though, and appreciated being directed to specific courses that matched the statistical tests relevant to my field. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is that the lectures are recorded and provided online for students. This really provides you with all the tools needed to learn the most that you can, especially since the content can be very dry at times. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is the breadth of knowledge it manages to adequately cover in one semester. However, I found that the lectures did a poor job of explaining some of the more difficult concepts or preparing me to do the homework problems. ",
            "\u00a0A very good course, however hard to seek help as office hours are very busy. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was well organized and taught ",
            "\u00a0The use of live streaming/recording the lectures was a fantastic strength for the course--as a person who gets sick quite often, I really appreciated being able to 'tune in' to class from my dorm room when necessary. Class was really engaging, and Prof. Reuning-Scherer's lecturing style is a huge bonus. The abundance of professor and TA office hours is also phenomenal; I've never had another course compare in terms of sheer opportunity to get help, nearly every day of the week.  All of the TAs I interacted were incredibly nice and knowledgeable, and grading was unimaginably fast. ",
            "\u00a0Set up very well. You get out what you put in. ",

            "\u00a0The course was always interesting, and I enjoyed the lectures quite a bit. I thought that the pacing was uneven at times and that we would get caught up in something that didn't need too much attention while quickly addressing something else that would be critical to understanding the unit. Because of this, I sometimes felt disoriented, or like I was scrambling to keep up or waiting for us to move on. ",
            "\u00a0Professor R-S is the strength of this class. He is engaging, funny, and committed to his students. He provides a lot of different ways to learn the material and get help if needed, and his lectures never failed to entertain and keep me engaged.\r\n\r\nThe format of the class is also a positive  it's nice to split off from the larger lecture and specialize in material you are interested in, and the PSets are productive and help you learn the material (there isn't too much busy work, and they are not inordinately difficult). ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are about as engaging as they can be. Jonathan sometimes moves quickly through the material, but his use of humor and the fact that all lectures are posted online more than compensate. The class provides great practice with common statistical techniques without dwelling too long on any one topic. The most frustrating part of this class is downloading the statistics computer program for p-sets. As the main program isn't Mac compatible, finding a computer for the program is a nuisance. ",

I felt like it was a very well-balanced class and I dont have complaints about it except that sometimes problems on exams are worded in convulted ways. ",
            "\u00a0The course moves very quickly, as do most math classes at Yale, but Professor Reuning-Scherer is incredibly engaging and provides you with ample examples to learn the material. While it is fast-paced, there are many opportunities to get help through emailing Professor Reuning-Scherer or going to the many TA office hours offered. ",
            "\u00a0The chief oddity of this course is the disjunction between its p-sets and its exams. The p-sets essentially test your competence with MINITAB, stats software that is basically souped-up Excel--completing them doesn't really require you to understand concepts. The 2 midterms and final, though, are all concepts. You could do extremely well on all the p-sets and then bomb the exams because the former really don't prepare you for the latter. Looking past this, the course was not too difficult. JRS is a seasoned lecturer, though I found it hard to follow his lecture slides at times. The course is balanced and never unreasonable. But besides core concepts like the Central Limit Theorem and p-values, the intricacies of statistics were not imparted with enough clarity to last, at least in my case. ",
            "\u00a0This course's strengths include Professor Reuning-Scherer's charisma and lecturing style and the extensive notes. If it has any weaknesses, they are based around the speed of the course. It's a whole lot of material to cover in one semester, and some of the subject material was glazed over only briefly despite becoming crucial to understanding of future topics. ",
            "\u00a0I was not very engaged in this course, but that is definitely not Professor Reuning-Scherer's fault. He clearly did his best to make the material interesting to the class, and sometimes succeeded. I really appreciated the humor and easygoingness he brought to the class. I just realized that Statistics do not interest me personally. ",

            "\u00a0Absolutely. For anyone looking for an introductory stats class, this is really approachable and engaging. As someone who did AP Stats in high school it felt somewhat below my level but the refresher over the first 8 weeks was really useful and the expansion in the last 5 felt like a natural extension of what came before. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, yes. I'm a non-STEM student double-majoring in Political Science, and this was a good way to fulfill my QR. I learned something, so it wasn't a gut or waste of a credit, but it also wasn't too hard that I felt like I was in over my head. If you're like me, you're probably deciding between social sciences and political science. The advice I got (which I can't confirm) is that social sciences is easier but political science is more interesting. I can't really confirm this, but I can say I wasn't riveted by political science (although I don't know if a stats class could ever fascinate me), and political science wasn't too hard. No idea how the difficulty compares, though. I got a pretty rudimentary introduction to basic concepts in statistics such as ANOVA, regression, and probability. I learned how to use the statistical programming software minitab. Professor Reuning-Scherer is pretty good at explaining concepts. I felt like I was able to learn without a ton of stress, which is always nice. Do keep in mind that there's a disconnect between what you learn for homework and what you learn for exams. The homework material and the test material were so different that it felt like two separate courses. On the homework, we used Minitab (or another stat program), and on the tests we did everything by hand without a program. This disconnect between the tests and homework felt weird for me. I think I would have been able to understand the more complicated concepts better if we learned about them in a more integrated way. ",
            "\u00a0If you have not yet taken statistics, this is the perfect way to start. Super lectures, tons of help available, and it's just fun. My favorite class of the semester. If you have taken AP stats, then maybe not? I was told that this covers some AP stat topics. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone interested in stats! ",
            "\u00a0This was an engagingly-taught course on ain my opinionpretty boring subject. I was taking it for a QR credit and because it's relevant to my major. I would recommend it if you're interested in statistics already or if it applies to your major, but probably not if neither of those criteria apply. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Statistics is a very practical and useful, and also very cool, branch of math. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to another student who wants to learn about statistics, needs to fill a requirement. You will come away with a lot more than basic statistics knowledge. The pests are reasonable, the tests are fair, and the lectures are fun. This is a great QR, or just a class to take if you want to learn how to interpret data. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Think it is a very good introduction to statistics and if you take it with Jonathan, then it is absolutely worth it! Very fun, nice guy who is really engaging with the material which is so hard to do in such a huge lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, good course and you really learn quite a bit in an easily understandable manner. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to another student, especially if you are in any social science field. Understanding statistics and how to apply it to inquiry in your field is crucial! I didn't understand how useful stat is until I took this course. I promise, this course is the best way to learn about stats too: the professor is truly incredible, one of the best (if not the best) I've had at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Sure. 103 is nice because the same 10x professor teaches it so it makes the transition smooth. ",
            "\u00a0YES! FLIPPED VERSION ",
            "\u00a0It depends if this is something that would interest you! I think it is a good intro course! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it. This a pretty fun course sometimes. You will learn a good deal about statistics and, if you do the work, you likely will not feel overwhelmed. ",
            "\u00a0The first 6 weeks or so of the class are pretty easy, then you split off into your respective sections. The 103 section is taught by the same professor so it's very similar to the first half. I recommend 103 over the other sections. ",
            "\u00a0I think this is a good course if you don't have any stats background and want to try it out. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this course with Professor Reuning-Scherer. He's a great lecturer, and successfully makes stats engaging, fun, and easy to comprehend. The workload is minimal, and it doesn't require learning any complex statistical programsMINITAB is intuitive and easy to use. ",
            "\u00a0Take the flipped version! ",
            "\u00a0I think, if you've had a bit of stats background, yes; it was a survey, but still pretty intensive. ",
            "\u00a0No take AQA instead of S&SD103/2, AQA is more applicable to real life. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would definitely recommend this course to another student interested in an overview of statistical methods available to use for almost any field. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning basic statistics. Stats 103 uses many examples involving statistics methods that can be applicable to many different situations. Additionally, the course is great because the lectures are recorded and you can rewatch/watch them to learn the material at your own pace. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course because the workload was not difficult, and if you use office hours to your advantage, you can understand the material and do well. ",
            "\u00a0Yes it was a good intro stat course ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take the full semester with Reuning-Scherer (social science); his lectures are fantastic and he livestreams them so you can watch from your dorm if you're sick (or watch the recordings later if you don't feel like having class). ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course, however I haven't received clear feedback on my homework assignments, so I think TA's should pay more attention to this ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student interested in getting a wide view of general topics in statistics, but wouldn't recommend it for somebody who has had no experience with statistics at all. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. JRS makes stats a fun and informative ride -  one that I thoroughly enjoyed, even though I was initially afraid of taking stats. He truly cares about making all possible resources available to students (TAs, Office Hours etc.) and has been very approachable. I couldn't have imagine learnings stats from anyone else and recommend this course to anyone interested in stats or in need of a QR in which you actually learn something. Workload is balanced. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend taking this class. Professor Reuning-Scherer is a great teacher and keeps you engaged. He has some very funny stories and lots of corny jokes, which helped keep the lectures interesting and unique. The class is a good introduction to statistics, and it made me want to learn more. The problem sets help you learn the material but are not super difficult. If you're looking for a QR credit with a useful subject matter and a really good professor, I'd definitely suggest taking this course. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to any student who needs a QR credit and would like to learn about practical applications of math (as opposed to hard math). The workload and exams are completely reasonable, though the actual exams are usually more difficult than the sample exams. I also would highly recommend going to office hours; it saves a lot of time and confusion when working on the p-sets. ",
            "\u00a0yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend thus course to another student because statistics is a very pertinent, practical topic in society. The class is taught by a wonderful professor and is overall set up for success. ",
            "\u00a0yes, it was well taught and clearly explained ",
            "\u00a0If you've taken AP stats, you can still take this course and it definitely wont be a complete review bc this course moves much faster than AP stats, but you'll be at an advantage. Prof. JRS is engaging and very funny but sometimes not that clear when explaining things. \r\nGo to office hours for the psets, the TAs are very helpful and basically give the answers. The psets dont take that long (except for the one on probability). ",

            "\u00a0Loved this class! Im an EVST major who wanted to learn the basics of statistics because of the importance of fundamental math knowledge in all fields, and I ended up really finding an academic interest in Stats! The prof is great, if youre going to take an info Stat class, take it with Jonathan. The problem sets and exams dont throw curveballs at you, which is nice, because you can see the results of your efforts. Overall, I would definitely recommend! ",
            "\u00a0Statistics is useful to know regardless of what career you pursue. It's a great introductory course to statistical analysis that will better prepare you for any career. ",
            "\u00a0If you are looking for an easy QR, this is a good choice, but there are probably more fun options out there. I found the material interesting, but never scintillating. Sort of a meh course. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course. If you think it'll be helpful to you even a little bit, it's worth taking. I took it credit/d and probably didn't even have to because it was so well taught that assignments were a breeze and it required minimal studying outside of exams. The professor is kind, helpful, and interesting. Definitely give it a try. ",
            "\u00a0Unless you're thinking of being an S&DS major, there is really no reason to take this class-- and if you are, there are probably better classes to take. There's no major problems with it, necessarily, it is just the sort of class that doesn't add anything to your Yale experience. I took it because I needed another QR requirement and I thought it would help with research that I've been working on, but I was wrong. It's like a high school class. Take it if (like me) you're terrible enough at Calculus to need a different type of QR, but otherwise try to find something more specific. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. A good introductory statistics course that covers all important basesp ",
            "\u00a0If they need a QR credit and are not a math person, yes. While I did not find the course that interesting, I also didn't find it extraordinarily difficult, and I felt that Professor Reuning-Scherer wanted students to do well and tried his best to provide them with the tools to do so (the notes posted online were especially helpful). ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this class to another student. Statistics is very practical, and this class changed the way that I read science and news studies. ",
