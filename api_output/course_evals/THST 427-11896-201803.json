            "\u00a0This class teaches you to look at almost anything from a movement research perspective. We covered a wide variety of topics from dance notation to virtual reality to visual art and read important movement research essays. We started every class with movement exercises and learned how movement can inform us in other parts of life. ",
            "\u00a0This class helped me see my daily actions and movements through the lens of history and personal stories.  It transformed the idea of dance from something that only /dancers/ do but to something that we all do everyday, just with different choreography depending on our history and what we have experienced. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about a new discipline in which I had no prior knowledge. The class was organized well to facilitate interdisciplinary discussion, fostering the learning. ",
            "\u00a0In this course, Professor Coates gives you the ability to explore questions about movement research/the intersection of technology and movement that pique your intellectual curiosity, while providing a strong intellectual base in movement theory, interdisciplinary research, and performance art through the assigned readings. ",
            "\u00a0This course, in the broadest aspect, developed a students ability to reengage with the world through movement. The variety of movement studied transcended fields both in the arts and sciences. It allowed a person to re-approach concepts through the lens of movement and gain a deeper insight into both the subject of movement and the concepts on view. As the idea of embodiment developed in the class postulates, by using movement exercises in the class the material became engrained internally. "

            "\u00a0The fairly small class size was nice; at the same time, I felt there was good diversity of people who took the class which also created an engaging class dynamic. The structure of the class taking place in CCAM digital media studio was super helpful because we had space to move around and use the equipment. Overall it's kind of a weird class in that movement research is a kind of loose subject - it bleeds into a lot of different things. Some readings were difficult to understand and sometimes it was hard to discern the real point to what we were doing. But in general, the class was interesting and I felt like I gained a lot of new knowledge and a new way of looking at the world. ",
            "\u00a0In the future, I think it would be helpful to turn in rough drafts of our final papers. The final project is such a huge component of the class, and I think my final paper would have taken a much different direction (in a good way) if I had received feedback on it earlier in the course. ",
            "\u00a0This course's strength is its professor; Emily Coates has a wealth of knowledge about dance in the theoretical, practical, and interdisciplinary sense. I think the course could be improved by further integrating the use of the motion capture lab into class sessions. ",
            "\u00a0The course is strong in all regards: terrific professor, interesting and vital material, and full-body participation. My only suggestion is for Professor Coates to lecture a tiny bit more. She is incredibly engaging to listen to and learn from and having her lecture for part of the class before starting the discussion would be very valuable. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this if you're looking for a different kind of seminar/learning experience. It's unlike any class I've taken before in that it's very interactive and sometimes feels a little wishy washy in the academics. It's definitely a nice break from other more traditional academic classes and allows for more creativity than you might get in other classes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think that the material one learns is something that isn't taught elsewhere - this class is extremely unique and don't know of a course that is similar. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This course is truly multi-disciplinary. If you're interested in dance, philosophy, history, art, music, physics or film...take it! For example, we took field trips to both the YUAG and the Wright Lab (a particle physics lab). Emily is wonderful at guiding the class through productive discussions. Classes generally began with a 15ish min movement exercise (no dance experience is necessary) and were followed by a discussion of the readings. \r\n\r\nReadings were very manageable and carefully tailored to each week's discussion (unlike some other seminars that assign hundreds of pages of readings, forcing students to quickly skim everything). You can (and should!) do all the readings thoroughly for this class because they're so interesting! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. Whether you're a technically advanced dancer, someone who ruminates on the philosophical implications of dance, movement, and art, or someone who's just interested in taking a dance studies class, this course provides a great experience for you. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The material applies to any discipline and allows one to view their discipline with a new lens of movement. This a valuable skill to have and learn. "
