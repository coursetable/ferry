            "\u00a0The strength of this course was that because it was so hard, I learned a ton. However, I think the course could be refocused somewhat. Guy tried to cover too much material, sacrificing depth for breadth. I think rather than try to cover as many techniques as possible, and having us learn to write our own implementations for all of them, the course should address some of the practical challenges of data mining, including how to collect and clean data, when certain techniques should be used compared to others, and how to interpret results. \r\n\r\nIn particular I think SVM, Isomap, and Diffusion maps could be eliminated or moved into an advanced Data Mining course. I would have liked to learn lasso or other regression based methods, and also learn how to scrape websites for data. \r\n\r\nIn a sentence: less focus on writing our own machine learning algorithms, more focus on how to use, implement, and interpret different packages on actual messy data sets. ",
