            "\u00a0I learned the ethics and the practices of field research. This includes thinking through my own positionality, as well as learning how to write field notes, conduct interviews, and conduct observation. ",
            "\u00a0Practical skills: interviewing techniques, organization of field notes, how to use your data to support your argument\r\nTheoretical skills: ethical concerns, understanding of the importance of qualitative techniques to research ",
            "\u00a0I got to know the practical aspects of doing fieldwork and to practice them with close supervision. I also learned about the ethical challenges of doing fieldwork and the process at the University for the review of research projects with human subjects. ",
            "\u00a0\tThe hands-on aspect of the course and its requirement for relatively extensive fieldwork is by far the most useful element. It helps apply, refine, and challenge what we read in this class and others. It is an opportunity to get our hands dirty and engage in spaces outside the comfort zone of Yale. ",
            "\u00a0This course was really beneficial in terms of learning what the steps are for doing a qualitative research project. I learned more about the research process and built skills in qualitative research methods ",
            "\u00a0This course was very valuable. Most importantly, I developed my interview skills and my understanding of research ethics. "

            "\u00a0I loved this course! It is an amazing hands-on practicum, which introduces students to both best practices and the city. The structure of the course is novel, the readings are excellent, and the assignments are productive. Professor Wood is a phenomenal mentor. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: lots of opportunities to practice the skills, in-depth class discussions driven by the students, guest speakers\r\nWeaknesses: directions not always clear for projects ",
            "\u00a0Its main strength is its practical component, and the guest speakers were also very good. Perhaps its weakness is that we have to start doing the practical component before reading the readings on note-taking, ethnography, life history, etc. so there were some mistakes that could have been corrected preemptively.

It is an opportunity to get our hands dirty and engage in spaces outside the comfort zone of Yale.\r\n\tThe fieldwork could begin earlier in the semester  i.e. cold calls, interview protocol, etc. could have earlier deadlines so that we can get into the field sooner. ",
            "\u00a0The course was structured well and encouraged students to work on their fieldwork projects. ",
            "\u00a0This course overall was very strong. The opportunity to do an in-depth research project and receive detailed feedback and guidance from Prof. Wood was the greatest strength. The opportunity to speak with authors about their ethnographic works was also very valuable. "

            "\u00a0Yes--the ability to conduct a research project over the course of the semester, coupled with feedback from Dr. Wood and other members of the class, was extremely useful for developing my qualitative research abilities. I feel significantly more confident to apply this to future projects. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This course builds important, necessary skills. The guidance you receive in unparalleled, and the opportunity to get out in the field while being able to ground and discuss the experience within a class setting is valuable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Really looks at why you would want to do field research and the potential difficulties of doing so. Realistic in the difficulties but also inspiring in the works chosen to show the outcomes of this type of research. Terrific guest speakers who are practitioners. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is a great way of getting a theoretical introduction and some practical experience in fieldwork ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Excellent, hands-on training and detailed feedback along the way that will prove useful regardless of whether your focus is qualitative or quantitative research. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another graduate student looking to build qualitative research skills or get started on a research project. ",
