            "\u00a0I learned an enormous amount about French cinema and its evolution over the 20th century. It was an amazing journey to go on with Professor Andrew; the movies are wonderful and fascinating, and the discussion is excellent. ",
            "\u00a0You learn how to understand film history and the various component which compose it vis-a-vis French Cinema. The course is looking at French cinema through the legacy of the new wave. You'd be hard pressed to find a more knowledge and kind professor than Dudley Andrew, who is wonderful in the seminar setting and one of the world leaders in French film. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about developments within French film and French film theory from the 1930s to the present day. I especially appreciated the report on the Cahiers du Cinma issue. Given how closely connected French filmmakers were with French film critics, the assignment on Cahiers du Cinma helped me to better understand how criticism operates within cinema. "

            "\u00a0This course will introduce you to the wonderful world of French cinema and its evolution throughout the 20th century. The professor, Dudley Andrew, is a brilliant, kind-hearted man who is passionate about French movies and about seeing his students succeed. The seminar format is very conducive to excellent conversations about the movies, as are the discussions that take place after every Monday night screening. This class made me fall head over heels in love with French film. Thanks to this class, I will keep watching French movies long after I've left Yale.\r\n\r\nI would recommend that in the future this course have a French-language seminar section. I loved having a French language discussion after the Monday night film screenings; \r\n\r\nI would also recommend that the film screenings be held on weekends; while I loved going to the screenings, they often conflicted with other meetings and practices that I had on Monday nights. Perhaps somehow the movies could be available online, in case a student has to miss a screening? That student could then do work to make up for their absence from the discussion. ",
            "\u00a0The course if fantastic. The combination of screenings and readings is perfect. It gives you an overall sense of what film history is and how French film developed. The seminars can drag if students aren't engaged and sometime Dudley can lecture on topics that aren't directly related, but overall seminar was always enjoyable to attend and interesting. "

            "\u00a0I absolutely would recommend this course to another student. If you are a lover of film, French, or just stories in general, you will love this class. And if French movies aren't something you'd normal take an interest in, try this class anyway! You'll fall in love with French movies. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely if you have any interest in French film, this is the course to take. Dudley Andrew is the professor you want to learn from about this topic. Would definitely recommend to anyone interested in film or literature. The class becomes a tight night cine-club where everyones opinion is valued. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student who has interests in film, French culture, or critical/literary theory. The readings (especially the essays) and films are all fantastic, and the \"cinephile\" atmosphere of the class is wonderful. "
