        [
            "\u00a0This is a good class and Phil is a good teacher. Although there are few formal prerequisites, it's really best that you've already taken 350. You'll also benefit from having done some category theory, but this is not necessary. There is a very well developed theory of representations of finite groups over C, and there's so much structure so it's pretty nice to learn about. Much of the Lie group unit focussed on Lie groups and algebras as opposed to their representations, but that's also good to know. The courseload is reasonable - will take some time, but nothing crazy. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, however be prepared to work extremely hard. Take modern algebra first. Only then is this course valuable for any math major who is interested in understanding the Langlands Program. A physics major can learn the material she/he needs in an easier and perhaps more useful setting than this. This is not the kind of course you can credit/D. "
