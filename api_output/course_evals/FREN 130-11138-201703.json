            "\u00a0This course does a great job of teaching an intuition regarding french grammar. Through audio programs, French novels and films, and endless exercises, the most valuable lesson I gained was the ability to really break down a sentence to its component parts and understand why it was structured in the way it was. ",
            "\u00a0I strengthened my speaking and listening skills, as well as touched up my grammar. I developed essay writing skills in French, which I had never done before. ",
            "\u00a0Intermediate French ",
            "\u00a0I felt my confidence in French grow more in one semester than in three years of high school French! I've never before formed sentences in French to express my thoughts or emotions, and surprised myself when I began telling a story in French to my classmates. All I'd ever done in high school were grammar exercises and reading aloud from books, so this was the biggest learning curve ever. I've noticed myself thinking in French--I never though I'd get here! ",
            "\u00a0If you took French 110/120, this class will mostly be a review as far as grammar goes. But you get to read several interesting books and watch movies in French. My reading and speaking skills definitely improved a lot! "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0It is very hands on especially with such small class sizes which is nice. It is a lot of work, but you learn and improve your knowledge of the language fast and efficiently. ",
            "\u00a0There is a lot of redundancy in the audio programs at times, but the strengths of the course far outweigh the weaknesses, the strengths being the combination of great classroom engagement and repetitive practice for homework. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Mme. Koizim! She was always very energetic and creative, especially when she came up with examples for helping us learn vocabulary, and really cared about all the students. Also, reading literature and watching movies was a fun and effective way to build my French skills.\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the audio programs are old and kind of difficult to hear what the people are saying. ",
            "\u00a0The fact that the course is structured around books and films makes language-learning engaging and also accelerates one's rate of comprehension to (what I felt was) a remarkable degree. That said, the quantity of work one can do for the course is quite flexible, and improvement is proportional to work. Since L3 is about consolidating pre-existing grammatical knowledge, you could coast, but not improve by very much. ",
            "\u00a0The level of personal engagement blew me away. I never expected a college class to help me build such a close connection to my teacher and classmates: it's all the touchy-feely parts of high-school, with the intellectual stimulation of Yale! I love that it was almost entirely immersive. I was wide-eyed for the first two weeks because I'd never spoken French before outside of book exercises, but this class showed me I am stronger than I thought.\r\nI just wish I could stay with the same teacher and classmates for next semester! ",
            "\u00a0This class was well designed and the books we read were really interesting. The homework can be long, but its generally helpful. Madame Koizim was also an amazing Professor! She was super kind, energetic, and she really cares about making sure her students succeed. However, I felt like a lot of this class was review, so it could feel slow at times. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Never have I been so engaged with a course that involved so much of what could be described as \"busy-work.\" ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend - great course for building listening, speaking, grammar, and reading skills. I feel much more confident in my French abilities after taking this class. ",
            "\u00a0Again, because L3 is about consolidating pre-existing grammatical knowledge, and it's a daily course, I can see that it could become deadening if one's level of engagement was low. However, it's not an \"easy\" course, and for someone looking to improve their French through books and films, I think this course presents a suitable and worthwhile challenge. ",
            "\u00a0The workload is worth it. There's no better feeling than FEELING like you are really learning! ",
            "\u00a0If you like French, take it, especially with Madame Koizim! Its a lot of work, but your French will really improve. However if you have a strong background in French, you might be a little bored by the material because its a lot of review. "
