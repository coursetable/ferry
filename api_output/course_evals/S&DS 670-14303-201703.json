            "\u00a0I feel like I better understand the problems at the forefront of research into neural networks. ",
            "\u00a0theoretical knowledge about neural networks. ",

            "\u00a0Absence of every day discussion on canvas. It is impossible to know what are going on in the class if you miss one class. ",
            "\u00a0The best part about the class was the informal research seminar style instruction.  The project also offered a good chance to explore topics of interest.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if there were more papers to choose from for the project, especially more recent papers.  There was a lot of overlap in what people chose, and for some topics there seemed to be relatively few to choose from.  Also, many of the potential papers were extremely long (70+ pages) which is not practical for most students for the scope of the class. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent for people with self sustained interest in the material. The professor is exceptionally knowledgable about the material, and you get to witness research first hand. However, it does not provide a structured introduction to Neural Nets, if that is your goal. ",
            "\u00a0the teacher did not have the ppt. And the structure of the syllabus is not good. ",
            "\u00a0Very insightful, but its pace is kind of fast for me to keep up with ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are that the course covers a great amount of knowledge and the instructor introduces it in detail with patience. Weakness is that the content of courses is less organized and sometimes I get lost in class. "

            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely, as long as you don't expect to learn how to work with neural networks.  You will learn the theory, not the practical applications, of neural networks. ",
            "\u00a0This is a good if idiosyncratic class about neural nets. Professor Barron is very up front about how the course is a way to present his views and his research on the subject. This gives a very interesting perspective as the class gets to the frontier of research very quickly. That said, if you are looking for applications do not take this class, it is pure and abstract theory. ",
            "\u00a0If the student is self motivated about the material, it is an excellent choice. It is a poor choice if they are not. ",
