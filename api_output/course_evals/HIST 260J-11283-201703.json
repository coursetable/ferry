            "\u00a0You learn about reproductive culture from as early as the 16th century, but you end the class in the present day. You learn to make connections between centuries old ideas and today. ",
            "\u00a0learned so many cool things about the history of abortion, generation, clones, and everything in between! ",
            "\u00a0This course looked at gender, sexuality, life, and abortion from renaissance to modernity. Through readings, papers, and class discussion we analyzed gender biases, moral implications, and more of science as we know it. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Dal apret emphasizes learning to think like the people in the eras we are studying. I learned how to read texts with not only an emphasis on understanding the meaning of the material but also learning to interpret it to become the author. ",
            "\u00a0I became a better reader and writer through this course. It was my first history seminar, and although the assigned readings were sometimes difficult, I learned how to read more effectively and efficiently. I also appreciated learning how to look at history (particularly, different historical paradigms) through a new perspective. Professor Dal Prete was always very good at pushing us to find new perspectives and ways of thinking. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the different ways that gender, sexual orientation, and abortion were dealt with throughout history. "

            "\u00a0Some of the readings can be quite hard to pull a discussion from which can be a problem in class when students are just expected to speak.\r\n\r\nIt covers a wide period of time and there are so many surprising connections that can found from the readings to today. ",
            "\u00a0this class covers a lot of interesting material, but since the seminar is so long, by the end of it we kind of exhausted our discussions ",
            "\u00a0I loved this course I thought it was super interesting and captivating. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of this course is the volume of interest material covered in the class. There were very few readings that left little to discuss. As for weaknessss of the course, it seemed a bit dated at times with little room for discussion of present applications ",
            "\u00a0I think a strength of the course is that it covers a lot of different, interesting, and particularly important topics, and the professor is able to connect those topics with one another. However, I believe the readings and class discussions can be improved by diversifying the readings across a broader range of geographical/cultural areas. More specifically, the course could be improved if it incorporated readings that focused on more than Western Europe. Professor dal Prete did this to some extent, but I think more can be done. I understand the limitation of this, as there are language barriers, and the professor's main forte is in Italian/European history. However, I think it would greatly benefit the class. ",
            "\u00a0Stength: Awesome small class where you get to know your classmates pretty well, develop inside jokes with them, and have fun discussions about the reading.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I felt that the class on historical takes on automatons/artificial life (1600s-1800s) wasn't that relevant due to the huge limitations on technology back then. The class where we discussed ethics of cloning/watched Ex Machina was INCREDIBLY interesting, and I feel like we could have devoted more time to that, and maybe just had one reading on old world automata to contextualize it. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that this course was conducted very well. I really appreciated how much this course stretched me as a writer and as a presenter. I did not notice any weaknesses in this course. The weekly readings were always very interesting, and the class discussions were also very engaging. "

        [
            "\u00a0Yes, but you have to be super interested in history and the culture of reproduction. If not, the class might end up being boring for you. ",
            "\u00a0This is a very interesting course as long as you actually do the readings- they are genuinely fascinating and the best part of the class! As someone who has a tradition of skimming readings, I noticed that my enjoyment of this class drastically increased when I started fully doing the readings, as did the quality of our discussions. Naturally, it's hard to stay focused in class when we have laptops to peruse but in general I didn't mind this lengthy seminar once a week. ",
            "\u00a0Yes this course was very interesting the readings and discussions I had for/in class I brought out of the classroom to discuss with friends. This class made me think about how I view the world and modern science. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course. It is very underrated. You learn a lot about interesting topics and things that you would find applicable/relevant to life beyond the course. The workload is not heavy by any means. Grading is composed of 6 reading responses throughout the semester, 1 class presentation (on the reading for that specific class), and a final paper. The readings are not heavy, and often times, very fascinating. I would highly recommend doing the readings (even if just skimming the ones you don't get to) because it makes the class discussion much more engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course! This was by far my favorite class this semester - Ivano is funny and relaxed, and you will learn a lot about the history of reproductive rights and the treatment of sexuality. Its kind of obvious, but class is infinitely more enjoyable when you've done all the reading. These are fascinating, kind of wild articles, and if you read them you WILL have opinions on them. I would not take this course if you are aiming to get by on skimming every reading; that will fly for a few classes, but ultimately you need to do the readings so that you can write the required 6 reading responses and also to fully enjoy the class. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Before I took this course, I had little exposure to the subject matter, but I was pleasantly surprised by how interesting the subjects we covered were and how engaging the course as a whole was. I think any student would enjoy this course. "
