Overall, though, I wish I personally had had a more solid grounding in linear algebra and general statistics, so I could have gotten much more out of this course. ",

A few classes after the midterm, however, it was harder for me to follow a story-line concerning the material we were covering, which in turn made it more difficult for me to understand the material. It seemed like we were jumping from topic to topic, and it was difficult for me to find the relationship among all the material we were learning. ",

Also, the discussion on Piazza is super helpful. It's a bit hard for me to come up with further suggestions... maybe making the preliminary slides as close to the final version as possible (except the whiteboard writing part) will help the students who use laptops to take notes (like me) better organize their notes, so that they can write on the preliminary version and there's no need to transfer to the final version with added slides after class.

            "\u00a0As difficult as I found this class, I enjoyed it and how it was taught. My only real point of comparison for it is with my undergraduate linear models experience at Berkeley, and that course, in addition to the theory, offered many opportunities to apply what we learned to real data sets. This course was decidedly theoretical, and although I greatly appreciated the chance to learn this much valuable, foundational theory, some applications might have proven a nice enrichment. ",
