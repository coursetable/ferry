The most obvious improvement that could be made is to either make the lectures contain material that will be addressed on the homework, or alter the homework to match the lectures. ",

You can submit the problem sets as many times as you would like until you get all of the questions correct and this is particularly helpful because often times the problem sets took an enormous amount of time. The information discussed in class was unrelated to the questions asked on the problem sets, so the students were often left having very little idea of how to do the questions on the problem sets. Stemming from this, I think that a big weakness of the course was the way in which the lectures were run. I wish that we had discussed problems and formulas to use that would could then reinforce and apply when we were doing our problem sets and homework. Instead, the information discussed in class was incredibly complex and almost entirely unrelated to the types of questions and problems asked on the problem sets and exams. ",

He speaks so softly and in such a monotone way that it is impossible to stay focused on his lectures. The class itself is unorganized and I often had no idea what was going on. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciate that this class was geared towards students with little to no math experience. However, it was poorly taught and was more about memorization than learning. I never understood what was happening in the class or the nuts and bolts behind what we were learning. I memorized material and got through the course okay, but it wasn't geared toward my learning at all. ",

However, the second half of the semester, which focussed exclusively on student presentations, really sagged. I would have preferred a slightly more rigorous and structured second half of the semester that mirrored the organization of the first half of the semester.

            "\u00a0No. It was an absolute disaster. In the end, the class is an easy A, but it will give you many headaches along the way. ",
            "\u00a0Hahaha ",
            "\u00a0yes!!! especially if you are bad at math. ",
            "\u00a0Take it if you need a QR credit. The lectures are a bore, but the term project is quite enjoyable and the workload isn't significant. ",
            "\u00a0If you're looking for a gut, this is it assuming they let it run again. The psets took, on average, 10 minutes, and we only had two after spring break. They could be resubmitted over and over up until the deadline, and you could check whether you'd gotten the right answer. Both the midterm and the final were just the questions from the midterm with different numbers, and they were open book/notes/internet. Truly a joke. The only thing you could maybe consider work for the course was the group presentation, which was the normal amount of work for a group presentation. If you take this class with a half-competent group of friends, you're guaranteed an easy A. ",
            "\u00a0You're stupid if you don't take this amazing course.  Easy a while learning math. And prof coifman is so funny and cute. TAs are helpful too. The finals are online. ",
            "\u00a0If you want the gutiest gut, yeah take this class. But honestly don't waste your time or money. ",
            "\u00a0No - only if u need a QR credit and/or a relatively easy A (not completely a gut though; you definitely have to put in some work, and make sure you are prepared for the midterm and final, both of which are open note). ",
            "\u00a0Yes, everyone who can should take this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0I might recommend this course to another students. It's an accessible and straightforward QR. However, I think there are probably courses with a similar workload but with an opportunity to learn more. ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely- if they are seriously interested in the course and are not taking it for a Qr ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. It is a great QR and the professor is very nice and understanding as well as the TAs. ",
            "\u00a0If you need a qr and you hate math, you NEED to take this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah. If it's offered by The CoifMan again, how could you not? Brilliant class, you'll get everything out of it that you need for minimal workload. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definingood for non math people looking for a QR credit! ",
            "\u00a0Yes if they need a math course that will be more legible than others. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Take it absolutely. Great class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you're not good at QR courses, you should take this course. ",
            "\u00a0I would.  This class was a good class which was actually interesting.  It wasnt too challenging but it made you learn a lot about stats and networks. ",
            "\u00a0Yes for beginners ",
            "\u00a0I probably wouldn't for many of the reasons I gave above. I feel like it became a burden for me to complete p sets and do the final project and it was a burden that wasn't worth it because I genuinely don't feel like I learned anything. I would tell my friend to take a different QR if that is the type of credit they're searching for. ",
            "\u00a0Take it if you want a little broad overview of math and to do the project. It's more work than some of the reviews say so be warned that you will have to put in a little effort. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think it was an interesting class and a good way to get a QR credit. Lectures could be kind of confusing at times, but if you go to office hours the parts are pretty easy. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. THE BIGGEST GUT AT YALE. You absolutely NEED to take this class, it's not even a question. You will do 0 work and are basically guaranteed an A. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, a great class for anyone. Very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, take it! You actually learn really useful math in this class AND you get a QR credit. It wasn't as easy as I expected, but that's because Prof Coifman actually wants you to learn the materials. With that being said, if you do the p-sets and understand them (which take less than 2 hours a week), this class is 100% doable. ",
            "\u00a0If you truly struggle with math, this is the class for you! ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this class to anyone with an interest in pattern and probability. It is elegantly taught by Prof Coifman, he makes complex topics very interesting and easy to grasp ",
            "\u00a0Interesting perspective on statistics. ",
            "\u00a0Only if they need to take it for their major and enjoy mathematics ",
            "\u00a0TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T DO MATH. ",
            "\u00a0YES! AN excellent QR credit. A class I will never forget at Yale ",
