            "\u00a0This course taught me how to engage more fully with the text - both poetry and prose - and look for a deeper meaning in the words of the writer. It is designed to help develop your creativity and critical thinking while looking at works that cross a wide variety of themes and genres. I feel that after taking this course I have the ability to read an Emily Dickinson or Walt Whitman poem and actually have some idea of what it is talking about, and I've developed a more wholistic view of not only the literary context of the time period we studied, but also how the works relate to the historical context they are set in. ",
            "\u00a0Developing transitions between paragraphs\r\nOutlining a paper ",
            "\u00a0My ability to write and engage with literary criticism improved, and I really enjoyed reading a breadth of American literature while simultaneously focusing on my writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0I became better at close reading literature and writing analyses. I learned a lot from the professor and my classmates. ",
            "\u00a0English 127 continues to develop students' close reading as well as their analytical writing. For writing, one point of emphasis was transitioning between paragraphs - a focus especially helpful for improving the development of longer analytical pieces. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the Walt Whitmans self-portrait in lieu of an author name, how Moby Dick has been interpreted over time, and the context of the murder of Emmett Till within Gwendolyn Brooks poem about the Bronzeville Mother. I used more transitions to help my essays flow. I looked for ways to incorporate personally striking text into arguments that are more relevant to the audience and the author. "

            "\u00a0The setup for the first two papers was good, but because we read a lot before the final paper, it was harder to write the third and recall everything that was on it. ",
            "\u00a0One of the strengths of English 127 was its variety in readings. We read everything from poetry to short stories to novels, from Walt Whitman to Harlem Renaissance authors. Such variety helped to strengthen us holistically as readers because we had to constantly adapt to new voices and styles. ",
            "\u00a0I loved all the classes held at the Beinecke, the literary criticism within the Norton Critical Editions of Moby Dick and The Autobiography of an Ex-Coloured Man, and videos of Star Trek and Bill Callahans America! I benefited from knowing that scholars were extremely interested in various editions of Moby Dick and learned about the history behind the James Weldon Johnson collection. There was so much potential in having access to the James Weldon Johnson collection at our fingertips, especially for analysis of The Autobiography of An Ex-Colored Man. Because of the extensive notes and criticism available in the Norton Critical Editions, I felt that I could engage with a group of scholars on my subject, and that I was covering further ground. Something I would suggest is to coordinate the Beinecke visits more with opportune points during the discussion of the book, for example at the beginning of a book, or during the first few sessions. That way the following discussions could incorporate what was learned at the Beinecke. "

            "\u00a0Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to any student, even if you are not a humanities/English major. It isn't an easy course - you have to think critically and creatively about the works - but the discussions are very engaging, enjoyable, and  intellectually rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. The chosen works were extremely interesting to read and write about, and my writing developed very well. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. It gives a comprehensive span of American literature, and incorporates literature that is not always considered mainstream, but that was vital to the country's cultural development. ",
            "\u00a0If you'e interesting in analyzing literature, go for it. It's definitely a solid course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. The variety of readings means that each student will (I think) find at least one reading that they really enjoy. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student! I just switched to the English major this semester as a junior, and the style of literary criticism takes some time to get used to, but this course really wonderfully acknowledges that there is a lot of research to be done (even bringing in a Yale librarian to help with jumpstarting student research), and it helps accelerate student research by providing a lot of literary criticism smack dab in the required texts and also through Beinecke visits. Professor Glaser met with each of us before each assignment, and really went through the draft, sentence by sentence (or brainstorm, idea by idea). Definitely take this class!!! You will improve in your writing, the flow of your arguments, and the way of your thinking! "
