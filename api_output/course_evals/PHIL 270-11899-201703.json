            "\u00a0We focused on modern issues in epistemology and jumped right into the midst of contemporary philosophical debates.  Epistemology is a very interesting subject in its own right, and we also developed general critical-thinking philosophical skills. ",
            "\u00a0- Epistemological theories.\r\n- Skills of philosophical paper writing.\r\n- How philosophy can be applicable in real life (e.g. disagreements) rather than just a purely thought experiment. ",
            "\u00a0I feel like this course really made me reflect on how I approach knowing or justifying beliefs in a way that is applicable to basically every course. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me develop a sense of why knowledge is important, and the different nuances it has. I have not taken a philosophy course before, and found that philosophy is different to many other fields. It requires thinking about matters in ways that I have never considered, and synthesizing others' views in relation to my own. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt to closely scrutinize academic philosophy papers, engage with their ideas, and develop my own responses to the topics they dealt with. The papers and weekly reading response assignments require you to think not just critically, but also independently and creatively.\r\n\r\nSkills aside, the very issue the course deals with - that of knowledge - is immensely fascinating and permeates virtually every other discipline as well as our daily lives. The course involves readings about skepticism, our attempts to dig our way out of it, Gettier problems, theories of knowledge, and the epistemology of disagreement. The course will probably not give you any definite answers, but you will definitely leave with some profound and occasionally mind-blowing insights about the nature of the beliefs we hold. ",
            "\u00a0Very good introduction to issues in epistemology. ",
            "\u00a0This course offers an introduction to several important epistemic debates. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about epistemology, including various theories and important results from both the past and recent times. Taking this class and learning epistemology has helped me become more reflective in my everyday life. Besides the content, the course really helped me consider various arguments and develop my own arguments more analytically. ",
            "\u00a0An introduction to epistemology\r\nWays of thinking about knowledge and beliefs etc. \r\nNew insights into reasoning about everyday problems "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The main strength of this class is that the material is so damn cool.   In what other class would you talk about whether or not you can trust your senses and how you should respond to peer disagreement?  The last few classes (which pull together a lot of material) are especially eye-opening.  The weekly reading responses seem like they would be a burden, but they actually provide a good opportunity to engage with the readings before class discussion. ",
            "\u00a0- Good and interesting content.\r\n- Personally, I believe philosophy to be a content subject, so I would have liked to read summaries of the content rather than original papers, some of which were very verbose, which made me feel I did not glean sufficient insights from them for them to be worth the read. Nevertheless, I guess there is also the factor that I never did read a lot before college, so this might bias my evaluation in that I disliked the amount of readings (which is still less than other similar courses, I believe). ",
            "\u00a0I think that more class interaction would have made the class more engaging. The coursework was relatively straightforward, but the way it was presented was not the greatest. I felt like my seminar was being taught like a lecture. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the focus on papers written in the last 100 years. The class considered arguments instead of possible interpretations of extremely confusing phil. Professor Greco gave clear summaries of what we read before we considered responses which I also found helpful. ",
            "\u00a0One strength of the course is that it presented a varied literature of epistemology papers and helped developed critical thinking skills. I think the reading assignments and responses were very good and helpful, as they formed the backbone of the course.\r\n\r\nA weakness of the course, however, is that I felt that the discussions in classes only really repeated the readings. While going over the readings is helpful, I feel that the classes could afford to be faster so that the discussion can move onto additional insights. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked this course. The material is interesting, up-to-date and well-organized. The discussions in the lectures were inspiring. I wish this course could be offered as a seminar so that there's more interaction between the students. "

            "\u00a0Take this course even if you're not a philosophy major!  The workload is honestly pretty light, but you will leave this class with a different life outlook. ",
            "\u00a0- Yes but you must be genuinely interested in epistemology. Else you would get bored really easily and begin wondering what's the point of all this philosophical discussion. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. The readings are not too long but were always interesting and thoughtful. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend the course if you're really interested in Epistemological philosophy/if you need the requirement. Professor Greco is funny and engaging. Be warned -- the class (at least this semester) meets 2x a week at 9am, and it's a bit difficult to think about anything, let alone complex philosophical questions, first thing in the morning. ",
            "\u00a0If you've ever wondered about the nature of what we learn or believe, then you will probably find this course extremely interesting. The weekly readings and class discussions will give you new insights about knowledge and certainty - whether it's in science, politics or daily sensory experiences, as well as new tools to think about these topics.\r\n\r\nProf Greco is a great lecturer, and is able to illustrate complex abstract ideas with intuitive examples, or respond convincingly to even the most difficult or puzzling challenges you might pose. The class is a great mix of majors - examples raised during discussions raise from math proofs to the law, and is generally enjoyable.\r\n\r\nIf you're prepared to put in the work (be warned, As are extremely difficult to get), and are looking for a non 'wishy-washy' humanities course, then certainly take it. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course with Professor Greco! If you enjoy abstract questions surrounding knowledge and what we can know you will love this class. If you think philosophy can be frustratingly abstract and self-indulgent, you will feel that way about this course. I loved it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to any student interested in epistemology. ",
            "\u00a0I recommend this course. It is thought provoking and challenges you to ponder more over everything. The class has both theoretical and practical implications for everyday life. ",
            "\u00a0This is a really interesting class that will make you think twice about everyday notions such as knowledge, belief, or justification. The material would be interesting to someone who enjoys thinking in depth about these concepts in philosophical terms, and may seem boring and meaningless to someone otherwise. I enjoyed it a lot though. The professor is inspiring and helpful too. "
