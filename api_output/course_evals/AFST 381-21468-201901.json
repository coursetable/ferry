            "\u00a0I learned about the history of African politics and how to analyze the level of democracy within countries through the last assignment. I had never taken a class on Africa before and this class was a great intro to many of the relevant forces that have shaped African governments. ",
            "\u00a0Broad overview of politics and government history of Africa, particularly from the ~1950s onwards. ",
            "\u00a0This was a very interesting course and I learnt how complex African Politics can be. ",
            "\u00a0I was able to understand the dynamics of African politics from a historical perspective. I was also able to develop a method of thinking that critically examined political systems on the continent. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about governance in Africa, which isn't discussed in many classes at Yale unfortunately. I also got to learn about some basic mechanisms of democracy from a political science perspective ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about Africas politcal history. ",
            "\u00a0Overview of history and politics in Africa ",
            "\u00a0how african governments function and the struggles they have endured ",
            "\u00a0This was a great survey course in the polisci department. Professor Baldwin taught us the basics of African politics in the 20th century, and did so with uncommon clarity and honesty.\r\n\r\nYou'll leave the class with a decent understanding of the context of African politics. You might understand current events better because of this class. It's worth taking, in my opinion. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a much enhanced understanding of African societies, economies, history, and government and current issues. ",
            "\u00a0More complete understanding of issues that are broadly experienced by the sub-Saharan African continent, with a focus on issues that are political and economic in nature. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: the assignments are relevant and fairly fun to complete, the lectures are informative, and Prof. Baldwin is a fun and engaging teacher. \r\nWeakness: students are sometimes not especially engaged in the lectures, but those who are get a lot from Prof. Baldwin's teaching. ",
            "\u00a0All of the assignments were very easy except for the exam. The final exam (worth 25%) had ID terms that even included authors, which felt silly because we are never going to need to be able to identify what authors wrote which articles about Africa for anything in our lives. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Katherine is a fantastic professor and Constantine is a fantastic TA. Assignments are generally creative and a good break from normal classwork while still being productive and learning experiences.\r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Personally didn't enjoy some of the assignments (colonial legacies art poster), but I can see why others did, so that's an individual thing. ",
            "\u00a0I think the class gives a really good overview of African politics while zooming in on a few countries. However, some current events other than the Sudan conflict could provide better content. I am also unsure if creating a poster about pre-colonial societies is the best way to learn about gov & politics in Africa. I also think assignments could have better rubrics in order to avoid confusion. ",
            "\u00a0The essay requirements were confusing and the professor's expectations often did not match the information given to us in the syllabus' description. In future, it would be useful to have more information about what is expected before each assignment. ",
            "\u00a0The structure of the course was great. Professor Baldwin gave very interesting and engaging assignments that I always looked forward to. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are the variety of projects that we did throughout the semester because it was interesting to learn different aspects of African politics outside of a lecture format. Weakness would be receiving more detailed guidance on the projects. ",
            "\u00a0The course is great. There is a lot of good structure to the course and the work is often entertaining.  \r\n\r\nIts also way different than a lot of other classes Ive taken, which made it pretty interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I wish the course went more in-depth and focused on a few specific countries rather than try to cover general trends of the whole continent. I felt like I learnt the most when I did the projects where we were able to do research on one country. I also wish we could have prepared more for the final debate. I felt like I did not really know what I was doing and needed more information. The skype call was really helpful though. I also really appreciated the timing of the final. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were perfectly cogent, with main points emphasized and the logic behind them clearly presented. They were really nicely done. I have a few criticisms and suggestions, but do not let these detract from my good opinions of the course.\r\n\r\nIn regards to the course's substance, I'd recommend that Professor Baldwin spend a bit more time on the present. It seems that the only lectures that focused on the present were the China in Africa one and the South Sudanese peace simulation.\r\n\r\nI also thought that the grading scheme on the first presentation on an art gallery object needs to be redone. I assumed that the poster should contain only the main points, the 30,000 foot view, and that our oral presentations of the poster should fill in the gaps. However, the grading scheme is such that the poster comprises almost all of the points and the oral presentation very little. This creates a perverse incentive for students to fill their posters with microscopic text in an effort to get as much information graded as possible. I should have picked up on this based on the grading rubric released before the poster was due, but I allowed my intuition of what a poster should be lead me astray.\r\n\r\nI also thought the timing of the biography proposal was poor. It was effectively left for spring break, which meant that we could not get feedback on it as we were working on it, and it was due the day after break. True, it might have been released a little before break began, but given the hectic academic schedules of students during midterm season, the proposal was basically left for us to do over break.\r\n\r\nOn the first day of lecture, Professor Baldwin told us that this class would have a little more work and be more interactive than a typical polisci lecture. She explained that the workload would not be substantially different, but exceed that of the typical polisci course by one assignment. And she was exactly right. It felt like a little more work but not too much. However, I think that the course did have one project too many, and I recommend that the poster be cut and the biography proposal moved earlier so as to fill the gap and give us more time to work on it. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were really well crafted and engaging, and the lecture slides did a great job conveying information that you could refer back to. \r\n\r\nWhile I appreciated how interactive the course was, I wish that we had gotten to choose our own groups for the colonial artifacts posters. Being assigned groups for a group project felt very reminiscent of high-school. A lot of people gamed the system by ranking the same artifacts as their top choices so that they could be grouped with their friends anyways. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest weakness of this course is that the assignments do not correlate to the skills learnt in the class, and neither does the way that the assignments are graded. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning more about African politics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0It depends what you're looking for - if you're looking for a very easy class, then yes. If you're looking to actually learn a lot about Africa, then no. However, be sure to study a lot for the final exam. ",
            "\u00a0I would. Baldwin is a great professor -- a slightly above average lecturer, friendly grader, kind person who cares so so much about students learning and engaging with the material. Content is very interesting as well, and the class has points where it is quite fun. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but needs improvement in assignment descriptions. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Take this class if you're interested in African Politics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would, especially to a student who has only been exposed to Western political systems because it enables you to develop a different perspective of international politics as a whole. ",
            "\u00a0Id definitely recommend to another student. ",
            "\u00a0It is a good overview of important concepts, but I feel like I still don't know enough about important events such as wars, disasters, etc on the continent. ",
            "\u00a0new perspective on africa, good ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course. You'll walk away with a solid foundation of the context (but maybe not current events) of African politics. Getting an A is achievable but will require more work and speaking with the professor and especially the TA for feedback. ",
            "\u00a0Yes very interesting and informative ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course as a survey class of African Politics and African History. It is a great way to supplement learning in an area that is not often represented in the Yale College Course Catalog. Professor and TA were both very nice and helpful! ",
            "\u00a0A really awesome class! Not a gut--you have to go to lectures, do multiple papers/projects, but not a super tough class either. \r\n\r\nI think everyone should take this class. Africa is barely covered at all in American school systems, so I think this class is super valuable in increasing awareness of African socioeconomic and political dynamics and current issues. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, Professor Baldwin is really excellent and really passionate about what she does. However I think that there was a disconnect between this passion and the rubric-esque manner in which the assignments were graded (which was particularly annoying when the factors that caused you to be marked down were not made known anywhere before grading the assignments in this manner).
