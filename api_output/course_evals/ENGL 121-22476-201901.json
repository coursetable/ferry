            "\u00a0I learned sooo much from this class. I felt as if my writing skills improved a lot and I learned so many interesting things about medicine and medical writing. Definitely one of my favorite classes at Yale! ",
            "\u00a0Reading scientific papers, writing for audiences of different levels, approaching language with precision, loving and being kind through writing ",
            "\u00a0I developed a lot in terms of writing simply but powerfully. With intricate details to make my writing come more alive. ",
            "\u00a0My writing became much tighter and cogent after this course, and along the way I learned many insights about the medical field through personal accounts and a lot of reading. ",
            "\u00a0Writing scientifically for different audiences (scientists, clinicians, patients, general public, students, etc.); writing more clearly and concisely; writing about medicine/ health in different registers and styles, including opinion writing, news stories, patient stories, plays, book reviews, and longform. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt about the importance of word choice and how it contributes to the tone and style you are trying to establish in a piece and how word choice differs depending on your audience. I also learnt that fluff is not necessary for good writing- short punchy sentences without clutter are a much better option. I also learnt how to keep a reader engaged by dispersing gold coins to give the reader a break in the midst of heavy science. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me practice in journalistic writing (short pieces, a profile and a long-form final) as well as other styles of writing (memos, emails, tweets). I also became more conscious of my own writing  what kinds of metaphors I use, when I rely on cliches  through reading a LOT of others' work. ",
            "\u00a0I developed an ability to communicate clearly about science and integrate human stories in medical writing. I also improved my general writing skills by learning to be thoughtful about word choice and sentence structure. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about medical journalism, and the class also helped improve my creative writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0Mostly how to write longform science/personal interest stories and a little bit about interviewing. "

            "\u00a0The strength of the class was definitely Professor Epstein. She really pushes you to be a better writer and gives us very interesting assignments such as writing about pathology lab specimens as if they were a piece of art. I would say the very high workload of the class is the weakness. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Epstein is extremely passionate about teaching, she provides constructive feedback, classmates are supportive. Some weakness is people come from such different backgrounds of writing. Some terms/styles of writing might be foreign. Perhaps more background reading. ",
            "\u00a0Strength is that Professor Epstein was absolutely amazing. She is very caring, understanding, considerate, and willing to help you improve. We also had great guest speakers and class trips that were very insightful and engaging. One weakness is the class went very quickly, and a lot was packed in. The fast pace was a little overwhelming at times. ",
            "\u00a0This course's strength lies in preparing its students for a different styles of writing, and improving the structure and flow of ideas. All the readings were also very interesting and relevant! Although I do wish they were more integrated into the curriculum and we spent more time discussing them. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Diversity in styles of writing, class activities and assignments, and assigned readings; excellent feedback and opportunity for improvement; high level of engagement during class with varied activities, guest speakers, and trips\r\nWeaknesses: ",
            "\u00a0strengths: passionate and funny professor, interesting readings, good paper topics, meeting patients and doctors, visiting the path lab and cushing center\r\nweakness: too much busy work took away from the class, having constant reading assignments/blog posts/little assignments on top of papers was too much, couldn't enjoy the work I otherwise would if there had been less of it ",
            "\u00a0I think there are too many 30-minute assignments (emails, tweets, reading responses). I don't think they helped me and at the very most showed the professor I was doing the readings, though I think that should be assumed by college. The major assignments were all worthwhile, but I felt like some of the shorter assignments amounted to rather mindless tasks. ",
            "\u00a0This course is strong because it makes students expand their range of thinking and writing, with many field trips to medical sites and assignments of varying length and genre. One weakness was that there was a lot of potential for a seminar setting with participation from the class, but many students seemed reluctant to participate. ",
            "\u00a0The course succeeds in looking closely at various aspects of writing, and teaching students how to apply them in our own writing. However, the course was quite disorganized. It felt as though we jumped around to various random topics in whatever order they stuck Profs interest. It never felt like we wrapped up on any topic. There were many many short assignments that seem as though they were assigned off the cuff- little to no direction, sometimes seemingly unrelated to the class, unclear format and deadlines.  \r\nAdditionally, it often felt as though we were simply learning about and being graded what prof was good writing or writing she enjoyed or would write herself, as opposed to suggestions on how to simply become better writers.

            "\u00a0Yes! Definitely! ",
            "\u00a0Definitely recommend if interested in science and writing, it's not easy, but the challenge is so worth it ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It is a great class with an amazing professor and you learn so much from it! ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! It can be a bit challenging to properly fine tune your writing at first, but I found it to be  unique and rewarding academic experience. Having the opportunity to interview people for the final paper and other assignments is something I've never done in other classes, which was also a highlight of this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. It is a great way to become familiar with a variety of writing styles and forms, all unified by their topic of medicine. I enjoyed the readings and writing assignments, and I looked forward to class. All semester, I was telling friends about the cool trips we took and speakers we had. Professor Epstein is also an engaging professor and provides helpful feedback. I feel that my writing improved a lot after taking this course. ",
            "\u00a0This is an amazing course--my favorite so far at Yale. The readings are interesting, the assignments are fun and challenging, and the overall material makes you want to write about medicine for the rest of your life! ",
            "\u00a0If you want to write, but you're afraid to dive right into an English class because you're a STEM major who isn't sure if they are good at writing (especially premeds!), this is a great class to test that out while also reading & writing things about topics that interest you. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to someone looking to improve their writing and communication skills and who has an interest in science and medicine. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to improve your writing and are interested in the kinds of pieces that weave science with narrative, take this course! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class for anyone interested in medicine. The class incorporates very interesting science articles and assignments that help explain future assignments but also help the students learn about medicine. I really enjoyed this class as a pre-med student, and highly recommend this class to any pre-med looking for a writing credit. "
