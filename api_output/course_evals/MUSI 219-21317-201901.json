Although finding the motivation to get out bed and sing whole tone scales at 9:30 in the morning can be difficult, the classroom environment is laid-back and friendly and you'll learn and develop some useful skills along the way. The required weekly keyboard labs can be fun if you go in with a good partner, especially since you'll be able to decide what kind of material/skills you want to work on for the semester. ",
