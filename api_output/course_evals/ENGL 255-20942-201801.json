            "\u00a0The ability to identify and evaluate (1) the logic and premises in a humor piece and (2) a humor piece's texture/tone/character/narrative. Also, learning how to produce a large bulk of writing on a daily/weekly basis, which is essential to write humor (and to write much else). ",
            "\u00a0Useful tools for writing humorous essays. ",
            "\u00a0My favorite class at Yale. Hands down. You learn the most important skill in all of writing: how to not bore the sh*t out of people and consider your audience. I went from being afraid to write anything to have too many jokes and ideas I couldn't fit them in the word count. Further, Ryan has an incredible ability to improve your work. This sounds simple, but he's the best I've ever seen at it. He won't just tell you what he doesn't like, as most English professors do, he'll tell you what you can actually do better--and here's the weird part--it actually GETS BETTER. It's a lot of work  (about an essay per week, and not easy essays), but so worthwhile. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to craft a humor piece-- from analyzing excellent texts to creating my own. ",
            "\u00a0Through taking this course, I learned how to write a comedic essay in various formats. More specifically, I learned about comedic structure and how to write an essay with emphasis on tone, character and narrative. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The material is not only excellent but Professor Wepler is also a highly efficient instructor. My only suggestion for improvement would be to offer fewer student-led/student-driven courses. I am not sure if we needed all of the text presentations that we had and often it was more valuable to learn from texts that Professor Wepler had selected himself and curated a lesson plan around. ",
            "\u00a0This course provides a great insight into the process of writing humor essays. It would be more far engaging if we studied other styles of humor, like sketch and stand-up, at least for a couple of week. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: gave me the course to eek out my own voice. I learned how to consider my audience and entertain at the word level--a valuable skill for all writers. The readings were not too lengthy and provided great fodder for discussion, not just in the class in which we discussed them--but sometimes months later (\"the condom piece\", \"the burrito piece\", \"that onion piece\"). I loved the student-led classes, I thought they were very fair. The workshops helped a ton too. Most of all, the one-on-one conferences were often revolutionary.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:  The humor challenges especially wore me out, but unfortunately they helped me be a better write so we can't cut those. By the nature of the class, it has to be a lot of work. At least Ryan was really understanding about the lateness of things. ",
            "\u00a0I feel a bit unsure about the student text presentations. I think they're useful, but perhaps would be more useful if organized according to skill category. What made them so difficult to follow is how each lesson in a given day could be on a range of topics. Instead, he should ask people to submit their chosen text at the beginning of the semester, along with a brief description of the topics discussed-- *then* break up the text presentations according to topic/method/etc.\r\nBut I love, love how Prof. Wepler so easily breaks down the mechanisms of humor writing. That systematic analysis is SO helpful for crafting your own pieces. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course lies in Ryan's incredible dedication to the course and to his students. The only weakness or area for improvement I can think of would be the range of comedic pieces we study. I think it would have been enjoyable to also look at sketch comedy, stand up comedy etc--rather than just comedic essays. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this class without hesitation. Professor Wepler is the perfect instructor for this course--he has a clear understanding of what makes a humor piece work and a clear understanding of how to teach in an efficient way that pushes you toward those learning outcomes. The very idea of dividing up a humor piece into its premise/texture/tone/character/logical incongruities/verb-noun replacements etc will help me write across a range of disciplines. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Know that you will write bad pieces and some really funny ones, and  you will get used to reading bad and good pieces as well. ",
            "\u00a0100%. Amazing and fun class - enjoyable every time. ",
            "\u00a0This was one of my favorite courses I have taken at Yale. I absolutely recommend it to everyone! ",
            "\u00a0Heck yes! This class was the hug of death in terms of workload, but by FAR my favorite class at Yale. Ryan is also the most caring and helpful professor I've ever had. The amount of times he's squeezed me and my classmates in for last-minute conferences is unreal. The best classes demand a lot of the students and a lot of the teacher, and this class definitely does that. This is my fourth WR credit, and by far the most well-earned. ",
            "\u00a0YES. For sure. I'm not even really that funny / into comedy-- but this is really a class you need to take, no matter the kind of writing you practice. Prof. Wepler is perhaps one of the most effective creative writing teachers in how he systematically breaks down texts and helps you apply that analysis to your own writing process. His humor challenges and language challenges are part of the magic: they're really great at helping you focus on the line-level and word-level changes you can make to your writing. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to any student interested in writing comedy (even those with no prior experience!) "
