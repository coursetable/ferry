            "\u00a0This course taught me how to read. I used to prefer skim only focus on interesting plots when I was reading. However, Professor Williams taught us to be  \"paranoid\" while reading. In the class, we questioned every single word and dug down, trying to find why the author uses the specific word and what it really means. I found this way of reading can help me learn much more than only skiming. "

            "\u00a0The readings are fascinating and challenging, and the teacher is very humorous.\r\nMore feedback and chances for us to practice our own analysis may make the course even better. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very amazing. Before we read every book, we learned the background knowledge, including the authors' life, the writing styles of the authors, the period when the books were wrote. What's more, we watched movies and looked pictures which relate to the books. Different dimensional materials helped me to learn deeper of the books. "
