            "\u00a0The readings gave me more insight into new types of racism, and the latest trends in assimilation, interracial marriage, etc. There was a good combo of classic theories and emerging trends ",
            "\u00a0None - this is one of the worst classes I've ever taken. ",
            "\u00a0Some basic knowledge about race, ethnicity, segregation, and racial identity. ",
            "\u00a0Introduction to reading sociological research papers, a deeper understanding of U.S. immigration policy as well as race relations. ",
            "\u00a0Compared to (the very few) other sociology courses I've taken, this class proved fairly numbers-focused without crossing the line into being a QR credit.  Much of the readings consisted of academic articles that featured empirical analysis, and the other portion consisted of literature reviews.  It's of course beneficial to become familiar with empirically-focused academic papers, especially when one has little prior background in statistics, and the literature reviews will prove helpful for the final essay, which is meant to resemble one. ",
            "\u00a0Learned plenty of mind-boggling information about race, ethnicity, immigration, and history. This course was an excellent introduction to sociological theory which I had not previously been exposed to. At the end of the day, I believe this course really improved upon my understanding of the social processes which drive society. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about certain race issues and I feel like I got a solid foundation in understanding what the field of sociology is. I learned how to write literature reviews and analyze data within sociological articles/reports. ",
            "\u00a0Basics of race, ethnicity, and immigration in US society. Assignments consisted of short literature reviews, which were easy and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0A much better understanding of the Asian American experience in the United States as it pertains to immigration. ",
            "\u00a0Got a good overview of sociological concepts, data, and research centered around race, ethnicity, and immigration. Learned general patterns and trends to help inform an overall understanding of American society today. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write literature reviews. I also developed a more cohesive understanding of the history and theory behind race and ethnicity, alongside relevant studies that examine these topics. ",
            "\u00a0Little to nothing that would not have come up on googles first page ",
            "\u00a0We learned to analyze lot of sociology literature and determine the limitations of many studies. ",
            "\u00a0Very little. I knew a lot of the information. ",
            "\u00a0This class helped me develop a new writing style that I had not tried before. I am now able to write a literature review and read a research paper effectively. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about trends in demography, race, ethnicity, and immigration. I learned lots of valuable information as well as the ability to read and interpret sociological studies. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the racial tensions in the US and the deeptooted issues related to race and immigration. It opened my eyes to some of the cruelties that take place in this nation. ",
            "\u00a0Most important topics over which I now have much more concrete knowledge: immigration enforcement, trends in deportations, wealth AND income inequality based on race, the social construction of race, basic structure of a sociology report (through reading many of them). ",
            "\u00a0It was interesting because I feel like I gathered the facts and stats to articulate the lived experienced I've had. I know Latinos achieve higher education at lower rates than other minorities, that black men are incarcerated at ridiculous rates and that interracial dating is rough for black women and asians. I knew these things, but now I know how they are studied and quantified. ",
            "\u00a0Learned how to better read graphs and data, and evaluate the results. Also learned a lot of race relations in the US ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot more the history of race relations in the US and the origins of many pervasive stereotypes. I also learned a lot about sociology and how to write reviews. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about general patterns of historical immigration to the United States, as well as racial patterns currently in our country. I found it interesting to learn about multiethnic identity, interracial dating, and theories of assimilation. I gained the skill of being able to conduct my own research using academic articles and books. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of the numerical and statistical background to sociological trends and studies in this class. ",

            "\u00a0I learned critical analysis skills as well as how to interpret sociology analytic reviews. I discovered percentages and data about race relations and educational opportunity in the US that were surprising to me. I also learned how institutional racism operates within different systems. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: I think that almost everything I learned in this class came from the readings. The readings were interesting--good because you had to do them for exam\r\n\r\nWeakness: Lectures were boring and uninformative, at best. I feel like nothing new was learned through the lectures. Nonetheless, Grace Kao would often pull up stats that should have been obvious (Yale's average income is high, Trump voters think Whites are most oppressed), many Whites have negative stereotypes of others, etc) This really begs the question who this class was meant for: the privileged White student who has never been exposed to the racism/ classism. I, and many of my friends, would have skipped this class every time if they didn't take attendance. There was also a lot of busy work--nearly every review essay is. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses - the class was poorly formatted, the material was very basic, and the exams were designed in a way to be unnecessarily tricky. The material was not exciting or engaging at all, which is really sad given how much scope this class could have covered. A lot of the time was spent watching videos or movies, and the test was on very arbitrary material. Would not recommend this class. ",
            "\u00a0The actual course material and topics were very interesting which is why I chose to take the class, but the lectures were not very engaging and section was not that helpful either. For the written assignments, we didn't get that much clear instruction in the beginning so we had to figure it out ourselves along the way. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very effective in familiarizing students with empirical papers and literature reviews and provided a good expos of quantitative sociology.  I also appreciate the fact that we were able to learn of several statistical trends in U.S. ethnic and racial demographics and their intersections with other demographics that often go under-reported or misinterpreted (e.g. the fact that 'Asian-American' is used as a monolithic pan-ethnic term that brushes over the vast differences in wealth and education among and within different Asian ethnicities).  It's here where I think the class could have been expanded, and where the class would benefit from providing more room to discuss contemporary issues related to the material, perhaps allowing for debate among students as to what kinds of policies or changes must take place to solve the problems that the course analyzes. ",
            "\u00a0This course was excellent for several reasons. \r\n1. Extremely interesting information was provided each lecture\r\n2. No information seemed unnecessary or irrelevant\r\n3. Was absolutely enlightening\r\n4. Dr. Kao.\r\n\r\nI cannot identify a true \"weakness,\" although I would suggest adding a bit more structure to the course to make sure people are doing the work. ",
            "\u00a0It's a slow-moving course, so some of the material can feel very obvious or redundant. ",
            "\u00a0This course had a lot of good content through its course material and assigned readings, and the assignments were all very good and relevant for an intro sociology course. I think that it could have been a lot better taught - a very large portion of class time was spent on watching videos or going over plain statistics, which could have been spent on getting deeper into the course material. Each topic is extremely broad and there could be a lot more to talk about. Class time is also spent on summarizing and going over the readings, which is also something that can be done on our own time. The readings and films should be used to supplement the course material, not be the course material. ",
            "\u00a0The material itself is fascinating if you're interested in the topics of the course. The actual class was a bit dry most days, as it heavily involved reviewing the content of readings we were expected to have already read. The larger size of the class also hindered discussion, and even the smaller section lacked meaningful discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Organization and literature was mediocre ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - it is very basic, so very accessible to people who have never given race, ethnicity, or immigration a thought. Reading the sociology studies was a nice way to familiarize myself with the field and how the sociological field operated. \r\nWeaknesses - we live in a world where it pretty impossible to ignore those topics, so the statistics that Professor Kao showed us were not that surprising. Lectures were boring and mostly just a summary of the readings, basic stats, or loosely related youtube videos--new perspectives weren't really added. Additionally you were just given a grade on reading responses with no feedback. ",
            "\u00a0It helps students who have no knowledge whatsoever of sociology. However, it presents the information with very little nuance or room for critique. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - very interesting material, interesting lectures\r\nWeaknesses - unclear expectations on assignments such as literature reviews ",
            "\u00a0The material was very interesting and I enjoyed the lectures. The discussion sections however were not helpful and there were no meaningful discussions of the required reading. ",
            "\u00a0Lecture is mostly a very surface summary of the readings... it does include some supplementary material, but I think the course would be stronger if the lectures really delved in on one reading every week. Alternatively, lecture should be optional, since it really did not help me and often felt like it would be better for me to just take that time to go back over readings myself. ",
            "\u00a0I think we could have had better discussion sections, it was hard to get people to talk. Maybe more documentary screenings? Things that are easy to engage with? ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: great content \r\nWeakness: lectures were usually not very engaging, and the sections werent helpful or productive ",
            "\u00a0This course covered a lot of the basics, much of which I was already familiar with as a socially conscious person in the US today so I wish we had gone more into depth with certain topics. ",
            "\u00a0Readings assigned were very interesting and I feel as if I learned a great deal from them. However, the lectures seemed a bit scattered and unstructured; we would often jump around between themes and topics within one lecture. Also, it would have been nice to learn about more modern theories, as many of the theories we learned about seemed outdated, and the Professor herself pointed out that they often blamed the victim or were deemed racist (e.g., culture of poverty, etc.). ",
            "\u00a0I found this course interesting day to day, but it lacked structure across the semester. At times it seemed that we were jumping between different societal issues without any overlying order. One week would be interracial marriage and the next would be the criminal justice system. While each was interesting on its own, I would have appreciated some more structure, perhaps more of an emphasis on chronology and the changes that each era brought to certain topics. We usually talked about one issue and then followed it through different time periods, and then started over with another topic.\r\n\r\nAlso I think there were too many readings. Reading three to four studies a week was a little difficult, especially the dense sociological studies. Maybe cutting them down to two or three would be better. Personally, I felt little motivation to do all the readings, first off because they were a lot, but also we didn't analyze them much in class or section. There was always a summary but never a discussion on the implications. ",
            "\u00a0I felt that the class was very engaging. The lectures were supplemented with examples, videos, and images that made everything clearer. I do think that the course could have been more in depth, though. Sometimes we had to rush through topics. This could be prevented by focusing in on specific things. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include engaging material, illustrated concepts clearly using videos, and relevant reading material. Improvements include making the material more personal because all of these topics are things that actively effect us and the way we perceive the world. Additionally I think students would benefit from deeper questions posed in lecture and to work on making comfortable space to share. I think that is why there was some hesitation to participate. "

            "\u00a0No ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to another student because again, I genuinely felt like I was wasting my time by going to class. Everything we learned was so obvious, and there was no further engagement with the student body. Maybe if this were a seminar, it would be a more interesting class. But I hated how we spent so much time just watching movies or videos - I also felt like going to section was a huge waste of time, and I was always so confused on what I needed to do for the assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Not personally. I know a lot of people enjoyed the class, but I did not find it as engaging and interesting as I expected a class about race to be. There are a lot of other similar options that I wish I had chosen instead. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but if you are looking for a typical ER&M class, this is not it. It is much more research-based and numbers-based. You won't be reading or talking about critical theory, you'll be memorizing statistics and talking about trends identified by researchers in sociology. ",
            "\u00a0yes, great course to cover a broad range of interesting topics ",
            "\u00a0In general, I would recommend this class to other students, especially if they wanted to introduce themselves to concrete data characterizing policies and structures that buttress white supremacy in the United States.  While further-along ER&M majors might find certain aspects of the class as repetitions of what they've already learned in other classes, it can still be helpful in being able to learn specific theories and methodologies, especially if such majors have an interest in sociology or quantitative study. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely would recommend this course to anyone else, mostly because it was a deeply interesting topic taught by an excellent professor. Also, for many people, these theories and statistics are completely foreign. However, understanding everything in this course seems necessary to being a socially-conscious person in the United States. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student but with reservations. I feel like we covered the subject matter pretty comprehensively but because it was so comprehensive we didn't delve beyond a superficial level. ",
            "\u00a0If you're truly at an beginner level of understanding the dynamics of race/class/etc, then yes. If you're looking for an alright 5th class, yes. Otherwise, no. IF you're an ERM student or already have above-minimal knowledge of the topics, you're probably better off in another class. ",
            "\u00a0The readings are really interesting, but lectures are painfully boring. You should just take a different ERM intro course. ",
            "\u00a0The material that's covered in the class is important to learn, and so in that sense I would recommend it to other students. But I think it could be much better taught (class time used better) and more engaging, which makes it hard for me to recommend. ",
            "\u00a0I  would recommend this course to students with a deep interest in, curiosity for, and/or minimal knowledge of the sociological aspects of race, ethnicity, and immigration. At the beginning of the course, Professor Kao will explain how this course tends toward the empirical over the humanistic, an approach that I found unique and valuable as applied to the assigned readings but strained in attempts to facilitate meaningful discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Not at all ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this class to international students like me. I thought I had a fairly good grasp of US racial dynamics after living two years here but there was still so much that I didn't know and was eye-opening ex. income disparity among racial groups and the heterogeneity of immigration history of different minority groups ",
            "\u00a0yes yes yes ",
            "\u00a0No. We were frequently let go 20 minutes early, and we rarely learned anything new in class. ",
            "\u00a0No. Professor Kao did not do a good job. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I really enjoyed delving deep into the problems and harsh realities we see and sometimes don't recognize in society and the communities we live in. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, its an interesting class with cool information that is both relevant and interesting to learn. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the information I learned changed the way I view the world. ",

            "\u00a0Yes! It was pretty informative and the information, although some considered it redundant, was pretty informative. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to someone else. I would give the warning that if you can tough out the rougher lectures and the sections you can gather a lot from the content of the course. ",
            "\u00a0I would if you arent interested in familiarizing yourself more with race, ethnicity and immigration issues in the US but not if you are looking for something more challenging and deeper. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend the course to another student. The class makes you think more deeply about the United States relationship with race, ethnicity, and immigration. It is very relevant to our current society. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend the course because I think it is necessary information that all students could benefit from. It increases our understanding of personal biases and helps to explain interactions that we observe on a daily basis. "
