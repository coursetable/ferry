            "\u00a0I learned how to develop my writing, reading comprehension, and verbal communication skills. This course tests all of the facets of Spanish, and you will improve a lot with hard work and dedication to the coursework. ",
            "\u00a0This course will really help with your oral Spanish. The assignments are geared to push you in this aspect. ",
            "\u00a0My Spanish improved a ton. ",
            "\u00a0Although subtly, my Spanish abilities (less so speaking, more so writing) did improve. ",
            "\u00a0Oral and written Spanish speaking/comprehension ability. ",
            "\u00a0My fluidity in Spanish, both written and spoken, has improved immensely. My grammar is also much better. ",
            "\u00a0I think I became a better Spanish speaker through this class. We reviewed a lot of grammar and read a lot, but I think the biggest thing I got out of this class was just being more comfortable speaking the language. ",
            "\u00a0I became fluent in Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my Spanish speaking and writing skills. I became more confident with my communication and conversational ability. ",
            "\u00a0Became MUCH more comfortable speaking (lots of previous classes had focused more on writing and non-verbal). Exposed to more cultural literature and cinema, including \"Cronica de una muerte anunciada\" by Gabriel Garcia Marquez. "

        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: All-encompassing course. Uses a variety of media as subject matter for class discussions and written assignments. I would like more time to allow for informal class discussion as that most closely mimics the type of conversations we would have outside of class. My classmates and I really enjoyed the few instances where we were allowed to talk as a whole group (as opposed to work in pairs or triples). ",
            "\u00a0The quizzes could be tweaked. There was too much memorization. Also, for the amount of work that this course is, it should be a 200 level course and be apart of the Spanish certificate program. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very well designed to facilitate your learning of Spanish. There is a lot of feedback and every student is encouraged to fully engage themselves in the class. ",
            "\u00a0More focus on grammar, particularly content that is \"old\" but has definitely been forgotten since initially learning it (i.e. comprehensive subjunctive review) would have been helpful. More open practice speaking out loud/less prompted reading/speaking. A lot of inconsistencies in the info and grammar rules communicated to us by the professor. ",
            "\u00a0Immersion is strong and very helpful. Sometimes unclear which assignments are graded or not.\r\n\r\nWorkload is so high that course should certainly be at least 1.5 credits. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - forces you to speak whether you want to or not, really good feedback on assignments\r\nWeaknesses - some readings were kind of boring and irrelevant, we went through grammar and readings really fast so didn't get to focus much on specifics ",
            "\u00a0Professor Diaz is incredible. Beware: its a constant stream of work. ",
            "\u00a0The class was a lot of work, and I thought it was worth 1.5 credits. The course was conducted well and helped me improve pretty much all aspects of my Spanish. That said, the class does not count towards the Spanish certificate, which is outrageous. The amount of work and time required for this class is higher than a lot of other L5 Spanish classes. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The discussion. Discussing and speaking casually with classmates every class period for the majority of the time made me become SO much more comfortable in my speaking abilities. I also really enjoyed most of our selections, both the short films and the short stories. Cronica de una muerta anunciada was also a nice addition to the curriculum. I also liked that we talked about current issues in society today. Specifically the gender violence readings were very illuminating. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This class is a lot of classwork and assignments. The first week of class, we were told \"this may not be a class that meets every day like previous levels, but it is a 7 day a week class in that you'll have work to do every day.\" This was definitely the truth! I'm conflicted because I really liked a lot of the short films and selections we read, but I feel like it was too much at times. Sometimes we just didn't have the time to discuss them very in depth (or at all) during class. "

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. This class NEEDS to be included as an option for those pursuing the Advanced Language Certificate. It is more work than several other L5 classes and way more intensive. I highly advise those considering this class to gauge how much work they will have in other classes because although this course meets three times/week, it is really 7 days of work (but extremely rewarding). ",
            "\u00a0If you've got a good command of grammar and speak easily, this course will probably be very easy for you. If you need to refresh your grammar and vocab before you'll be able to speak and write fluidly then this course might be more challenging and the work will take awhile. It will give you lots of practice speaking and writing, but you have to be at a certain level of comfort for that practice to really be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is a good course if you want to take your Spanish to the next level. In fact, this ",
            "\u00a0100%. If youve taken L4 this is the next step. This class will help you improve your fluency a lot and is a lot of fun. Take it with Sebastin Daz if you can. ",
            "\u00a0Just be warned, this class is a ton of work for what feels like minimal reward, and it was quite difficult to gauge how the professor would grade a given assignment. You cannot get away with simply doing the assigned work, as it requires a lot of outside practice and energy to learn the material well (as you will likely have to teach yourself a good deal on your own time). This class has, all in all, improved my Spanish only when it comes to writing, but is a massive pain in the ass. Take at your own risk and be prepared. ",
            "\u00a0Yes--it certainly improved my Spanish, and, while difficult, was enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - this course is a lot of work, but if you put in the work you come out of it speaking Spanish better ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you are serious about Spanish and love the language. If you just want to finish with an L5 credit, take another course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, you get what you put into it. You also have the opportunity to form nice connections with the other students in the class, as it is capped and a smaller class size. I became SO much more confident in my speaking skills, which was one of my main goals. Be prepared, however, for a pretty large workload. There is a \"Tarea para entregar\" which is a 250ish word essay due almost every week, in addition to discussion forums on Canvas, videos of yourself speaking responding to prompts on Canvas, written responses to comprehension questions on readings, grammar exercises, and more. None of these felt like busywork in that they did feel valuable and important for my learning. However, be aware that this is the workload of this class. The good news: there are a lot of assignments for practice and that go into your final grade. The so-so news: you'll be busy, so plan accordingly.\r\n\r\nAlso, this class currently doesn't count for the Advanced Spanish Language Certificate, so you are truly taking this class for taking this class.
