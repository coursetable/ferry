            "\u00a0This course helped me build on the vocabulary and grammar I had learned in Elementary Portuguese. I learned pitfalls, slang, and the culture of Lusophonic cultures. The class improved my reading, writing, speaking, and comprehension skills in Portuguese. I am much better at holding conversation, listening to news reports, and reading higher-level Portuguese texts. ",
            "\u00a0PORT 130 definitely builds on earlier courses, in that students continue to improve their abilities to read, speak, and understand spoken Portuguese. You continue to learn about Brazil and the lusophone world, build your vocabulary, and increase your ability to differentiate the unique sounds of Portuguese. ",

I liked it when we mixed in other literature, like poetry and outside short stories. ",
            "\u00a0The work is very manageable and actually enjoyable. The textbook is a series of cronicas, which lead to interesting conversations. I really really enjoyed all the projects we completed. "
