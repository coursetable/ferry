            "\u00a0From this class I was able to practice both my spoken and written French at a high level while engaging thoroughly with an interesting topic that is still relevant today. ",
            "\u00a0In taking this course, I developed an in-depth knowledge of the history of Jews in France, as well as French Jewish literature. \r\n\r\nIt definitely improved my French writing and oral expression. ",
            "\u00a0My understanding of Jewish-French history, thought, and literature are dramatically improved, as is my competency in French. "

            "\u00a0wonderful syllabus and the professor was really interested in the material and us engaging with it. but class discussions weren't great because no one did the reading. i dont thin't it's the professors class but there was almost no class engagement or classroom community ",
            "\u00a0For certain French students, the fact that the class was entirely in French may have been a weakness. \r\n\r\nSome of the readings are very long (about a novel to read per week), which means that they are sometimes read hurriedly, and discusses superficially in class. \r\n\r\nI think the class could be improved by maybe allowing us to give more extensive presentations on notable French Jews (longer than 5 mins). It was a fairly important for our final course grade, and the time constraints meant that it covered the topic superficially. ",
            "\u00a0The course is extremely ambitious in the sense that it attempts to cover a tremendous span of history, geography, and genre. And I think that is a good thing, and in fact I would love to see a graduate seminar version that would cover even more. The flip side is that some things will always have to be left out, but I'm not sure that there's a way to include some of what was excluded without requiring something else to be excluded. As a survey, I think it's exceptionally good--maybe a bit more at least mention could be made of things that are left out (the AIU, Proust, Derrida, for example) beyond the oral reports. So the only question would be either to focus it (on a genre, a period, or something) or to keep it as a survey, and I like the latter option, since I feel like the course opens well onto further study.

            "\u00a0Absolutely! I wish there were an English version of the course offered so I could recommend it to even more people! ",
            "\u00a0As a fifth credit, perhaps not -- the readings can be a lot to handle. But the content is really good and I have no complaints about the readings other than their length. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, as it was a wonderful mix of literature and history. ",
            "\u00a0totally. hopefully they will have more time for the course and so will the other students so that discussion can occur and be valuable. but a super manageable course with really interesting material and a professor and TA who were laid back and enthusiastic ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. \r\n\r\nIt was very well taught and I greatly enjoyed the reading that we did from class to class. Professor Samuels is an excellent professor who selects interesting texts to look at and the assignments were fairly research-light and engaging. \r\n\r\nOne thing I would say however is that I took this course as a native French speaker. I therefore had no trouble with the fact that all of the discussions that we had and all of the oral and written work that we completed was in French (including a ten page research paper), but I would find completing these tasks as a non-native speaker or with little experience in speaking and writing French to be extremely challenging. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely would, especially to another student in my situation (first-year grad student--I guess saying this will compromise the anonymity of my eval, but oh well), or to anyone with interests in a) the broad sweep of issues covered in the course or b) any of the specific figures or topics engaged.
