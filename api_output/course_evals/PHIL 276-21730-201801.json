            "\u00a0The course was a survey of the foundations of three aspects of modern metaphysics - time, personal identity and modality, and race/gender - and I developed a general understanding of the state of metaphysics in each area (what the big questions are, general frameworks to address questions in each area, etc.). I improved in my ability to read and understand modern analytical philosophy, in my ability to analyze and discuss seminal philosophical frameworks, and in my ability to write more effectively regarding these topics. ",
            "\u00a0I gained an overview of the metaphysics field in philosophy, delving into concepts of space, time, personal identity and social construction. Having never taken a metaphysics introductory course, this course showed me how different sub-fields within metaphysics intersect: e.g. how a concept of personal identity builds on an understanding of space and time. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the basic method of metaphysical inquiry through the study of three major topics in the field. I also improved my argument mapping, which led to an improvement in my ability to write a philosophy paper. ",
            "\u00a0This was a great intro course in analytic philosophy. It gave skills in philosophical thinking and writing, and provided a good survey of a few metaphysics topics. ",
            "\u00a0Deep analysis of philosophical writings on time, personal identity, and social construction. ",
            "\u00a0The class did a good overview of major metaphysics topics such as the reality of space, personal identity, and social ontology. ",
            "\u00a0I gained deeper critical thinking skills. I had to focus more on my arguments and my thinking. Articulating thoughts onto paper was a trying task and yet I feel as though I grew as a writer and as a student. ",
            "\u00a0I really felt like I gained an entirely new skillset with which to approach the world. Metaphysics really enabled me to ask important and piercing questions while solidifying my own ability to craft ideas. Overall an incredibly interesting and useful class. ",
            "\u00a0I gained an overview of contemporary metaphysics literature on time, personal identity, and race and gender. I learned how to write philosophy papers which were more than reconstructions, within short word limits. ",
            "\u00a0I did not know what to expect from this class, but Prof. Dembroff made a great curriculum for introducing the field. ",
            "\u00a0Metaphysics honed my methods of critical analysis and opened my eyes to new lenses through which I can view society. I learned how to dissect social structures and understand their foundations and build theories to explain the world around me. "

            "\u00a0The material was a fairly standard survey of the main areas of modern metaphysics, but some parts of it got a bit boring. This is a problem endemic to the nature of the material in the course, a problem which can be mitigated if you take this with a good professor. In my case, I had a fantastic professor, but I can imagine this course being much more boring with another instructor. ",
            "\u00a0Doing a weekly reading response helped me improve my writing skills and ability to summarise and respond to material. The course material was very interesting. I would have enjoyed more material on the physics behind theories and philosophy of metaphysics, and a more discussions-based learning style like a seminar rather than lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The syllabus's movement from space and time, to personal identity, to social construction felt natural. The latter part of the course definitely built on the former, and Professor Dembroff's choice to structure the course the way they did assisted my learning. Professor Dembroff's lectures are also in themselves a strength of the course, as it's pretty rare to find such a clear, incisive lecturer in the philosophy department (in my limited experience.) 9am Metaphysics classes with Professor Dembroff's crystal-clear lectures were a great way to start the day and to awaken the mind. In addition, our weekly reading responses helped me to consolidate my learning and also allowed me and my classmates to engage with each other  I enjoyed them very much. I also appreciated how Professor Dembroff would stop after all the important points in their lecture so that we can ask questions and engage with the content.\r\nImprovement: Professor Dembroff could consider spending a bit less time during lecture laying out the arguments from our reading, and more time critically engaging with, or posing questions for us to critically engage with, the reading. I'd say that students should have deconstructed and reconstructed the arguments from readings mostly by themselves before class. The most value adding I got during lecture was through Professor Dembroff's questions that challenged us to opine or evaluatively interact with our readings. ",
            "\u00a0The course was great- one of my favorite at Yale ",
            "\u00a0i like that we have very close analysis on our readings! That helps me understand the readings much better. I wish the readings on social constructions could be more interesting though. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very well planned and structured. It was good intersection of lecture and seminar style teaching. It would be nice if maybe on the first day of class, the field of metaphysics could be more broadly laid out so we know what the course covers and what it doesnt. ",
            "\u00a0The course definitely required thought and care. The lectures were brilliant and really engaged the class and caused students to think about their assumptions and thoughts. The expectations were high for papers, but that is not necessarily a weakness. I felt that I grew far more than I would have with easier grading and lower expectations. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the readings and the responses were very helpful in getting me to engage with the material, and as a result definitely helped my ability to participate in class. I felt that the 'leminar' structure of class, where we had a powerpoint to get through the material but the small structure that enabled conversation and a seminar-like atmosphere. \r\n\r\nI do think a little more time could have been spent on learning how to write metaphysics papers and possibly workshopping drafts of papers. That would have been really interesting and would have helped students better grow from each other's passions. ",
            "\u00a0A very good class--sometimes I felt behind/lost when discussing some concepts while others knew them, so wish there were supplementary materials for those unfamiliar with philosophy writing/structure. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Dembroff has a talent for explaining convoluted ideas with easy-to-understand analogies and examples, and they are always willing to expand the lecture from a monologue to a discussion when they think it's beneficial. I felt that the biggest weakness of the course was its unpredictable subjectivity. At times, it felt like every idea we presented in lecture was treated as uniquely insightful, but other times, nothing anyone said was treated as relevant. Considering how complex metaphysics is, the subjectivity is understandable, but it made it difficult to know when to contribute to in-class discussions and when to keep my comments to myself. The same subjectivity sometimes came through in the discussion of reading responses and grading of essays. However, it didn't detract too much from the course overall; metaphysics was wonderfully taught and as engaging as it was difficult. "

            "\u00a0This is a standard metaphysics course. Nothing too exciting, but nothing too boring - the material can go either way. Who the professor is comprises one of the main factors of whether a course like this can be recommended; if a good professor happens to be teaching it that year, by all means, take it. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a fascinating introduction to metaphysics applied in ways that are relevant to the real world, if that is of interest, focusing on time, personal identity, and race and gender. It was a course I looked forward to going to every day, even though it was a 9:00 am. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you're a philosophy student, or a non-philosophy student interested in \"the bigger questions,\" this course is essential learning. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to any student, even one not interested in philosophy, as the topics are interesting beyond the extent of the field, and they have important real world applications. ",
            "\u00a0If you like analytic philosophy, then it's worthwhile. Especially during the earlier units--metaphysics of time and personal identity--it would occasionally feel like the arguments were circular, and people were defining their terms in lieu of the conclusions they wanted to find. But Prof. Dembroff is honest about that, and teaches you to think and write well. ",
            "\u00a0YES! I think time, personal identity and social construction are important issues that everyone needs to learn! The class helps you understand the readings much better and I feel I learned a lot! ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0To a student that is interested in philosophy, I definitely recommend this course. The content is engaging, the lecturing style is wonderful, and the material is thought provoking. Some of the papers might cause you to fall asleep while reading them, but that's a hazard of older philosophical literature in general. For students wishing to have an easy humanities course, I would not recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this course. Professor Dembroff is phenomenal, and metaphysics is an incredible subject that really expanded the way I understand and frame problems. The course has definitely been one of my highlights, and I really believe it's a subject that offers a lot of insight into any aspect of life. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to philosophy students, anyone interested in metaphysics generally, or students interested in race and gender theory. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Prof. Dembroff is a clear instructor who explains complicated topics in an engaging and understandable way. They also address relevant topics to tie in philosophy with everyday life. ",
            "\u00a0This course is hard, but it's well worth the effort. The course title is slightly misleading because this isn't just a broad intro to metaphysical thought. We engaged directly with only a few metaphysical ideas (namely time, identity, and social metaphysics), but we explored these ideas at length and therefore got great depth from it. The class itself was a weird amalgamation of lecture and seminar, but it usually worked well. If you're looking for a lowkey intro to philosophy, this definitely is not it, but if you want an engaging and interesting class taught by a knowledgeable and articulate professor, look no further. "
