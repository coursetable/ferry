During the course of this semester and particularly in the Hurricane exercise I have learned a lot about my role in a team. For as long as I can remember, I have been struggling with feelings of inadequacy and social anxiety. I sensor myself and dont always speak up due to fear of being judged by others. To me the Hurricane exercise was such an eye-opening experience as it made me think about how I would have acted in a situation that was life-threatening ",

            "\u00a0They exceeded my expectations ",
            "\u00a0I had a lot higher expectations for this class. It was marketed like a few of the professional and personal development courses at SOM, but fell short due to the number of topics that were covered in the course in such a short timeframe. ",
            "\u00a0Extremely well. Even better than I had expected because what I learned is so directly applicable to my career and personal life. ",
            "\u00a0Great. ",
            "\u00a0They align pretty well with my expectation. ",
            "\u00a0The first third of the class was great and all I hoped for. The second half was close to useless. I thought most of the lectures after the hurricane exercise were not particularly relevant or helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Very well! There aren't a lot of specific classes, or sections of existing courses, dedicated to personal development, leadership, team building, etc. I really crave those soft skills and think they're crucially important for those of us entering the environmental field, no matter how far along we are in our careers. This course is really one of those that you get out of it what you put in. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of the speakers were from SOM and I was a little surprised that there wasn't more diversity in that regard. Yale has a ton of professors at the college, at the Divinity School, the School of Public Health, the Law School, etc. who I thought would have had a lot to offer for some of the course modules, but we just kept hearing the SOM viewpoint repeatedly. This was okay in some situations, but in others, it felt rather poorly aligned with the interests of most of the people in the room. Zoe Chance gave a talk on influencing without authority and most of the examples she gave seemed to be about selling things. That's all well and good, but most of the folks in the class were from F&ES, where sales is not a primary interest. A talk from someone like Katherine Hollins or Julie Vance about communicating/influencing environmental change would have aligned better with what most of us actually want to do. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the skills gained in this class generally aligned with my expectations. I would have like a deeper dive into certain sections like the lecture on power while I could have done without the lecture on public health. The first half of the class was better organized and gave me more actionable skills than did the second half. ",
            "\u00a0Poorly--I think for a class on working with people, opportunities should be sought (every class?) to operate as a group under some kind of stress/pressure. This is where groups are tested most, and one often doesn't recognize how group dynamics play out until these moments. Ultimately, I will remember much more about the interpersonal moments between peers in the class than I will about content of lecturer's presentations. Take that as you will. ",
            "\u00a0very well ",
            "\u00a0Not very much. I did not learn much about persuasion and how to influence a team. ",

        [
            "\u00a0There needs to be MUCH better communication on what the instructors expect from assignments and much better feedback on assignments ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: It's a relatively low lift that you end up getting a lot out of. Because there isn't too much actual work to do, there's time to reflect and work through the things you learn in class. The teaching team was also just awesome and modeled everything they were teaching. And being in a pod (a group of students) was also a lovely experience from which I learned a lot.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It was heavily focused on business, so if that is not your area of interest, you may lose interest during some lectures. Also, the lecturers were a little hit or miss depending on the week. Finally, the reflections were graded weirdly. I received marks a little lower than I was expecting from a reflection that I put a lot of thought into. I also didn't receive any comments that told me why I received low marks. ",
            "\u00a0There is no strength of this course as such. The weaknesses are plenty. ",
            "\u00a0The first half of the class is better, and the second half lacks meaningful content ",
            "\u00a0More continuity between guest speakers; more prep with guest speakers to have their lectures be clearly tied in to the course material and building on previous lectures. Some lectures I felt I got nothing out of, and were only tangentially relevant to our class or felt like new information (e.g. the Michelle Bell one, the public health one). I enjoyed the first part of the course with the self-assessments of the Insights and power profiles - those were really helpful in guiding my thinking. However, the course content seriously declined after those first few sessions. I was hoping for more specific and concrete discussions or workshops on examples of issues that have come up in working with people and how to resolve them; the concepts shared felt too nebulous to be effective without digging deeper into how to ACTUALLY apply them. The pod breakouts grew on me but I initially was not a fan; I enjoyed getting to know my podmates but felt that the frequency of breakout discussions in pods wasn't very effective and the questions posed weren't always meaningful enough to make me feel that I should put effort into discussing them. It felt a bit forced. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the first two modules of the course seemed the strongest. Got a lot out of the deep dive into self, and enjoyed the work with pods, but could have used additional time to dive further into others' self assessments and learnings from personality types that were not my own. \r\n\r\nWeakness: module 3 felt less useful and seemed to taper off.  Wish the precedent had not been set that readings were optional - engagement with the material seemed to fall off collectively when that became a norm, and made for less useful pod discussions. Wish there was greater clarity on expectations for the pods both inside and outside of class. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the pod organization of this class. It was cool to be placed with a group of people I didn't know at all and then spend most of the semester with them. ",
            "\u00a0This course has a lot of great ideas.  The biggest strength is by far all of the module 1 stuff, which deals with getting to know yourself.  Module 2, which deals with groups, was ok, and module 3, networks, was a waste of time.  The format of this class was really hard for me to engage with.  The instructors and presenters expected everyone in the class to go from deep personal insight and reflection to small group sharing to large group synthesis in rapid succession; I just couldn't do it.  I think the presenters need to slow down and stick to a few key points and concepts.  Even though I felt uncomfortable, out of place, devalued, and disengaged in class, I still got a lot out of this experience. ",
            "\u00a0I wish we could have spent more time discussing with our pods on topics we were reviewing. There were two or three too many speakers that were just not that engaging (the two male SOM speakers for example) and the material was either not that relevant for the course or not valuable enough to take up an entire class. The topics at the beginning with the personality tests we could've talked about more in our pods or with a partner. Overall, it just never felt like we really got a chance to dig into any topics well enough to cement them or practice them.\r\nThe pod system is wonderful, podcast were a great idea, the stranded island game was good, so was escape the room, any opportunity that gave a chance to practice and reflect worked really well. Stu and Brad are wonderful people to be teaching this course. The TA team was good. Class discussion on a wide scale worked well. ",
            "\u00a0The Insights Profile was incredibly insightful and helpful. More clear instructions on assignments and pod expectations could help improve the overall atmosphere of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses, the papers were too long and completely unnecessary. People did not enjoy writing any paper, it was a waste of time because we caoulcn't reflect on anything learned in class. ",
            "\u00a0Maybe the third module, I'd say that it felt a little more disjointed and some of the focusing on networks felt very abstract versus the concrete discussions of the first two modules. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very interesting and often overlooked topics were covered in this course. The entire teaching staff was very kind and approachable. Weaknesses: Could have used more variety in the means for class discussion and the readings for each week were rather redundant and could be cut down. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: group exercises (hurricane challenge, escape the room, pods for pods)\r\nWeaknesses: too much material covered and too many speakers; sometimes group exercises during class were not productive ",
            "\u00a0I think a great strength is the speakers the course brings in. I wish we had had more time for questions in each class. I know most students were often curious about a few things, but it felt that we never had time to pursue those curiosities. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, I felt that Piazza as a tool was not used well. If a post on Piazza is listed on as a pre-class to-do, having that thread already started would be great. Alternatively, if it's not working, my opinion would be just drop it, rather than paying it lip-service alone. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I have learned a lot from this class and appreciated the diversity of perspectives that were brought in thanks to the lecturers. There was a good balance between theory and hands-on/practical application.\r\nWeakness: The feedback we received on our papers could have been more speedy. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The structure and content of the class is its strength. It's incredibly thoughtful and its work. ",
            "\u00a0Again, I loved the personal best self exercise, the hurricane exercise, and the escape room trip. Those were all fantastic.\r\nEverything after spring break I thought was just irrelevant to the course. I think the class should be a half-semester class in the future and the unnecessary lectures should be taken out. The network exercise is interesting, but does not merit that much class time. ",
            "\u00a0I know there's probably not much that can be done... but the 8:30 start time is rough :)\r\n\r\nPods should definitely be kept and encouraged to get to know eachother much sooner in the semester with dinners or group assignments. It was a real pleasure getting to know my podmates, and I appreciated that we all had different power profiles and leadership styles.\r\n\r\nGuest lecturers were good, but some were much more standout than others (ex: Amy Wrzesniewski, Peter Boyd, etc.) Try to relate speakers/materials back to environmental/social work as much as possible. \r\n\r\nSometimes readings aren't very well integrated into course lectures or activities. Keep them actively part of class somehow, or cut them.\r\n\r\nThe Network Map assignment needs to be rethought. I realize it was changed in response to student feedback that they wanted more pod team assignments, however the execution and clarity of the assignment was really tricky and wasn't as valuable for every team member as it could've been. ",
            "\u00a0There should be less reflection and more application to real-world experiences ",
            "\u00a0The speakers were hit or miss. Again, the first half of the semester was awesome. Once we started getting into network mapping, I got less interested. I understand the value behind the concept of growing your network and understanding the scope and connectivity of your network, but something about the way that was communicated and the assignment we were given to explore that idea just didn't land for me. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the class were seen in the guest lectures of the first half of the class. The weakness was the lack of solid assignments. The papers that we were asked to write felt like busy work and did not really have much use beyond simply synthesizing what we had been presented in class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths--diversity of speakers and interests, breaking into pods, hurricane simulation, escape the room.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses--Lack of applied knowledge, shaky lecturing, failure to connect ideas to \"common threads\" in the course. T.A.s were underutilized as well, I think (could they sit in on more discussions and identify themselves as objective \"neutral observers\"--i.e. \"what I've noticed in this conversation is that student A has spoken most, and student B has spoken least--are there any reasons for that dynamic?\"\r\n\r\nBuild in opportunities for direct feedback in pods based on challenges (e.g. a class period where the group alternates between designated leaders to take on challenges and then each leader is offered feedback on their leadership style) ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The topics were all really interesting and salient!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Expectations for assignments were not well set up in advance, office hours were limited, and we didn't actually have a lot of time to engage in our pods. ",
            "\u00a0S: the power profile is definitively the best part of the class! Very useful and straightforward! \r\nW: I believe that discussing every detail of the class with the pod was not necessarily useful. I wish that instead of using most of the class to discuss with our pods, we could have had more time to learn from the faculty and the guest speakers. Discussing is good but to a certain point and I believe that it should be used more carefully because if everything has to be talked, things start to be repetitive and dont create value. ",
            "\u00a0The class brought excellent speakers, but we spent most of the time discussing small prompts that didn't add much value to the pods. I think we would benefit from hearing more from the speakers and only use group discussions when they add value to the class. \r\n\r\nThe pods provide continuity to the class, that is great. That said, I think the pods would benefit from having a clear task or raison d'tre. As it stands, we were unclear at times of the point of having pods. ",
            "\u00a0It would be very helpful if the invited guest speakers adapted their examples to environmental issues. For example, Zoe Chance gave great corporate examples of marketing strategies to sell products, but it would have been great to see innovative examples of how as environmentalists we can actually change behaviour regarding consumption patterns and personal choices. \r\nThe feedback on the assignments could be improved, it was difficult to understand how the assignments were being graded and how one could improve.

There are very few structured opportunities in grad school to do self-reflection, get honest feedback from peers, and practice your soft skills. Take advantage of it while you can!
