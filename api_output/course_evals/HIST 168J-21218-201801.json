            "\u00a0I learned a lot about Canadian history and French North America as a whole. I would say that I learned a lot more in the beginning few weeks of the term, and the rest of the semester didnt feel as helpful or knowledge-filled. ",
            "\u00a0A whole new side to Canada and the French-Canadian identity. ",
            "\u00a0I must admit, you won't learn a ton about Canada, but spending time with Professor Gitlin is always a treat. Dean B does well to keep him on track. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a bit about Canadian and Quebec history which was exciting because its not something that's usually offered in American curricula. ",
            "\u00a0A marvelous introduction to Canadian history, particularly around the topic of francophone culture in North America, Quebec & Canada, 1791-Present offers at once a broad sweep of Canadian history as well as an exploration of the student's topic of choice. Canadian history revises the American perspective familiar to most students in unique and remarkable ways. The course, perhaps surprisingly, draws in important discussions of race, ethnicity, language, culture, and comparative politics. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a lot of critical writing and thinking skills while taking this course. We learned a lot about Canada and Quebec and my knowledge of the country now is a lot more extensive than it ever was in the past. "

            "\u00a0Its a pretty good setup because the profs recognize that you're not going to do the reading except for your two weeks where you're responsible for presenting on the readings.\r\nClass went over by a minimum of 10 minutes nearly every single week, which was difficult and put us in an awkward position because we're getting graded for our attendance so people didnt feel comfortable leaving.\r\nI was confused as to why we technically had two profs and a TA for an 18 person seminar. It made it a little confusing as to who was in charge.\r\nPeople had to pay for the field trip, which I thought was inappropriate.\r\nThe professors talk a lot for a seminar, which was fine, but I feel like it gave them less to judge us on for grades and such. Also, it meant that you really didnt have to prepare for class except when you were presenting because youd never really have much of a chance to speak. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the instructors' passion and expertise, the variety of readings and discussions \r\nWeaknesses: too many readings and too many mini-assignments that are not shown on the syllabus.  (They're not too time-consuming but it would have been nice to know they were coming up) ",
            "\u00a0Strength: easy fifth credit, low workload. Weakness: not much engagement with material, since class is mostly a lecture format and readings are not discussed in detail. ",
            "\u00a0There was not a clear format to the course. Despite it being a seminar, Jay Gitlin lectured the whole time. ",
            "\u00a0Ah, this is a course with a substantial history, and it is difficult to imagine much room for improvement. Three small suggestions: I think requiring a small statement (say, a couple paragraphs) earlier in the semester about a final paper topic would be helpful to get research started, definitely keep class conversations central to the course, and finally I sometimes worried that my peers did not complete much of the reading. Do you think it might be improved by choosing articles to emphasize and maybe a bit more room for discussion? (At the same time, though, it is hard to countenance taking time from Professor Gitlin.) ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the layout of the course, we were able to accomplish a lot within a short amount of time. It was also a good group that we had and we were all able to add a little in our own ways. ",
            "\u00a0Very enjoyable seminars. Could have had better structure and more transparency though. "

        [
            "\u00a0Its a pretty chill class but you still do learn things, so its a pretty good course choice when you have a busy academic schedule otherwise. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!  Everyone should learn about Canada.  It's not America's hat!  It's its own country with its own history and memory and complicated race/class/gender dynamics! ",
            "\u00a0Very good seminar with low workload. Do it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Definitely take this course if you have the opportunity. It's a cool way to learn about the complexities of Canadian identity that Americans typically don't think about. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, low workload. Interesting professors. ",
            "\u00a0Certainly-- a delightful and engaging course on a special interest topic. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student because the material is very interesting and the professor is really good at teaching it. Even with a little Canadian background I learned a lot about Canada that I never knew before. ",
            "\u00a0Very enjoyable class. Readings are great but not necessary to read. You get what you put into the class. "
