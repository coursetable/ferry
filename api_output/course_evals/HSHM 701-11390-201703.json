            "\u00a0Critical reading and analysis, insights of medicine and public health and the importance of looking at these ventures/successes with a critical lens ",
            "\u00a0This class was much more focused on evaluating the historical method of the history of medicine than I expected. This had a lot of pros: I learned about ways of thinking through the scope of a project and finding holes, and I sharpened my ability to critique a historical work (largely through class discussions and classmates). I was a bit disappointed that the books on the syllabus were so broad, mainly because it made it feel a little hard to connect the materials, or the big historical questions, rather than just the act of writing a book. But, for historians of medicine, the focus makes sense. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about the history and interests of the field of the history of medicine. I also learned a bit about how the different departments represented in our class (american studies, history of science, public health, etc) influenced perspectives on the books we read. Having such a diverse class was useful in bringing up ideas and concerns that might not have come to the fore in a less diverse class. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to critically think not only about history, but especially the way history is recorded and the biases that accompany different perspectives. ",
            "\u00a0Better understanding of the disciple of history, and the history of the field that is history of medicine. Discussion fostered familiarity with interdisciplinary concerns. ",
            "\u00a0I am newly conversant in the influence of modernity, in its many iterations, on the development and transmission of medicine globally. Our conversations thoroughly drew upon books from previous weeks and their themes, creating a cohesive, cumulative dialogue that was possible to track from the first week until the last. "

            "\u00a0The reading list was excellent. Dr. Warner is clearly very open to all opinions and welcomes all discussion. The discussion functioned as a free-for-all which is helpful in some ways as we are graduate students and should be up for that at this point. However the stronger voices definitely took over and it could be a difficult environment for those who are more introverted/less experienced in the field. Overall a good informative course taught by a very kind and knowledgeable professor. ",
            "\u00a0Discussion often dominated by limited set of students and their concerns. The material was well selected to cover a variety of approaches and stimulate discussion. ",
            "\u00a0I wish that we engaged more with texts on the history of psychiatry, reproduction, and womens health movements/culture. "

            "\u00a0Yes. Challenging and time consuming but insightful ",
            "\u00a0Take this course if you're ready to read a book a week and focus on the historical method of eachit's a good course to explore the questions of that method with your classmates. Other than that schedule, there isn't much structure to the course, so if you aren't self-motivated to read and think, it can quickly become lost time. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it to someone familiar with the field who is very willing to speak up in discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Well designed to address central problems in the field. Quality of discussion will vary with student composition. "
