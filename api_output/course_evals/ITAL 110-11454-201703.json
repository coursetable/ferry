            "\u00a0One really great thing about my section was that there were only 9 people, so there were more opportunities for speaking and engagement with our instructor. However, I know that not all sections are like that, but I feel like the course would improve if there were a limit on class size. Also, please stop asking us if we prefer the mountains or the sea (the sea is the clear winner here). ",
            "\u00a0It is an extremely fun and interactive course that I got so much out of. It pushes you but you never feel uncomfortable because everyone else is in the same boat. I loved it. ",

            "\u00a0Italian is a great language to take at Yale. Many high schools don't offer it, but a background in Spanish or French is very helpful and makes it easier to face the challenge of learning a new language. The department is large enough and can offer enough sections that there is flexibility when scheduling classes, but it isn't so large that you're unable to participate in class or that everyone you know is taking it. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. As someone who has trouble learning languages, this was an excellent course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the professor course combo. The course should only be taken by those with an interest in the language as it is a somewhat difficult course. "
