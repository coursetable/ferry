            "\u00a0I gained a variety of foundational skills related to analyzing poetry: relating a work to its historical contexts, analyzing poetic devices and forms, finding meaning on the levels of the word/line/stanza, articulating my own responses as a reader, and using secondary scholarship to supplement my own ideas. ",
            "\u00a0Close reading on a bunch of levels: theme, meter, rhyme, style, form, etc. We often spent entire class periods on one or two short poems. You will learn how to dissect a poem for sure! ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Eccles is simply wonderful and leads an adept discussion. The class is very organized; the informal writing assignments were always varied and kept me engaged without the pressure of a grade. I really liked the balance between Professor Eccles' introductions and the built-in time for students to lead discussion on certain works. Weaknesses: naturally, because this is a survey course, it felt too crowded at times. We found ourselves running out of time to discuss huge foundational works (spending only 1 class period on Eliot's The Waste Land, for example) and often read 10 poems for class but only got to discuss 2. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Eccles is the bomb and very knowledgable about the subject matter. Class time is focused on a close analysis of one or two poems, which helps develop the necessary skills you need to write literary analysis papers. Smaller written assignments also help develop these skills. \r\n\r\nWeakness: perhaps more time could be spent on more contemporary writers? Also we need more time for Dickinson (but then again I could go on about Dickinson forever). ",

            "\u00a0Yes I'd highly recommend this course! You will become a pro at close readings by the end of it. I wish I had taken this course earlier in my yale career! The skills I gained in this class would have benefitted me greatly in other writing courses. ",
