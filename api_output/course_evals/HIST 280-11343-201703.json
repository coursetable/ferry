            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about a subject I knew nothing about, and developed skills for approaching difficult primary texts. ",
            "\u00a0Catholic Intellectual Tradition is a class that is accessible and relevant to students across the board. You need not be a history major, nor a Catholic. In this respect, for an intellectual history dealing with the doctrine of one particular religion, this class is quite remarkable. \r\n\r\nUnlike other history classes, mostly seminars, but the occasional lecture as well, Catholic Intellectual Tradition is not one that teaches you how to read large amounts of text, how to conduct primary source research or how to write eloquently and concisely.On the other hand, what it does give you is a survey of 2,000 years of intellectual and theological developments of one of the West's most important canons. ",
            "\u00a0Very strong overview of the fundamentals of the Catholic theological tradition from Augustine through the 20th century. The course covered a lot of material with an impressive amount of depth. ",
            "\u00a0The course gave me a strong understanding of the intellectual currents and foundations in Catholic thought. I also gained experience in theological analysis, and was surprised at the intimacy of the connections between what social, political and religious Catholic writers in the past discussed and the ways the societies they were part of functioned. ",
            "\u00a0I have learned more in this class than I have in any other class at Yale. This course truly gives students an entirely new outlook on how Catholicism has shaped and responded to western society. Not only this, but my critical analysis and writing skills increased tenfold. ",
            "\u00a0Building criticism and appreciation for the Catholic canon. Even with a background in Catholic High School, this was an incredibly insightful course which, I think, helpfully pushes the boundaries of what the intellectual tradition of Catholicism is. ",
            "\u00a0I really deepened my understanding of the catholic faith. Great course. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the history of Catholicism, but also about different schools of thought/ways of looking at the world. ",
            "\u00a0This class really improved my confidence in interpreting primary texts, particularly within the context of a larger historical frame. It also deepened by appreciation for the complexities of Christian religion in both a philosophical and social sense. Due to the highly paradoxical nature of the subject matter, this course also expanded my ability to think outside of traditional, linear paradigms. ",
            "\u00a0I didn't pay that much attention or learn that much in this class. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me to think critically and make broad connections across material that spanned centuries of history. I learned a lot about the history of Catholic intellectual thought, from its roots to the present, and gained an appreciation for a wide range of thinkers, including many who I previously recognized by name but had only a superficial understanding of. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about the Catholic Intellectual Tradition. ",

            "\u00a0I was raised a Catholic, and although I did receive Sunday school classes about the faith and the church's primary message(s), I always felt slightly uneasy about the fact that I was never taught about the church's intellectual faults and less than perfect history.\r\n\r\nThis class has changed all of that. I am now better versed in the Catholic Church's intellectual history, in both good and bad periods, and this class receives all of the credit for having exposed me to that deeper understanding! ",
            "\u00a0The ability to understand and analyze important texts and ideas in Catholic intellectual history. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a solid theological and philosophical foundation within the bounds of the Catholic tradition through this class. I developed the skills necessary to understand dense texts and synthesize their important ideas. ",
            "\u00a0I have a new appreciation for the role of faith in society. Despite the fact that I am not Catholic, I now feel more connected to the rituals and beliefs of my religion by seeing its sinilarities and differences when compared to Catholicism. This class gave me a good background in Catholic thought which is instrumental in understanding European history after the year O CE. ",

            "\u00a0Strength: A genuine exploration of religion as religion, not as some socio-political phenomenon.\r\nWeakness: Some people were a little dense and didn't know super basic things about Christianity and Catholicism, but still took this class. They were annoying to deal with, but there isn't much to be done about this. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures and readings are phenomenal. I enjoyed all lectures except Prof. Brenzel's. ",
            "\u00a0The professors are very knowledgable. ",
            "\u00a0The first half of the course is substantially weaker than the second. In part, this is due to the fact that you are having so much information thrown at you, without any way to ground it. Usually the critique of history classes is that they depend too much on secondary material, at the expense of getting you to read primary sources as such. This class, ironically, seems to fall too far on the other extreme. \r\n\r\nIn the first part of the semester (before the midterm), I found it incredibly difficult to ground the intellectual tradition in more traditional accounts of historical developments. The lectures range from a very close reading of a particular text (e.g. Dante) to a seeming endless list of disparate facts, whose relationship to the week's reading seems somewhat unclear. In this vein, I think it would be useful to have a kind of sourcebook for that class that includes a week-by-week overview of Christianity's political, institutional and economic history (not its intellectual tradition). Perhaps it would be beneficial to future students to have a 10 page overview of the developments of the century or centuries that week's readings will address. ",
            "\u00a0Rather than reading Salinger or another novel at the end of the course, I think it could have been useful to spend the last week or last lecture talking about present-day debates within Catholicism. ",
            "\u00a0Course did a good job covering a very vast time period in history, however there was a LOT of reading, which was difficult to all do in depth. It was too bad we don't have time to go into depth in some of the texts, because many of them have a lot of information packed in them. Prof. Eire's lectures were quite engaging, but there are many guest lecturers, who range from boring (literally reading an essay) to very energetic and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Engaging material, excellent lectures and professors, helpful TAs for my essays\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Professional guidelines for citing theological sources in text would have been helpful. Professor Eire was also often away this semester, although this was unavoidable because it was the anniversary of the Protestant revolution. ",
            "\u00a0My one suggestion for the course is more structured instruction/feedback for writing. As a computer science major, writing isn't my strong suit, but I wanted to take this class regardless. A more thorough rough draft/feedback system might be helpful to draw in students who don't usually take humanities courses. ",
            "\u00a0I wish that the course would've explained more as to what the Catholic intellectual tradition is, as that is it's namesake. Nonetheless, it was very interesting and the readings gave a broad perspective into Catholicism. ",
            "\u00a0Awesome readings -- I think the class makes it too easy to get away with not doing them, though. Maybe have someone in each section present on a work each week or find some other way to encourage readings? ",
            "\u00a0I loved the variety of texts that we read; I only wish we had focused more on the ideas behind each of the texts in lecture, rather than spend so much time on the history. ",
            "\u00a0This is a very strong course. Professor Eire is clearly passionate about the material and loves engaging with students who, by virtue of being the self-selecting group which take this course, are also interested in Catholic thought. The topics are broad, ranging over close to 2000 years of history, so there is certainly a fair amount of variety in the class. That being said, it is still quite cohesive. Professor Eire's lectures were fluid and approachable, and the guest lecturers were amazing as well. ",
            "\u00a0I think I learned a good amount around the time of exams and papers but like I could just kind of figure stuff out then. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that the course was very well run. One strength is the inclusion of so many guest speakers with specialized knowledge about a specific writer or era, because I thought this wide range of voices each brought new and interesting insights to the course. This is not to say however, that I didn't enjoy Professor Eire's lectures, because these were also great. The set up is a very effective mixture of broad concepts, historical context, and primary sources, and the discussions always proved to be fruitful extensions of the lectures. ",
            "\u00a0More about mystics! ",
            "\u00a0The course makes use of numerous primary sources, which is wonderful. Sometimes the connections between is a little hard to draw, but that's the fun of the course, I suppose. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the class were numerous. Maybe some texts were a little rushed, but I'm not entirely sure what you could do about that. ",
            "\u00a0I really appreciated the guest lecturers. That made the class more interesting. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are the way that readings build off of each other and connect. I came away from the course understanding many of the important people and ideas in the Catholic Intellectual Tradition and had the opportunity to connect twentieth century Catholicism with the past. \r\n\r\nOne major weakness is the absence of discussion of Catholicism in the Americas, Asia, or Africa. ",
            "\u00a0The course is highly organized and II enjoyed all the readings. Yet I hope some of the guest lectures could be as engaging as Professor Eires. ",
            "\u00a0This course was especially strong for a number of reasons. Lectures and sections were equally gripping experiences (for different reasons, of course). Professor Eire and the TAs were straight-forward, invested in our learning experience and willing to meet outside of class. In terms of weaknesses, the lectures did not attempt to provide a historical backdrop for the texts. It would have been helpful to have an overview of Catholic / Church history to better place the readings. As well, it wasn't always clear what we were to draw from the readings, which were often quite dense, but nevertheless enjoyable. Perhaps this is merely because I myself am not a Catholic / have no experience reading theological/philosophical texts. That isn't at all to say that you need prior experience to take this class, however. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the lectures by Professor Eire and wish he lectured more throughout the course instead of bringing in guest lecturers with regularity. I sometimes felt that the messages of the course were conflicting as to what the Catholic intellectual tradition really is- it is still not entirely clear to me. Maybe this is because of the guest lecturers, but it was at times difficult to see the commonalities between authors we read and how they fit into the curriculum together.\r\n\r\nThe course was on a while was fantastic and a great way to reconnect with faith- Catholic or not. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent coverage of often neglected areas of Catholic philosophy and theology. ",
            "\u00a0This is an amazing course. I cannot say enough good things about the way that it is taught or organized. As a Catholic, was elated to learn that a course like this one was taught at Yale. I found no weaknesses in the way this course was taught. "

            "\u00a0Great class! The readings were so interesting and Professor Eire brought in the best guest lectors. ",

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course because it goes over one of the three big religions, and I think it is important to be able to understand a set of beliefs that is so influential today. ",
            "\u00a0Certainly. The course unravels the mysteries and myths surrounding Catholicism, and gives perspective on the influence and proceedings of the Catholic Church. For those who want to better understand the thought and practice of one of the world's most influential religions, look no further. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend that everyone take this course. Even if you aren't Catholic, there's so much to learn about how Catholicism has impacted our culture, and this class is taught in a way that allows you to learn without penalizing you for not having background information that other students might have. ",
            "\u00a0If you're a Catholic, I highly recommend this course. If you're not Catholic or non-Christian, I still highly recommend this course. The readings are very interesting and the workload is very manageable. This is a class that you'd want to definitely attend lectures and discussion sections. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! The lectures are diverse, varied and rewarding + the TAs really know what they are doing and how to break down the content. ",
            "\u00a0Really interesting; I'll remember some of these texts for the rest of my life (and I definitely plan to re-read them later!). The lectures are interesting, and the papers are really short. And the exams aren't hard, either, but they're all passage IDs and are therefore designed in such a way that you learn a lot by studying for them, instead of just cramming names and dates. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Catholic Intellectual Tradition is one of those courses that really makes you feel like you are getting the \"Yale\" education experience. It doesn't kill you with work, which is nice, and all of the readings are really very interesting. It's a class that makes you want to put in more time. If you're Catholic, definitely take this course. If you aren't, still definitely take it. It gives you the opportunity to approach ideas and history through a very specific cultural lens. Professor Eire is a superstar, but also so approachable and with such a clear interest in teaching. If you are looking for an interesting, enjoyable humanities class, I would definitely suggest you shop Catholic Intellectual Tradition. ",
            "\u00a0If you're really interested in Catholic stuff than yeah. But if you're someone who doesn't know that much about Catholicism then it might not be the move. I was probably the only non-catholic kid in my section. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student, whether they know nothing about Catholicism and are curious, grew up Catholic but want to learn more about their faith and the history behind it, or anything in between. Even if you have no religious feelings, it is an interesting history class with a great selection of readings and will help you to understand one of the longest-standing and most common world religions. I got a lot out of this course without a workload as stressful as that for my other courses. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, 100 percent. ",

            "\u00a0YES! I also think that if you are Catholic, like I am, it is extremely beneficial not only intellectually but culturally to investigate Catholic theology. That being said, the Catholic Intellectual Tradition is so rooted in Western thought that even if you are not Catholic you  can get a lot out of this class. ",
            "\u00a0Catholic Intellectual Tradition is a great class. Some weeks the reading load is quite heavy, but the readings are generally very interesting, so that makes it more enjoyable. Also, Professor Eire is a great lecturer. ",

            "\u00a0YES. I think everyone should try to understand one of the most influential religions in human history. ",
            "\u00a0I would 110% recommend this class to all students--Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, Atheist, Agnostic. Do not shy away from this class because it is centered around the Catholic tradition, as much of it influenced the western canon. Whereas many Yale classes involve the study of classic texts that we might think to read, this class exposed me to texts I wouldn't have even thought of reading on my own. Take this course-- incredibly enlightening and thought provoking. If you do, you'll surely do some soul-searching. ",
            "\u00a0This course was not exactly what I was expecting -- I was hoping for more history and timelines as compared to religious philosophy, which is really a matter of my not looking at the syllabus beforehand. If you would like to read a lot of the Catholic intellectual tradition in order to see the progression of opinions held by Catholic thinkers over time, then by all means, go ahead and take this class. If you're looking for history and don't want to read 20-100 pages per week, you won't be getting the most out of the class. ",
            "\u00a0This class is very popular for good reason. It gives a background in the major authors of great Catholic works and an overview of the major movements in Catholicism throughout history. At times, the class felt more like a philosophy class than a history class. Without being too much work, the class was thought provoking and enlightening. ",
