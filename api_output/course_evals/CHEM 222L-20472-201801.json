            "\u00a0I learned how to separate chemicals by filtration and distillation, and I learned how to identify chemicals based on TLC and IR, as well as how to analyze MP. I gained experience in the synthesis of liquid and solid products as well. ",
            "\u00a0How to run proper organic chemistry reactions ",
            "\u00a0Honestly I feel competent and capable in an organic chemistry lab now. Dr. DiMeglio is so much more iconic than Dr. G it's sad. I'm generally not a fan of labs (because of Gen Chem Lab) but honestly I went from being ambivalent about 222L to looking forward to it each week. It was so casual, and Dr. DiMeglio is so encouraging that I came out of this class actually understanding topics and lab techniques. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me to cement techniques I'd first encountered in CHEM 134L/136L, and also exposed me to new techniques and chemical processes. I developed a newfound comfort with many lab techniques, as well as a stronger sense of intuition regarding the mechanisms of certain chemical processes. I've applied some of this intuition to other classes and lab experiences, and I feel like a better lab scientist after taking this course. ",
            "\u00a0about as much I could've learned by myself in ten hours ",
            "\u00a0I got a very good insight into the laboratory processes and techniques used in organic chemistry. ",
            "\u00a0I gained exposure to synthetic chemistry labs and learned how to work with acids, bases and organic compounds in a more advanced fashion. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great introductory lab course. You learn the fundamentals in chemistry lab techniques. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about different techniques to separate and synthesize organic substances. ",
            "\u00a0Principles of purification including recrystallization, distillation, filtration etc. Practiced some of the reactions learned in class. ",

            "\u00a0The labs were very easy and manageable as long as a sufficiently comprehensive EP was prepared beforehand. The TA for the course was helpful in explaining theoretical concepts and in helping with the lab techniques. The independence students have in running the experiments can be stressful at times, but overall it helped me gain confidence in my work in a lab. ",
            "\u00a0weakness = arbitrary grading, becomes a points game, long standing hours \r\n*It would help to reduce the emphasis on grades. It is so easy to lose points in assignments for this course. \r\n\r\nstrengths = good instructors, helpful staff, good/fun environment ",
            "\u00a0This was an all around good class, and could potentially be improved by letting us work in partners for more than ~1 lab. I understand the reason for making us work individually, but even when we worked with partners, we did equally the amount of work and wanted to understand the theory behind the lab as much as we would if we were working individually. ",
            "\u00a0This course is mountains better than general chemistry lab and there was a much more relaxed atmosphere. I generally wouldn't change anything, the assignments and the procedures had plenty of support and guidance and I never felt overwhelmed or unsure of what I was doing. The only weakness was the one day we had to do two labs in the one sitting due to the snow week, that was pretty disorganized and confusing, but I understand that it was necessary. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very accommodating and does a good job of instilling various topics crucial to work as a chemist. ",
            "\u00a0Least annoying lab Ive taken at Yale. Weird rules to get used to at first, but then its fine. Its nice that there were only 2 lenghtier lab reports unlike other lab classes! ",
            "\u00a0I loved this class!! It was really fun to learn about the material in lecture and then see it on the bench. The final could have been better in matching the rest of the course in difficulty. (The final was absurdly difficult in comparison) ",
            "\u00a0Provide an answer key to the exam questions at the end of each experiment. That may make the course not require enough work from the student, though. ",
            "\u00a0Well organized. TA is chill. Best delivery of this content possible. ",
            "\u00a0Reasonable amount of work for .5 credit class. The class environment is very positive and relaxed. I learned a ton! \r\n\r\n\r\nI wish that an emphasis on theoretical understanding of what we were doing throughout the class and not just during the final. Before then, it felt like cookbook chemistry but it all really came together in the end \r\n\r\nSometimes the grading was nit picky and took points off for very specific structural things "
