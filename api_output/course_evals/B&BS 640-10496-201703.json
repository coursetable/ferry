            "\u00a0Grant writing skill; scientific communication skill; time management skill ",
            "\u00a0We learned some basics about the NIH F31 fellowship and the review process. We developed research plans for the fellowship and engaged in peer editing to polish the documents ",
            "\u00a0I acquired a more comprehensive understanding of what the grant writing process entails and practice in writing in a new style. ",
            "\u00a0This class was tremendously valuable for not only learning how to write an F31 grant, but for all formal scientific writing. The class was great for learning scientific writing, a topic not formally learned by most. ",
            "\u00a0This class was super useful for learning how to organize the scientific proposal for a grant application - how to develop your ideas and present them in a clear, logical manner while also selling their importance. The instructors also offered some basic style advice on scientific writing in general, which was especially helpful for me since I had not done much science writing outside of undergrad classes. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my writing and editing skills, learned about aspects of writing (in particular grant writing) that are useful in science. I strengthened my ability to think conceptually about experiments, and my ability to explain them to others in and outside my field. I also developed my ability to critically evaluate others' writing and experiments. ",
            "\u00a0The course presented the process applying for an F31 grant. Every week, a written portion of the grant was to be submitted for feedback by instructors. I gained a good understanding of what is required for a clearly written grant. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a tremendous amount about grant writing and the NIH grant review process. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write the research plan of an NIH grant in this course. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me prepare a F31 application, which I submitted for the December 8th deadline. I was able to hone my scientific writing skills and learn strategies to efficiently write competitive grants. ",
            "\u00a0I had written one NIH style grant for my qualification exam but had yet to take a formal course on the subject ",
            "\u00a0I've  learned how to write a grant proposal effectively and what specific aspect does the reviewer specifically looked for. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about:\r\n-Relevant material to include in a grant application\r\n-Structure of grant application\r\n-Personal statement \r\n-Key words to include in application\r\n-Hw to strenghten the application "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The overall strength is that it puts grant writing in perspective of the application process, and it provides us with actionable timeline to get the writing done.  \r\n\r\nThe weakness is that I wish it is co-taught by two faculty members, so the written grant can be actually reviewed by faculty (not TA). ",
            "\u00a0The course needs to give more attention to the supporting documents. It should have examples of what is expected for them, some tips on formatting and a general expectation of what kinds of things the writer should want to emphasize. However, the discussions on the research plan were helpful. Though feedback delays would make some revisions of documents in the course come up just before the feedback was received from the previous version. These delays began to defeat the purpose of the feedback/revision process. ",
            "\u00a0This class took my knowledge and experience writing grants from a literal zero to a more comfortable working knowledge and an awareness of what I need to work on to improve. That was incredibly valuable! The level of care and effort that the TAs and Dr. Politi put in was unexpected and very appreciated. \r\n\r\nI appreciated receiving feedback on drafts but it would have been much more helpful to receive it several days before the next draft was due instead of after. This would allow time to incorporate feedback on any consistent problems into the next section draft. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure if it is feasible but it would be great if peer review took place in smaller, more topically related sections. I felt like I couldn't offer much scientific critique to most of the papers I read because they were so far outside of my field. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: great for learning scientific writing; skills learned extend beyond writing the NIH F31\r\nWeakness: This is not a comment on the specific class per se, but it would be nice if there were versions of this class geared towards different departments. This class was in the pathology department so the instructors just had more of a background in related topics. It could have been helpful to have instructors that had more of a background in other biological disciplines, although this did not significantly detract from the feedback received. ",
            "\u00a0I think the biggest strength in this class is the amount of feedback we get on our writing - not just from the instructors but also from our peers. The peer review sessions were really productive and helpful. I also liked the organization of the class - how essentially a draft of one section was due every week. This made is feel less overwhelming, even though it did take a lot more of my time than most grad classes at Yale have. \r\nThe one unfortunate thing I can think of is that our draft for the approach section for aim 2 was due before we got our instructor feedback on aim 1, which probably led to us making the same mistakes twice and a little bit of wasted time/effort. However, I understand that giving us feedback takes time, so I'm not sure whether it's feasible to fix this. ",
            "\u00a0This course was great for its personalized feedback, and the sequence of lectures and assignments. The beginning of the course is somewhat slower-paced than the ending. This is in part because the writing sections become more lengthy, but it might be useful to concentrate the smaller assignments in less time towards he beginning of the semester, and leave more than 1 week for the bigger sections. I also wish the due dates were at the end of the weekend, rather than midnight on Monday- makes it difficult to improve the writing as much as possible while also attending to important tasks on Mondays.\r\n\r\nFeedback after the first approach section, and before the 2nd is due would be useful so that the comments could be incorporated into writing the 2nd approach section. I felt like a lot of the mistakes that were pointed out on my first approach section I had done in writing the 2nd section as well.\r\n\r\nThe peer review sections were really useful both for learning about different strategies for approaching the writing, but also for getting feedback from people who were less familiar with our research field. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: presentations on the various grant parts as well as how to work with the mentors and collaborators on letters of support; the writing was done in segments and wasn't overwhelming; feedback by peers and instructors was very helpful \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I took this course while also working on my qualifying prospectus. While the two are complementary, there are certain requirements that differed between the two documents and it was difficult at times to keep up with both. This is not a weakness of the course per se, but students will benefit most if they can only focus on the F31 itself. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: It was very helpful to have many people with different scientific backgrounds read my proposal. It was also helpful to have examples of successful proposals.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This class really helped me prepare a strong specific aims page and research proposal, but I felt fairly lost when writing the other portions of the grant. It would have been helpful to go over the other portions of the grant. Also, it would have been very helpful to have an entire grant with all of the documents as an example. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were the required deadlines which ensured students completed assignments. The instructors also clearly dedicate a great deal of time to peer review, which was much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe weaknesses of this course were that the actual class time was mostly a waste of time, other than the presentation and peer review days. Worksheets on passive voice etc. are not needed, and the bulk of the information presented is basically common sense. To improve this course the lecture time could easily be reduced and more time spent on peer review. The assignments were also due at a silly time, Monday night instead of Tuesday at class time. The rationale \"people can't go to RIP talks Tuesday mornings then\" is not valid. If the person wanted to go to the RIP talks, their own procrastination by not doing the assignment earlier is not a reasonable excuse. Having the assignments due Monday night added an extra stressor, and it was incredibly annoying to have all this extra time before the afternoon class Tuesday, with my assignments already turned in. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, this course, at least my impression of the course, was that it was marketed to have students produce a complete NIH grant by the end of the term. This was not the reality of the course. The course instead does only what it says \"develop and write a scientific research proposal\" meaning only the specific aims and research plan. There are many many other documents that were required for the submission of the NIH F31 which was not made as abundantly clear as it should have been. We spent the entire semester on the research plan (which is important and was done well), but in the future a detailed checklist should be provided and gone over at the start of the course with reminders throughout. Examples of complete NIH F31 grants need to be provided for this course so students can actually see what a full grant will look like and how to adapt the structure for their own research. Writing all the supplemental documents at the very end was extremely stressful, as in class these were waived off as a minor addendum, which they certainly are not. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course was its ability to prepare students to write the \"Research Design\" portion of the F31. Each section of the document was broken down and feedback was received from multiple instructors. In addition, the group meetings in which each student was able to receive feedback from both instructors and other students was very helpful in revising the document.\r\n\r\nA weaknesses of the class is that there is much less emphasis on the other F31 documentation. Another class or two on how to write and compile the non-science related documents would be beneficial to ensure that students know exactly which sections they are responsible for. In addition, making the extraneous documents due for those who plan to submit in December may help them craft a better application by getting feedback on the entire fellowship.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there were some classes in which not all of the time was used or discussions were dragged out longer than necessary. If this is the case, these times could be used for students to begin preparing sections of their application and allow them to ask instructors questions while formulating their ideas. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were the breakdown and the   numerous chances to get feedback.\r\nWeakness is that its a new course ",
            "\u00a0This course is well organized which take us through the whole process of how to write a NIH predoctoral fellowship. I like how the instructors not only take care of our writing part but also teach us how to design the figures within the grant. Additionally, I like giving other people feedbacks as well as receiving feedback from others. I think this is a great learning process and experience for preparing our future career especially in academia.\r\n\r\nOne thing that I think could improve is the loading for peer review is  quite heavy because we have to review four full grant in one week, so we don't have enough time to totally understand other people's grant.

            "\u00a0I would recommend the course because of the mechanism it offers to get some feedback on your research proposal from a large group of people. However, I don't think the course fully prepares students to submit the entire fellowship application. I think dedicating more classes for providing document feedback would be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this to any graduate student as critical for gaining skills to be a successful researcher. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely would recommend this class to others. This is one of the most useful classes I have ever taken. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely. Even though I won't actually be submitting my application (at least not yet), it was a very useful exercise and helped me with another application I was working on during the class as well. I think all the grad students should receive this kind of training (in this form or another), since communication is an integral part of science. ",

            "\u00a0Yes because this course made it much easier to write an F31. Also, I believe that my final proposal was stronger because of the changes I made based on feedback from the instructors and my peers. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It can definitely be improved, but it is a nice class to experience the writing of a research plan and to familiarize oneself with the grant writing process. ",
            "\u00a0Even if you are not planning on submitting an F31 I would recommend this course (it may be beneficial to institute a course that focuses just on scientific writing for those who are not preparing a fellowship application). The work I produced as a result of this class was not only used as my F31, but was also used for my qualification exam. Students who take this course become equipped with the skills necessary to write clear, concise scientific proposals. Even if one feels they are comfortable writing such documents, this course gives students the ability to practice these skills and enhance and weaknesses in their writing style. The instructors and teach fellows are very engaged and give constructive criticism on all assignments. ",
