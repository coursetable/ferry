            "\u00a0There's a LOT of work, but you do get to make an intervention from start to finish. I wish there was more practicality in it -so basically we were forced to implement some part of it or something, so that we couldn't be so lofty in our intervention. I wish we did more intervention analysis on real interventions outside the research space (i.e. case studies) or campaigns, mobile interventions, hospital admin interventions etc which would have helped students who are not necessarily entering the research or non-profit space. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The end product of the course, the intervention manual, is an incredible accomplishment. I'm proud of it and am grateful that we got interim, timely feedback on each section.\r\n\r\nImprovements: the lectures themselves were not that helpful in my opinion. The slides didn't keep my attention. I really enjoyed the exercise we did where we got into groups to discuss outcomes evaluation strategies. I think those exercises are much more effective to retain knowledge than dry lectures. I would break into groups every class to discuss the topic of that day. ",
            "\u00a0More in-class time to work in groups ",
            "\u00a0I think it is a great course for people who are interested in intervention design, but I don't think that is everyone in SBS. \r\nI don't think it should be a requirement for the department, there were other classes I wish I had the opportunity to take in place of this one. \r\n\r\nThat said, I think it was a well organized and instructive course. I just struggled to be really engaged with the content as it is not an area of public health I will be involved with in my career. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a great experience for me. Very helpful to put into practice so many of the things that we've learned over the last two years, especially with most of the SBS cohort in one room and in formats that we'll likely be working with in the future. The tough feedback from Trace and Mahaya is excellent - I'm very grateful for that, and always want to be told when I'm wrong. \r\n\r\nThe major negative was that some of the classroom sessions where the entire class was giving feedback were a little harsh - people were very sharp, and not respectful. I was surprised by this. I know it's a competitive and critical group, and the feedback is absolutely necessary, but the classroom environment could have been managed a little better in that respect. ",
            "\u00a0Its great. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: similar to a capstone project, this course allows students to use the skills they have learned throughout the MPH program and put them all together to create an intervention. I really liked how this course allows students to be innovative, while challenging them to think critically and thoroughly evaluate and research the problem they're looking at.\r\nWeaknesses: it's group project based, which can always have issues. Having more structure and support for how groups should handle the workload would be good. There was also a lot of overlap in assignments, so making the guidelines for each assignment more distinct could help solve this. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- What I expect SBS students to consider doing post-grad, so it was nice to have a taste of that firsthand\r\n- Really interesting projects\r\n- Sweet to have one last class with other SBS students\r\n- Open to non-SBS students, which brought differing perspectives\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Experience of the course highly dependent upon group members ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: It does what is says on the box. I feel confident that I could design a health promotion.\r\nWeaknesses: Lots of writing and revising, sometimes the feedback wasn't easy to understand/we didn't quite know what Prof. was wanting us to change ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Teaches about the importance of attention to detail, teamwork, and critical thinking regarding what determinants can be influenced and how (oftentimes with the realization that interventions are an iterative process and changing these determinants is not that simple)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: A lot of work, the lecture itself could be much shorter given the practical nature of the course ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: You really know the best methods for developing a health promotion intervention\r\nWeaknesses: Would recommend that first years take this class. It is difficult to balance this coursework while also completing a thesis. ",
            "\u00a0Pretty poor. Did not like this class. It was a comprehensive class, but too much work. Honestly seemed to be an aggressive amount of work producing something that will never get used in the real world. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a lot of work. It felt almost like a second thesis, but it was the most practical course of my MPH. ",
            "\u00a0It was nice to have feedback throughout the intervention development process, but I don't particularly feel like I learned any new methods or approaches to public health research or practice. This might also be because as a second-year, I'd already taken several methods classes, and so it just seemed that we were applying them in a slightly different way. ",
            "\u00a0This class does a good job of breaking up an entire intervention into manageable parts. I think it would be nice to have an overview of every section (1 class describing each section overview) and then go more in-depth for each class. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided an opportunity to fully engage with intervention and evaluation concepts. Although it being theoretical had a number of advantages and drawbacks, the chance to create an intervention from scratch allowed me to learn the amount of thought and planning involved in creating an intervention. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - I did not know much previously about interventions and ways in which to evaluate them (both process and outcomes). That was extremely helpful and helped me to think about other courses/ programs in a different light. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - I feel like this either needs to be a real life partnership with an actual CBO or group, or alternatively a hypothetical project with a non-vulnerable (e.g., students, faculty) group as the intervention target. It felt uncomfortable talking to CBOs about a hypothetical project that was not even possible to deliver to them. It just felt weird. ",

It's so clear that he cares about our learning experience.\r\n\r\nImprovements: Trace's lecture style is pretty dry and it affected the amount of information I was able to retain. The subject matter itself is dry, so it would help if Trace came up with a way to not just lecture on it, but do something else like my breaking into groups more often idea from above, or something even more impactful.

            "\u00a0Trace was great to learn from, especially given his wealth of experience. Nothing but positive things to say, aside from grading -- his point system (e.g., -0.3, etc.) felt a little arbitrary, at times (though he was thorough in and timely with feedback). Wonderful course, wonderful instructor. ",

            "\u00a0Trace was great one-on-one, but lecturing is definitely not is strength. It was funny when the first hour of class was an ambling walk through some of the prepared slides, followed by group sharing that took up the rest of the time. We got work done, which was nice, but in terms of engaged teaching in the classroom setting? That wasn't really the case, but it didn't also need to be. ",
