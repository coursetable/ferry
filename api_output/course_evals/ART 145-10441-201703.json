            "\u00a0We learned a lot about video editing and really spent a good amount of time talking about video as an art form itself and ways that different artists have been making innovative work with it. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to work with the Adobe Creative Suite (more specifically Premiere, After Effects, and Photoshop). I also learned how to think more critically about how we interact with media such as digital video. Last but not least, I learned how to create digital art video ! ",

            "\u00a0Great class overall! ",
            "\u00a0This course is the only course I found at Yale which gives students full freedom for creative expression. The assignments were designed in such a way that we could make them our own. This was extremely satisfying and liberating. It also fostered a new way of learning. When left with minimum guidelines, we started thinking for ourselves and reflecting deeply about what we really wanted to create. ",
            "\u00a0Good introduction to general concepts, although the grading and assessments could be made less subjective and more objective. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely take this class! It really opened my eyes to a whole new area that I am interested in! ",
            "\u00a0Yes ! Absolutely, if you are interested in media/video/art, you should take this class ! Not only does it give you exposure to really nice editing softwares, it also makes you think about how important media has become and how we can communicate through video. Last but not least, Justin is an amazing professor and artist who shares his deep passion for the medium with his students. He is very supportive and will help you grow artistically over the course of the semester. 10/10 would recommend. ",
            "\u00a0Anyone interested in digital video as a medium, or simply in creating interesting, original art, should look into this course. "
