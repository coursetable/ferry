            "\u00a0In just one semester, I already feel equipped with enough knowledge to go to France on my own and navigate. The immersive teaching strategy was new to me but something I am so grateful to have experienced. The entire structure of the course from the compositions to the course packet to the french in action videos collectively was very effective. I learned various tenses, grammar, vocabulary, and colloquialisms. I enjoyed french music videos as well. I was surprised by how much I was picking up so quickly. ",
            "\u00a0I developed good writing and speaking skills. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt a lot about the way of life of French people and how to express myself using simple french. ",
            "\u00a0Really good experience. Really good practice of oral skills. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The course demands engagement. The class sizes are small, so you have to engage. The homework assignments each night along with the weekly tests made sure that we did not put french on the back burner as a course. I liked the 2 projects we did in the class that were composed of oral presentations because it was great practice. The oral production parts of the tests were the most intimidating, but they became easier over the weeks and will make me better at French in the end. One major strength of the course was Madame DeVos, who makes french come alive. Her engaging personality and obvious love for French and the Francophone culture is infectious. Take the class for her. ",
            "\u00a0Good class interaction. Could be improved by slowing down the teaching of materials. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very interactive but at so e points, it was a little fast paced. ",
            "\u00a0The class is excellent though it's also a lot of work. Yet it's definitely worth and Jessica is one of the best instructors I've had at Yale. "

            "\u00a0I absolutely would recommend this course to another student. If you have even the slightest interest in learning French, take this course and you will be sure within the first few classes that it is a beautiful language and worth the time. Whether you have an aptitude for learning languages or not, there are many resources available to stay on course in the French department : french tables, office hours, etc. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend to slower the course of the class so that students can have more time to study the passages and absorb the material. ",
            "\u00a0yes. I loved it all through. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely! But you should be aware that there is a lot of homework almost every single day! "
