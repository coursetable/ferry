            "\u00a0I learned about biotech valuation and pharmaceutical market forecasting. I learned about different classes of drugs and their mechanisms. ",
            "\u00a0This class was one of my favorites. I came away with real skills (such as market forecasting) and learned a ton in the process. ",
            "\u00a0A framework that combined both scientific and economic concepts to learn how companies go through the drug development process. ",
            "\u00a0The content learned in Econ 463 sits at the nexus of economics, medicine/biology, and finance. We learned about the drug development process both from the lens of drug creation, including the biological underpinnings of certain diseases and drug mechanisms of action, and through the financial lens, in terms of a drugs valuation and its reception in the market. We read drug labels, case studies of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, textbook chapters on the drug discovery and selling process, and learned from experts in the biotech and pharmaceutical field. For the final project, we wrote an extremely comprehensive report for a biotech companys initiation, and modeled the companys earnings going forward. This project was incredibly challenging, but truly one of the most fulfilling assignments I have done during my time at Yale. "

            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the midterm and final projects but wished we did a full market forecast for a drug as a class before embarking on our own. ",
            "\u00a0This is one of the top three classes I have taken in my four years at Yale and it is undoubtedly the best Economics class that I have taken in completing the major. Dr. Dash and Dr. Raskin are extremely knowledgable and engaging professors and they made sure that each and every class that we had was packed with information and enjoyable activities. The guest lecturers that they brought in were all remarkable and added even more enjoyable content to the course, helping students connect what we have learned in class with work that actually happens in the biotech industry. I think that the only possible weakness to the course is the midterm and final assignments are quite lengthy, but I after completing the assignments, I realized that the effort was worth it because they teach valuable and relevant skills that will translate into skills that will help with work that is done in the industry as well. Overall, this course had countless strengths and I am so glad that I took it. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: two engaging professors with a lot of interesting experience in medicine and biotech. Very well structured class--I appreciated that classes were interactive and full of conversation and debate. Reasonable reading load that I usually found very interesting. Topics covered in class are relevant to ongoing social and political issues today. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I did not understand the nature of the midterm and final assignments when I signed up for this class. I would have preferred to write about aspects of the course that were more interesting to me and that were less modeling-heavy. Perhaps the instructors could describe the midterm and final in more detail during the first class. Additionally, I would have enjoyed a greater variety of majors in the course as occurred in previous years (though I recognize the challenges posed by course designation in the economics department). ",
            "\u00a0The classes were filled with lots of material and covered a broad range of topics, so it is hard to add more time for discussion, but I think it might improve the course to have more discussion throughout lectures. I thought the exercises we did in groups towards the end of classes were helpful for digesting the case studies and other material. ",
            "\u00a0The course had both STEM and Economics major students, so much of the course material was new to either contingent of the class. The course instruction was great even for those with no prior knowledge and could get anyone up to speed by the end of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: informal atmosphere created facilitated conversation well, interesting topics, engaging professors\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: classes are a little repetitive when we discuss cases, the fake investor presentations were a nice change of pace for example ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the class are that it was very organized, informative, and thought-provoking. This class could potentially be improved with additional modeling/valuation/Excel prep to prepare students for both the midterm and final. Also, I very much enjoyed the last debate, so perhaps more of those! "

            "\u00a0Yes, this is a really good senior seminar to take as an Econ major. The two hours went by very quickly each week largely thanks to Dr. Raskin and Dr. Dash's contagious energy and the incredible group of guest speakers they brought into class. The midterm and final assignments are not the most intellectually creative assignments but they are very helpful in really developing a comprehensive grasp of the material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, great course with great professors. ",
            "\u00a0This course was probably the best class in the Econ department that I've taken at Yale! Dr. Raskin and Dr. Dash are both incredibly knowledgeable about the material, and the course was very engaging. I would definitely recommend this class to another student! ",
            "\u00a0YES, take this class! The professors are really nice and experienced in their field, which made the class super interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would undoubtedly recommend this course to anyone who is an Econ major or is at all interested in the biotech industry. Dr. Dash and Dr. Raskin both have valuable experience in the biotech industry and are remarkably knowledgable about the field and about the concepts that are underlying the industry. I can honestly say that each and every class for this course was a treat. Between going through business case studies, learning about drug development, listening to founders and CEOs of biotech companies, and having Dr. Dash and Dr. Raskin explain scientific concepts, I learned so much through this course and it definitely increased my interest in biotech as a future career path. I think that Dr. Dash and Dr. Raskin were great lecturers. They work very well together to co-teach this class and their lecturing was very engaging, lively, and also funny. Overall, this class is an absolute must and was among the very best I have taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course if you are interested in biotech or medicine. The course discussions and readings were interesting and engaging, and the professors created an enjoyable atmosphere. Weekly workload is reasonable, but the midterm and final assignments are rather difficult and lengthy, especially if you don't have experience in biotech valuation and market forecasting. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a gem I'd recommend to anyone interested in medicine or economics. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in biotech from any career standpoint. As someone with a science background, it was good to learn more about the business side of drug development and the structure of clinical trials. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are interested in biotech investing or the marketing of drugs, this is a fantastic course to explore those with no prior knowledge required. ",
            "\u00a0:))) ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! It is challenging, but incredibly fulfilling, and wholly worth taking. "
