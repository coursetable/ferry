            "\u00a0Great overall. First 5 weeks are not what you'd expect for a class on the Olympics. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about different issues with the Olympics and athletics in general and engaged in meaningful conversations about how we view other people and athletes ",
            "\u00a0Very interesting and different view of how the Olympics plays into history ",
            "\u00a0We focused a ton of ancient history of athletes, sports, and olympics games, while also seeing the trends from then to now. Seeing what beliefs and practices we took from the ancient Greek in Sport. ",
            "\u00a0How to debate and take on modern day issues with both reference to modern and ancient texts as well as through poignant conversation. ",

            "\u00a0Very good course. ",
            "\u00a0I think more time could be spent on the modern material and less on the ancient ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were the seminar set up that allowed everyone to engage and argue and understand different points of view. The readings were super interesting and thought provoking. I really liked the presentations. No weaknesses ",
            "\u00a0George is great and class is very interesting and engaging! ",

            "\u00a0Yes if you want stimulating discussions and a more chill course, this is good for you. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. If you are interested in sports or the Olympics it was interesting to learn the history and origins ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would. It totally changed my perspective towards the Olympics and invited me to challenge different views instead of just accepting them ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely it was a very discussion based class but they were very interesting and I wanted to engage in conversation ",
            "\u00a0YES YES YES YES. Not to sound bias but you will love this if you are a classics major, love Greek history or if you are an athlete. It is super interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Take this class immediately. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. While it was interesting being in the class as an athlete with many other athletes, I believe that anyone would enjoy this class. It was fascinating to study topics including race, gender, and the natural body all through the lens of the Olympic Games. Having many different perspectives from many different students allowed for great conversation in every seminar meeting. Although this class meets early on Thursday mornings, I really do not think the early start time should discourage anyone from participating. ",
            "\u00a0Yes because it was very cool to see all the components of the Olympics together "
