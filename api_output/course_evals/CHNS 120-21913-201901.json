The vocabulary we acquired is highly applicable for everyday conversations to be able to make our way around a Chinese city and get to know someone in Chinese. We learned grammatical structures, expressions, and the origins of the characters we learn to gain an appreciation for the Chinese language and culture. ",
            "\u00a0Taking the two semesters of Chinese brought me to a basic level of fluency in Chinese to have simple conversations on a range of subjects. I think I have also learned enough grammar that continuing to learn the language on my own after college will also be easier. ",

I think we only spent one day fully focused on characters, and that was probably my favorite class. Also I really enjoyed the character quizlet competition we had. ",

            "\u00a0This course is probably the best taught class I have taken at Yale. The rigor with daily written and oral homeworks, character practice and quizzes allows us to acquire the material progressively through practice and repetition. Class is engaging both in its teaching and conversation, and all the Chinese teachers are remarkable - I loved Li Laoshis class. ",
