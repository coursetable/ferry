            "\u00a0Learned about the concepts behind MRI, fMRI, EEG, and several other imaging techniques! Also learned about methods of analyzing data gathered from these techniques and ways to apply them to answer questions of interest. Has really helped me understand the pros and cons of various research methods, which is especially relevant when considering study designs. ",
            "\u00a0In-depth introduction to the principles behind and applications of a wide array of neuroscience research techniques, including PET, fMRI, EEG, MEG, TMS, and others. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the fundamentals of fMRI, PET, EEG, and other brain imaging techniques. I also learned the basics of how to design experiments. ",
            "\u00a0I think this is a great survey course of methods used in human neuroscience research. Would highly recommend for anyone working in/thinking about working in a neuroscience lab and/or writing a thesis involving neuroscience methods. ",
            "\u00a0I gained so much knowledge in this class. It is an incredibly comprehensive course covering fMRI physics, the biophysics of why imaging works, experimental design techniques, and statistical analysis tactics. The amount of information covered was a lot, but all very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of in-depth knowledge about fMRI research in particular, although we covered a lot of other research methods as well. I particularly enjoyed the focus on learning concepts through demonstrations and analogies rather than just looking at the math. ",
            "\u00a0Overview of nearly all methods of neuroimaging, their advantages, their origin, and some of the physics behind them ",
            "\u00a0I learned about how fMRI, EEG, PET, and other neuroimaging methods work. I also learned about their practical uses in medicine and research. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a well-taught exploration into the methods used in modern human neuroscience. It did a great job explaining each technique and pairs well with the lab course in which you get hands on experience using the data acquisition and analysis tools you learn about in this class. ",
            "\u00a0I learned many of the fundamental tools that are used in human neuroscience research, such as fMRI, DTI, PET, SPECT, EEG, ERP, MEG, NIRS, TMS, tDCS, and the ways they are practically applied in the field. ",
            "\u00a0Maybe the first class at yale in which i actually learned something. Amazing survey of imagin techniques ",
            "\u00a0I learned all about the difference methods that research neuroscientists engaging to measure and inquire about brains. "

            "\u00a0Definitely enjoyed Professor McCarthy's lectures! They were very thorough, engaging, and well-put-together. The recaps, in-class demos, and different ways the material were presented really helped me understand what was going on. Great course overall. ",
            "\u00a0The course was designed very well to place techniques in a logical developmental context. Each technique was clearly described in terms of how it is useful both independently and relative to other methods. Most lectures start with a recap of the previous day's material, which is occasionally unnecessary, but guarantees that as long as you are engaged class, you really can't fall behind on the material. ",
            "\u00a0The course was relatively well organized (and especially organized on canvas). Professor McCarthy is also a clear speaker who is very patient. ",
            "\u00a0I think that reading responses/once weekly discussion might make the course feel more collaborative, engage all students, and help improve understanding of material before exams. In addition, it eases the stress if there are opportunities to demonstrate knowledge before the exams (i.e., when there are graded assignments besides exams). ",
            "\u00a0Very engaging course, my favorite neuroscience course in three years ",
            "\u00a0This course was taught really well. I wasnt in the lab section, but I thought that the lecture course was able to cover each topic really well. ",
            "\u00a0Dr. McCarthy is an excellent lecturer. The material is very interesting, but very dense. I found it hard to keep up if I didnt understand a topic immediately in class. I may have benefited from additional written materials, in addition to the textbook. ",
            "\u00a0Although it was a small classroom setting, there was very little room for student involvement in the course other than asking questions during class. More opportunities for student participation would be appreciated. ",
            "\u00a0No weaknesses mccarthy is amazing he explains concepts with grace and is always available if you are having trouble ",
            "\u00a0A huge strength was simply Professor McCarthy's absolutely fascinating seminars. I felt that I left class genuinely understanding most topics. I also really enjoyed the accessibility of lectures and notes online. As a disability student, this was incredibly important for me.\r\n\r\nI would say one weakness might be that because there were only three exams that determines the entirety of our grades I was consistently very stressed about those exams. I wish there was maybe one or two homework assignments to balance that out. "

            "\u00a0Would recommend, especially for those doing neuroscience research involving imaging! After taking this course, many neuroscience paper methods sections make a lot more sense, and you begin to understand the rationale behind many study design decisions. It also has made speaking to people about their research and study designs a lot more interesting. ",
            "\u00a0This is the best class I have taken at Yale. For anyone who has a basic background in neuroscience and is at all interested in research, either practically or abstractly, I can't recommend this class enough. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This class is very interesting and the material is exciting and engaging, especially if you have an interest in human neuroscience. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student who is very interested in neuroscience. It was a very difficult course, but incredibly informative and worthwhile. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you want to learn about research methods from someone who has used them all and can teach them with a focus on conceptual understanding rather then the math and/or CS side of things, it is a great course. ",
            "\u00a0Would absolutely recommend to anyone interested in neuroimaging. The lectures were very engaging and Prof. McCarthy always finds times for some humor. Super accessible to all skill levels. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Professor McCarthy provides really clear lectures and the material is extremely interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend to another student who is interested in getting a broad overview of the kinds of neuroscience laboratory measurements that are possible. ",

            "\u00a0Yes. This course is amazing. Great teacher, interesting topics, totally worth it. Everything you learn in this class can be applied to today. Its great. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely yes. I was someone who was incredibly disillusioned with science at Yale, and this class single-handedly revived my interest in continuing stem education. Professor McCarthy was genuinely passionate about the topic and was capable of explaining does topics to us in a way that was accessible. "
