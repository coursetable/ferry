            "\u00a0I gained a knowledge of themes in Russian literature and how these have related to Russia's experience as an empire over years. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this course because after learning so much about Russia and Eastern Europe for my major it all starts to repeat itself, but in this class I got to look at the same history from an interesting new perspective which lent itself to the selection of completely different literary materials than what I had encountered in previous classes. I can't think of any literature on the syllabus that I had read before, which made the whole semester exciting. The secondary reading that we did on empires in general and Russia in particular has given me a new lens to use when thinking about history and modern geopolitics. The interdisciplinary approach was well thought-out and opened up complex dimensions of all the material, which made the reading more enjoyable and paper writing interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Russian literature and history; Russian imperialism ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the Russian conception of empire and its own imperialism. I also developed a greater understanding of the Russian periphery and the perspectives of those who live in those regions. "

            "\u00a0This is a very good course. It has the potential to be an excellent course. The reading lit is fantastic, Professor Bojanowska is knowledgeable and helpful, and the material is relevant to contemporary discussions. However, I felt quite strongly that there was an unreasonable amount of assigned reading and film watching. The weekly mandatory film screenings took up a lot of time, and I didn't feel that they particularly added to the class. I also felt that the reading was consistently too heavy to finish and process effectively, especially as a major with many similar classes. ",
            "\u00a0A major weakness of this course was the film series. With the exception of 12 (which was excellent and I am better for having seen it) I felt that the film screenings were not a good use of my time. It is a big ask to have students come in for a few hours outside of class almost every week to watch films in addition to all of the other reading that we were assigned. And to make it worse, I disliked almost all of the films immensely and did not feel that our best discussions stemmed from them. I think Professor Bojanowska was under the impression that the reading was generally light with a few exceptional heavy weeks, but really it was the opposite. Most weeks were rather heavy (not outrageous, but a respectable pile of (usually) very readable material) with a few exceptions when the selections were rather small. Over all I felt that the selections were made with a healthy respect for both the integrity of the material and our time, but the reading would still have been plenty without the films. There was also some discussion in class about whether Professor Bojanowska should expand the Siberia unit. I would suggest against that because the literature from that unit was by far the most boring of the semester. The secondary material about considering Siberia a colony or not a colony based on Russia's desired relationship with the West, or global imperial/national trends etc is interesting and crucial and I would keep it all. But rather than making more time for Dostoevsky and Sakhalin Island I would take a very targeted approach to selections from those materials, including only what is necessary to elucidate the secondary readings. ",
            "\u00a0Ideal combination of history, literature, current events, film ",
            "\u00a0I loved the readings for this course (many of them great works from Russian literature), and how Professor Bojanowska used the diverse bodies of work to illustrate Russia's various perspectives on empire. The films were also very interesting, but they seemed less important to our overall understanding of empire, and if this course is offered again I think they should be optional. "

            "\u00a0Yes, I would. This is a very good course. It has the potential to be an excellent course. The reading lit is fantastic, Professor Bojanowska is knowledgeable and helpful, and the material is relevant to contemporary discussions. However, I felt quite strongly that there was an unreasonable amount of assigned reading and film watching. The weekly mandatory film screenings took up a lot of time, and I didn't feel that they particularly added to the class. I also felt that the reading was consistently too heavy to finish and process effectively, especially as a major with many similar classes. I would recommend the class with the caveat that it is a lot of work and requires priority in your schedule. ",
            "\u00a0This is a well taught and engaging course that I would recommend to students interested in Russian history/culture or theories of modern geopolitics especially as they pertain to Russia. Expertise in the field is not a barrier to entry, but someone who knows a lot about Russia in general will still encounter many new ideas and literary works. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. One of the best history classes for history majors and non-history majors alike; well-taught, multidisciplinary; in-depth exploration of rich literary tradition ",
            "\u00a0This was a great course. The workload is a little high around the midterm and final, but Professor Bojanowska is an incredibly intelligent woman with a great eye for readings (even if there are a lot of them sometimes). "
