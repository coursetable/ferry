            "\u00a0This class opened up a whole new part of the world in a way that other international focused classes have not. Because it focuses on the culture of Iran, and the politics that drives it, the class touches on much more than the abstract. It helps students understand how and why culture in this region has developed, and learn a great deal about the government systems, and how and why they formed this way. I think this class is especially important, as Americans have a very limited, and often misguided, understanding of Iran, and the people within it. This class, more than anything, humanizes far away cultures, that the mass media in the US describes as \"regime driven\" and as an opposition state. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me a colorful and intimate introduction to modern Iranian culture -- I truly feel that this course widened my worldview and taught me to hear, interpret, and engage with the artistic production of  a society and culture far removed from my own, yet accessible and recognizable to me in surprising ways. ",
            "\u00a0This was an incredible look at modern cultural production in Iran. I learned so much about the culture and politics of Iran, and I came away knowing much more than I expected to know on the subject. Nahid is a great professor in this regardshe clearly knows her shit. At Yale, where it's pretty hard to get any class that gives you an in-depth look at modern Middle Eastern culture, this was a breath of fresh air. ",
            "\u00a0You learn so much in this course  about specific musicians/movements/movies/moments in Iran. Its a course that really gives you new insight into a rich culture  and you come away with lots of new knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the structure of Iranian governance and how a lot of the policies were vague to begin with, allowing officials to prosecute as per their own beliefs. I also learned how to analyze the social conditions that produce cultural forms like film, music and journalism. "

            "\u00a0This course was highly instructive and interesting, but the workload was quite high. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this class are that you come away learning a lot. The weaknesses are many, including: an incredibly high workload, the fact that \"class discussion\" is more a space where students regurgitate facts from the reading and aren't allowed to have debates/in-depth discussion, and an instructor who actively calls people out in seminar. The environment of the class itself is more like a lecture and less like a seminar, and she publicly targets students who she feels are not working hard enough/slipping up. So be ready for that. She asks you to do a lot of work, but then doesn't really ask the class to engage with the material/topics in depth during discussion. ",
            "\u00a0I think this is a great course with great readings/movies. The only thing is that it is quite a bit of writing for it not to be a writing credit  given that the reading responses are rather lengthy given the amount/depth of readings. ",
            "\u00a0The workload was a weakness for this course as though the recommended length for the weekly blog posts were 300-500 words, most people wrote up to 1000-1500. The material that needed to be responded to was also a lot and so the professor had high expectations for them. While I see how weekly blog posts may be important to ensure everyone does the reading, if they are to be graded and are expected to be nuanced readings the texts for discussion, it might have been better to have them less frequently like once every two weeks. It's also unfair to skew the higher grades to people who have written more when the requirement was 500 words. The strength of this course was the readings themselves - the material was fascinating and very important to understanding the Iranian context. The professor clearly knew a lot about the subject and I enjoyed listening to what she had to say about it. "

            "\u00a0Maybe. Be prepared for an incredibly frustrating semester. It is very informative, though! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This is a terrific course that is engaging, interesting, and not overbearing. "
