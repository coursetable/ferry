            "\u00a0I developed a deep appreciation for the powers of statistics, which coax insight and information out of data to an extent I wouldn't have believed prior to taking this course. I also strengthened my ability to reason logically and understand formulas. Finally, the setup of this course encouraged me to develop time management skills and cultivated the ability to work together with others in a team. I grew a lot as a student by taking this class, and I only regret that I had not taken it earlier on in my Yale career. ",

            "\u00a0Would be nice if there was more exam flexibility for different time zones, since taking it at 10-12pm is kind of hard, although I suppose that would be hard since alternate tests would have to be made. Course could've gone a bit further in STATA skills I think. Very good for someone with low background in statistics. ",
            "\u00a0The class was taught by an outstanding professor. Professor McKee made a clear commitment to engaging students by using interesting real-world examples, encouraging questions, and emphasizing learning over rote memorization or competition among students. The one way I believe this course could be improved would be by offering individual sign-up slots for office hours rather than holding them in a communal virtual meeting room. The latter setting can discourage shy students from seeking help. ",
            "\u00a0This course as it was taught during session A had very few weaknesses in my opinion and the weaknesses that I can think of were only due to the constraints of time which was inevitable. It went very rapidly so it often felt like concepts did not really have much time to be absorbed before moving on to the next thing. However among its strengths was its structure which facilitated the maximum amount of retention considering the circumstances. For example, the pre-recorded lectures were great for explaining concepts in more digestable ways than the text could at times. Additionally the lectures are enhanced by the fact that actual students who were taking the class at the time that it was recorded were able to ask questions. It simulated being an a class where other people's ways of thinking and incites can help deepen your own. The fact that we were able to ask our own questions during lecture and focus on working through practice problems was a great way to supplement this pre-class preparation. Finally, I think that the quizzes were a great way to help think more conceptually about topics and helped as a way to keep me on track with the class. Being able to have immediate feedback like that on the understanding of topics was also psychologically effective for me in providing small wins when the class felt overwhelming. I believe that the assignments and tests were pretty fair. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- Teaching: the professor and TA are much better than those who teach ECON 131 or other econometrics courses during the year\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Lack of guidance on the final empirical project\r\n - Could have had more practice problems prior to the final exam ",
            "\u00a0The course length was short so the time was tight. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Overall, it's a really good class - you learn basic econometrics/stats which is super important.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I felt other stat classes give a far better intuitive understanding of what is really going on behind the equations. Going beyond memorization is really important. This class tried to do that by going through proofs of most equations, but I felt the method of going through the logic behind each aspect of the equation in a non-mathematical sense was better for me personally. Also, the online and compressed nature of the class are always just tough to deal with. The group project was annoying - it'd be better if it were an individual project and the professor just took into account the limited time-frame when grading. ",
            "\u00a0Having the online lectures to refer back to was very helpful. I think the course could have benefited from more problems/assignments for us to practice the types of questions we'd see on exams and better understand the material. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Online so convenient, small class size\r\nWeakness: Technical problems during class time and exam ",
            "\u00a0The group project peer evaluations should be on a 100 scale, and only 25% of the final project grade. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n\r\n- I was hesitant to take an online course, because I was not sure how engaging it would be not to be in the same place as the professor and other students. I was very pleasantly surprised to find that the course was very engaging. In fact, I felt like I had more contact time with the professor and teaching assistant than I would have had I taken the class in person. \r\n- The material was taught in a way that made it relevant and engaging. For me, the most interesting part of statistics, is that it provides the tools to quantitatively asses theories and presumptions about the world. Professor McKee was great at making sure that every new technique, or mathematical process we learnt, related in some way to the real world. \r\n- I enjoyed the small class size, and the combination of lectures and discussions, where we were able to work through problems as a class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n\r\n- Working on a group research project when people are based in different places was very challenging, and posed many difficulties at times. I enjoyed the research project itself, and felt that it was a fitting end to the class, but the process was frustrating at times. It would have been helpful to see a previous example of a report as well. We were told what content we were expected to include, but the layout and organization was not specified. More specific instructions would have been helpful.\r\n- We moved through the material very quickly. I had taken some statistics in high school, and most of the first section was not new. For me, it was good revision; however, if I had been seeing this material for the first time, it would have been a lot to take in all at once. That is not to say the class should have included less material, I think it would have been helpful to have more time to process the material, with the help of additional (maybe optional problems). The problem sets were relatively short, and for midterms and finals, we only had one sample test. It would have been good to know which problems from the text book it to do as additional practice. \r\n- Examity proved to be slightly frustrating to work with at times. I found that my proctors often did not know the specific rules of our class tests. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely, Professor McKee is awesome. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, would recommend. The summer online course was actually a pretty pleasurable experience, and Professor McKee is a very nice instructor who explains the concepts well. Having the lectures to review whenever and the slides is also a plus. It does move a bit fast at times. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student with an interest in quantitative reasoning. It is accessible but not easy. It demands consistently high-quality work without being unreasonable. It encourages reasoning and intuition over rote memorization. Most importantly, it is extraordinarily well taught. At this point, I would recommend taking any course taught by Doug McKee. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course especially with Professor McKee as the instructor because I think it is well-structured to maximize student learning. My only reservation would be that a student considering taking the course should makes sure that they have ample amounts of time to really absorb the information, work over it, and prepare questions so that they can get the most out of the experience. Watch the lectures, do the readings, go to live lecture, complete the assignments truthfully and you will get a lot from the course though the pace will be overwhelming at times. I had originally started taking this class in fall of last year but dropped it because I wasn't following the material well having not taken a stats course since early high school, however the way concepts were explained during this summer session was incredibly helpful in understanding the theory behind things. Additionally, I believe its such an important course to take because it opens a new way of interpreting the world that you may not be familiar with if you don't have a background it stats. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I would DEFINITELY recommend you take this, whether or not you are an Econ major, if you have any interest in econ research. Econometrics is horribly taught during the school year; read through any of the reviews and you'll know. If you want some actual decent teaching in econometrics this is the course for you. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Inspiring and highly practical. Might be an intro course in Yale but is good to build the foundation before going on the advanced courses. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Econometrics is a difficult topic and the online summer session allows it to be your sole focus (granted you aren't taking any other courses), which makes it much easier to put forth the necessary effort to fully understand the material and succeed in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It's really important stuff and a pretty enjoyable class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student who wanted to learn some data analysis without having a lot of background in the subject matter. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, since this is an important course for statistic students ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this class. Despite initial hesitations, I thoroughly enjoyed this class, the way it was structure, and having the opportunity to learn from Professor McKee. Having a professor who is committed, engaged, and always willing to provide additional help can really make a class. That was certainly the case with ECON 131. If you are interested in statistics, to go on and study higher level statistics, or just to inform work you are doing in another field - like politics, anthropology, or sociology - this class provides a fantastic introduction. Most of the time, you have to wait to get to a higher level class to be able to answer questions, and do research that you are really interested in. This class finds ways to get around that, and give you a taste of what econometrics is, and what it can do. "
