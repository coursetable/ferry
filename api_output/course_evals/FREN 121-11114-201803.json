            "\u00a0My French listening skills greatly improved. Other skills did too, but I think listening improved the most. ",
            "\u00a0I went from knowing barely any French to being conversational in just a few months, which is definitely an accomplishment. I developed the ability to talk not just about the weather or basic stuff but also more substantive topics like culture and politics. ",
            "\u00a0A great knowledge of french. I definitely regained my former French knowledge and improved my French beyond my previous limits. I am familiar with typical french knowledge/grammar and would probably be able to navigate at a basic level in French-speaking countries. ",
            "\u00a0I reviewed all of the French that I learned in my high school career and then some. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely learned a lot of French grammar, vocab, listening, and speaking skills. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my french speaking, reading and listening comprehension. ",
            "\u00a0Though most of this course was review for me, I strengthened my grammar (incl. pronoun use, tenses, agreement, \"si\" clauses, etc.) and learned a lot of idiomatic phrases which, despite being commonplace in every day French, I have never been taught before. ",
            "\u00a0Better speaking, reading, and writing in French. Got up to speed after having not taken French for a while. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about french grammar and how to form sentences in french. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0It's very well organized and you really do learn a lot. That said, most of the learning takes place on your own outside of class. Class time a lot of the time is a review of what you were supposed to have already gone over yourself. I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing, but sometimes it gets challenging. ",
            "\u00a0Mme Skorupa is incredible - honestly some days I was incredibly tired and went solely because she's a great teacher. She's always awake and energetic at 9:30am while half of the class is lethargic! I didn't feel afraid to make mistakes in front of her and felt like I learned so much from her, she's so enthusiastic and open about French. I only wish we could spend less time on FiA material - I felt like some of the homework was repetitive/too long (especially when there was story fill-in-the-blanks) and didn't help me learn. I liked watching the videos though. ",
            "\u00a0This was the absolute worst course I have taken at Yale. It literally destroyed my soul. This class moves so fast that I doubt anyone actually learns anything. It is quite overwhelming and I am scared for next semester. The workload is absolutely ridiculous it is like 2-3 hours a night when the class meets every day! The only way that this class could be manageable is if it is literally the only thing a person is taking that semester. This course does not recognize that some people are not meant to learn languages just like some people aren't meant to learn math or science. It is not compatible with many learning styles. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the French in Action by Capretz method. It was organized and engaging. It was a time commitment to take this course but I am glad I took it because I really feel I learned so much. ",
            "\u00a0Solid engagement, I love the FIA series we watched. However, the workload was enormous and there were too many tests. The tempo of the class was very fast. ",
            "\u00a0The first several weeks are \"bootcamp\" where we speed through a chapter every day (and do an entire chapter's worth of homework every night) to review L1. The workload gets substantially better after that. While our professor made a point to provide opportunities for speaking, I definitely feel like I could not speak the level of French that I knew how to write. (I've been told speaking is a priority in L3 however.) That being said, office hours with Skorupa to practice my spoken presentation were immensely helpfulshe noted and went over every single pronunciation error I made (most of which I had no idea were wrong), which has definitely improved my accent. We also don't memorize lists of vocab, which is both a plus and a minus. The focus of this course is definitely on grammar and idiomatic phrases. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- lots of smaller assignments and tests throughout the semester, which provides a lot of opportunities to do well or improve. \r\nWeaknesses- I think its hard for most students to keep up with the workbook homework every day and they end up not doing it. ",
            "\u00a0I liked how involved it was but felt that some of the work was unnecessary. There was a lot of busy work that didn't necessarily help with mastery of the language. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to other students. If you want to learn French, this is a good course to take. The workload may seem like a lot, but it gets easier to manage throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0It's an excellent course to take if you're looking to take French and learn very quickly. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but you really have to put the work in. There's a lot of homework and if you haven't taken French in a while you should expect to put in a lot of work at the beginning of the year. Make sure you're willing to go to class every day otherwise you'll miss material and won't succeed on tests. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely not. I took French in high school and I literally would rather have taken anything else. I'm trying to fulfill a language requirement not become fluent in three months. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in expanding on your French knowledge, this course is definitely the next step. The pace is quick so I would recommend having some experience in learning French if you are entering this course. There is class and homework every day and it meets twice during reading period. It was a time commitment to take this course but I am glad I took it because I really feel I learned so much. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would but with a warning. The course is great but it would be so much better is it were not so hectic. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This course is fast-paced but slows down to focus on the harder concepts. There is a lot of homework, but you quickly figure out what to prioritize. The textbook we follow has a funny storyline and Mme. Skorupa is one of the kindest professors I've ever met, and she makes the class engaging, hilarious, and varied. We have writing assignments every other week, skits, presentations, and class breakfasts, and even had regular Skype conversations with university students in Paris, which were particularly great practice and a way to make unlikely new friends. This class was a great way to start my morning. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially with Madame Skorupa! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the structure gives you a lot of exposure to the language. Meeting every day can be hard but it is extremely beneficial in mastering the information "
