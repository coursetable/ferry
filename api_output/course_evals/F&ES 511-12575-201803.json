Now I do, and more importantly I have been been introduced to some of the leading   conversations that are happening in the field.  I think that my biggest takeaway was the development of a novice skillset for analyzing the functional aspects of a ecological system. I understand what \"tipping points\" are are the interconnected value of ecosystems and ecosystem services in a way that I can explain to other people now. When asked about this course I mention how preserving and duplicating the functional relationships within an ecosystem is more important than the strict biodiversity of a species...Often times conservation is targeted at a human selected species and not one that is integral to ecosystem health and productivity. This was a very salient point that I will take with me. ",

            "\u00a0The presentations were long and at times confusing. The professor definitely had a point that he was trying to make but sometimes the focus was on driving that point home rather than integrating discussion and other relevant dialogue from the class. We looked at a lot of ways in which conservation efforts have failed but very few in which they were a success. I would have liked to see more of those.  I felt like some of the theory in ecology is pretty loose, so it made producing appropriate work difficult at times. One of my favorite parts of the course were the graphs illustrating carrying capacity, top down controlled trophic ecosystems and other theories. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: \r\nCourse felt disorganized; powerpoint slides were cluttered and confusing; homework problems felt like they were designed for undergraduates or even high school students (contrived and way too easy); too much emphasis on instructors opinions of flawed past research/policy and not enough on core ecology concepts.\r\n\r\nIt might be helpful to follow a textbook. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course's weakness is that it's a half semester class that tries to pack in at least 3/4 of a semester's worth of content into it. Also, I think that the homework was very helpful, but also extremely time-consuming for a foundations class. ",

            "\u00a0Given my lack of academic training in biology and ecology, it was difficult at times to fully grasp the concepts covered in the articles we were assigned to read. It might be helpful to supplement the academic articles with more approachable sources (videos? writings aimed more at the general public?) in order to aid our understanding of the material. ",
            "\u00a0Oz is super knowledgeable and the course material was interesting. I found the grading pretty subjective. He just looks at the essays and kind of judged how much to give. Oz seems to like some students and not like others. ",
            "\u00a0The book was great. The lectures were engaging - but could drag on about some topics for too long.\r\n\r\nThe homework in particular was really poorly written. I don't believe in having things handed to me on a silver spoon, and I am happy that some of the questions required critical thinking and not regurgitation to solve. That being said, I questioned myself over and over again when reading the question to understand what the heck was being asked and if it was double trick question. The may be a specific critique that the terms used were not consistent across the lecture/reading and homework which made it hard to go to a reference material to determine if my initial interpretation of the questions were correct. ",
            "\u00a0The course was good.\r\nThat being said, I strongly object to the concept of prerequisites being implemented in the fashion they were. It is not fair to the student body to emphasize the importance of there being only four semesters to pursue what we came to the school for and then take a semester away. I don't think it's fair to do to the Professors either to demand so much of their time on such fashions. Many of the prerequisites may also have been better applicable within specific concentrations. As some, although interesting, will not further the trajectory of a some students. \r\nAs well, it is an incredibly overwhelming prospect to begin school, choose an intended concentration, have no room to explore any of the others, and have the prereqs and core classes staggered on one another, and was not an enjoyable experience. For the sake of future students, I hope the process changes. ",
            "\u00a0It was quite intensive for a 6 week coursegood intro and applicable to the real world but perhaps negate the last group project at the end. ",
            "\u00a0Assignments were unclear, open-ended, time-intensive, and did not necessarily help students to better understand the concepts. Instructor's unclear expectations impacted how final exam questions were answered (unclear on how much detail to provide), which in turn negatively impacted score. ",
            "\u00a0The content is interesting and useful, however it is too much. Presentations of over 100 slides per class. Assignmets required too much time (more than the rest of the basic knowledge courses) and were not clear. ",
            "\u00a0Assignments were too time consuming. I think the questions were too open ended without clear expectations, leading to for more research and estimation than I think was necessary for weekly assignments. ",

            "\u00a0Oz is a good teacher and he has an interesting, and challenging point of view, which I really liked. His care for the course and students really showed and he is clearly highly knowledgeable. \r\n\r\nIn terms of suggestions I felt like often the lectures rattled through too many 'examples' from research, such as cropped out graphs, that in themselves would take 5 minutes to comprehend and probably a read of the whole paper / a half lecture to understand. These were more confusing than useful and instead we should have focused on one specific research that is representative/topical, etc. We often covered a lot of ground, but instead of trying to rattle through all this at a high level and then leaving us more confused and potentially having learnt less, we should have covered the same core knowledge per class and then gone in-depth on one piece of research or case study that is representative, cutting edge, interesting etc. per topic(=class) and gained some depth. We sometime did this with case studies - and those were truly useful. \r\n\r\nThe final problem set, brining it all together in teams was a great idea and worked out really well. "
