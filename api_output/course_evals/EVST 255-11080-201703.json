            "\u00a0I learned a lot about a multitude of environmental issues. I feel like it was a great overview, and it was presented in an interesting, non-stressful way. Wargo is so knowledgable and passionate about the topic, so it was great to learn more from an expert in the field. ",
            "\u00a0Not much. Most of what we learned could've been read in the newspaper. The interesting material was not related to law, it was more in the vein of environmental public health, so if you're into that and you don't mind busywork, unengaging lectures, and pointless final assignments that basically ask you to spend five pages copying statistics from various websites, then this is the class for you. But if you're interested in the law, not so much. If you've taken a law class from a lawyer (such as Con Law, Comparative Con Law, anything with someone with a JD), this will be a big disappointment. Well it probably will be anyway, but you know. Wargo is a nice guy, but what he does know about the law (given that he does not have a JD) is watered down in the course by distracting topics not otherwise related. Note that if you watch this course on OYC you'll see much more law that he covers presently--I'd say he did about 20% of the legal analysis this year that he did on the OYC in 2010. Really a pity this class has gone so far downhill, and I hope it can be revamped (including getting someone with a JD to teach it) given the importance of this subject. ",

The structure of the class was great and facilitated easy learning. ",

I learned how complicated it is to create policies and enforce laws which effectively address and remedy these environmental problems without destroying economies and businesses.  I also learned how to analyze government documents, research results, cases, and studies done in regards to the environment.  There are many facets to every problem; thus, there are many facets to every solution.  This course taught me how to better analyze problems in order to develop the best solutions possible. ",

I learned about the complexity of issues that I hadn't really considered, and that there is a higher level of interaction between government agencies, NGOs, privatized companies, scientific researchers, individual consumers, and various other sources of impact on environmental issues than I had previously realized. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a tremendous amount about the environmental issues that currently face the human population and the world as a whole. I also came away from this course with a much better understanding of how to legally approach these issues and hopefully solve them. ",
            "\u00a0I gained insight to government responses to seroius environmental and health catastrophes and problems. I hadnt before known about the repercussions of nuclear testing, of  land preservation laws, nor of coastal zone management, among other issues. ",
            "\u00a0By taking this course, it provided a great insight into what the environmental political field is like. During my semester, the United States decided to pull out of the Paris Agreement so it was nice to have this class to learn about why and why not that decision should have been made, instead of gaining the information from a potentially unreliable source. Also, there were other current events that occurred during the term and they were nicely tied into the curriculum, making the content more interest and worthwhile. ",
            "\u00a0This was my introduction to environmental studies in general along with environmental law and politics. Our focus on several especially political environmental topics (nuclear, plastics, chemicals, etc.) offered insight into how environmental policies are enacted in America and the level of (dis)organization of our legislation. This class was also my first exposure to reading court decisions in an academic setting. ",
            "\u00a0Learned extensively about the issues in the current legal framework on the environment. The class gives a solid background to certain moral issues that the law has to address. ",
            "\u00a0This course offers a really good basis in the discipline of environmental law, and is definitely a good course to take if you are interested in environmental issues -- however, don't expect the class to be very engaging or well-run. I think it does a decent job of teaching you how to think through environmental/legal/political issues in an analytical way, but the course concepts are not very challenging and the lectures are often quite boring and disjointed. It is really more of an environmental health class (large focus on EPA function/regulation, and on health issues like pollution, plastics, drugs, antibiotics in meat, etc) than a law class. We do very few case studies and even when we did them we did not go in depth at all, we only got the bare bones written on one slide. If you are interested in regulation/monitoring of human environments, that's more what this class is about. ",

            "\u00a0weakness\r\ndry lectures ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: test/paper set up\r\n\r\nWeakness: boring lectures, poorly structured ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Wargo is a nice guy, means well, and wants the best for his students. Can't take that away from him. I guess the fact that you could do the paper on any topic you want instead of getting stuck in one of his boring topics was a strength, but in that case I'd recommend just taking research for credit or do it on your own so you'll get better feedback.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Oh boy. 1) Lectures. Not engaging at all. He would always ask people to stop using their laptops to do other things--perhaps this should have been an indication to him that nobody could be sufficiently interested by his presentation of the material. I do not feel like I learned that much from the lectures, and the only reason I went was to make sure I didn't miss something esoteric that might come up on the final. \r\n\r\n2) Organization. He switched the syllabus around a few times, as if this were a new course and he was still trying to figure it out. This meant that the presentations in section were not lined up at all with the course material, and my presentation slot randomly got moved to a different week without any warning. The final essay prompt was released late because apparently three months wasn't long enough to come up with something, and then the directions to it were copy/pasted from the midterm assignment (and not completely applicable). The final essay assignment was modified two days after it was originally posted, which resulted in the WASTE of all of the work I did on it during those two days that was no longer relevant because I'd done it in a different form.\r\n\r\n3) Material. Really not relevant to or connected to what you'll see on the syllabus. The syllabus made the course look interesting. Maybe it would've been if he'd followed it. Did not demonstrate proficiency of knowledge about the constitutional underpinnings of many of the key issues. Did not attempt to present arguments for why the government would be politically unable to implement many of the ideas he suggested. \r\n\r\n4) Section. The presentations are mind-numbing and pointless, in my section at least. Plus they were not aligned with the material and mine was randomly changed TO A COMPLETELY UNRELATED TOPIC. My TF was really bad. She's actually like a high-achieving student getting a couple of degrees and with a prestigious fellowship--which leads me to suspect that she just didn't care about us. Feedback on essay draft was decent, so can't take that away from her, though it was rushed. Her office hours were usually cancelled without notice. She also lacked much constitutional or legal knowledge--not great for a class with law in the title.\r\n\r\n5) Exam assignments. Generally lots of busyowrk. The midterm was ok, but a bit formulaic and left little room for any sort of position that wasn't \"we should literally implement every law possible to control this without thinking about how it'll affect anyone else.\" The final was an unmitigated disaster, much like the areas of the environment it was asking about. The first five typed pages had to be copied statistics from various webpages about damages from hurricanes Harvey and Maria. This did not differentiate between students at all and was just a massive time sink. Also the topic of the final was on one of the topic covered least in the course and least related to what one would consider a domain of environmental politics and law.\r\n\r\n6) General ethos. This one is not so much an objective weakness of the course, but I want to get it out there in case you were like me going in. Basically, this class is full of environmentalists. If that's you, great. But I think it's important to realize that in order to make progress with the environmental agenda, understanding of the other side is needed and perhaps even more important. I really wish we could've heard more of the history of the issues from both sides and the reasons that various bills, etc., failed in congress, etc. Much more interesting than just learning about how smoking kills.

            "\u00a0Very clear and organized! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- Wargo's considerable expertise about the field\r\n- take-home midterms allowed much greater depth on a few significant problems\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- lecture structure not very engaging\r\n- midterm structure encouraged more outside research than engagement with class texts\r\n- midterms necessitated a ridiculous amount of depth. Both of the take-home midterms I submitted were longer than my final paper, which felt like an after-thought for most of the semester.\r\n- still not a clear understanding of the actual structure and function of environmental law\r\n- little feedback about coursework over the course of the semester because there were only three assignments, only one of which I had received feedback on by the end of the semester. Grading was often late and confusing. ",
            "\u00a0While the material is interesting, the lectures are somewhat hard to follow. The lectures do not have much to do with the assignments. As such, the assignments felt random and long. Assignments should be timed to not coincide with recesses, and be more connected to course material. The research paper format should stay the same, though. I appreciated the emphasis on finding solutions for the problems in the assignments, and I wish that the lecture followed that template more closely. ",
            "\u00a0This course was great -- loved the organization -- loved the take-home exams and timeline of the final paper; really felt like I had ample time to come up with creative and genuinely insightful input. ",
            "\u00a0The course is interesting and the lectures were good. The first few classes, it was not clear what we were supposed to have read, which made things a bit confusing. The course schedule also changed frequently, which made it a bit harder to follow along. All in all, though, the course was well structured and well taught. ",
            "\u00a0The weakness of this course is that it does not get into the politics, the law, or the environmental aspects of the problem. It is taught in a way that makes you feel like you're not really learning anything. Most weeks, the workload is close to nothing, but then there is a midterm and a final in which you have to write over 10 pages in a week and a term paper. Frustrating. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures are pretty boring and there were 2 take home tests (10 page papers) and a final essay (8 page paper) so you don't need to go to class ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this class are the material and the opportunities to engage further with it in the final paper, the midterm, and the final. Having take-home essays for the midterm and the final was a huge plus - I gained so much more from those experiences than I would have from cramming for in-class exams. \r\nI felt that this class was disjointed in certain ways. We jumped from one topic to the next without a lot of structure, spending a lot of time on certain subjects (i.e. Vieques, the Adirondacks), and very small amounts of time on other subjects. I didn't like not knowing the logic behind this structure or knowing how long certain topics would get, since we did not strictly stick to the schedule in the syllabus. Additionally, the topics that we studied didn't seem to have a logical progression. The lag time between what we talked about in class and what we were assigned to talk about and present on in section was irritating. In the future, section and lecture topics should be synched.\r\nI also feel that I didn't come away from this class with a complete understanding of the structure of environmental law in the U.S. Case studies introduced us to important laws, but I don't have a full comprehension of what these laws mean and exactly what they can do - just how they worked in the situations we studied. I recognize the importance of case studies to see how this law actually works, but I would have liked to get a more intentional, in-depth explanation of their actual content and structure. I think that this lack of knowledge was reflected in my lesser ability to address the second section of the midterm and the final - I didn't believe I was given the knowledge and tools to actually apply legal strategies or to use them to analyze case studies. ",
            "\u00a0The case studies were really interesting - I felt like Prof Wargo gave us a great understanding of the multidimensionality of issues as well as their legal framework. I dont feel like we spent enough time discussing solutions, and when papers asked for them it was difficult to come up with something plausible. ",
            "\u00a0John Wargo is unmatched - One of my absolute favorite professors at Yale. The content of the course was extremely interesting and was well presented. I loved it. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course is that the course has a relatively low workload. A take-home midterm, a final paper, a take-home final, and participation in section are all that are required of you for the course. However, because of the nature of this course having a comparatively low workload, it becomes easy to forget to do the work and deadlines that you have to keep. A weakness of the course is that lecture does feel a bit dry. Prof. Wargo is obviously very knowledgeable and passionate, but I feel like the course material itself is not necessarily all that exciting. Sure, the concepts and case studies covered are interesting and eye-opening, but most of that insight comes from self-studying and digging through articles on your own, rather than in lecture, where the ideas are all just presented. All in all, the course can probably be described, by other students, to be a bit boring, and although I think that's a fair assessment, I do think that you get from the course as much as  you put into the course. Prof. Wargo can only do so much to also entertain while bringing in serious and dreary topics into lecture. One major strength of the course, though, is that Prof. Wargo is involved personally in many of the case studies covered, so it really feels like you're getting the \"insider-look\" into each one. Grading does take a while and even now, on Canvas, my grade is N/A because no grades have been entered. ",
            "\u00a0The content of the course is really interesting and extremely topical. However, the structure of the course and its lectures were disorganized. I think the course would benefit from more structure on both levels, as well as more introduction to the legal tools discussed, including basic explanations of their mechanics. ",
            "\u00a0Having the option of take-home final vs. exam ",
            "\u00a0Take home midterm and final allow you to put some real thought into them and you can actually draw on the course material in a way that you can't in 50' sit-downs. Lectures and notes are cool, lots of great videos throughout the semester. Favorite part was that Professor Wargo didn't try to espouse any political agenda through his teachings - it was an objective, summary course. ",
            "\u00a0The information was interesting as someone who is interested in environmental issues, but often class was boring and tended to take on a \"gloom and doom\" sort of feel. Overall I enjoyed it, but at times it was kind of a downer of a class. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are the course material and readings. They provided great insights into the environmental world. ",
            "\u00a0This course is rather interesting in that it focuses on a few case studies as a frame for environmental law. ",
            "\u00a0I believe this course should be listed as a writing credit.  I wrote close the thirty pages in all, and I find it shocking that it doesn't count. ",
            "\u00a0The course material itself was fascinating and lectures were well planned, but Professor Wargo usually assigned hundreds of pages of reading for homework each week.  It is unrealistic to expect that we can read all of these readings in depth, and it is difficult to understand the readings by just skimming them.  I think a better approach would have been to assign about one-hundred pages each week that really focused in on the heart of the material rather than hundreds of pages of half-irrelevant documents.\r\n\r\nAlso, while each lecture was well-structured, the overall schedule was a mess.  Due dates for major assignments were changed many times; the topic of our section presentations and the presentation dates were changed many times; the lecture schedule was changed many times; the topic of discussion in section was changed many times.  Inconsistency was certainly a theme of this course, and while Professor Wargo is incredibly knowledgeable in this field, I found the course increasingly frustrating because of all of those inconsistencies.  In any given week, the readings due for homework would differ from the topic of lecture, which would differ from the topic of the Canvas post before section, which would differ from the topic of our section discussion.  This was overwhelming and frustrating.  I think that if all of these facets of the course were aligned each week to one central environmental topic, the course would have been much more enjoyable.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we always received very delayed feedback.  I did not get feedback on my term paper for a month; at that point, the course was over for weeks, so I was not even able to apply that feedback to my final exam. ",
            "\u00a0I think that this class had a very good in-depth presentation of issues from various angles.  I feel like I learned a lot about the complexity of environmental problems, especially the ways in which environmental issues disproportionately affect minorities and the poor.  I think that it was a bit unclear which readings were necessary and which were supplementary, but I don't think that there was anything major that should be changed about the class. ",
            "\u00a0Course was very interesting and engaging for someone interested in environmental issues. I especially enjoyed the weekly discussion sections. Those really helped me to solidify the ideas discussed in class and make sure my understanding was clear. ",
            "\u00a0Lecture was immensely boring and syllabus was somewhat much more structured than class ended up being -- course did not align with syllabus and workload seemed scattered. Also, writing a total of 30 pages for the semester for a course that was not a writing credit (WR) seemed extremely excessive. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a very important one but needs a great deal of improvement. The reading load is excessive, the structure and Professor are very disorganized with deadlines subject to change constantly, and sections rarely align with the week's lecture topic, making it very difficult to feel like a sense of continuity and clarity is maintained throughout. Additionally, Wargo asks more questions than he answers during lectures--while it's clear this field involves looking at issues from many angles and interrogating them, I often wanted more facts and more concise explanations. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the course material and learned that there are many environmental issues that are indeed immediate and urgent to peoples' health. I would have preferred more specific instructions on the take-home exams. The few criteria listed gave general guidelines, but I was often very unclear as to what the grader was looking for specifically. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Wargo is a great professor, and his lectures are interesting. I really enjoyed watching the news clips he would show us. A weakness would be the attention of students in the class. When we started the class in the YUAG auditorium, there wasnt any WiFi, and students couldnt be distracted. A strength would be the structure (topics, assessments, exams, etc) but a weakness would be organization on canvas. It wasnt clear which readings we had to do until a bit into the course, and the lecture weeks didnt match up with the folders of topics on canvas. Giving each lecture and equivalent folder with related readings the exact same name would be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: You definitely become more aware of the environmental implications of certain things, such as plastics use and air pollution, which is great because the information is clear cut and unbiased. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures tended to be boring and usually started late. Additionally, the first midterm, while take home which I think is a good format for this class, and the research paper were assigned right before Oct Break and Thanksgiving Break, respectively, which was unnecessary. Could have been assigned a week before or a week after. ",
            "\u00a0The class sometimes felt disorganized just because our lectures started off in sync with our readings/sections and ended up preceding our readings and section discussions by a weekI ended up forgetting a lot of the points made in lecture by the time we go to readings and section. I also wish we spent more time on environmental justice in environmental politics. Otherwise the class had an appropriate amount of reading, a fairly engaging lecture, and fair assessments. ",
            "\u00a0The class was very interesting in the first half as professor Wargo supplemented his lectures with rich and colourful videos on nuclear bombs and palm oil production for example. This made me a lot more interested in the topics and was very engaging. The second half of the course lacks this unfortunately and makes it far less interesting. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a pretty important basis to have if you are interested in issues of environmental health. We focus a lot on plastics, drugs, chemicals, antibiotics, air pollution, water pollution, and how they affect human health. Certain units got lots of focus (land management in the Adirondacks, environmental degradation on a specific island in Puerto Rico), but others it felt like we brushed over. Without doing any of the readings, I was able to keep up no problem, and thus the only main work was the 2 midterm papers and the research paper. So it is not a very demanding class, but in turn you don't learn that much either. It could be improved *greatly* by just being more organized -- Prof Wargo seemed to change the syllabus daily, and changed deadlines all the time. The assignments (section presentation, midterms, research paper) were all very disjointed and often topics being discussed in section did not relate to topics being discussed in lecture. I think the course has a lot of potential but it was just facilitated extremely poorly and therefore I did not enjoy it very much. ",

The material was also given as a take-home midterm and a take-home final, both of which were very straightforward and a breeze to complete. I think the paper was also fun to write since it was so open-ended. I started it Credit/D but then converted because I enjoyed it more than I thought. Strongly recommend! ",
            "\u00a0yes if you want a class you don't need to attend with no in class exams. No if you want something that is engaging and interesting, as lectures are dry and readings and section is often disorganized ",
            "\u00a0Under no circumstances. I realized during shopping period that it would be really boring and inexplicably stuck with it. Worst academic decision I've made here. If the stuff in the first weeks doesn't really appeal to you, get the hell out, because it ain't getting any better, and you could use the credit in so many other ways. Basically, this course should be called \"topics in environmental public health.\" This would much better capture the focus. There were lots of other weaknesses (see my freakishly long list on that question), but I feel like a lot of them were due to low enthusiasm, which came from the disconnect between the expected course material and the actual course material. If everyone knew going in that they would be learning much more about the public health issues than the law and politics issues, I think a better set of people for the course would enroll, which would hopefully make people more engaged and Wargo feel less like he was talking to a bunch of disinterested students. Either that, or more preferably, he would change the material back to what he was doing in 2010 as can be seen on the OYC (which is orders of magnitude more interesting and better than what he actually did this year). \r\n\r\nAgain, John Wargo means well, and he's a good person. He just needs to understand what people are looking for in the course, and then make it a priority. Sorry, but releasing the final exam prompt late, having obviously written it in a huge rush, and then having to correct it due to students' inability to find information about the questions asked is not the mark of someone who is prioritizing the teaching of this course. \r\n\r\nI think my complaints are partially due to the fact that I'm a hard-core legal scholar, and it's basically impossible to please me in a law class unless it's from a law professor with a good constitutional background. I actually have come to dislike the whole EVST department because it feels \"soft\"-- everything I've learned seems like something I could've read in the newspaper, and I don't see what skills I'm developing that will help me in the long run. \r\n\r\nSo if it looks like it's for you based on the syllabus, shop it, and if you aren't bored out of your skull, take it. I really hope he makes it better in the future. But still, be prepared for disorganization, bad sections, bad exam prompts, and a lot of busywork. ",
            "\u00a0not very interesting ",
            "\u00a0Take this class! I didn't really think I'd have any interest in the material but it was actually super interesting and very relevant to everyone's life. I learned a lot about current environmental law and how it affects us as people. Wargo has a lot of experience (advised Vice Presidents, members of the senate, etc) so he is always giving us personal anecdotes which are really cool too. ",
            "\u00a0As a broad introductory approach to environmental law and policy, or as a foundations class for the Environmental Studies major, this class is worth the while. But I'm not sure in its current form that I would recommend it to others. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course because the material is interesting and the weekly course load is light; however, the three assignments are lengthy. Take this class if you are looking for something on the lighter side, but only if you are interested in the material. You will be bored otherwise and not come to lecture. ",
            "\u00a0I would most definitely recommend this course to other students!  Without a doubt, one of my favorite classes this year! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. You learn a lot about both American and international environmental history and the law surrounding it, and Professor Wargo is the best. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in the environment and political science, I would take the course. I'm not sure if it inspires an interest in these things, but it certainly grows one if you already have an interest. ",
            "\u00a0Not really. It's a cool subject with a lot of potential but lecture is dry and section is kind of a waste of time. ",
            "\u00a0Yes it is interesting and important information ",
            "\u00a0I wouldn't recommend this course. Yes, it is a \"gut,\" but you'd be so much better off taking an interesting course with a little bit of a higher workload. This course was so poorly organized and boringly taught that I ended up struggling to get myself to go to lecture or do any of the minimal work assigned. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course. The assignments are frustrating and long and I did not get much from the lectures. ",
            "\u00a0If you're looking for a manageable poli sci take it. But we aware there are 30 pages of writing that comes with it. Don't really have to go to class but when the essays and take home tests come around it'll be time consuming. ",
            "\u00a0This class lacks good organization and structure and doesn't actually address the structure and basics of environmental law that much. That being said, it makes up for this by being pretty darn easy and fairly interesting if this is your field of interest. If you're an EVST major, take it. It's definitely one of the better options for fulfilling the humanities requirements of the major, along with American Environmental History. If not, this would be a pretty good 5th class. It's definitely interesting, but don't expect to be blown away. ",
            "\u00a0Its a good class with not too much work and its interesting. Take Home tests basically fell out of the lecture notes, even though going to lecture is not too necessary. Make sure you get a good TF. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely recommend taking this course, even if you've never been a big \"environment person\". John Wargo can make anything interesting. I LOVED this class, and I would take it again if I could. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you have little to no background in environmental science/studies. Many of the case studies, although interesting, were rehashes of content that is already covered in any basic environmental science/studies course. If you're looking for a fairly smooth ride, then I would say to take this course because if you have some background knowledge, you'll find that you'll be able to not only keep up in lecture, but also know more about the case studies without even looking deeper into them. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students with a strong interest in environmental politics while advising them to consider other ways to explore that interest. For students not already interested in environmental law or politics, I'm not sure this course is the best choice. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend this class. Although Wargo may be fearmongering with some of his claims it is still interesting to learn more about the environmental issues that affect us, and how much of current policy is lacking ",
            "\u00a0yes, definitely take it. not much work and dont have to go to lecture ",
            "\u00a0If you want an objective, agenda-free overview of environmental politics and law, and its applications then absolutely take it. Not a ton of work, but everything is fascinating (assuming you go to class and do the readings). No background necessary. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in environmental issues, then this is a good class that is not too much work. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to another student if they are interested in the environment or a light-workload fifth class. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a great course for anyone interested in environmental studies or the environmental side of law. The relatively low courseload is great for someone looking to take this as a 5th course. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course.  I thoroughly enjoyed going to lecture, but be warned: this class isn't the gut you've likely heard it to be.  There aren't weekly assignments, aside from readings for sections, but the midterm and final papers are a doozy.  If you're willing to put in a week to outline, write, cite, and revise your papers, giving maybe two hours a night, this class shouldn't be a problem work-wise.  The topics you write on are fairly interesting, too, and the final paper is so broad that you can choose any environmental topic that interests you.  If you love nature, national parks, and would say that you care about the environment, take this class. ",
            "\u00a0John Wargo made this class one that I will never forget. He is an incredible professor and very knowledgeable in his field. He is engaged with his students to a degree far beyond other professors, and because of this I fell in the love with the class material. I went from having 0 interest in environmental law (and honestly took this course because of the workload) and left with a strong interest in it and also a mentor in John Wargo. He is incredible (despite thinking the class was from 10:35-11:25 everyday). Take it! ",
            "\u00a0I think that it is incredibly important to understand the environmental crises faced all over the world and how complex it is to develop policies to mitigate those crises, but the inconsistencies within this course are so prevalent that oftentimes those overshadow the actual content of the course.  I am passionate about the environment and did learn things which I did not know before through this course, and I appreciated Professor Wargo's kindness and knowledge in this field, but the course needs to be restructured and clarified. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures are very interesting and cover a variety of topics. The take home exams not only cover the material but also had a creative policy element, which made them very realistic and engaging to think about. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the subject matter of this course, and I feel like I learned a lot by attending lectures and reading the provided written materials.  I'm very glad that I took this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely - amazing course. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course! Thought it was super interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Super low level of engagement, but if it's still 30 pages of writing (a 10 page paper and midterm and final that were essentially 10 pages of writing each) then probably not worth it. If you can schedule the writing into free time and you're looking for an easy B or B+ with potential for A- then this class is pretty good. ",
            "\u00a0No, I would not. Not unless it is restructured\r\n As it stands, the material is of course very important, but the course is incredibly disorganized, frustratingly changeable, and unnecessarily extensive in its workload. ",
            "\u00a0Terrific course. Even if you are an EVST major, there are topics covered that you havnt studied before. Professor Wargo is great , and the take home exams (midterm and final) were very manageable. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student who is truly interested in the environment. I think this helps when it comes to being engaged in discussion section and when having to write the 3 paper assignments (2 midterms and research paper). Also, I think this class because of its relevance to current events would help craft more holistic students. ",
            "\u00a0I think this is a pretty good intro environmental studies course if you aren't looking to get too into the scientific specifics. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class if you're looking for an easy class and if you're interested in some ethical issues related to environmental law. The class in the second half of the course gets far more boring, otherwise I would recommend it to everyone. ",
            "\u00a0I recommend this class if you want a fairly easy class where you'll learn a little bit about environmental law/health issues, but not have to work that hard. The midterm papers were shockingly specific and demanding after a pretty easy set of lectures and section discussions, but if you go to lecture and go to section and try to put your best foot forward you'll probably be fine.
