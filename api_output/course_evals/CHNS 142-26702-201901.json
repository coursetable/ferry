            "\u00a0I'd highly recommend this class for heritage students, even if you don't speak Mandarin at home. I had little to no Mandarin experience at home, but I still felt like this class was a good fit because I was able to learn the characters and Mandarin pronunciations of words and phrases I already knew in Cantonese, which I'm fluent in. So I'd say if you have a fair amount of experience with Chinese at home, regardless of dialect, you'll have a good time in this class! It's also really interesting compared to the non-heritage classes because you get the added bonus of discussing Chinese culture and society in your lessons and connecting with other Chinese American students. ",
            "\u00a0The Chinese department is great at Yale, and I would recommend this class to anyone interested in learning Mandarin. The heritage class is especially special because there is a unique connection between everyone. ",
            "\u00a0Yes of course, learn chinese if you're an ABC and want to reconnect with your mother tongue ",
            "\u00a0If you have the time, Chns 142 is a great way to expand your Chinese knowledge and get further acclimated with Chinese culture. ",
