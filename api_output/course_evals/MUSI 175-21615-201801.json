Much of the last half of the class as on geometric representations of all possible three-note chords. Most of what was taught in the class would be useful if you were interested in modern atonal pitch class set theory-based music. ",

I suppose I might know more about how chords are related to each other, but I certainly dont understand it. The material was incredibly difficult to comprehend, and the obscure nature of the lecture and problem sets did not foster a healthy way of learning what was being taught. I had a very hard time with this class, and do not feel satisfied with its style or content. ",

I feel that instead of learning about math and music, I learned instead about some quasi mathematical topics that were largely unrelated to music or formal mathematics. ",

Well-organized class with plenty of study material provided on Canvas (notes + solutions). \r\nWeaknesses: none really. The course was significantly more challenging than I expected, and was hard to grasp near the end, but that is more likely my fault than that of the course. ",
            "\u00a0It's just so boring.\r\nThe class goes into great detail about mathematical relations found in music-- from the construction of chords to interesting rhythmic patterns.\r\nBut I find myself asking: \"so what?\"\r\nThe class would be significantly improved if it could justify why it's a subject worth studying.\r\nLayer upon layer of abstraction: cyclic universes to sets to set classes. Triads to fifths to the Tonnetz. Q-relations.\r\nIt never came across as significant in music.\r\n\r\nThe math was interesting though. ",
            "\u00a0I would say this class is much easier for math people with music experience than music people with math experience. Some of the music people have trouble with seemingly simple math (for math people) so I feel like more support should be given in these cases (or at least advertise the difficulty of the math required in the course). ",
            "\u00a0Very abstract - few concrete things to hold onto ",
            "\u00a0Pacing was extremely slow until about the last three weeks. Sped up a lot after spring break to the point where the material was often confusing. ",
            "\u00a0This course was strong in the content it taught to the student. The material being very new was fascinating. \r\nSome instructions for the problem sets were sometimes difficult to grasp but overall the course was strong. ",
            "\u00a0Stength: very interesting course. Weakness: instructions on pset weren't always clear. However, the professor and TA's were very prompt to answer. ",
            "\u00a0The professor and TA were very energetic and organised with lectures and other assistance. They were also good at explaining problems and muddy areas. Though it's not really a music class, there could be more integration of music into the lessons, in terms of simple analysis and examples. ",
            "\u00a0The wording of the problem set questions could have been improved. On quite a few occasions there were unclear questions. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Mathematical analysis of music is interesting, and Prof. Cohn reliably posts the notes online after class. Some knowledge of music theory is needed, but it wasn't too difficult to learn.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The material is esoteric, so there aren't many resources beyond the notes. That's especially problematic when the notes are convoluted. It's nice that some psets are effectively optional, but on the other hand they introduce new material, and students should get credit for completing them. It's also nice that the graded psets make up 60% of the course grade, but they're confusing and difficult, students can't ask each other questions, and the scoring is unclear  percentages are converted to letter grades, but it was never explained if those letter grades are curved, or how they factor into the course grade. The final exam was similar to the psets in that it was confusing and difficult. ",
            "\u00a0Intuitive, subject is fun. Problems are confusing sometimes, not so well specified. Class can be hard to pay attention to. ",
            "\u00a0The psets were incredibly confusing and the professor/graders were not forgiving with points when students couldn't read their minds to figure out what each question was actually asking. ",
            "\u00a0The first two weeks of the course are extremely misleading. During shopping period we were told that the only prerequisites were basic arithmetic abilities and the ability to read music. This was true for the first few lectures, but after that point the class delved into much higher-order mathematical thinking than I had ever been exposed to. I, and many other people in the class, felt like our mathematical intuitions fell far short of the instructor's expectations.\r\n\r\nThe questions on the problem sets often asked us to make huge conceptual leaps, and questions were often unclear or poorly formed. The instructor and TF stressed that problem sets were intended to \"stretch\" our understanding, but it felt like the graded psets were asking questions far beyond the scope of what the professor covered in lecture. I spent hours on psets feeling like I was hitting my head against a wall. Office hours were only mildly helpful.\r\n\r\nLecture was sometimes engaging, but often repetitive and . Class could have been improved by working through more problems in class, allowing for students to ask questions about the actual process of using the information presented in lecture to solve problems. The only times we were ever given the opportunity to test our own handle on the material were the graded (and few ungraded) psets. \r\n\r\nThere is also no outside help or alternative resources for most of the concepts covered in class. Your only resources are lecture, the class notes (which I had difficulty understanding), the professor, and the TF. If those resources aren't helping you learn the material, you have literally no other resource to turn to. By the end of the course, I felt disillusioned and apathetic because I didn't really feel like there was a way for me to succeed. There was no reason for this course to be as difficult for me as it was. ",
            "\u00a0The problem sets and notes sent out were poorly written, and the subject matter was somewhat inaccessible. The first part of the class was fine, but all of a sudden the class became drastically harder without any additional help. ",
            "\u00a0This course was not taught in a very straightforward way. Although the concepts made sense and were interesting, they were taught in a way that made them very difficult to absorb and practice. We never did any practice problems in class, and as a result, most students in the class felt very ill-equipped to do the problem sets. ",
            "\u00a0All math no music ",
            "\u00a0It was extremely difficult, seemingly for no reason. Questions would be asked and almost deliberately misunderstood. Furthermore, there were no examples of material that would appear on problem sets that we worked through together as a class. Because the work was so abstract, it really would have been useful to go through a problem together during class with both the TF and professor present and guiding us through the material. However, I felt lost and guide-less throughout the entire semester. I would go to office hours and leave more confused than I started. The course is fundamentally flawed because sometimes the professor could not answer the questions he was being askedstudents had found discrepancies and inconsistencies in the work, which further confused me. It did not seem concrete in any way. ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Cohn is an extremely enthusiastic professor, and the TA was incredible too! Very responsive to emails and extra help. Some of the Psets were lengthy and required a steep learning curve since you probably have not seen some of this material in the context of music. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that it covers a topic that most people will never have the chance to learn about, and it moved at a pace that was good for everyone, regardless or prior experience with math or music theory. The weaknesses are that sometimes the instructor did not understand the material and had difficulty answering questions. ",
            "\u00a0Lots of the course is very theoretical and not very concrete... its a lot of ideas which are pretty heady and not a lot of concrete facts you can pick up on. I guess thats just the nature of the course but it makes it very difficult to feel like youre learning things and picking up on facts. Sometimes very hard to follow if you dont understand something. ",
            "\u00a0The course had very few strengths. Weaknesses included the professor and his teaching style. It was largely inaccessible and we were not given necessary tools to synthesize the material properly from his lectures. The information taught in the class is not real math or real music, just some watered down version of both haphazardly combined into one field of study that has very little research published by anyone besides the two Yale professors who work on it. ",
            "\u00a0At times, I felt that this course could have been named \"Mathematics or Music,\" for it rarely hit both on the head. \r\n\r\nThis course improperly uses mathematics -- some of the things we've learned have been plain wrong. ",
            "\u00a0I think the material should be reworked to be more accessible to students. ",
            "\u00a0This course, as it is one of the first to follow this particular curriculum, has its anticipated speed bumps along the way in terms of organizing the teaching in a way that makes sense to the extremely uneducated student. Though this class is an intro class of sorts, I think there is an assumed knowledge base that is a bit higher than is made clear at the beginning of the semester. This is to say that this class would have been more valuable to me if I was more well-informed at the beginning of the semester as to what I needed to know in order to get the most out of this course. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that the course was very well paced throughout, until the last unit. The last unit concerning higher-dimensional modeling of music felt rushed, and time on other units probably could have been compromised to ensure that students had a better grasp on the final unit. ",
            "\u00a0The class could be improved by somewhat clearer teaching and making more explicit the ways in which mathematical concepts from different units related to one another, and how the math and music were connected. ",
            "\u00a0The course seems to deal a lot with the modeling of music in a mathematical framework but doesn't take the extra step to show how it applies to actual music. We had one class on the application of cyclic universes to different rhythms in various pieces of music which I thought was a highlight of the course, but the remainder seemed fairly esoteric without much \"point\" in relation to how we could use it to inform us either musically or mathematically. Also the depth of math covered was somewhat shallow and disorganized. On problem sets there would often be concepts that we didn't really discuss that we would have to use our intuition for, but I feel that we did not go deeply into the material enough to actually develop intuition about some of the topics.

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone who has a genuine interest in the material. Because the math is very different from that typically covered in introductory math classes, this is not necessarily an easy HU credit for STEM majors (or QR for that matter). Professor Cohn is very charismatic and approachable. We also had an incredible TA (Ethan) who was very fair and good at explaining things. All in all, MUSI 175 was a very well-organized class with plenty of study material provided on Canvas (notes + solutions). The course was significantly more challenging than I expected, and was hard to grasp near the end, but that was like due to my laziness and tendency to miss class. ",

            "\u00a0Yes. It allowed me to think about unique and different problems than I usually encounter in my classes. ",
            "\u00a0As a music major, the first three quarters of the class was a very slow review of basic musical material and an introduction to modular space and graph theory. During the final few weeks, the math part sped up a lot and I felt a bit lost. ",

            "\u00a0This class is great if you're a STEM major looking for a good HU credit and it's also a good QR credit if you're a humanities major looking for one. The concepts covered in class are interesting. ",

            "\u00a0I would for a student interested in a fun QR course. However, it's hard to see me taking much I learned from the course anywhere else so I'd advise against for someone with those interests. ",
            "\u00a0Course could be improved in terms of organization. no solutions for problem sets were posted (only partial ones one time), which did not facilitate learning ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend this course to students who are interested in modeling music mathematically, and to students who want to complete a QR or HU course. Although frustrating at times, the course is interesting, and it's not too difficult. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in music and like graph theory and set theory and want to see how this kind of math applies to music, can be really interesting. Otherwise, it might not be as fun as it sounds. ",
            "\u00a0Decidedly not. This class was just a load of bs and I didn't enjoy it. ",
            "\u00a0I took the class because I wanted a fun QR related to music - something I love to do and am interested in at a high level. However, my actual experience in this class was frustrating, disappointing, and disheartening. Part of the draw for me for this course was that it seemed accessible - I don't feel like my math abilities are all that strong, and I thought that the set theory, modular arithmetic, and geometric representations advertised in the syllabus would make me think about math in a new way, but the whole experience was just frustrating. ",
            "\u00a0I likely would not recommend this course. Although I learned a lot and it wasnt too hard for me, even without a lot of precious mathematics or music knowledge, the actual course work and grading was very difficult and almost impossible to understand. It just overall wasnt run very well, nor was it well organized. ",
            "\u00a0No--at least, not as the class and the curriculum stands right now. It is a class with very important and interesting material that is not treated properly in instruction. I also highly recommend that collaboration on the problem sets be made acceptable for students in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Very, very low workload, but not worth it. I have never before seen a class in which the syllabus was written out to include such interesting material but the actual class was disengaging and dryly taught.  This class contained little to no music and was mostly dry set and graph theory. Not until the last lecture did we see an actual example from classical music in the context of the course material. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this class to anyone who does not have a strong, strong, strong grasp of complex and abstract mathematics. From the start, it was advertised very poorlythe shopping week classes did not at all represent the class that would ensue. What I saw during shopping period included normal algebraic components, such as union and intersection, and counting pitches as they increased on a piano. However, the rest of the class involved extremely difficult-to-understand theories of graphical space (that did not seem to be fully understood by the professor or the TF) and underdeveloped material about tuning. In all, I found the class to be confounding. Never have I felt more unprepared by a professor to do work completely and with pride. I felt that I was stupid during this class, as the professor made it seem like this was all common sense. Furthermore, the problem sets did not correspond to the material gone over in lecture. They were exceedingly long and confusing, and, in my experience, no one truly understood how to complete them. The professor said that we would be applying the material in a more challenging way, but it legitimately felt like a different subject. Additionally, the class notes that were posted (akin to a textbook, since there is hardly any research on this subject because it is so out there) were written very choppily, and didnt make sense to me. One of the worst parts of this class was the isolation that it createdthis is such a unique subject (which is maybe the one interesting thing about the class) that the only person we could turn to for help was the professor or the TF. As Ive mentioned, they were almost useless in enlightening my peers or me. There was no way of helping ourselves in this course, as any research we may have tried to do would have come back completely empty. This class drained me and made me feel absolutely unwelcome in a scholarly community. The final exam felt like an exam written to purposely make me fail. I cannot stress enough how truly horrendous this class was for me. ",
            "\u00a0It is not a gut! Even though you only need arithmetic and basic music reading/music theory, be prepared to jump into this topic with much more math and analyzing than expected. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student who enjoys music and numbers and is interested in seeing how they are connected. ",
            "\u00a0This class is much harder than it sounds and will require a lot of hard work not that theres a lot of homework, but just to understand the concepts of the course. Be prepared for that! Its cool if you like music to think about it in mathematical terms but it can get very confusing and heady at times. ",
            "\u00a0This is not the gut you're looking for. Do not believe the 2014 course evaluations. Dr. Cohn is not effective as a teacher and I did not feel like he gave us the tools in order to do the synthesis that he expected on our psets. The material in the course is also so new that there aren't many outside sources that you can learn from, so doing personal research in order to teach yourself the material is not easy. Dr. Cohn's class notes are not effective tools to learn from and his lectures are so disorganized that taking notes in class is equally useless. As well, he does not appear to have a strong grasp of the information that he's teaching and this shows in his inability to answer questions when asked during class. His office hours are inaccessible and he frequently will tell you not to ask him but rather to go talk to the TA instead. Do not take this class as a QR gut or as a STEMy HU. ",
            "\u00a0I would not until Professor Cohn has developed the course a bit more. ",
            "\u00a0No; perhaps in the future, if it is restructured. It is clear that the information is interesting (at least, I thought so) but the lectures are confusing and the teacher unhelpful in understanding the course. ",
            "\u00a0I think this is a very interesting course, and it is worth exploring as it teaches a rather singular field that is different and intriguing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, as long as they had strong fundamental musical knowledge, which greatly helps in understanding the course material and the motivations behind concepts. Although most of the time the material didn't seem practical, it was still interesting to examine music through a mathematical lens. ",
            "\u00a0The class seemed very interesting but was often quite frustrating. I was glad I challenged myself, but was not sure whether the challenge was because the material was difficult or because it was not always clearly presented. Often lectures would spend a fair amount of time on the simple material and then rush through the more complicated elements. Also, sometimes the professor seemed a bit confused about questions during class or like he didn't have complete mastery over what he was saying. ",
