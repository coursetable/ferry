            "\u00a0A strength is in the group collaboration on the questions each week. A weakness is in the lack of regulation or filtering for the questions that the visiting lecturers submit. Some weeks the questions would be fair and make sense and some professors asked questions that appeared outside the scope of the course. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures lacked continuity because each week we talked about a different disease with a different professor and there is no one overarching theme. The weekly quizzes (where you collaboratively work on some questions with 2 other students and type out an essay response in google docs) was a lot of stress for me. You definitely had to read your papers, and depending on whether your group mates pull their weight (and read the papers before class) you might end up doing very little or a lot. We also didn't really get a lot of feedback over how we could become better at answering the questions - because the style of questions also change every week. \r\n\r\nI think it could be fun if we could maybe do the questions together sometime as a class (where everyone participates) with the TA/professor guiding the discussion. It would also be less stressful if only part of the weekly discussion quizzes counted. ",
            "\u00a0Quiz questions did not always have a straightforward answer so grading felt arbitrary. Some of the papers we were assigned to read felt a little too dense and impossible to understand without more background in the field. ",
            "\u00a0Broad range of topics, very detailed concepts and good integration of things learned in 301. I would have liked to see more of the clinical side of research, but I still really enjoyed all the basic science aspects. ",
            "\u00a0The professor lineup is obviously OP and it's a really interesting course. My only suggestion would be a little bit more week-to-week normalization of the question topics/styles, more clarity of the questions, and more normalization of the amount (# pages) to read. ",
            "\u00a0A strength is the thought-provoking discussion questions and group-based discussion. I know I learned a lot through discussion with my classmates. A weakness might be the specific nature of the questions, but this might be a good way to keep us aware of the literature and delve more deeply. ",
            "\u00a0regular assessments, group assignments, interesting material ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of this course is the quality of the lecturers. I felt that all of our Monday lectures were very interesting, and most of the topics were things I had never heard of.\r\n\r\nTo me, the biggest weakness of this course is that it sometimes felt like it had unfair expectations. I often felt like the course was catered to people who had a heavy research background. I do not, and I often felt lost when topics were glossed over because instructors assumed everyone would be familiar with a certain technique or experimental design. I have taken MB&B 251L, but I didn't feel nearly as prepared as my classmates who had spent time working in biochemistry labs. The final paper was particularly challenging in this regard. It is VERY difficult to design a series of experiments when you've never had to do anything like that in the past, and the course wasn't really designed to prepare you for this (at least in my opinion).\r\n\r\nMy only other suggestion is to please ask instructors to assign papers based on quality, not quantity. Nothing is more frustrating then devoting equal time to the six papers that were assigned, only to arrive at the discussion section and see that questions are drawn from just two of them. I thought Joan was the best about this, especially when she would write the assigned papers on the board, reference them during lecture, and let us know what she wanted the key take-aways to be. This definitely helped me focus my studies, and I felt like I got much more out of the papers this way. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed learning about various areas of research, but it felt like the medical impact of some lectures were lacking. The volume of papers to read some weeks could also be a bit overwhelming, although we always managed it in the end. My biggest criticism is that I wish there was a clear point's rubric for the written assignments, as I didn't always know what part to emphasize.\r\n\r\n(There also seemed to be a problem with the random group sorting, as I ended up in the same group as two people at least 4 times.) ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - the group work, because it felt more like real life and lab discussion of relevant papers\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - some topics too narrow or difficult to learn well in one lecture (like the T. Stietz ribosome things). TA's a bit unnecessarily strict ",
            "\u00a0This class is an absolute jewel. The open teaching style as well as the focus on certain recurring areas of biochemistry makes it an extremely rewarding experience. The only weakness, in my opinion, is that the presenters sometimes relied too much on their PowerPoints and didn't clearly explain themselves without several rounds of questioning. One unrelated thing to note is that the majority of the instructors--excepting only Joan and Karla--are men, and that the vast majority of instructors are Caucasian. Though maybe some of this could be attributed to the field, some extra diversity would be appreciated. "

            "\u00a0It's not a bad class. You get to read a lot of papers and definitely become much better at consuming scientific literature. 100% of the class this year were MB&B majors so you'll get to know your classmates very well. Having said that because it's curved grades are also a lot of stress because every piece of assignment count for a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially for students more interested in the basic science research. Although the class emphasized clinical applications more than other classes, it was still heavily focused on research. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course. The amount of scientific literature we are able to read and engage with is hugely helpful for applications in our own research and other courses. The workload is very manageable and enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this was a good class for learning more about research and how it affects the clinical side of the equation. There was very limited discussion of the medical side, but there was still a connection. ",
            "\u00a0Strongly recommend as a fourth or fifth course to improve grasp of biomedical applications of molecular biology. ",
            "\u00a0This course was amazing. You get to learn from many professors, each with expertise in the chosen topic. Make sure you dont fall behind on the mini-review paper or final paper, because these require significant research. The professors and TAs were really engaging, and we definitely appreciated their commitment. ",
            "\u00a0Finally some applications of MB&B to real disease - but not as much as the title implies. Still mainly biochemistry with a touch of application, but still cool. Group assignments are clutch, good practice with reading papers but don't be mistaken that it's quick and easy. 3+ papers every week to read after Mon before Wed is quite a bit of work. The final paper is challenging because you design your own experiment. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course to learn about how biochemistry impacts the medical field. It will also give you a much greater appreciation for the work that is done in biochem labs. This class should be required for anyone thinking about pursuing an MD-PhD. It will give you great insight into how the physician and scientist halves of your career will interact and support one another.\r\n\r\nNote: This class is very challenging if you have no wet lab background. I wouldn't forbid anyone from taking the class if you haven't worked in the lab, but know that you will have an uphill battle compared to your peers. The instructors assume you already know certain techniques or aspects of experimental design, and this can be very frustrating if you actually don't ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed this MB&B elective. It was nice being able to work with friends in the major and we got to read a lot of interesting papers. Lectures and discussion questions could be hit or miss depending on the person giving them, but I felt like I got a taste of a lot of different subject areas. ",
            "\u00a0Probably one of the best upper level MB&B class available, and my favorite thus far. Brilliant professors and MDs teaching about their favorite research topics, group work to dissect papers, as would be done in real life. Relevant, inspiring, and awesome. ",
            "\u00a0If you have the background, absolutely. It'll give you more faith in your field. "
