            "\u00a0Working with Deb gives students the opportunity to engage in collective, company-based theatre making, which is an experience many of us have never had. I was able to expand my theatre knowledge and tool box in this class and developed a greater appreciation for this type of theatre making. ",

            "\u00a0The course was far too discussion based, there were far too many voices in the room and this often stopped us from reaching artistic decisions in a timely manner, and slowed down all of the pertinent processes. I think rehearsals in class should've started way earlier to make each class session as productive as possible. ",

            "\u00a0Take a class like this. It's an enormous time commitment, but incredibly rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who has any interest in Shakespeare or performance. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed performing in a show this semester via a Theater Studies class. I think it allowed us all to gain a deeper appreciation for both the play and the other members of the company. Also, having been involved student run theater of all kinds, it was fantastic to be in a production with an adult in the room at all times ;) ",
            "\u00a0It depends on the experience you're looking for with a Shakespeare class. If you're looking for a production based experience then this is a great option! "
