            "\u00a0I learned a whole ton about the cognitive science of pleasure from a very interdisciplinary standpoint. This was a really fascinating course with a constantly evolving syllabus - Professor Bloom would pick the next week's readings in part based on the discussion from the week before. This was really cool because it felt like the whole semester was connected. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about suffering and what makes a good life. Discussion was always very engaging ",
            "\u00a0i learned about the psychology behind the pleasure of pain for a bunch of different phenomena ",
            "\u00a0This course was a great semester-long exercise in critical thinking, arguing, and classroom debate. We learned about current knowledge in the studies of pleasure, pain, and suffering and worked together each week to synthesize informed opinions and to challenge one another's viewpoints. ",
            "\u00a0A thorough review of the psychological literature on how one can derive pleasure from pain (e.g. mountaineering, karma, unchosen suffering, guilty pleasures) as well as how these ideas connect to each other and potential extensions ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the different theories regarding why people enjoy benign masochism, NSSI and sexual masochism, and chosen and unchosen suffering. I also learned how much suffering is necessary for a good life. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about why people enjoy suffering/unpleasant things from various perspectives (psychology, philosophy, etc.). Content-wise, I engaged with a lot of interesting ideas (for example, the limits of altruism being practical and the experience machine). Skills-wise, I learned how to engage with various types of academic writing and people of various academic fields. I also developed new skills from doing a creative, non-traditional final project. "

            "\u00a0This course has interesting readings, and Professor Bloom is great, but the conversation was always really disorganized. We would debate philosophical things that had very little to do with the reading and sometimes it got boring. ",
            "\u00a0I think the greatest strength of the course is Professor Bloom - if you can get into a course with him, obviously take it. He is a hilarious professor and incredibly insightful and engaging. His wealth of knowledge in all fields of psychology is remarkable, and it's always interesting when he assigns the rare reading that he himself wrote since it's cool to see how his own field fits into the topic of the course. He also is a really, really kind man.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness I can think of is that the reading responses required that we used all the week's readings in a short response. I imagine Professor Bloom did this to make sure we actually did all the readings. However, this was really tough because the readings weren't always all related, so sometimes I felt quite constrained in the approaches I could take to the responses. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that having the class open by having everyone go around and say one thing was a really good way to encourage class participation. Reading responses were also a good way to keep people engaged with the material ",
            "\u00a0i didnt receive any clear feedback about my performance in the class. additionally, Professor Bloom certainly has his style and it can be intimidating sometimes to talk in class because if something isnt interesting to him or important to the discussion, it wont be talked about further and its easy to feel shut down. ",
            "\u00a0This course was perfect! Great for anyone who is curious about the mind and the interdisciplinary study of cognition. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the overall course content via reading and class discussion, Professor Bloom and his ability to lead discussions, the final project and presentations. Weaknesses: although the discussion was well directed, it could sometimes be dry and I felt like people went on tangents or gave personal examples that did not necessarily help me leave the discussion feeling like I reached a conclusive answer on the day's topic. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the seminar style of this course. It allowed me to really engage with and understand the material on a deeper level. \r\nThe discussions were always well organised and engaging, and the material itself was fascinating. ",
            "\u00a0I honestly really enjoyed this class in just about every respect. The class discussion felt lively, honest, and personal in comparison to many of the other seminars/discussion sections I have been in. There was a good mix of personal and academic ideas in the weekly discussion. The assignments were adequate from week to week, and the final project was not too daunting though it still encouraged a lot of engagement. "

            "\u00a0I would only take it if you are sure you are really interested in the subject. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you can get in definitely take it. You'll have a blast while learning a lot. The topic changes every time Professor Bloom teaches it, so he's going to be learning alongside you and figuring things out during the discussions. It felt like an actual conversation with an incredibly brilliant man rather than a professor lecturing his students. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Great class great professor.  Very intellectually engaging ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course, or any course with professor Bloom, to another student. the syllabus was extremely interesting and the discussions were rigorous and challenging. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely! I recommend to anyone who is curious about cognitive science or pleasure. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, this course was one of the most interesting classes I've taken at Yale and really pushed me to think about traditional ideas in new ways. Professor Bloom is one of the funniest, most helpful, and engaging professors at Yale - definitely don't miss out on taking a class with him! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Professor Bloom is not only an extremely intelligent and insightful professor, but he is also very caring and passionate about his students. The topic last year was the pleasures of fiction and the topic this year was the pleasures of suffering, but regardless of the exact topic, it will definitely be worth your while, especially as a Psych/CogSci major or grad student in those areas. The content was very interesting to read, so I did not mind the sometimes long readings. The length was generally manageable anyways. The reading responses might seem like a pain but I actually learned so much about critical reading and analysis from having to incorporate all of the readings into a concise argument to answer the response question. The final essay/project definitely took a lot of time to write, but Prof Bloom breaks it up nicely so you're not scrambling at the end. By the time I began writing, I already had a topic, a proposal, a basic outline from my presentation, etc. Definitely a fantastic seminar if you're able to get in! ",
            "\u00a0YES! Take this class if you can get in. It was one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It might be the most fun class I've taken at Yale. The discussion is lively, funny, and, to be quite honest, feels like a deep late-night conversation between friends with very little filtering and a lot of hot takes. I mean, of course, it's still a Yale class with a significant workload, but it's genuinely fun and there's not a lot of pressure to sound sophisticated or to worry about grades and deadlines, so the focus is really on the topic of the week and everyone's thoughts. The final assignment is supposed to be a 20-page paper or a project with an equivalent workload, which may sound daunting, but a lot of people opt for alternatives like podcasts and documentaries and I honestly had a lot of fun with my project.
