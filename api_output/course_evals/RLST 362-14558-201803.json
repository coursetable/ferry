            "\u00a0I gained a great insight into Islam as a religion, and the foundations of the Islamic legal system. This class helped breakdown a lot of stereotypes I didn't even know that I had about Muslim communities, and Islam. ",
            "\u00a0-Developing an argument, even if it is counter to your own beliefs (through the in-class debate exercise)\r\n-Close reading of texts and critically analyzing them \r\n-Engaging in discussion to dissect readings carefully and find the main arguments of a writer ",
            "\u00a0This course has been an eye opening for me. The knowledge that I have gained in this course was exceptionally insightful and interestingly critical. I have learned a lot about women and gender in Islam with profound critical sources and reading texts, which challenged my understanding of this religion and women's issues around the contemporary political scope in Middle East. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much from this class. Most importantly, I learned to challenge my own preconceived notions of what it means to be a Muslim and what it means to practice Islam. I can say that this class succeeded at making me a more informed citizen and less ignorant person to a degree that very few other classes have. I will continue to tell people about the things I learned in that class including the hijab functioning as a symbol of liberation for many women, the way people can be socialized to feel unsafe around coed religious spaces, the colonialist roots of the  human rights discourse, and the egalitarian messages within the Quran ",
            "\u00a0One of the best classes I have ever taken. Highly suggested for everyone, regardless of if you are a Muslim woman or not. "

            "\u00a0This course has many strengths including amazing relevant readings that build on each other, great important conversations, and moderate work-load. The only weakness I can think of is that the class discussions were somewhat dominated by the professor, which is understandable to an exten as the professor needed to clarify. However, more students voice during conversations would have made the class perfect. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this class are the facilitated discussions, the strong selection of readings, the use of different mediums to portray information (podcasts, and documentaries), and the linkage of information from the readings to present day events. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n-Selection of topics and readings - I was drawn to this course because I found the material to be extremely interesting and the fact that the topics were connected to one another. \r\n-Structure of the course - I think the variety of assignments really helped me to engage with the class as it spread the work load very fairly. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: fascinating reading material each week and assignments (such as the debates and reflective essays) that encourage us to engage more thoroughly with the reading materials and form our own opinions about the authors arguments.\r\nWeaknesses: primarily a lecture-based teaching style used which did not encourage as much organic back and forth among students ",
            "\u00a0An amazing class. "

            "\u00a0YES! Everyone should take this class. ",
            "\u00a0YES! I would definitely recommend it for anyone truly curious about womens status in Islam and is ready to abandon all the stereotypes about Muslim women. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this class. While the readings are challenging, the knowledge gained from this class is valuable in helping you understand that the gender issues in Muslim societies are both contextual and complicated. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to other students in MMES, NELC or WGSS. It provided me with so much knowledge and perspective on the topics we covered and has challenged me to think in different ways. ",
            "\u00a0Highly! I have already recommended many of classmates in the Art Department to take her course for next semester, if she is teaching next year. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to other students. The workload is reasonable and the material will endlessly fascinate you if you have any interest in understanding the origin of cultural norms and how religious text can be used to justify certain ways of thinking. Also anyone who is non-Muslim should feel obligated to take this class. There are so many misconceptions out there about Islam and Islamophobia is on the rise all over the world. Its time to fight bigotry through conversations with friends and family and distinguish between fact and fiction. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This class opens up a whole world into the the reasons behind the portrayals of Muslims in the world today and deals with a lot of contemporary issues. Regardless of whether you are a Muslim or a woman, please take. "
