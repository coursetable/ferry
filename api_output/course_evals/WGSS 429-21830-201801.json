This is a really important class to take, I think, and it was the sort of class that naturally started conversations outside of class. (I ended up talking with a friend in the class about something Professor Rosenbluth talked about just about every time afterwards. That's a sign of a good class.) The class does a good job of mixing broad theories with more pointed applications of those theories. The overall approach of the class is strong/well-organized: It first introduces the three lenses, and then it applies those in different ways to different instances of problems at the intersection of gender, biology, politics, and economics. \r\n\r\nIn terms of weaknesses, I think the readings could be better incorporated into class and section. There wasn't great consistency in terms of which readings ended up being really important in class and which were tangential.

After taking this class, I feel much more educated about why gender inequality exists and the challenges that females continue to face in our world today. I also appreciated that the class took into consideration biological, economic, and political lenses when talking about these different challenges- Professor Rosenbluth literally starts at the beginning, from a biological standpoint, in asking how exactly males and females are biologically different. She then moves on to consider various topics like the gender wage gap, female political representation, women and development, and female participation in the workforce, all through these various lenses.

Whenever we discussed the experiences of women who weren't white and European or American, it felt like a diversion from the \"main\" material. There shouldn't be a single lecture on race and class. Race/ethnicity, religion, class, sexuality, and ability should be incorporated into EVERY lecture because all of these factors are essential to the lifestyles and experiences of women around the world.
