            "\u00a0I believe that my Korean significantly improved in general through the course of this class. ",
            "\u00a0There was a lot of practice on vocabulary. I think that was the main thing I learned in this course: which vocabulary and grammar patterns to use in which situations. Often we learned the cultural background of the grammar and vocabulary to aid in that. ",
            "\u00a0Improved Korean grammar & vocabulary; practiced writing; better understanding of corporate work culture ",
            "\u00a0I definitely felt like my Korean ability approved overall, with particular attention to incorporating more complex vocabulary and grammatical structures into both speaking and writing. ",
            "\u00a0I developed linguistic skills as well as cultural skills at a higher level of learning in Korean. I was able to relate to current events through in-class discussions and debates and formulate and articular my personal opinions. ",
            "\u00a0Reading, speaking, and comprehending higher level Korean language ",
            "\u00a0initially this course was difficult for me because I had decent oral proficiency but less-than-average literacy proficiency. This course helped me improve both aspects of my knowledge in the Korean language significantly. ",
            "\u00a0I developed higher levels of writing, reading, and speaking Korean. This namely occurred through in-class discussions/debates, reading short stories/articles, and writing essays (about 3 paragraphs) on various topics presented to us. \r\n\r\nI also learned a lot through the cultural-literacy project, where we a Korean drama in order to learn more about the work environment and social culture within Korea. \r\n\r\nNot only does this course help with learning Korean, but it also creates a space to debate and express one's own opinions about various topics that come up. This happens both in-class and during TF sections, and both class and session were a joy to go to every time.\r\n\r\nThe course overall is very insightful, and I would recommend it to everyone. It has left me with a lasting impression that will stay throughout my entire life. "

            "\u00a0We learn a lot of vocab in this class, but we don't really return to them once the quiz or test is over. I think I would retain the words a lot better if we reviewed them every once in a while or encountered them in new situations. I also still don't know when to put spaces between the characters. I guess pretty much every time. \r\n\r\nI really like how I always knew what to expect in class. There was a pattern and a routine which I found helpful to my learning. ",
            "\u00a0Too many projects where we did not learn anything new directly. I would have liked to learn more new grammar and vocabulary at the advanced level, even if it meant using our textbook more and doing fewer projects. ",
            "\u00a0The course in general was really great. I would say that it could maybe be improved by more clear grammar integration. It's really easy to learn a grammar point and then never use it, so it would have been nice to be challenged in a concrete way to use more advanced grammar. ",
            "\u00a0There was a bit too much of a range in language ability across the class; I'm not sure if everyone's language needs were met due to that.\r\nThis could be improved if Yale expanded its Korean department by hiring additional faculty. The Professor did the best she could with her course. ",
            "\u00a0This course was fantastic. Professor Lee-Smith is wonderful at engaging with students and at catering to a heritage course in which writing/reading/speaking proficiency varied fairly significantly. I don't think there were any weaknesses of the course on her part. Even with 13 students, sometimes that felt a little large for a language course that was trying to push us to speak with longer arguments. The course might have been even better with an even smaller group. ",
            "\u00a0One of the strengths is the numerous debates and discussions in class. Often times when discussing something one is passionate about, he/she is inclined to be able to speak naturally instead of having to think hard to process thoughts. I did not see any visible weaknesses in this course. ",
            "\u00a0There are no weaknesses to this course.\r\n\r\nThe strengths: language acquisition, increase in skills of Korean, increased in written confidence, and a great group of people you get to know throughout the semester. One of the best things about this course is that you get to know each and every one of the people in the room (about 15 people), and you get to share conversation and experiences through in-class discussions and debates. Professor Lee-Smith is phenomenal and always prioritizes her students when it comes to learning. This class has so many strengths that I think I can continue writing to fill up this entire character limit. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to improve their Korean skills or keep them sharp. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommended. Korean is one of the best language courses Yale has to offer. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, although the class requires a lot of work and much more engagement than the previous levels, you will learn a lot and it is very rewarding to see how much you've improved by the end of the semester ",
            "\u00a0Take this course if you think your Korean vocabulary and grammar are lacking or you want to improve on them. Speaking as well is something you could improve on in this class. As far as writing and reading, I'm not too sure. We did do a solid amount of writing in homework assignments and reading in class, but as far as graded assessments, I felt that vocabulary was a much more emphasized skill. Either way, Professor Lee is great and tries to make the class atmosphere as fun as possible. ",
            "\u00a0Good course for heritage speakers if you would like to improve your Korean. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I was really on the fence about continuing Korean, but Professor Lee-Smith makes this class really rewarding. While there can be a fair amount of work, I found it to more than fair for an L5 course that's still 1.5 credits. Like any language course, the kind of thinking you're doing for it is also easier and involves more rote memory than other subjects, so I found that the workload balanced out. Class itself was always engaging and often downright hilarious, and I'm really going to miss both it and Professor Lee-Smith. ",
            "\u00a0Seeing as this is the second highest level of Korean available at Yale, I would strongly recommend this course to those interested in delving deeper into the language in all facets. It does a great job to cover all the possible aspects of the language and does so in a very efficient manner. ",
            "\u00a0I recommend this course to other students. The course is well organized and the instructor is very involved, passionate, and knowledgeable. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. Not only would I recommend this course for another student, but I would also advertise students to take Korean starting from L1 just to be able to take this course later on.\r\n\r\nThe course was not only important to my development as a Korean speaker, but it was also just fun to be in. There is work to be put in, vocabulary quizzes, essays, and other assignments, but the work all makes sense and adds to the learning experience, rather than feeling like \"busy work,\" as I feel like many language classes end up doing.
