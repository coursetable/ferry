            "\u00a0I gained a greater understanding of the mitigation efforts that coastal communities are implementing to combat rising sea level and coastal erosion, the methods used both in the field and in the lab to acquire information about water quality and organism health, as well as new knowledge on how to write a lab report and a research proposal. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about saltwater marshes, and about nitrogen and phosphorous. ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge about coastal environments, conducting research, and most importantly, how to conduct research and how to develop a research plan. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the different ways humans and natural processes have changed coastal environments, especially in New England. I learned how to write a research proposal and refined my lab writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0A better understanding of the scientific method and coastal environments. ",
            "\u00a0Before this class I had never written a lab report for an environmental science related project. From the first to the second lab report, I improved significantly due to very detailed feedback. My figures as well scientific writing improved to ultimayel. Beyond that, the class covered a variety if coastal topics that I enjoyed getting to see first hand "

        [
            "\u00a0This course is a great opportunity to engage with coastal environments in the New England area and also learn a lot of the basics of most lab courses at Yale in a fairly low-pressure class. I also really enjoyed how independent it was. When writing your project proposal, you pretty much have all the freedom you want over your topic, and you end up learning a ton just through independent research. Professor Decker and our TF, Laure, were awesome people to get to know and they always had our learning in mind. \r\nThe readings for the class were often excessively long and not very helpful to the class itself. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths--Professor Decker & our TF Lauren Pincus were wonderful.  Really knowledgeable about geology, marine biology, and environmental studies in general, so they played off of each other in class and that was great.  I thought the field trips were well-selected and generally stuck to learning what was on the syllabus.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses--I wish that there was a bit more of a balance between working in the field and learning in the classroom.  Though it's great to have so much time in the field, it's also more educationally helpful to spend time listening to Prof. Decker lecture for a bit--not just for a four hour stretch every few weeks.  I think there could be more of a balance there, especially with the amount of reading assigned that we never really discuss or need because of the nature of the assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the field trips and lack of weekly work. You get to take a trip to the ocean almost every week in the first half of the term, which is amazing, and don't really have to do any readings. Weakness is it's super unorganized and very backloaded. More than 50% of your grade rests on the last couple of assignments right around finals. ",
            "\u00a0Incredibly interesting, fun, and learning focused class. Loved how interactive everything was, and definitely felt like I learned way more because of the hands on nature of the class. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a great way to learn about coastal environments hands on through almost weekly field trips. It was a great way to escape the Yale bubble and learn about the environment nearby. There is a free trip to Cape Cod during Fall Break which is a huge perk of this class. Sometimes the homework assignments didnt feel very closely related to what we learned about during our field trips, but they were helpful at teaching scientific writing. ",
            "\u00a0The course could have a little more structure and have more of a logical progression of topics week to week to better introduce students who are less familiar with the subject matter. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the idea of writing a project proposal, but think that a bit more could be done to cover how to emphasize the strengths of a project and to explain how to write a procedure for implementation. One of the strengths is the long class periods which allow for field trips and lecture on the same day, which really helps to emphasize what is learned in class. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class because the field trips are really interesting and the project proposal is really fun to write. However, keep in mind that it may not be as structured as all students want. You will probably not walk out of this class with a ton of facts, figures, and concrete knowledge about every angle currently being discussed about coastal environments. However, you will gain a much greater understanding of what you are specifically interested in! The class is tailored to your interests. ",
            "\u00a0I have mixed feelings about EVST 244.  I was originally really excited about the syllabus, and it was great to be out in the field, out of the Yale bubble, exploring cool environments (especially over October break) but I was also very underwhelmed.  Seemed like some of the field trips were more about exploring cool stuff than they were investigation-based, and it did feel like the lab reports and problem set kind of came out of the blue with only a few guidelines to go off of.  There isn't much work consistently, and you really don't need to do the readings each week because the class is so fluid, but when you do have an assignment due,, it takes hours and hours and is usually pretty hard.  But the grading is very fair and more constructive criticism than just giving you a low grade.  I'd say take the class if you're trying to dabble in the sciences without going too deep, have an interest in marine life, and are willing to put the time in when you need to. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this would be the best class I took at Yale and it wasn't. So if you have the right expectations, yes. But be ready for unorganized atmosphere and super early mornings for the field trips. No assessment means not sure what I actually learned outside of individual projects. Problem sets were kind of a joke. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this class to anyone interested in the environment, or how we interact with the environment. This was the most fun I have ever had learning at Yale! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in coastal environments, taking field trips around New Haven (even if that means early - sometimes 7:30AM - starts on Friday), and working on their scientific writing. This course definitely focuses more on New England, which makes sense given the focus on field trips, but the research proposal allows you to explore coastal environments in another region. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Decker (and Lauren, the TA) are great, and the field trips are a lot of fun. The lab reports and other assignments take a long time, but I learned a lot from them, and there are only a few. ",
            "\u00a0Without a doubt! This course is definitely geared for upperclassmen who are preparing for their senior thesis project. However, it is also a great opportunity for any motivated student to further their knowledge of coastal ecology. The workload is manageable, and the assignments are engaging. Grading is not harsh, but the assignments require substantial effort. If you are interested in marine science and environmental issues, I would highly recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to another student. I would say that there is a learning curve, but the feedback I received really helped me do better work. Many of the deadlines in the course are slated towards the end of the class, though plenty of warning is given. That said, use your time outside of class wisely because they can sneak up. This semester the TA was very helpful inside and outside of class and I hope that remains the same- there are such varied topics covered that it was helpful to have both in the classroom and on field trips to answer questions. Overall I liked the field trip and lecture style because it exposed me to real world instances of the material and allowed better understanding of costs in Connecticut (I am very glad that there is a class that takes advantage of new haven's proximity to the ocean) "
