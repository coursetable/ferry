            "\u00a0The strength is that the readings are very interesting and the class is enjoyable. There are readings every class and 3 class presentations throughout the semester. The weakness is that the readings could be outlined and summarized a bit better by the student presenters. ",
            "\u00a0I loved learning about London's cultural history through this course. Most of the learning, however, was through the readings. I would've loved for our professor to have shared more of her knowledge and expertise and even lecture us more as opposed to having student-run group discussions of the readings every class. ",
