Professor Cameron published all the slides so even if the class moved quickly, you could return to his detailed notes later. Further, the readings were quick and interesting. I believe the class suffered from poor attendance but the material was impressive. ",
            "\u00a0The topics covered in this course are extremely interesting, ensuring the course's popularity. However, the organization could be improved and Professor Cameron's lectures can be dry at times. Slides are loaded with information - sometimes too much - and many students leave this class losing the forest for the trees. I wish this course focused more broad themes and takeaways rather than minute details. ",

The course regrettably has some weaknesses as well, however, associated with Professor Cameron, which I will discuss later. "

The grades are 1/3 midterm, 2/3 final, so the class is light for much of the semester, but a grind at the end of the term. ",

However, the amount of detail in each lecture makes this course difficult for students who don't have a decent amount of background in European history or politics, even though no prerequisites are required.
