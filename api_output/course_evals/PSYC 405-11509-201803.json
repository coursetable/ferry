            "\u00a0What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?\r\n- I learned not only how to think about emotions and evaluate their impact on us and our close others but also about asking questions guided by Social Psychology that allow us to really study our own behavior in a way that no other class at Yale has taught me to do. I found myself being engaged in thinking about emotions in a very academic way that actually helped me deal with everything I went through this semester really well. ",
            "\u00a0The social implications of emotion, how emotion is expressed nonverbally as well as verbally, and the functions of emotions. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about emotions and their social functions and effects in social contexts. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me an understanding of emotions and their role in relationships.  It's obvious that feelings have an effect on the way we interact with others, but it was really interesting to understand why we feel certain things and how our expression of those feelings changes the way others perceive us. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the functionality of emotions in regards to our relationships and life with other people. The course helped me think about emotional lives in a very different way than I ever had before. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read various kinds of psychology papers (empirical and non-empirical) that incorporated a wide range of methods and had many interesting findings. I also was able to further develop the ideas from the papers in discussions with my classmates and Professor Clark. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about how to understand emotions in a relational lens and how to develop theories around emotions. ",

            "\u00a0What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?\r\n\r\nStrengths: \r\nProfessor Clark is an absolute gem. She is a HUGE name in the field of Social Psychology but she is one of the most down to earth and engaging professors I've had the pleasure of taking a class with. Each week, there's an assignment and a reading response that makes you apply the readings to your own life experiences so doing the homework for this class was the most fun part of my academic workload! Oh and there was food (pastries, fruit, tea and coffee) at every class. \r\n\r\nWeakness: \r\nSince a lot of the class is driven by students' questions and discussions, we often wouldn't get through all the exciting material that we could have covered, which was a little sad sometimes. ",
            "\u00a0Very manageable workload, good discussions, and interesting subject matter. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were that I felt comfortable speaking in class. Professor Clark was fantastic.  No weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0Nothing, it was great! ",
            "\u00a0This course is wonderful! Professor Clark is genuinely invested in the success and wellbeing of all of her students.  There are small homework assignments every week that are very manageable which allows you to focus on the final paper throughout the semester.  Professor Clark was always available to meet to discuss new thoughts and ideas on your paper and would give lots of feedback so it was impossible to turn in a paper you weren't proud of.  Also, there's often snacks and coffee during seminar which was nice!  The only negative thing (which wasn't even bad) was that the class was a 9:25, but it was definitely worth it!! ",
            "\u00a0The course was filled with interesting discussion. The content was very engaging, tying in both intellectual content and personal anecdotes. ",
            "\u00a0Discussions in this class were often interesting, but were rarely directly tied to the readings -- I felt that a lot of the contributions were based on folk psychology and personal experience, rather than on psychological principles or findings from the literature. This may have been attributable to the makeup of this semester's class specifically, but while I really appreciated hearing about my classmates' personal experiences and how they connected to the themes of the course, I didn't find myself expanding my knowledge of the literature or the field. \r\n\r\nI also didn't receive feedback on most of the assignments that I turned in, so it was difficult to know if I was completing my work correctly. The assignments themselves were pretty manageable -- each week, we discussed a different emotion, and the assignments for each week involved writing an example of that emotion (either from personal experience or from the media) and answering a theoretical question about that emotion (e.g,, \"What do you think about [x]?\" I wished the assignments were more tied to the papers that we were assigned to read. ",
            "\u00a0AMAZING course and AMAZING professor...seriously, my favorite at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0This was a great class. The discussions were very interesting and the studies we read were interesting. \r\n\r\nThe only weakness was that some classes were very discussion driven while others had a lot of Professor Clark presenting information, but it may have been better to have a blend of both for each class. ",
            "\u00a0Material was well organized. Content was interesting. "

            "\u00a0Yes, I would because if you are interested in social psychology, it is extremely interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Great course and fantastic professor! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this class!  If you are interested in the way you interact with other people, you should take this class! Low workload and extremely interesting material.  Professor Clark is an amazing teacher and just an amazing person in general.  I would note though, that I started psychoanalyzing myself quite a bit during/after taking this class hahaha but everyone needs a little introspection :) ",
