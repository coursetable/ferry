            "\u00a0It is incredible how much this course changed the way I look at both photography and sculpture. I had never actively considered their relationship, but every class session, my understanding was deepened, complicated, or nuanced by the readings and our class discussion. This course helped refine my research skills, and I wrote my first real exhibition proposal/catalogue essay. This final paper was really formative, and it will be really helpful for me in my future art history courses/museum jobs. I think, more than anything, this course taught me to have an extremely critical eye when looking at photographs of three-dimensional objects--there is so much there to unpack! ",
            "\u00a0learned a lot about photo and sculpture as I hoped. got great contact with Yale's various collections, which will help in future research ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the development of photography and the reciprocal relationship this had with sculpture - a really interesting look at these subjects from a number of different angles. ",
            "\u00a0This course was an amazing deep dive into the relationship between sculpture and photography. I really appreciated the opportunity to have a seminar dedicated solely to discussing these two media and was able to read lots of treatises/theories about them. While doing the reading for the weekly seminar, I learned how to extract relevant information from hundreds of pages of reading while also drawing connections between the two. The class also often met at the YUAG, YCBA, or Beinecke to use Yale's extensive collections to further develop our visual analysis and connection skills. Especially for my work as a Gallery Guide at the YUAG, I really valued the opportunity to fully debate the presentation of sculpture and photography in museum spaces and in the public sphere. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: really engaging class discussions; the visits to special collections/study rooms were hands-on, fascinating, and they helped facilitate meaningful discussion. Both the professors were extremely well-prepared and knowledgable on the subject. They were always there to propose supplemental resources/readings to the students. \r\nWeaknesses: I sometimes felt like there was too much to cover/discuss in such a short period of time. ",
            "\u00a0wonderful! wonderful. no weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0Really loved everything we touched on, but would liked to have gone a little into the contemporary moment, with artists who work at the intersections of photo and sculpture (Erin Sherriff, for example). ",
            "\u00a0This course was amazing, and the few suggestions I have would only serve to heighten student engagement with the material. I would recommend that if this course is taught again, the professors assign a weekly reading question to encourage students to do at least part of the reading and draw conclusions and connections to answer the question. Because the class was fairly large (about 15-20 students) I think that many people sometimes relied on their peers having done the readings in order to drive the discussion. Weekly reading responses would ensure that everyone did at least some of the reading assignments. "

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to any student interested in art history, photography, or sculpture. I was genuinely excited to go to class each week because it was always so different from the week prior. The class was really well organized: each week we tackled one main topic/theme, and I really liked that. I recommend this to a student who has some familiarity with art history courses but wants a seminar that is discussion-based. Overall...Take this course!!! You won't regret it. ",
            "\u00a0100%! nick and Martina were amazing to work with, we got to look at great art every week, and I learned a ton ",
            "\u00a0yes! ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! Would highly recommend this course to another student, most likely a history of art, art, architecture, film and media studies major because this is a seminar and does require some previous knowledge of how to write visual analysis as well as art historical theories. This course taught me to how to engage with intellectually challenging and dense material and relate it to works of art I had previously studied, seen in the YUAG, or were studying in the course. "
