Many of the guest lectures were fairly repetitive and didn't seem a great use of time. The lectures early-on from Maureen could have been more engaging and deeper, felt somewhat rudimentary and not new information (basics of powerpoint). It's neat that it's set up as a client class, which brings a unique perspective to the course. ",

The instructor gave helpful feedback throughout the semester and invited sustainability-focused consultants to share their experience during class. \r\n\r\nWeakness: The course experience highly varies due to clients. It usually took up to three to four weeks on average to start working on projects efficiently. Mid-term presentations happened right before spring break, leaving two to three weeks for students to actually work on the project. ",

The lectures were not necessarily tied to our projects, but they offered interesting insights into the life of a consultant that we could maybe draw parallels to in our class projects.\r\n\r\nIt was also useful how there were feedback opportunities built into the course. Everything was direct. ",

I would have liked to have a few classes that were workshop-based that helped us build consulting/team work/presentation skills. I took the sustainable entrepreneurship consultancy class this semester, and that class did a group job of curating the in-class time to help us improve our performance for the client projects. I would recommend talking to Peter Boyd who was the faculty advisor for that class, to ask him about running workshops during class time. ",
