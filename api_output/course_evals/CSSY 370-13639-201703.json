            "\u00a0I learned how to come up with an original TV concept, and carry it through the stages of pitch, outline, and pilot episode.  I also learned how to close read TV episodes, the importance of doing so, and the techniques and methods such close reading will allow me to apply to my own TV writing.  I also learned a great deal about the industry and how actual TV shows get picked up, and how working writers in the industry navigate it. ",
            "\u00a0For better or worse, I learned a lot about the TV industry. Sometimes this made me a lot less interested in TV, but I was glad to have the information. I felt like I learned how to sell myself and the importance of connections, yes, but also some interesting details about narrative storytelling. I also felt like I learned a lot about what I *didn't* like which helped me sharpen my professional interest in television to something more specific than just drama. ",
            "\u00a0The Art of TV and Drama offered a very comprehensive lens into what makes great TV and how to write a compelling pilot. We gained insight into very diverse styles of writing and the professional world of being a TV writer. We were taught how to not only craft our own pilot, but the process of pitching, of writing a story area, of interacting with professionals, and advocating for ourselves. I learned a ton! ",
            "\u00a0I learned what goes into writing a TV show/pilot ",
            "\u00a0How a TV episode is structured, how to approach creating a tv show, and a lot of information about how the tv writing industry works ",
            "\u00a0Very valuable insight into the tv industry, elements of a good story and screenplay, and the stages of the developing a pilot episode. Overall a very insightful course! ",

            "\u00a0Well structured and well paced course.  The weekly discussions always corresponded well with the episodes we read and kept us engaged and invested.  The guests who came to speak to the class were also great. Perhaps an expansion of the types of TV shows studied beyond such a heavy focus on the white male \"antihero\" as the keystone of prestige TV. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course was how many awesome TV pilots we got to read and discuss. \r\n\r\nI think the class would benefit if there was more attention to the like actual mechanics of story writing. A lot of how I went about writing my pilot was just mimicking what I liked in the pilots we read. While this is definitely a useful/necessary technique, I would've appreciated more instruction apart from this on how to write the basics. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: LOVED writing the critiques, I found this super challenging in a surprising and unique way, to have to deconstruct a story I already knew was \"good\" and decide what made it good. (It also allowed me to follow my own interests a bit more.) Aaron's feedback on the critiques was always really sharp and insightful. Same for on the pilot  as difficult as it was at the time, I found the stages of writing that we went through were ultimately incredibly useful and that Aaron's comments were mad helpful. I felt like I was inspired to work harder on the assignments overall more than I expected to be and really took them seriously. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Quality of the shows we read could've been vastly improved. I felt like the material was functionally dated and that we spent more time reading many pieces within a norm (procedurals, male anti-hero) than needed  we could've read just one and then spent the semester reading pieces that unpack that norm, like all the shows we cited as our favorites in the beginning. \r\n\r\nI was genuinely surprised that even though we are living in an unprecedented rise of shows centered around women we barely read any. I know me and of other women in the class felt alienated because we didn't watch any of the shows being championed. Like, what happens if you hate Mad Men? It was really surreal to go to class the day after The Handmaid's Tale and Big Little Lies swept the Emmys and read another drama about a white man struggling to Do Right because it was like, not only did I want to read more stories about women, but stories about women are where the industry is going! So it was like, not only did I feel like a lot of women in the class felt removed from the material because the shows they watched weren't included and the shows they had to read listed all female characters as \"young, attractive,\" I also felt skeptical of the material we were reading because it seemed not-in-line with the industry's direction. Obviously CBS and such are still the big markets but that's not where the creative excitement is, you know? \r\n\r\nIn general it was a really hard time to take a class about TV, obviously, because the giant national news story was If You Go Into TV As A Woman, You Will Be Harassed. So maybe I'm being unduly critical because I wanted the class to do more to make me feel like that future wasn't inevitable.  But while I'm sure nothing was meant by it, handing out a Woody Allen script immediately following a discussion of film/TV and sexual harassment is like not really in good taste. ",
            "\u00a0The obvious strength of this class is its super interesting subject material. Even people who aren't interested in pursuing a career in the entertainment industry will probably enjoy discussing what makes an episode compelling and how their favorite shows were created. I found the homework (pilot analyses and pilot writing) very useful, interesting, and integral to what we were learning in class. In addition, I really enjoyed the pilots chosen and thought they offered a very wide range of styles and examples of what can make a pilot successful.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this was one of my first classes that I've taken at Yale that offers really REALLY practical real-world insight into the industry. I appreciated that aspect so much and feel a lot more knowledgeable in general about the TV world.\r\n\r\nI would have liked to have some feedback on actually writing dialogue before the final assignment, as I think it could have helped my overall final product. It would have helped to practice writing a single compelling scene or teaser before jumping into the entire pilot, and seen where improvement could be made small-scale. I also would have enjoyed practicing pitching my pilot idea to the class for some more real-world experience. ",
            "\u00a0The readings are great and the discussion makes you think about TV in new ways ",
            "\u00a0Would love to work in some kind of workshopping element! ",
            "\u00a0An opportunity to read/ study numerous television pilots, and develop your own. \r\nI sometime wish we had more time in class to mull over our television ideas. "

            "\u00a0Totally. Great class, super fun, super informative, and especially great if you're actually trying to be a writer in the industry. ",
            "\u00a0An introduction to TV Drama. Expect to learn a lot about the industry, sometimes demoralizing but definitely informative. Class generally centers around the male anti-hero genre (Mad Men, Breaking Bad, Ray Donovan) as the epicenter of our supposed second golden age of television. Take it if you're considering going into the industry. ",
            "\u00a0If you have any interest in TV writing at all, DEFINITELY take this course. You will go through all the steps in writing a TV pilot and analyze a bunch of really amazing scripts so you have a really good sense of what to do as you write your own. Professor Tracy is incredibly friendly and always interested in talking and helping you out in any way he can. It is definitely a lot of work, but absolutely worth it. ",
            "\u00a0yes, awesome course. you learn a ton about TV industry and writing ",
            "\u00a0YES! It was awesome. One of my favorite classes. The pilots are super fun to both read and watch and Aaron is so encouraging and knowledgeable. ",
            "\u00a0If you can get in and you genuinely want to analyze TV and what makes TV work, take it. It's a solid class if you put in the work. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you want to be a screenwriter, or work in the entertainment industry in some way, this is a very insightful and fun course. It's not too demanding and Aaron really takes the time to get to know each student. ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested in TV writing or the television business, take the class!  Aaron is lovely, and the readings are fun. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, really fun, really current, and provides an opportunity to be creative:) ",
            "\u00a0You definitely get a good look at the industry that you wouldn't normally get since Prof. Aaron is doing exactly the work that he is talking about. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Take it whether you're a film studies/theater/English major or just generally interested in TV or screenwriting.The class was both relaxing and intellectually challenging. I went in thinking it would be my \"just for fun\" class and ended up with a new hobby as I continue to work on products from this class afterward. Two pilot scripts every week with some writing reading on the side. Writing your own half a pilot and listening to others' ideas is fun and eye-opening and doesn't overwhelm with workshopping. Aaron Tracy is a writer's writer. He's not only good at what he does but he's in love with the craft. He shares all different kinds of writing philosophies, invites interesting guests, tells you all about the behind-the-scenes of the TV business, and gives excellent feedback. "
