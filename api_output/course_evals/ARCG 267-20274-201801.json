            "\u00a0I learned a ton about how humans became what we are today! ",
            "\u00a0Methods of studying human evolution including bone morphology, dating methods, and DNA. Tool use, comparison with modern primates, theories about brain evolution, information about Neanderthals and human Neanderthal interbreeding, cave art, evolution of hunting, etc. ",
            "\u00a0I learned both the facts of human evolution (who, when, where) and a wide variety of approaches to how to study paleoanthropology, from carbon dating to genetics to how anthropologists can make stone tools. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the discipline of human evolution, its methodology, and delved in depth into understanding evolutionary theories and the importance of ecology for understanding humans today. ",
            "\u00a0This class really introduced me to the world of human evolution and the extensive fossil record. A lot of the material in this class was extremely new to me, and I found the content fascinating. From touching fossils to learning about religion, this class really provided a wealth of knowledge. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The class covers some interesting topics but would be better served by varying lecture styles a bit. After a while, another dry 75-minute lecture just isn't that appealing. But Prof. Watts is a lovely person, means well and clearly is passionate about what he teaches. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures for this class are great, although at times they can get a little too technical. Reducing the scientific jargon of the course would make it more accessible to those without prior knowledge of archeology or biology. Sections are also super fun, and the hands-on aspect of the course was my favorite part of it. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- Professor Watts is wonderful and the overall set of topics is interesting and gives you a good insight into the state of the field of human evolution, including modern areas of research, new methods, and specific niche topics. Professor Watts' extensive knowledge of chimpanzees was particularly interesting, as was comparing social systems among living primates. I also enjoyed how all of the class assignments and section taught you things about the material without being overly stressful- Professor Watts always returned our assignments with extensive comments with more information on the topic, which I really enjoyed. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses- none really- if anything I would have preferred to spend slightly less time on the methods section earlier in the course and a bit more time with the topics at the end of the course, especially with chimps as a comparative model since Professor Watts knows so much about that topic. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked Human Evolution! I really appreciated how much Professor Watts cared about the material, and how he cared about his students and didn't try to punish us with unnecessary assignments/exams (if the course had any significant weaknesses, it might have been that it was almost a bit too easy, although I'm not going to complain because I still feel that I learned a lot). I think that, for the most part, the second half was more interesting for the first, although I do think that it was good that we spent some time talking about the more \"methods\" parts, even if they weren't always as exciting. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this class was wonderful. The lab sections were always hands-on and very fun, and the lectures were informative while being digestible. Professor Watts was always willing to cater to the interests of the students and was extremely knowledgable about the material. The class was a great foundation with opportunities in the assignments to pursue individual interests. The articles assigned for reading were always interesting, and overall it was a good learning experience without being stressful. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength of this class was the generally interesting content. Lectures were interesting and the readings provided plenty of new knowledge. However, a predominant weakness would be the lack of organization. Lectures often bounced around, and it was often hard to follow what was necessary and what was not. A little more streamlined information would be helpful. "

            "\u00a0Human Evolution with David Watts was an excellent class. Professor Watts is a truly great teacher, and he gives excellent feedback on assignments. The assignments are also very effective assessments of what you got out of the class. One of the best teachers I've had at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0An ideal So gut - the sum total of work was two 3-page reading responses, a 4-page midterm essay, and a final paper. But I probably would not recommend this course to an anthro major. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course! Professor Watts is is really energetic, and his enthusiasm makes it impossible to not be interested in human evolution. Lectures can get a bit boring sometimes (especially when they go in depth into osteology), but overall they were really interesting. Sections are probably the best part of this class, and even though the anthropology department is a real hike, I was always excited to go. It's a really laid back environment where you can handle a bunch of cool fossils and ask any questions on your mind. Overall, this class was one of the only classes that I felt was organized to facilitate exploration and learning instead of sticking to a strict syllabus and preparing for tests. It was a great class! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This is a great course with a professor who really cares about the material and his students. the assignments (two 3-4 page reading critiques, a take home midterm, and a final paper) really allowed you to engage with the material in a meaningful way. Section was also well run, as Professor Watts led the sections himself and most classes we looked at model fossils or had some kind of activity. Lecture is occasionally a bit dry but overall this was a great class! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend Human Evolution to a student who is interested in spending a lot of time thinking about the course material but doesn't want a course with a ton of work or hard assessments. Some of the lectures occasionally felt a bit dry, but overall I really enjoyed the class and am glad that I took it. I really liked the fact that Professor Watts gave a take-home midterm and a final paper, which made us engage with the material but weren't as stressful as exams. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class for anyone interested in evolution, biological anthropology, or humans in general. The evolutionary approach to studying humans provides a really interesting framework to understand human society and behavior. I felt the class was detailed and rigorous while remaining fun and relatively low-stress. Professor Watts is a wealth of information and is always willing to be flexible and address the questions and interests of students. I learned a huge amount about the subject matter and the discipline of paleoarchaology in this class, and I loved the subject matter and the breadth of material. The lab section is a great way to get hands-on exposure to the topics addressed in class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class, but don't expect too much. The material was very interesting, but the class is quite unorganized and hard to follow. If you want to take a class to touch fossils, have some interesting readings, and just learn about a niche subject, then this is the perfect class. However, do not expect to receive an in-depth understanding of the material. That being said, Professor Watts is nice and the class is relatively easy. "
