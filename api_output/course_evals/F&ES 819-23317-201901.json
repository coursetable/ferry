I feel more equipped to engage in conversations about conserving land and ecosystem values, and have a better understanding of how various benefits of ecological conservation collide and intersect. I also gained a technical foundation for understanding sources of conservation funding, and the organizational structures of land trusts. ",

The variety of offerings really helped make the class feel well-balanced. ",

The course laid the groundwork for what aspects are required for doing deals, all of the aspects involved with management, and brought in a variety of speakers of varying areas of expertise. ",
            "\u00a0Many, many insights. Lots of knowledge. Skills also, but to a lesser extent and mostly incidental to what i was doing for my clinical project. I truly loved this course in every possible way. This course bisects the many angles of private conservation in a highly structured way that makes it manageable for students. So I got up to date on many issues that I knew were going on and others that I didn't knew existed to well. So yes, many, many insights from guest speakers and vast new knowledge about their topics, readings included! ",

I learned about the process of doing a conservation deal, and how to fund those deals from a variety of sources. I learned about who to engage in conservation and how to make sure conservation meets community needs. I learned to question convention and ask questions to find new ways of problem-solving and getting people (funders, stakeholders, staff, etc.) on board. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths - the TA, the dinners, the guest speakers, the conversations, the format of the reading, Prof. Gentry's lecture.\r\n\r\nLook, this is a strong class!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - sometimes during class discussion it is difficult to get everyone to speak up. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures and feedback can become a bit conversational, some more structure would be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strength of this class is its structure of a lineup of guest speakers followed by discussions. The class discussions were some of the most engaging and insightful of any class I've taken at FES.\r\n\r\nI think the weakness is really the variability of the projects, but that's going to be true of any clinical class and isn't specific to this one. ",
            "\u00a0The ability to network with the speakers after the course was amazing. I really enjoyed getting to talk to speakers after the lecture and learn more about their organizations/their work as well as get to explain in a smaller setting my interests.\r\n\r\nI think the time dedicated to the clinical project report outs in class could be utilized or done differently. Because not everyone was familiar with each other's projects, it was hard to keep continuity. ",
            "\u00a0One of the strengths of the course is clearly the speakers. It was an amazing opportunity to hear different insights from people working at different areas within the private conservation sector, and it was great to hear . Although I benefitted highly from the discussion portion of the class, often we tended to gravitate towards the same content. These ideas are critical, and will remain a challenge for conservation moving forward. However, I would have liked it if the readings were integrated into the class more. ",
            "\u00a0The guest lecturers were really an amazing part of the course. There were aspects of the group project, however, which felt more about intern-type work and perhaps less about what we as students could learn from it. ",
            "\u00a0This course has many. many more strengths than weaknesses, by far. The only way I would improve itif at all and based on my particular semester's guest speakers/session topicswould be to combine the land stewardship and the baseline report sessions into one single workshop/lecture. This not because the land stewardship session or the baseline reports workshop had any flaws to themthey didn't! But just thinking about how many of their lessons do overlap and that could open up space for a workshop on, say, \"community engagement\", which is something a lot of people are currently interested in and which we ventured into quite effectively in one session that included a workshop-type exercise (that a lot a people really enjoyed, me included). Yet everyone wished he'd had more time for it! So those are my two-cents: combine stewardship/baseline reporting into one day-long thing and expand on community engagement with an additional day-long workshop that can also include other aspects of the matter. The landscape-scale conservation session was the one that wasn't worth anyone's time because of the presenters, but it is still an important topic. I really enjoyed so many guest speakers so much that it is very mention some and not others, so I'm just mentioning the single one I (and others) didn't like. ",
            "\u00a0Most of the guest speakers were excellent. I did think that the class length and timing (almost 3 hours in the late afternoon) was a little rough. It was difficult to stay attentive for that long so late in the day. Perhaps switching to a morning block or breaking up the class into two 1.5 hour sessions a week would facilitate greater sustained engagement. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength of the course is that there are so many engaging speakers. Professor Gentry really took the time to arrange for top-notch speakers from around the country to come visit our class. One weakness of the class is that the readings don't always match up well with what the speaker talks about. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided very little flexibility in terms of catering the topic to each student's knowledge and learning goals. Would have appreciated an option to focus on learning fundamentals (laws, policies, financial instruments) instead of required discussion-based style. One way to achieve this would be if we could choose either a client-facing project or a research paper for our end result. The class discussions could have focused more on the readings than on our general feelings. I feel I did not get enough basic knowledge for the time I invested in this course. ",
            "\u00a0Too many strengths to count. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is it shares insights from working professionals who have specialized experience and knowledge in the topic that they are lecturing on that week. \r\n\r\nThe downside of this strategy is that sometimes (rarely) the visiting guest is less effective, which doesn't become apparent until after the fact. The only way to get around this is to learn from experience and invite the guests back who you know will thrive in lecturing/engaging students.\r\n\r\nAlso, a somewhat neutral but constructive piece of feedback is that this course was a lot of work. Unlike in many other classes, students begin working on their final projects within the first few weeks of classes (on top of weekly readings and discussion posts), and the project work remains consistent throughout the semester. For this reason, I put much more time into this final deliverable than in most other 3-credit, non-capstone courses. The quality of this deliverablethe amount of time and care put into itwas definitely capstone-worthy, and I would encourage the school to consider making this course eligible to be considered a capstone in the future. ",
            "\u00a0The amount of weekly reading assignments for this course was pretty excessive, though they were useful. The projects for this course were also very well organized. In this course, the outside organization's go through an application process, which helps to make the projects more structured. And while some students may have run into some issues with their projects, the overall experience seemed to be pretty positive. ",
            "\u00a0The structure of the class (3-hr meeting 1x/week+weekly reading recaps) let me really sit and immerse myself in the topics for a longer period of time. The lineup of speakers was so strong--I felt lucky to be able to hear from experts across the map of conservation work and understand their standpoints.\r\n\r\nIs there a basic \"finance module\" that incoming students to the course could be required to complete? Would help with \"language barriers\" during the finance-oriented sections of the class, which I think limited some students' learning (including mine). \r\n\r\nI loved the partnership project and its length--initially I felt very underqualified to take on a report of its magnitude but felt my competence and confidence increasing week-by-week through conversations with land-trust partners and my project partner as well. ",
            "\u00a0My four suggestions are:\r\n1. Greatly reduce the time spent reviewing last week's speakers. This part doesn't need to be a big, organized exercise, just a quick review of the key takeaways. Their needs to be much more time for the current speakers--they were all cut short before they got to the meat of their lecture.\r\n2. Remove the time spent talking about students projects. That's what the Canvas assignments are for--we can catch up on our peer's work there. Set up one to two individual meetings with Brad and TA to discuss progress.\r\n3. Revise the weekly readings. Reading 5-6 40+ page reports per week is not feasible and not a good way to spend time. And we don't have time to figure out which ones are the useful ones. By making so many \"required\", it actually reverse incentives us to do the readings. Just make one or two specific pieces \"required\".\r\n4. Don't make social/political issues secondary to the rest of the classes foci. These need to be their own section of the class. And we need to have a specific class on the beginning of the semester to discuss the historical problems/limitations of 'conservation'. The school and world is demanding us to be able to answer this.

            "\u00a0This class is a must for anyone planning to work on conservation, regardless of their desired organizational size or if she or he aspires to work in the public sectorit doesn't matter, you have to take this course! It will put you in direct contact with top practitioners and highly experience people in the field and they all come in sharing their life-long lessons and valuable insights. To boot you can keep conversations going with guest speakers after each session. There is however a decent amount of materials to read for each session and you have to turn in weekly reaction essays to both the assigned readings and to the previous week's lecturer, so there's that seminar aspect to it. For the same reason, as with any other seminar, much of the quality of the discussions will depend on you and your classmates and on how much into the readings you go. The clinical project is also something to be thought about. It does take a lot of time if you want to come up with something decent by the end of the semester, so do consider this also if you have too many other term projects or papers for other classes. Highly, highly recommended. TAKE IT! ",
            "\u00a0Do the readings that either appeal to you or cover subjects with which you are most unfamiliar. Don't try to read all readings every week because there are just too many to reasonably keep up with. ",

It exposes you to a breadth of topics and career paths in the conservation field, and it gives you and classmates a space to ask fundamental questions about what conservation is, who it's for, and who is it done by. Strongly consider taking this course if you would like to work for a conservation non-profit, land trust, or TMO. ",
            "\u00a0The reading load was a heavier than I expected, so may want to try and not have other classes that also have large reading assignments. You also need to decide pretty quickly what project you want to work on. Dr. Gentry is also easy to talk to, so I would suggest asking him questions if you are unsure about anything. And although the workshops can be time consuming (although there are only two), I found them useful. But be careful selecting other classes that also have outside workshops or field trips that may overlap with these workshops. Take advantage of the opportunities for dinner with class guests. Even if they are from a field you may not know a lot about, they can still offer good advice and insights. ",
