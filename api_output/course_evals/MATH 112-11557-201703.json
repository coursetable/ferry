            "\u00a0After taking calc in high school, this class definitely helped me touch back upon each topic and develop a better understanding of calc and its importance. ",
            "\u00a0Not much new, a majority of this course was covered in AP Calculus AB, Newton's Method was new, however. ",
            "\u00a0I developed knowledge of calculus and new mathematic components ",
            "\u00a0This course really built upon the calculus that I learned in high school and now I understand the real meaning behind everything that we do in calculus. ",
            "\u00a0This course refreshed me of my high school calculus knowledge and introduced a few new concepts. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the fundamental theorems and properties of calculus. I gained a better understanding of calculus concepts such as Riemann sums. ",
            "\u00a0In depth knowledge on limits, derivatives, and basic integrals. ",

            "\u00a0A weakness of this class was that when we had a wed assign due the material of those questions was not covered until after it was due which made it very difficult to understand the questions. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are the ways the course were taught but the weaknesses were the professors way of prepping us for the exams ",
            "\u00a0I felt like the practice exams did not properly prepare us for the exams. The practice exams for both midterms had me believing that the test was going to be a nightmare when in actuality they were manageable, and the practice exams for the final exam did in no way prepare me for the difficulty level of the final. However, I found that the class itself really helped clarify things that I had read in the text and was imperative to my learning(students - this is why you should actually show up to class!). ",
            "\u00a0It was well organized, but the exams were more difficult than the information presented in class and on the homework. ",
            "\u00a0Strength:\r\n1) It had an interesting professor who made the class fun sometimes\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n1) The questions on the problem sets were much more difficult than content covered during class.\r\n2) if you werent familiar with calculus beforehand the class would be way too fast and not thorough enough to understand the concepts. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the course moved at a good pace, and everything we learned ties into itself very nicely.\r\nWeaknesses: Psets were harder than they needed to be, and I think at times there was more focus on algebraic manipulation than actual calculus concepts. ",
            "\u00a0strengths were the tutors and availability of extra help in office hours, weakness was the way the questions were formatted on the tests were unlike the questions we had previously been exposed to ",
            "\u00a0If you get a good instructor, this course can be a great way to learn the basics of calculus. The course is difficult though because it is a lot of work. ",
            "\u00a0This course could have been better structured and I feel that sometimes the WebAssign and problem sets do not completely align with the material being taught in class. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who is on the fence about taking either this or MATH 115. High school calculus would not have prepared me for MATH 115, and in this course, I was able to build upon my calculus skills quite well. ",
            "\u00a0Unless this student is strong in calculus, I would advise to take a lower level course. I did not take any form of AP calculus in high school, and I struggled in this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the workload was definitely manageable and it is a good class to take to reinforce content learned during high school calculus especially if it has been some time since youve last studied it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - calculus is an important subject for everyone to have a background in, and this class emphasizes the practical applications it has. ",
