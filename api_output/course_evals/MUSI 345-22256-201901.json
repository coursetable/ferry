I feel that preparing 3 pieces for a jury performance was an important part of my lessons curriculum, and needing to memorize three pieces and perform them in an audition-like setting was extremely instructive. This style of preparing pieces and performing them is necessary for any performer looking to audition for graduate schools or jobs in the future, and I think Jannas students are deprived of this educational opportunity.
