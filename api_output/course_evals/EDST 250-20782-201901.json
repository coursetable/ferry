This is a writing credit, so clarity of thought and argument are important skills taught in the class. Professor Hersh cares deeply for his students and they're development as thinkers and writers, so he would give feedback n a draft as many times as you turned it in. If you wanted to rewrite your paper 7 times, he would have spent the time to revise it 7 times until you were happy with it. "
