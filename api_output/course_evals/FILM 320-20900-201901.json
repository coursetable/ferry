            "\u00a0This course opened my eyes to analysis of film even further than any previous course Id taken in the area at Yale. The film selection was spectaculareach movie was unique and important and engaging in its own way. ",

            "\u00a0Great ",
            "\u00a0I watched some seminal films that I had never seen before. I strengthened my shot-by-shot analysis skills. I also learned how to have a scholarly, helpful conversation about any film, even if I didnt enjoy it. ",

            "\u00a0Predictable format of every single lecture without change -- this is both a strength and a weakness. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: some fantastic films (eg The Shining and Mullholland Drive); the presentations were fun opportunities to explore films in depth and share insights with our classmates; the weekly reading responses were a reasonable workload; lots of flexibility with paper topics \r\nWeaknesses: sometimes when two students were assigned to present on one film, their presentations were redundant ",
            "\u00a0I think the class time is not used as efficiently as possible. Since only one or two people present a film each day, there is not much room for discussion and people have tended not to pay much attention. I think there should be more of an emphasis on group discussion. "

            "\u00a0yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The workload is not overwhelmingjust the right amount to challenge you as a thoughtful viewer of cinema. You can tailor assignments to your own interests, and youll have the chance to watch some amazing films you might not encounter otherwise. ",
            "\u00a0If you are a film major, you will have to take it. I liked many of the movies that we watched, however the class dynamic wasn't very cohesive due to how the class is structured. "
