            "\u00a0I learned so much about the historical dynamics of race and gender and how they come into play with consumerism, colonization, and religion. It gave me a new way of looking at the literature that we read and thinking about the authors of the creation of the characters and or the voice of the work. We had a very small class as well, so we also learned how to think and collaborate on ideas together. ",
            "\u00a0This course traces the ideas of race and gender as well as their intersection in a survey of transatlantic literature. There is an emphasis on close analysis, lateral connections, and broader thematic trends. ",
            "\u00a0This course covers a variety of fascinating works by and about female and African authors. I learned about the ways in which these authors navigated issues of race and gender in both narrative and presentation. We studied the front matter of novelsfrontispiece, list of \"subscribers,\" etc.and had rich conversations about decisions regarding book design. Most pre-1800 English classes study works as solely texts, but I felt that I was really analyzing the book in this course. There were so many extra components that minority authors had to add in order to \"prove\" the value of their work to potential readers. "

            "\u00a0I never knew that a pre-1800s English course could be this good. But it was. I can honestly say that I looked forward to class every week, and enjoyed every minute of seminar. ",
            "\u00a0LOVED IT SO MUCH. ",
            "\u00a0This class is superb at placing works in contextI don't think I've ever an English class that so perfectly balanced history, personal identity, and literature. These works provided insights into the society at the time, exposing contemporary social prejudices through the artistic choices of the writers. It was a strong decision to sandwich the works between Gyasi's Homegoing, because I felt that I got much more out of the book during the second time. The discussions were fantasticwe were particularly fortunate to have a small seminar, where everyone participated. "

            "\u00a0TAKE THIS COURSE. One of my favorite English courses I've taken at Yale don't let the pre-1800s course listing fool you. Professor Campbell is an incredible instructor who truly cares about her students and wants them to succeed. ",
            "\u00a0YES! This class is very interesting and there will always be good conversation! (even if certain pieces of 18th-century literature are a little dry.) This class is really amazing. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! It is a great course to experience, whether you're an English major completing a requirement or a non-major needing a WR credit. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, yes, yes! The feedback that Professor Campbell provides is truly singular in its thoughtfulness and meticulousness, and Professor Campbell is such a passionate and dedicated educator. (She also brought us treats and tea from a fancy French bakery every Thursday.) If you want to craft better arguments, learn about authors you probably haven't encountered in an English class before, or participate in brilliant and enriching discussions, take this course! If you're interested in creative writing, I think that you would benefit from this class as wellthere's a lot of time spent on talking about the presentation and design of the books, both of which are important for any writer to consider. We had a session in the Beinecke that was wonderful, and this was the first course in which I felt that I was actually studying the whole book and not just the text. "
