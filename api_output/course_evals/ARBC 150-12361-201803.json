            "\u00a0During the course we read a few stories, learned vocab for the stories, and worked out of the Media Arabic book which was helpful ",
            "\u00a0Very few skills, knowledge or insights.\r\n\r\nThis course is not very well designed to teach you arabic and you wont learn very much by taking it.. ",
            "\u00a0I liked this course's focus on media vocabulary, which I felt was helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt new vocabulary, especially vocabulary related to current events and the media, and how to read Arabic texts. "

            "\u00a0The class had no structure to it which was frustrating at times however, the relaxed pace was nice and I still felt like I was practicing and advancing in my arabic ",
            "\u00a0The Quiz system is absolutely awful. Once a week you get a quiz that is supposed to test your vocab from a lesson or story from the past week. The vocab list is released and every time without fail 20% of the required vocab are not on the list. If you aren't already a native speaker this is just impossible to study for and will always depress your grade.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the presentation system every week does nothing to facilitate your learning. First off, things like your sentence structure, grammar and the best vocab for the situation etc. can't be evaluated and helped because you are being graded on it, so you end uptalking in broken arabic about the first thing on al jazeera for six months and learning nothing. ",
            "\u00a0The quizzes often covered material not discussed in class, which made the course more difficult for me. In addition, some of the stories we read had vocabulary and phrases that were not particularly useful. ",
            "\u00a0Learning vocabulary and reading texts from the media book were very helpful. I felt that my reading skills improved because of this. I really enjoyed talking about news articles every Wednesday; I just wish we could discuss current events without finding articles as well so that we could improve our speaking skills further. Additionally, it would have been better if we had discussed the media vocabulary more in class and had used it in our discussions, like we did in L3 and L4. I wish the short stories that we did were discussed more thoroughly in class. I feel like I did not get the most out of them because I could not grasp the grammatical structures and some of the vocabulary. "

            "\u00a0Yes, especially native speakers who want to fulfill their L5 credit as you are allowed to speak in dialect and the work load is very manageable ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely not. The course itself is extremely poorly designed and won't help you to succeed either in learning arabic or in getting a reasonable grade.\r\n\r\nEither you already know arabic well enough that this course teaches you nothing or you don't know enough to keep up and your grade will suffer. Take literally any other language or arabic class (if you insist on taking classes in this awful department). ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student only if they're ready to handle the workload. The course involved weekly presentations, readings, and essays. I would also recommend Professor Aziz. "
