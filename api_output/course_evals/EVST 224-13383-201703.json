            "\u00a0- Historical background in creative non-fiction including examples ranging from John McPhee to the present\r\n- tools for the reporting process\r\n- writing workshops to build skills and take constructive feedback ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about interviewing and writing a reported piece in creative nonfiction style. I previously knew next to nothing about structuring, writing, or interviewing for such pieces, so this learning curve was pretty sharp. I learned to appreciate these kinds of reported pieces so much more, and I also learned that I am not a natural at writing them! I also gained a lot of insight in editing these pieces and came to a true appreciation for my classmates' insight and writing styles. ",
            "\u00a0I developed better narrative-style writing skills, became more aware of a variety of different nature writers and their styles, and got the chance to explore my own voice from microcosm pieces to reporting pieces. ",
            "\u00a0Got exposed to a bunch of good nature writing.\r\n\r\nHad the experience of doing multiple drafts of creative nonfiction pieces 10-15 pages long. ",
            "\u00a0From this course I developed an immense appreciation for journalism and scientific writing for the general public. I had never realized just how much work it can be, and this class introduced me to that. I also learned general techniques to improve my writing and make it more engaging and readable. Finally, through the readings, I learned more about global environmental issues, and from my classmates' essays I learned more about the local environment surrounding New Haven. "

            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- great readings\r\n- alan's expertise and useful feedback\r\n- creative assignments throughout the semester\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- classroom structure functioned really well in the first half of the semester but faltered a bit into the last half. Could have used more creative activities and prompts to fill out class time as the semester went along. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are the degree of independence and self-determination students have in determining what they write about (even though this is officially an environment writing course). Additionally, Professor Burdick and the people in this class really make the experience; the enjoyability of this class is determined by who takes it and how engaged they are with the material and their pieces. Another strength of this class is the material - Professor Burdick assigned readings that I really enjoyed. Lastly, I appreciated the opportunity to essentially use the whole semester to work on our final reported piece. \r\nI think the weaknesses of this class were related to it being the first year it was offered. It sometimes just didn't feel completely organized (i.e. in the reading assignments), although this did not really bother me. I also felt a bit like I had been thrown into the deep end of the pool without knowing how to swim with writing this material. I recognize that there's no way to learn how to write except for writing, but I wish that we had maybe some smaller assignments before diving into our large reported piece. ",
            "\u00a0This course was useful in exploring different topics in the environment through writing, layering observations to reach a new threshold and takeaway from the experience. It was fun to be able to explore microcosm pieces to more investigative, reporting-heavy pieces. It would've been more helpful to receive advice on how to go about interviewing different people for the longer pieces that required reporting, but plenty to learn along the way.\r\n\r\nWe had a lot of readings each week, all of which I wish I could've read, but not enough time to read them thoroughly, so it may be better to assign excerpts of books rather than entire novels each week. I wish we read more pieces from the Colors of Nature book, from which we only read one essay from. It would've been helpful to divide the readings into more specific categories (or maybe they were, and that distinction should be made more clearly to the class). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n\r\n-The readings are so much more fun than any other class you'll take\r\n-You can write about pretty much whatever you want as long as it's vaguely related to the environment\r\n-If Alan's teaching it, you get edited by an editor at the New Yorker while writing pieces in the style of the New Yorker \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n\r\nThe readings ranged widely in style and venue, and while that helped show us the countless ways to write nonfiction about the environment, it ended being confusing during the writing process. It would have helped to get more direct guidance on style and establishing a vision for the piece. ",
            "\u00a0I think the strength of this course is that it has high expectations and gives students the opportunity to explore a type of writing that may be new to them, or delve deeper into something that they have done before. As such, having students with a range of experiences related to science, writing, and science writing was very helpful. Also the readings (including the written works of peers) were very interesting and provided a wide range of the possibilities in environmental writing. Finally, the instructor was very knowledgeable about the topic, and provided important insight and guidance in class, but also was able to sit back and let students carry the discussion.\r\n\r\nThe main weakness I felt with the class, was that the readings generally did not reflect the same scale of the class written assignments. I also felt there was not enough instruction on how to go about writing a piece of science journalism, and that many of the examples provided were not of the same scope as the assignments. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely. One of the most engaging seminars I've taken in my time at Yale and a class that forced me to move outside of my comfort zone outside of the classroom. I hadn't considered reporting as an activity that I might enjoy and this class has really pushed me in that direction. ",
            "\u00a0YES!!! This class isn't just for people who are crazy about the outdoors - anyone who appreciates storytelling and creative nonfiction writing (i.e. New Yorker-ish style writing) would enjoy it. The semester-long reported project gives you the opportunity to get into a topic that genuinely interests you and give it the time it deserves, even if it's not directly related to the environment. The people who take this class make it, so shop it and make sure the group has a vibe that you like. Professor Burdick is so so kind and a great editor - he'll help you improve your writing from whatever experience level you're coming from. This class took a good amount of time (especially interviewing and reporting), but even when it wasn't easy, I truly enjoyed it. I can't say that for too many classes. Take it!! ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend! Great course. ",
            "\u00a0Really really good. Take it if you can get in. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who enjoys reading, writing, and taking time to appreciate the environment. Some of the most rewarding parts of the course was being able to come together at the table to share different places we'd explored and people we met for these pieces. ",
            "\u00a0This course is great. Alan is a professional editor and writer and it's rare to be able to work closely with someone like that. The readings are all things you'd want to read even if you weren't required to. It's a small class, you get to workshop and revise frequently, and end up producing something big at the end. \r\n\r\n\r\nIf you take this class, go to office hours often! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this class to another student. The readings are interesting and engaging, the professor is great, the other students are engaged and helpful, and the assignments--while a lot of work--are a lot of fun. I would be careful in choosing your topics as the logistics can quickly turn complicated and eat up a lot of time, and can be difficult to plan around with the school schedule. I would strongly encourage students to attend office hours regularly, even if there's no immediate deadline coming up, just to develop a relationship with the instructor and have a chance to think over your ideas out loud.
