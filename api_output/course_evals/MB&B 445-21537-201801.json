            "\u00a0How to more thoroughly scrutinize a paper for inconsistencies, rationalizing the techniques used. ",
            "\u00a0It's all in the name of the course! Great exposure to the standard methods and logic of molecular biology research. ",
            "\u00a0This course was an excellent course for thinking critically when reading scientific literature. The course forces students to challenge many of the mental shortcuts and assumptions that are made when attempting to read literature, and I can honestly say that my scientific thinking improved dramatically as a result of this class. "

            "\u00a0Great seminar format. The small size of the class really facilitated participation from all students. The professors provided extremely helpful insights during discussions, and it was clear that they had thoroughly prepared for each session. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the class are its small size and the level of engagement from each professor. The course really forced students to fully engage with each paper as opposed to simply skimming or reading the literature at a cursory level. The only weakness of the class are that there are 4 professors, and sometimes the professors chosen for a given week were not the optimal one. Overall, the weaknesses were trivial compared to the strengths of the class. "

            "\u00a0One of the best courses in MB&B! You'll probably only really enjoy it if you find molecular biology and biochemistry research really fascinating. That said, if you do, this course will push you so much farther in your ability to read papers! There are a lot of classes where you \"read\" primary literature, but in this class I learned to pick apart papers in ways that I had never done before. Also, the professors are fantastic (especially Wendy Gilbert!) and the small class size means you get to really engage with them in meaningful conversation. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class to another MB&B major. This class is an excellent one for improving the rigor and quality of scientific thinking during and after reading scientific literature on a topic. The class involves rigorously reading 2 papers a week, and culminates in the design and implementation of an assay designed to extend the results of a chosen paper(s). The professors were excellent sources of insight that elevated the class from good to great, and the small class size and seminar set-up ensured that each student contributed to every discussion. "
