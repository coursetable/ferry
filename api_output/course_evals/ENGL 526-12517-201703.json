            "\u00a0This course was an amazing opportunity to bridge the wide gap between medieval and modern lyric poetry. As my personal experience is very much confined to one side of this coin, this course facilitated the exact environment I needed to explore the other side. I was introduced to criticism and poetry that I've never worked with before. This new material not only broadened my horizons in understanding lyric poetry in general, but also enhanced my knowledge and and experience with lyric poetry in my own field. I was particularly happy to be introduced to some of the current critical debates that surround lyric poetry in general, and literary theory more widely. ",
            "\u00a0Wide breadth of knowledge of the history of the Lyric form; introductory understanding of 20c literary theory which I found very useful. ",
            "\u00a0I had very limited experience with Medieval literature, and had felt intimidated by what felt like an unapproachable web of multi-lingual, indecipherable texts- \"texts without context\"- but this course completely changed my perspective on Medieval Poetry, and introduced me to valuable tools to continue studying in that field! Also, I've never taken a course that so successfully integrated literature from different periods with the theoretical threads following along- the course unfolded quite exquisitely with three different chronological threads all informing each other! Completely amazing. The readings in theory I found incredibly helpful- it was my first time approaching any of those writers, and our discussions were illuminating, clear, and deliberately application-driven. I feel much better prepared to use theory to have more nuanced conversations about what poems are and what they can/can't accomplish. ",
            "\u00a0Basic familiarity with concerns of all three fields of medieval Anglo-French poetry, modern American poetry and lyric theory. Close reading, understanding of manuscript work, and most importantly, the collegiality and stimulation of addressing related fields as exemplified by the interactions of the faculty. ",
            "\u00a0My understanding of the lyric from the medieval period through today was significantly increased throughout the course. Reading literary theorists, across time periods, who grappled with defining \"the lyric\" complicated my own conception of genre and the form. I believe this course has given me a healthy sense of skepticism for defintive and bounded literary forms and genres. This course has pushed me to ask better questions and think more critically of English poetry. I have been energized by our seminar discussions to continue to pursue my interests in lyric theory. ",
            "\u00a0Most concretely, I developed a working definition of the term \"lyric\" and gained an in-depth understanding of the key words and concepts that have been used to frame theories around the term. The course was not limited to just defining the lyric, however, and the class built upon that concept in various ways-- making it possible think not just about lyric poetry, but about the place of lyric poetry within a larger field of poetry-- what makes it desirable, and what makes it insufficient. The class was a wholesale introduction to Medieval lyric, for me, and I learned to engage with lyric poetry without isolating it in the time of its production. ",
            "\u00a0This course was particularly useful as an introduction to the field of contemporary lyric theory. It also introduced me to a variety of different medieval poetic genres. ",
            "\u00a0I developed my skills in working with poetic theory and increased my knowledge of lyric poetry considerably. I found it to be a very valuable course in this regard. ",
            "\u00a0Critical reading, writing, discussion, and thinking. Covered a wide range of theoretical and poetic texts. Encouraged to draw unusual links and comparisons, and to encounter texts from disparate historical periods alongside each other to generate new and refreshing perspectives. "

            "\u00a0I found the concept of this course to be very intriguing. The specialties of the two professors brought a rich array of expertise to each class, and I thought they were able to interweave medieval and modern together interestingly. The greatest strength of the class was its structure and themes, and the readings assigned to address those themes. I found the discussion of manuscripts, textual editing, and Emily Dickinson very useful in conjunction with medieval texts such as a the Rawlinson lyrics. I also found the weekly presentations to be very useful not only in engaging conversation, but building confidence is individual students to try their hand at material that is not necessarily their specialty and to find their voice. I know my presentation was very beneficial in that regard. ",
            "\u00a0Seminar discussions were excellent, though more focused on the modern than the medieval ",
            "\u00a0As mentioned above, the organization and content were outstanding. I also appreciated not having a discussion post every week- it actually gave me more time to think about the material and prepare for class discussion instead of sweating over some response that might or might not inform the direction of the class' conversation. Possible improvements- a Beinecke visit would have been marvelous! ",
            "\u00a0It tries to do probably too much. But the opportunity for cross fertilization between fields would be otherwise hard to manage. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: it was a large seminar with many voices with different level of expertise which made for lively and compelling classroom discussion. The course reading list was exceptional. Having two professors, focused on different time periods, was an incredible opportunity for the students to consider \"the lyric\" from multiple angles and diverse perspectives.  \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Due to the amount of material we needed to cover, often times either the medieval or the modern component of lyric study for that week was truncated. I think to alleviate this, the reading assignments at times could have been more specified to ensure we maximized our seminar discussion time. ",
            "\u00a0The course brought together many ways of thinking productively. I think one of the course's greatest strengths was the free-flow of its discussions and the openness of our instructors to our input, as well as their ability to respond to and develop all kinds of input. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe main weakness of the class had more to do with logistics than anything else because all the readings were helpful and pertinent, but the constraint of class time and of reading time made it so all the material could not be fully engaged with. The class dealt with two distinct periods which made some weeks seem like they had two full reading lists. Again, that is more a matter of time than anything else, and the two periods of interest converged in productive ways. ",
            "\u00a0The course lacked a certain amount of focus. My primary suggestion for strengthening it would be to reduce the number of poets we read (both medieval and modern) but increasing the depth with which we read. Reading the collected works of fewer modernists and the entirety of several collections of medieval verse, as opposed to different selections each week, might create the opportunity for students to draw deeper connections between the two. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the strength of the course was in its constant juxtaposition of medieval and modern poetry because it encouraged both the modernists and the medievalists to consider works outside of their scholarly purview. The team teaching was also a strength of the course, as each professor could bring his/her specialized knowledge to bear on the material. I think that the course could potentially benefit from increased discussion of medieval poetic theory and maybe from a somewhat smaller class size, considering the discussion-based format of the course. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed, and benefited, from the medieval and modern combination; it encouraged me to encounter texts in ways I had never considered before. The range of reading was challenging and stimulating, although sometimes (I guess as a result of this being a new and more experimental class) we didn't always have time to cover everything set in the two hours allotted, which was a shame. "

            "\u00a0Yes I absolutely would. For students who are seeking to explore poetry beyond their comfort zone, especially if they are medievalists or modernists, this course is an excellent way to do that while also keeping one foot in a world they know. For students who are neither, this course offers a very interesting blend of two topics that dovetail quite nicely. I would especially recommend this course to medievalists, because I think it quite helpfully demonstrates how to engage modern theory and poetics with medieval material. I think this course would be a very creative and useful introduction to medieval poetry for non-medievalists as well. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - it was a fabulous course on theory, poetry and historical poetics. Lanny and Ardis were wonderful, generous instructors ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! ",
            "\u00a0Unique opportunity for concentrated learning both from students and faculty. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course. The depth and breadth of the course material and the opportunity to be taught by two outstanding professors in one course created a unique learning experience unlike any other I have had at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student both on its own merit and as a way to broaden one;s horizons if one is particularly interested in one of the two periods the course is concerned with. A medievalist could gain perspective on their own work through the class's engagement with modern lyric and vice versa. I would also recommend it to anyone who is interested in learning more about the \"nitty-gritty\" details of lyric poetry in an inviting and stimulating setting. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend both instructors to a student though I do not know if I would recommend this particular course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student interested in poetic theory, whether they are a medievalist or modernist literary scholar, as it covers both time periods relatively equally. I would not recommend it to a student who is not at all interested in literary theory, however. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely--I took it because it seemed like a very original kind of class, and wasn't disappointed. ",
            "\u00a0I would strongly recommend this course to any student pursuing the study of poetry or planning to turn to poetry as their research interest at some point in the future. Essentially, it serves as a kind of proseminar in poetry, providing the foundations in the field in an intensive fashion. It will be very helpful for any student seeking to situate their own methodology of working with poetic texts within the current and past research in the field. That said, students whose primary interest is not poetry, but novel, drama, music, material culture of the book etc., will definitely learn much from this course too. The class is focused on the lyric, but it showcases its openness: how the lyric is connected with other genres and media. "
