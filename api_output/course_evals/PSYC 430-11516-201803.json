            "\u00a0I learned a lot about different methods for studying cultures, as well as the ways in which cultures are created, maintained, and passed along. ",
            "\u00a0Before this class, I had never heard of cultural psychology before. This course taught me how to integrate my psychology knowledge with a nuanced understanding of how we cognize culture. ",
            "\u00a0The cultural psychology framework is truly incredible. The readings are fascinating and have changed the way I engage with the world. ",
            "\u00a0I gained more experience reading psychology papers (empirical and non-empirical), and synthesizing a set of papers along common themes (which was the way that the assignments for this course were set up.) It also introduced me to a facet of psychology that I had never dedicatedly focused on before: what we can glean from cross-cultural examinations, why they're often missing in many psychological fields, and why we need them. ",
            "\u00a0This course was not only my introduction to cultural psychology, but my introduction to psychology as well. As such, I learned how to do lots of things -- from writing a psychological paper, to writing reaction papers, to reading psych papers, generally.\r\n\r\nI truly felt like I developed a deep understanding of how and why cultures form and evolve, and the effects cultures have on our daily interactions. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the field of cultural psychology, how to read academic papers, and more generally about the interdisciplinary nature of the social sciences. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course! Not only do you get a very in-depth look at an up-and-coming field in psychology, this course also provides you with the tools and knowledge to think critically about other experiments from a cultural perspective. There is a lot of student autonomy, both in class discussion and projects, and the professor encourages you to take ideas and run with them. ",
            "\u00a0I learned what cultural psychology aims to do as well as the methods that have been used in cultural psychological research. I also learned about the intersections between cultural psychology and neuroscience, social psychology, sociology, politics and economics. "

            "\u00a0Professor and content--professor really made it easy to be engaged and facilitated the content very well ",
            "\u00a0This was a very strong course that was well organized and well thought out. ",
            "\u00a0This was the first time this course has been taught, but that did not affect how much I loved it. The material was consistently interesting, and I always found myself with something meaningful to say for the reaction papers. Class discussion was lively and engaging, and Professor Gendron made sure that everybody who had something to say was heard. Perhaps in later years, it could be gauged which topics are the most popular, and which should be replaced with something else. ",
            "\u00a0The readings are great. I think the in class discussions could be structured a bit better. Possibly by drawing more on individual reading responses and not just summarising the papers. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Gendron is a great conversation facilitator -- she always has keen insights and is responsive to all of the comments that my classmates and I made during the seminar. Discussion in the class often strayed away from the papers we read: this was often good, because I was able to learn from my classmates and appreciate the different insights they contributed to the discussion based on their varied backgrounds (academically and culturally), and we never really lost sight of the main points of the papers we read, even if our conversations did not stay strictly bound to them. \r\n\r\nBecause this was Professor Gendron's first time teaching this course, I think some adjustments were made in the middle of the semester that greatly helped the course improve. Toward the beginning, I felt that the seminar was more lecture-style, with Professor Gendron presenting a lot of material and doing the majority of the talking. I definitely appreciated this, because I loved to learn from her, but I think the seminar really came into its own when my classmates and I began to take up the discussion time. ",
            "\u00a0I only wish that more outside studies had been introduced in class. Sometimes, I felt like the discussions we were having in class didn't have much direction, because we were spending a lot of time discussing the results of studies and then drawing implications from them. These implications could be anything. I feel that if more time had been spent referencing new studies that we hadn't read for homework in an attempt to build a more comprehensive theoretical understanding, it would have felt more like a theoretical conversation, and I could have learned even more in the course. \r\n\r\nThat said, Prof. Gendron spent a lot of time and energy adapting and improving the course so that it the students' needs in terms of content and structure. The fact that I have this final critique should not detract from the fact that it was an awesome course to take all term. ",
            "\u00a0Really interesting readings and topics, although sometimes it felt like we discussed the papers in too much detail (I.e. were not expected to come to class with an understanding of the material). I would have appreciated more small group discussions and class discussions focused on implications and opinions. ",
            "\u00a0This is such a great course! One of the best I have ever taken. I loved the open, autonomous format of the class. The discussions were the best part. I learned as much from my classmates as I did from the professor! ",
            "\u00a0There really are no weaknesses that come to mind as this course is vivid, interesting and exuberant in its discussions, and the professor is extremely accessible and knowledgable. \r\n\r\nI appreciated the weekly responses to the readings, as they allowed one to write on any topic of choice and added richness for conversation during class. The professor is patient with questions- very clear in her explanations, and excellent at drawing parallels between real life and the material. ",
            "\u00a0The readings assigned were thought-provoking and the class discussions were very useful in processing the material we studied. I appreciated Prof. Gendron's interest in allocating a section of our time to discussing the real-world applications of the concepts we were discussing. The weekly reaction papers were a good way of interacting with the readings, and the final project was very rewarding. However, sometimes, poor in-class time management meant we didn't get around to discussing all of the assigned papers/the key points of everyone's reaction papers. \r\nI think the class could be improved by more firmly sticking to the time allocated to discuss each concept. Also, at the first stage of designing our individual projects, we had one class meeting where we only bounced ideas off of each other. While in theory, this could be very useful, I found that it was not, mainly because we were not yet clear on the guidelines for the project. I think that in the future, Prof. Gendron could create a more concrete list of questions to ask ourselves and our classmates so that we receive better peer feedback. "

            "\u00a0Yes 100% ",
            "\u00a0Yes to any interested in pursuing psychology or interested in learning about cultures. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend! I came into cognitive science wanting to examine how race, gender, sexuality, etc. affect the brain, and was disappointed that the curriculum had so little classes concerning this topic. However, this class gave me exactly what I wanted and more! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The readings are amazing and professor Gendron is very kind. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely -- even if you're not a psychology or cognitive science major, Professor Gendron really wants you to grasp the material. I learned quite a bit in this course (as a cogsci major) from the non-psych/non-cogsci majors in the class and the insights they offered. ",
            "\u00a0Just trust me. Take it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Really interesting course for those in cogsci, psych, or sociology. The readings are manageable and I found the assignments made me think critically about the material. ",
            "\u00a0YES! Everyone should take this course! The critical tools, exciting discussion, and interesting range of topics make this course a must-take for everyone, but especially cogsci/psych majors. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely - I left more knowledgeable about methods and issues in cultural psychology, but also a more nuanced understanding of what culture is and the ways it manifests itself in individuals' behavior and choices. "
