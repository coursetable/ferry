            "\u00a0I learned how to communicate about science that I'm performing. This was a really useful practical introduction to how to give presentations and speak about research; the sections where we learned about research techniques were a bit drier and less applicable to our own research. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about giving good scientific presentations and write proposals. Very useful course to take in your junior spring before your senior research project ",
            "\u00a0My public speaking skills were very rusty before this course, but we had three opportunities to present our work and it was really helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how a lab works, how to put together a biology research proposal, and how to be a better presenter (best thing ever!) ",
            "\u00a0Hierarchy of a research lab, how to keep a lab notebook, a lot of presentation skills (how to make a slideshow, how to improve public speaking, etc.); the information from a few research papers; some lectures on biotechnology (different types of genotyping, etc.) ",
            "\u00a0This class was most useful because it allowed us to work in our own biology labs with our PIs, doing real research that will inform our work this summer and nest semester, as opposed to just doing small relatively meaningless experiments in a classroom lab. This class helped us learn the important technology in molecular biology and also had a large emphasis on presenting science in writing and orally. It was useful to learn how to do these presentations, however I think that the first time that we did  a presentation with visuals the feedback was overly critical, given that we were given minimal guidance the first time. ",
            "\u00a0How to present and communicate scientifically ",
            "\u00a0How to speak. ",
            "\u00a0Through taking this course, I learned how to properly plan, design and present my scientific research. This course focused on providing us with an overview of common biological tools and processes for us to incorporate in our own work in the lab, which we subsequently presented and wrote about in research proposals throughout the course. Another major focus was on the public speaking and communication aspects of the presentation. I feel much more confident about my scientific and research abilities after taking this course. ",
            "\u00a0This class taught me what it is like to do research at a real lab and how to present my research and findings in an effective manner. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I think some of the lecture topics were not necessarily relevant to everyone, but overall the course was well organized and smoothly run. All the assignments related to research were helpful in pushing to get things done in my lab and pushing me to understand the whole picture of my research. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Breaks down things you never get taught and are expected to do such as write grants, be a contributing lab member, and give random presentations. Also loved getting to experience journal club\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the other information was only relevant for people doing that research. For example, the data science workshops were very dry. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The biggest thing I got from the course was how to give a good presentation. Professor Moreno does a great job giving advice and emphasizing the important things like how to make a good slideshow.  \r\nWeaknesses: The way the class is structured can feel very unorganized and disjointed at times. You will read a few research papers, learn some lectures on biotech: neither of these felt particularly relevant or helpful to our class. Especially when you are, for example, learning all the types of technology used to genotype. A lot of it does not feel applicable because it is not what you will have available in the lab. In addition, many of the students already have a lot of experience in their lab, so if you are new to research, you can feel very behind. Professor Moreno did try to remedy this during the final presentations, however, by emphasizing that we are all at different stages of experimentation. ",
            "\u00a0The best part of this course was that it allowed us to fulfill our MCDB lab requirement by working in our actual/independent research lab, which is much more useful and interesting than taking a lab class. I think that there should be more options available such as this that allow us to get credit for working in our own lab, as this is a very powerful educational opportunity and it can be difficult to work in an outside lab and fulfill major lab requirements. I thought that this class was useful in teaching us presentation skills and how to communicate our research. Dr. Moreno also very much cares about her students and making them useful in their labs. The absolute largest weakness of this class is that it was very stressful to be in it as a student because you never really knew the expectations of assignments, how they counted into your grade, or how your grade would be determined in the end. For example or lab notebook was going to be half of our grade and was never collected, some of our presentations we never got a grade back for, and some assignments were removed at the last minute. The expectations and timeline of assignments need to be MUCH clearer in the future. Also the lectures provide useful info but are not made to be very engaging, as the material is never tested. ",
            "\u00a0This course's strength was definitely in providing a place for students to receive critique and workshop presentations; I think to improve it, focusing more on these skills, which are more applicable across labs, and less on technical lectures would be a good move. I found a lot of the lectures on PCR and other assays fairly technical and not applicable to my own work; I think that perhaps meeting every other week and workshopping presentations would be a better use of time (and perhaps changing this to a half-credit course, or a full credit taking into account hte 8-10 hrs of research). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The course was very engaging with well-timed small assignments that led to the final presentational and proposal. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Though it turned out fine in the end, the course was not well planned in the beginning. Often, assignments and due dates were unclear. ",
            "\u00a0Very scary but also necessary ",
            "\u00a0A major strength of this class is its focus on bridging the gap between conducting research and communicating your results. Another strength is the team of professors -- Professor Moreno and Professor Nelson are both great teachers. A weakness was the lack of organization in the class -- some assignments did not have defined rubrics, so it was a shot in the dark unless you reached out to the professor for clarification. ",
            "\u00a0One main strength is that we are able to conduct research in a real lab, something unique to this lab course. The feedback we received and several presentations that we performed are also a big strength of the course. The lectures can be a bit boring at times but very informative. "

            "\u00a0If you enjoy working in a lab this is great/not to high workload course. Great preparation for MCDB senior research project ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend this highly for students preparing for the MCDB major thesis. This course set me up so well for a successful research experience. ",
            "\u00a0This is probably the least painful way to get a bio lab credit for those who need it, especially if you are already working in a lab. That said, it still isn't enjoyable. I found it tedious to sit through the 2 hour lectures and honestly don't feel like I learned that much. ",
            "\u00a0I probably would not recommend this course to another student. I think it might be more beneficial for a biology major to actually take a biology lab course and learn practical skills there. Although it is nice to be able to meet a lab and work during the school year, you often are unable to get much done due to the demands of your other courses. The lecture often feels disjointed, and it is hard to absorb the information from lectures that go over the science from a random article or  all the different ways to do genotyping. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you are looking to PRACTICE PUBLIC SPEAKING and get better at PRESENTING YOUR RESEARCH, this class would be very helpful. In my year, a lot of students already were working at their labs, so I think it was a better opportunity for them. Also, Professor Moreno is great and wants students to learn, so it is a nice class to learn from her. ",
            "\u00a0This course was VERY useful because it allowed you to get an MCDB lab credit for work that you are doing in your outside lab (which as an MCDB junior you are likely doing already). This is pretty unique and the class was also useful because it taught us presentation skills and also how to prep a science grant. The class was at times very disorganized and unclear in its expectations, but in the end was not too challenging. ",
            "\u00a0Don't take it ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take it if you're planning on doing senior research for MCDB. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student who is a Junior majoring in MCDB. This course is an excellent introduction to your Senior research project, and really starts you thinking about your project ahead of time. I think the skills that I learned in this class are very useful and practical, and I will use them again in the future as I continue my interactions with research and science. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to another student, especially if you are an MCDB junior looking for a lab to conduct your senior research in. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend this course to another student. I learned a lot of valuable skills in research, such as keeping a lab notebook and proper presentation skills. "
