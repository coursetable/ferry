            "\u00a0Strengths: The textbook\r\nWeakness: The instructor. Even though the course is an \"Introduction to Literary Chinese\" course, she required that everyone in class already knew Modern Chinese. As a result, everyone in the class were fluent modern Chinese speakers. This put someone like me, who had no background in Chinese, at a great disadvantage. She spoke modern Chinese to students in class. In her exams, she provided modern Chinese translations so that modern Chinese speakers can more easily understand Classical passages. Unsurprisingly, these modern Chinese speakers did better in exams. \r\n\r\nI had to take this course to satisfy my Departmental requirement (Religious Studies), and it is unfortunate that the so-called \"Introduction to Literary Chinese\" course was made to cater to those who already had modern Chinese background. \r\n\r\nWhen I asked the instructor to provide more English glosses for sight-reading passages in exams (since modern Chinese glosses were provided in full), she responded to me saying: \"It would be very difficult for me to teach the entire course geared towards you.\"\r\n\r\nHer attitude of favoritism in teaching this course did not represent anything resembling what Yale should offer.
