        [
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course are that it does not attempt to teach many topics, but goes deep and continues teaching a few important concepts, which is very helpful for retention of knowledge. Furthermore the professors are incredibly helpful and dedicated to their teaching.\r\nA major weakness is that some lectures are rather math-focused, without clearly connecting the ideas to the systems under investigation. A more continuously integrated approach, rather than having mostly-math and mostly-systems lectures would be more helpful in showing how the knowledge and skills should be applied. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to other students who have had some experience in biology and math (not having background in either would be hard), and are interested in learning quantitative approaches to systems they've mostly qualitatively studied. I found the approach of the course very eye-opening and exciting, and although it was frustrating and hard at times, I am very glad to have taken the course. "
