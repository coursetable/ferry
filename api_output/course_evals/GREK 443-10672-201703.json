He is a complete master of the Homeric poems, so studying with him is unlike studying with anyone elsesort of like studying with Harold Bloom or David Bromwich, in that everything is in his memory and every comment he makes, however small, is motivated by deep knowledge and experience.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of the course was primarily the room. Future courses *must* sit around a seminar table. The result was that this course did not feel like a seminar. Because there were smart people in the room, I wish I had heard more from my fellow students. "
