            "\u00a0Statistics methods and how to use stata ",
            "\u00a0The professor described it as about 2/3 of an intro Stats class and 2/3 of intro Econometrics, and that seemed about right. I feel pretty equipped to read a good bit of economic research. The class definitely leans practical rather than theoretical - probably good for everyday use in a variety of fields. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to interpret the significance, limitations, and assumptions behind a few statistical methods. I also gained skills in generating mathematical models of economic or social situations through the combination of theory and data. ",
            "\u00a0A whole new way to look at numbers and tables! ",
            "\u00a0This course helps me to consolidate my knowledge basement about statistics and basic econometrics. It's both informative and practical. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about statistics and econometrics as well as learned how to use Stata.  We also learned about the subjective challenges involved in statistics. "

        [
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this class. One of few weaknesses I can think of: the reading assignments seemed somewhat disjointed from the lectures/homework in the latter part of the class. Not a huge deal, and there are many other things to appreciate about the class (mainly the instructor). I also loved the structure of the material, starting with statistics and moving to regression from the ground up. ",
            "\u00a0Obvious strengths include the seminar-size of the summer course which allowed for plenty of questions and useful discussion during live sessions ",
            "\u00a0Group project is tough, especially since we couldn't meet with our team members in person. ",
            "\u00a0It's really remarkable for the abundant content and practical assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Well taught flipped classroom, really good professor, problem sets were manageable but long, "

            "\u00a0I do recommend if you're looking for a practically useful foundation in regression and stats. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Many decisions regarding government, business and individuals are--and more ought to be-- data-driven or data-facilitated in the modern age. As our capacity to process the vast amounts of data today increase, I think it's really important that everybody should have a good background in the mechanics of statistical methods and data analysis so that they can, at the least, become better-equipped citizens. The way this course is presented allows you to gain this foundation. After, taking it you might feel a little more confident in approaching in the complexity of the world. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I do not think I would have learned/gotten as much out of this course if I took the regular semester version. I had much more time to do the readings and interact with the lectures. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It really informative and practical. ",
            "\u00a0Good econometrics class, Professor McKee is a great professor.  You leave class with an understanding of statistics and the ability to critically understand these basics in statistical papers.  Take it if you need to learn econometrics ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the skills learnt in this class are crucial for any serious scientific study. "
