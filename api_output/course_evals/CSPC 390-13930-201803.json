            "\u00a0In this class I learned a lot about topics in business and finance, and how to report on them. We also learned basic principles/tips/tricks of journalism and business journalism especially. The best part of the course was the fantastic lineup of weekly guest speakers, who are all superstars in media and had fascinating stories and advice to share, and our field trips to New York. Beyond the substantive stuff, our class spent a lot of time together and got really close (facilitated by Professor Herman), and it was a pleasure to get to know my peers in and out of the classroom. This was by far one of the most fun classes I've taken at Yale, and the class in which I bonded the most with my classmates. That made learning and working together extra enjoyable and valuable. ",
            "\u00a0Some basics of journalism that you can probably get somewhere else ",
            "\u00a0The major role that news organizations play in politics and financial markets. ",
            "\u00a0This class was great. I learned how to write in for a different medium ",
            "\u00a0Learned about the journalism industry as well as about the ethical questions that journalists must ask themselves when performing their craft. ",
            "\u00a0This was a phenomenal seminar experience! I learned so much about journalism  as a business and an art  from Professor Herman and our many esteemed guests. Journalism is a fascinating, rapidly changing industry, filled with ethical dilemmas, which made for lively, engaging class discussion. I definitely improved my reporting and writing skills throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the basics of journalism. The course is not designed as a lecture, so do not expect lists and lists of what a journalistic article should look like. However, from the guest speakers and brief lessons from Herman, you will get a good sense of the industry. The guest speakers themselves are also really interesting and high profile. What you learn will depend on the guest speakers, but they always have interesting insights in the current state of journalism, business, etc. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about journalism and how important it is to have freedom of the press. This course taught me how to constantly ask questions, fact check, and always check sources with different views. I improved my writing in this course. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about the challenges and rewards of journalism in the era of changes. The topic of the seminar is especially relevant to current political and social events. Our trips to newsrooms and discussions with guest speakers also give us better ideas about what it takes to become great reporters. I also learn about the importance of fact-checking and holistic research in writing a good paper. ",
            "\u00a0ACCURACY, ACCURACY, ACCURACY! But honestly, I learned so much about journalistic practices from interviewing to researching to writing. Through this class, I learned how to ask pointed questions and how to use my research to inform my interviews. I also learned to take pages of research and hours of interviews and turn it into to a cohesive and coherent article that actually tells a story. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me invaluable information related to journalistic writing, including the importance of attention to detail, accuracy, thoroughness in reporting, time management, varying one's sources, and always having a back-up plan. I learned that journalism is extremely challenging, yet rewarding, and is unlike any other industry in the sense that it holds those in power accountable and seeks to illuminate societys shortcomings. In interviewing dozens of individuals, I learned how to effectively communicate with people from all walks of life, and how to assert myself in a respectful yet tenacious way. There were countless times when I went out of my comfort zone and was met with extremely fulfilling results. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Herman directly provides unique lessons to the class that I have never learned before. He teaches you not only what questions to ask when reporting on a story, but also brings in experts to talk about how to ask those questions. These experts are there with invaluable knowledge about working within industry and how decisions are made every single day. Some of the most interesting questions we considered surrounded when it was appropriate to not publish a story if there were potential ethical repercussions. We also discussed when it would be ethically sound to go undercover as a reporter  usually never. The most significant, direct lesson, however, was about research. Nearly every class we talked about accuracy, accuracy, accuracy. \r\n\r\nOne of the most valuable lessons this class taught to me, though, was the importance of dedication and commitment. Professor Herman was incredibly dedicated to each of his students and this made a significant difference in not only our work for that class, but also our ability to form relationships with other students.

            "\u00a0The material in the course is interesting, and the visitors are fabulous. I appreciated that we all got the chance to present on an article of our choice over the course of the semester, though it sometimes felt like the presentations cut in to our time with guest speakers, and perhaps we could have had one week with no visitors and all presentations. Similarly, it was nice that we alternated being scribes so that we didn't always feel pressure to take detailed notes, but it was unclear what exactly the notes were being handed in for. Class sometimes felt redundant week to week because it tended to cater to the visitors, who only attended one class a semester, and we talked a lot about the same topics (such as Carreyrou's Bad Blood). However, the material was interesting and every week felt new and exciting because we were hearing from such interesting people about their different experiences. The field trips, especially to the newsrooms, are fantastic, and spending time together in class and at weekly dinners was also a great way to have discussions and ask questions beyond what was on the syllabus. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The range of visitors and field trips; they are incredible\r\nWeaknesses: How we don't take advantage of them, and the assignments are completely unrelated to the visitors. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course was Herman, the speakers, the cool trips, and the people in the class. There were no weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0Not only is this a great class, it is also a matchmaking service. For the past 3 years, this course has successfully ended with 2/14 students in a relationship. When writing the profile essay, Herman will assign people others to profile, which has successfully started 3 relationships. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the fun trips you get to take to major news outlets in NYC (NYT, Buzzfeed, Bloomberg, etc.). Weaknesses are that the papers didn't really facilitate learning and the class is very business-oriented in the sense that we often repeated the same information about the financial crisis in 2007-2008. It would have been much more useful to write several short articles about something specific and focused as opposed to the papers we wrote talking about books that themselves talked about journalism. I think that journalism is learned through doing journalism, not by writing about it necessarily. ",
            "\u00a0More so than any introductory economics course I've taken, this class helped give me a broad understanding of the economy to the point where I can comfortably understand business news. We got to interact with an impressive roster of guests from the journalism world, and I appreciated the mixture of freedom and direction in each writing assignment. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very strong. Herman is amazing and the most passionate, involved instructor I have had at Yale thus far. The speakers and assignments were all very interesting in my opinion. My only suggestion is to have slightly more lesson time on writing and content so we have a good base with which to write our assignments. ",
            "\u00a0A strength would be the focus on writing. Because there is so much writing in this course, I think that I improved as a writer. Another major strength would be the opportunity to hear from various guest speakers and to learn about their careers and paths. ",
            "\u00a0The best class Ive taken. The course is a one of a kind experiencea mix of college teas with some of the top-notch journalists in the industry, field trips to the NYT, WSJ, Bloomberg, and Buzzfeeed, and a wealth of insight and guidance from Professor Herman, a veteran in the field. The class was the highlight of my semester. I grew not only as a writer, but as a researcher, interviewer, and thinker. I loved each and every assignment, and Professor Herman gives you the freedom and the resources to tailor the articles to your area of interest. He also provides thorough and thoughtful feedback for each and takes the time to appreciate the work youve done. He truly cares about his students and believes in them and their abilities. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course are countless - trips to famed institutions such as The New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, the New York Stock Exchange, and more, instruction from Professor Herman, an extremely accomplished and well-regarded individual in the industry, and guests ranging from Editor-in-Chiefs of major news organizations, to Jim Chanos, to Howard Dean. I learned a considerable amount about myself as a student and writer, and forged lasting relationships with classmates of diverse and rich backgrounds. I cannot think of any weaknesses! ",
            "\u00a0This was a wonderfully constructed course with experts in the field who came to speak with us each class. Professor Herman expertly engaged these visitors in order to get fascinating lessons from each of them. The dinners after class were long, but they were very useful when getting to know the visitors. And while there were five-time consuming assignments that required a heavy amount of research, it was the volume and feedback on these assignments that were so beneficial towards our learning experience. One area that could be improved, however, would be to spend less time going over what we were going to do for the day. I think it would be more beneficial to have a syllabus written out that we could read each day, rather than spending so much time at the beginning of class going over the tasks. "

            "\u00a0I would highly highly recommend this course to others, even students without backgrounds in business/finance or journalism. You learn so much in the class but more than that, you get to know Professor Herman and your classmates really well and have access to incredible opportunities over the course of the semester (like hearing from famous journalists, visiting places like the Fed and the New York Times, and getting to write assignments of your choice). Week to week the workload is not too heavy, but the assignments do require effort. However, because you have the support of Professor Herman and the option to choose what you write about, the assignments are enjoyable and I found myself motivated to put in the work to produce a good final product. It's also nice to have \"on\" and \"off\" weeks with presentations and note taking, because the class can take a lot of time if you want it to (with dinner, trips, etc.) and you won't want to say no to any opportunities. ",
            "\u00a0It's like a fun class, but you won't learn anything real out of it. The lessons about journalism that we get are pretty self-explanatory, and the professor doesn't make you do real journalism (honestly just a series of book reports). If you want to go visit the Wall Street Journal tho, go for it. I think this class fits those who are set to go into the path of journalism, except that we don't have that many at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course. It is incredible, and Herman does a really good job of creating a seminar community where everyone gets to know each other. The material was fascinating, and the speakers and nyc trips were unique opportunities. Be prepared to commit time to this course, but you will get so much out of it. ",
            "\u00a0YES! ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in journalism even slightly, this is a good class for you. The trips are unmatched and you get to meet very successfully individuals in the industry. Prof Herman is wonderful as well and will make the class very enjoyable by facilitating great dinners with journalists in which you can ask questions that you otherwise would never get to ask. I did feel, though, that the class often got repetitive. I recommend taking it Credit/D for the trips. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely  Professor Herman is highly knowledgable and engaging and makes a huge effort to get to know each of his students. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is definitely a must-take course at Yale. Expect to write a fair amount, but Herman is great, the field trips are a unique experience, and you will learn a lot about journalism. Even though I have no plans to enter journalism in any way, I found this class to be a great experience. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. This course was extremely interested and I loved the writing projects that we had. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to any student who is looking for a highly engaging learning experience and a chance to improve their writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0I cannot recommend this course enough. Taking this course was perhaps the best decision Ive made at Yale yet. I found a new passion, a great group of friends, and potentially a future profession. From field trips to NYT, to pizza at Pepes with Jim Chanos, to in-person interviews with veteran journalists, this class was a blast. I am really not sure what more to say besidesTAKE IT! ",
            "\u00a0Press, Business, and the Economy is the type of course that makes Yale the incredible institution that it is, and I can say that for only a few of the classes I have taken in my 7 semesters at Yale. The class was my first foray into business journalism, and I am now considering a future career in the field. Over the semester, we took 3 separate field trips to New York City, and were given tours of the Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, The New York Times, the New York Stock Exchange, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and Buzzfeed. At each of these locations, we met with award-winning writers, editors, researchers, and scholars. Most classes involved visits from individuals at the forefront of the field, including Paul Steiger (former Managing Editor at the Wall Street Journal, current CEO and President of ProPublica), Stephen Adler (Editor-in-Chief of Reuters), Jim Chanos (famously shorted Enron), Howard Dean (former Governor of Vermont and Democratic candidate in the 2004 presidential election), Joanne Lipman (distinguished author and former Editor-in-Chief of USA Today), Peter Lattman (Managing Director for Laurene Powell Jobs' organization Emerson Collective), Charles Forelle (Pulitzer Prize winner, Financial Editor at the Wall Street Journal), and more. Hearing from these individuals, and gaining insight into their lives, careers, and biggest mistakes was nothing short of inspiring. Between class field trips and weekly dinners following seminar, our class became very close, and by the end of the course, we felt very connected to each other and to Professor Herman. I feel very lucky to have been able to take this course, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is even slightly interested in journalism! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. This is one of the most meaningful classes that I have taken, as it has allowed me to engage with not only the class work, but also my peers and professor with the class. I learned how much I can learn from everyone in the class   something that, initially, should seem obvious. However, it is made clearer with our peer work and the discussions that we have in and out of class. Professor Herman is one of the most dedicated and intentional professors I have met. He is always readily available and ready to help. While he expects a lot out of his students, he also puts in the work that makes it worthwhile. "
