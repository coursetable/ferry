            "\u00a0It seemed like a good intermediate level micro course. Developed micro more fully with calc. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths - The material is extremely interesting and the case-study method is fantastic\r\nWeaknesses - The split semester between Jim and Zac can be challenging - very different teaching styles with some lack of continuity ",
            "\u00a0Engaging teachers and themes. More practice problems/examples and less long classroom discussion that were at times sidetracked from economics. ",
            "\u00a0Already written for Jackson review ",
            "\u00a0It seemed inconsistent throughout the course whether students should be focused on learning concepts or on being able to do specific math problems, which made it difficult to know how to approach studying. \r\n\r\nIn Zach's lectures, he often seemed unsure of the material or seemed somewhat unprepared. ",
            "\u00a0The concepts are broken down really well. The course could be improved by solving more practice problems in class. ",
            "\u00a0I would have liked less of the basic concepts covered and a couple extra class periods delving into other intermediate concepts. However, since there were people without any econ background I understand why the early pace was there. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I liked how the course sampled from across different aspects of micro.\r\n\r\nWeakness/areas to improve: I personally learn best through math. I found tracking concept --> math very hard, as opposed to the other way around (math-->concept). A more integrated approach that spelled out the math and then connected it to concepts would have helped me greatly. I recognize, however, that not everyone learns this way. It's tough, because this is a class that will always polarize the students depending on how it's taught.\r\n\r\nI also think that a different set of assumptions would help - while some students in the class are policy focused, I expect that all of us (or almost all of us) see the distinct value of economics in policy and everything else. I'm personally not policy-focused, and came to Jackson because I did want to study more economics. I chose Jackson because it gave me the freedom to do so, with all the other great benefits of the degree/Yale. Rethinking the assumption that we as Jackson students aren't interested in econ would help. I wanted to go into the subject more and was very keen to learn, and felt demotivated when I felt the class was being taught with the assumption that I was forced to be there and not interested. ",
            "\u00a0The first part was great. The second part lacked structure. Furthermore, the instructor, as well as the other students, did not stay on the topic of discussion. I felt that the deviation from the classroom topics detracted from our learning experience. "

            "\u00a0No. ",
            "\u00a0No, I would not recommend this course. While the topic was interesting, and I learned some essential skills, the learning process was unnecessarily burdensome due to poor course design/execution. The problem sets were only of minimum value, particularly in the first half of the term, as they were hard to map onto the course notes and impossible to map onto our textbook (the textbook was terrible and did not add value to the course). A lot of the course material I self-taught by reviewing the instructors' notes and watching YouTube videos. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would because it helps you understand how to apply economics concepts to problem solving. ",
