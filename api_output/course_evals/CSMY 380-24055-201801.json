            "\u00a0I feel that this course was one of the most insightful learning experiences regarding foreign policy as it considered a perspective which many classes do not. The role of the military in diplomacy is more important than ever, and Professor Eidemiller was incredibly knowledgeable about the diplomatic endeavours in the Middle East and about the disconnect between soldiers on the ground, and those in DC. ",
            "\u00a0As a future Marine Officer who had attended Marine Officer Candidate School the year prior, I had already been introduced to the world of the military and had undergone some basic training. When I heard about a course at Yale taught by an ex-Special Forces operator, I was excited to learn more about how my military training might be leveraged for more effect both in a civilian and military capacity. This course did that and more. It gave me insights into the relationship that the tactical level commander has at a strategic level, and how one effects the other. It also provided context for the role of the military in the modern age, giving insights into international security considerations as well. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how the military works.  Typically, classes teach you about the military on a broad scale - grand strategy and mass geopolitics - but this class focuses much more on the tactical and operational level. This is crucial to gaining a more holistic understanding of the military, how it is used, and the problems that arise within it. ",
            "\u00a0This course is about the way the modern military operates, especially in conjunction with the State Department. It's U.S. Army-focused and progresses from the first stages of an officer's career to the end (the papers and assignments reflect this progression). ",
            "\u00a0Amazing course. Learned a lot about the tactical military environment and how that influences policy decisions at a higher level. Enjoyed it a lot because we learned about unique examples in depth, which made it different than any other political science class Ive taken. Professor is great and very available to students. ",
            "\u00a0Much more familiarity with the specifics of military strategy, operations and tactics. While I had always been passionate about these subjects, this seminar showed to me both how much I really did not know, and offered me a fantastic insight into the details I had not considered before. Furthermore the uniqueness of the essay prompts and more broadly the challenges considered each class promoted me to tackle these issues in ways I had not considered previously and explore new texts to better substantiate my arguments. ",
            "\u00a0I greatly enhanced my knowledge on the U.S. military and the way it interacts with the government and the public. I also learned more about the different ways the U.S. military is present abroad and the diplomatic aspect of the military. Additionally, we talked a lot of about the way soldiers are selected and trained for various positions and how this has evolved due to the new environments in which war is conducted and the new methods employed by enemy troops. ",
            "\u00a0The class was incredible. We studied in-depth how the military is structured and how the U.S. military interacts overseas. It helps any student interested in Global Affairs or the U.S. military, in general, have a practical understanding of the role of the military domestically and abroad. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a fantastic overview of contemporary military operations and difficulties in warfighting in our modern era, especially from the perspective of the soldiers and marines on the ground in conflict areas. The focus of the class on the evolving role of soldiers as peace keepers and state builders was fascinating and helpful both for future military members and civilians alike. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a much greater insight into the unique challenges faced by soldiers on the modern battlefield as well as the skillset needed to meet those challenges.  I think that the Captain Eidemiller provided a fascinating and insightful viewpoint that I have not yet encountered here at Yale.  It was great to see a course that both helped bridge the civil-military divide and provided useful lessons regardless of what your future career path may be. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a better understanding of the purpose of the Army and SOF in the context of modern warfare. I'll be honest, I really didn't grasp what exactly the Army was contributing before this course. I learned much more about the tactical side of warfare and how the tactical side interacts with operational and strategic levels. I gained insight into what a \"soldier-diplomat\" really means and a bit more knowledge about how special ops interacts with embassies abroad. This course sparked an interest in SOF that I'm still pursuing. "

            "\u00a0Class was organised incredibly well, every session was planned down to the minute and so was always informative and engaging - this is rare for a class. It would have been useful if the readings were brought into the Yale bookstore at the beginning of the semester, and would have been better if the class earn a WR credit. I feel like perhaps that the role of research in the papers was not always clear - the Extra Credit Memorandum was the most realistic assignment that we had, and while the other papers were very interesting it was often hard to find stuff in the readings that seemed directly relevant; instead perhaps short 200-word reviews of readings each week would serve well, in exchange for shorter papers based more on ideas than on research - like the Extra Credit Memorandum. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course was the structure that built from understanding the basics of the military to more complex and high level understandings, and its use of guest speakers and the instructors own experience to make it a real world and timely class. It could be improved by expanding the scope to include an analysis of other avenues by which issues around the world might be resolved (using more than just military force) ",
            "\u00a0The class does a great job teaching about the workings of the military from the inside.  It is less about the civilian aspects and more about how it actually works. The professor is extraordinarily helpful, the seminars are interesting, and through either video chat or in person, a series of guest speakers come, all of whom provide great insight. \r\n\r\nIt could be improved by focusing a bit more on the diplomat aspect of the course, as opposed to the soldier. ",
            "\u00a0I think an acronym guide could be included for the students without military backgrounds, a lot of them had trouble understanding what was going on because of all the abbreviations. The assignments and readings were very creative and different from what you would usually find in a Yale course; additionally, I liked the group projects that we did. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the course material and Professor ",
            "\u00a0A strength was the connectedness of the instructor to the class, I always felt as if my feedback was being listened to and incorporated while the instructor was consistently offering new ways to deepen our understanding within and outside of the class through mentors, extra credit opportunities or other events. One area I would suggest for improvement would be providing the Yale Bookstore with a list of required texts before the beginning of the semester so that students could procure all of their readings at once and without having to worry about delays in shipping or inaccessibility online. ",
            "\u00a0This was a wonderful class that managed to incorporate a lot of readings and materials with engaging discussions and interactive segments with guest speakers. I think Prof. Eidemiller did a fantastic job at continuously improving the class as the semester progressed. One of the courses greatest strenghts was the fact that the essay prompts were never quite the same and challenged us to think outside of convential essays we might have written. The scenerios we were presented were real and seeing how you approached it versus how it was done in real life was really enlightening. ",
            "\u00a0The course was overall very strong. I preferred when it was not driven by structured questions which allowed dialogue to flow more freely. I think the class would overall benefit from a stronger emphasis on the diplomat side of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n1) Weekly expectation emails: These were really a highlight to the course. Of course, I could've kept track of all of the assignments etc on my own, but receiving the weekly emails were a nice reminder of where we were and where we were going. They also had several great resources that I can refer back to even now\r\n2) Overall structure: With a course this ambitious, structure is crucial. The framework that Mr. Eidemiller provided for each class was usually really helpful in making sure I could sort the information I was receiving and ensuring that as a class we made it through the questions that we wanted to discuss. He organized student and instructor discussion questions, sent out weekly expectation emails, and had a clear intention for the purpose of each class. \r\n3) Essay topics: These were case studies for the most part and I found them really interesting, especially the one asking us to detail how I would address problems facing a unit that I had recently taken command of. It's the first class where I was asked to work through case studies and I really enjoyed it.\r\n4) Teaching style of the instructor: I'll go into this more in the other box, but Mr. Eidemiller's teaching style, adaptability, and enthusiasm were a huge plus for this course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n1) Emphasis on strategic and operational levels: Most of the information about strategic and operational level warfare came from the readings. This was fine, except Mr. Eidemiller didn't have much background knowledge to answer questions that weren't addressed in the readings. He was an expert on the tactical side and often fleshed out the readings with his personal knowledge and experiences. It would have improved the course to hear the same background knowledge and details about operational and strategic levels. I think this could be addressed by bringing in a speaker from the strategic level and lining up the operational speaker with the lessons that emphasized the operational level.\r\n2) Time: I'm not sure if it's possible to rework the time allotted to this course, but I would've really liked some more time to discuss each of the questions brought up in class. I frequently felt like there wasn't enough time to fully explore the topic of the day. \r\n3) Breadth: This speaks a bit to the time concern I suppose, but there were times where I felt like we were rushing through really meaty topics that we could've spent a lot more time on. Maybe the best way to address this concern would be to advertise this course as a sort of introductory overview of the soldier diplomat and the conventional/special ops side of the military and then have further courses designed to spend more time just discussing the details.

            "\u00a0This was the best class I have ever taken. If you have the opportunity to take this class do not pass it up. Prof. Eidemiller is incredible and his insight and experience is one of a kind. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Eidemiller goes so far out of his way for this course, and it is very inspiring. Grading strikes me as fair if you follow his instructions! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, even if this person was not interested in the military. This course gives the student a grounded perspective of what the US is doing around the world, and is essential for any American student/citizen who wants to be made aware of what their country is doing and how. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course to another student.  The course material is unique in its perspective of the military as more than just an extension of politics. It deals with geopolitics, but also with tactical and strategic considerations on the ground of an operation. The professor is fantastic, and  is extraordinarily helpful to all students - willing to talk on the phone about the essays, or to get coffee to discuss aspects of the class. He is very engaged and organized. Furthermore, there are a lot of ROTC kids in the class. As someone who does not foresee myself working in the military, this provided a lot of unique and interesting insights. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course, but only if you're really interested in this specific subject area. The readings and discussion were different from those in most Yale courses and provided a new perspective from your standard Global Affairs or Political Science course that deals with the same subject matter. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, would definitely recommend. Great Professor and very interesting course material that you wont find anywhere else at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I recommend this class to both those who may be well-versed already in military theory and practice as well as those who lack a general understanding but are interested in this subject in some capacity. Given the incredible expense, human and material, that is associated with military operations, it is vital to understand the specifics which go into these actions, to recognize both where efficiencies are and where grave errors occur. This class manages to provide a broad overview of important themes while still diving deep where necessary and, in my opinion, deals with such a unique subject that it is overall an interesting an challenging seminar to take. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. As someone who came into the course with little to no knowledge on the material, I felt that the information was presented clearly and in a way that really encouraged learning. I gained a lot of knowledge on the military, but more importantly I gained insight on the sort of questions and considerations I should keep in mind when addressing issues relating to the military. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This was a great class. Professor Eidemiller was engaging, open to feedback and generally a pleasure to engage with. He used his personal experience to make the class a unique experience and give you a real sense of how the U.S. military operates. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely recommend this course, both to people who are interested in joining the military, interested in working in the public sector, or anyone else who has any interest in studying conflict today. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course.  Regardless of what your future career might be, there are so many interesting and useful lessons to be drawn from this class, and Captain Eidemiller provides insights and anecdotes that you're unlikely to find anywhere else.  The reading list is fantastic and never seemed like a pain or burden.  While many Yale courses are caught up in the theoretical, this class really forces students to think realistically and understand the real world constraints that the military and soldiers face. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I took away so much from this course. I was interested enough in some of the readings to actually finish the book in my free time. The instructor is incredible, the essays engaging, and the topics relevant. If you aren't affiliated or associated with the military in any way, this course is a great introduction into military culture, language, and mindset. Bridging the gap between civilians and the military is critical and this course is one way that you can do that for yourself. If you are associated with the military, this course delves into topics that will enable you to better understand the Army and special ops. It's an opportunity for you to explore topics, information, and questions that will be relevant to your training now and your career in the future. I really enjoyed the work from this course and found the assignments reasonable. Highly recommend. "
