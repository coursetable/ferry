            "\u00a0The course was valiant in its effort to cover a huge swathe of material. By the end, I learned the essence of the topics covered and could (but would  need to) look them up and learn more about them to use them if I needed to.\r\n\r\nMy main issue with the class was that the lectures felt chaotic at times. Victor lectured from memory, which is very impressive, but sometimes it led to errors on the board that meant a derivation ended up confusing more than instructing the class. It was unfortunate that the textbook for the course was more of a novel. That said, Victor had made lecture notes, which were really useful to review outside of class. However, to feel comfortable with the content in the notes took months upon months of engaged reading (hours a day).\r\n\r\nVictor was always very friendly and accommodating, and he made himself as available as he could outside of class. ",
            "\u00a0main strength: very interesting, engaging presentation of material, with unexpected insights\r\nmain weaknesses: irregular homework assignments and un-transparent grading of exams (not clear why exactly x number of points taken off for a mistake, not x-1 or x+1 etc) ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the assignments that involved coding our own simulations. I think the course could include more organized problem sets. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were the establishment of the fundamentals of statistical mechanics and numerous examples of how the theory could be applied to meaningful problems. The course could be improved by providing more grading throughout the semester. Since not many grades were received, it was difficult to know how I was performing. ",
            "\u00a0A major strength of this course were the class notes that doubled as a text book of sorts that condensed stat mech into its most important aspects. Everything we learned was important and helped to understand more complex topics. Having additional information be supplementary helped students tailor course to their needs. "
