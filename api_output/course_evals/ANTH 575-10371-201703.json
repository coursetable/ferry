The course also enables students to be able to critically review the process of globalization that are framed in lineal, Eurocentric rhetorics. From such perspective, the readings of the course includes a wide range of issues from land to sea to in-betweens, from Asia to Middle East, from the making and unmaking of places to the junctures and disjunctures of histories. \r\n\r\nAnother important take away I gained from this course is historical and anthropological sensitivity. Although I won't say I am fully historically and anthropologically sensitive after taking the course (a process I believe requires years of ethnographic and historical field work experiences), but I am definitely more aware that seemingly unfit cultural and social products usually underly amazing historical stories that might contribute to fill in the puzzles of the past. Especially when I am writing my research proposal, I realized that a lot of issues I attempt to look into are phenomenons that I have known for a long time but never bothered to question it. ",

            "\u00a0I thought the course was great. It would have been nice to have a little bit more discussion of the general anthropological frames in the beginning of the class, but that also would have cut into the more directed discussions and readings ",
            "\u00a0More non-Asia material ",
            "\u00a0Strength: amazing lectures and interesting readings. In class discussions are also really helpful. I find the literature review to be very helpful in gaining a more structural understanding of the articles and to learn effective ways to read different articles.\r\n\r\nWeakness: the mid-term presentation clashes with the weekly lecture on readings. Since the discussions on presentations are rather interesting, I would rather have spent more time on it. "
