            "\u00a0Functional Analysis. Banach and Hilbert Spaces, main results on functional analysis (open mapping, closed graph, principle of uniform boundedness), spectral theory. Proof-based class. Better understanding of analysis and how to do proofs, better appreciation of where analysis is useful for other applications (i.e., PDE's, Probability Theory, Ergodic Theory, Spectral...). It was a great sequel to measure theory, and a great introduction to infinite dimensional spaces. ",

            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the class. The lectures were great and clear, time flew by in class. The proofs and the results were very interesting. However, I feel that the first homework sets were not entirely related to the course, we had some applications on PDE's and complex analysis, which was not a requirement for the course. I wish we had a more systematic problem set, weekly, instead of a long biweekly homework. And the textbook that was recommended for the class was extremely hard to read and follow, I wish there was a better textbook for reference. I borrowed 5 other books at the library, that were more helpful, but it was hard to read them all in great details, and none of them entirely followed the class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the lectures are very clear. \r\n\r\nI thought the exams were very well written. I often left the exams having learned something. ",
            "\u00a0Material is super interesting and some of the homework problems are pretty fun! I think the course is a little too fast-paced however, and we cover so much information without stopping to catch our breath. On the one hand, I learned so much, on the other hand, I had to spend a lot of time outside of class going over what we had covered. This may just be the nature of the course, however, whose material is very conceptually difficult. \r\n\r\nAlso, Jeremy sometimes skips parts of proofs and/or leaves them as exercises, and it can take some time to fill in all the holes outside of class. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were great in explaining the main results and the whole direction of the course. Also, the problem sets were very helpful in understanding the topics covered in class, and challenging in the extensions of those topics. "

            "\u00a0I wouldn't recommend this course to non-math major students. This is a challenging course, requires some way of thinking and doing proofs, be challenged and solve problems. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend it. It made linear algebra significantly easier to understand. It completely changed all ideas I have about distance, norms, convergence, etc. It also gave me some insights into approximation theory which I found very useful. ",
            "\u00a0I would totally recommend this course. Functional analysis is very cool! But be warned, it is an advanced and conceptually difficult analysis course and although not necessary, it is definitely better to have taken measure theory and complex analysis first to fully appreciate some of its applications. \r\n\r\nAlso, never before in a course have I started writing proofs only to realize that they were wrong or that I was missing something so much. I think this speaks to how tricky this class is, and things that seem obvious and trivial are not as simple as they appear. Nevertheless, this is a very rewarding class! ",
