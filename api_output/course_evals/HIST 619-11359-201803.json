            "\u00a0This course gave me the necessary background in early modern England which I had been lacking because other classes I have taken have focused on deep dives into specific topics. The introduction to historical conversations was very helpful.\r\n\r\nWrightson does a good job of helping his students see when they need to reach into the historiography and when they have to stop and just get things done. ",
            "\u00a0A very comprehensive look into all aspects of Early Modern Britain as well as the ability to community ideas one-on-one and in small groups. ",
            "\u00a0I received a well-rounded overview of the social and cultural aspects of life in early modern Britain. ",
            "\u00a0useful for expanding my knowledge base of specific relevant subject matter, excellent writing experience and feedback ",
            "\u00a0Familiarity with some of the excellent works of social history produced for early modern England. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a wide range of approaches to the study of early modern England; methods in social and cultural history. "

        [
            "\u00a0Strengths - the course let's students focus on the things they are interested in and allows wrightson to do gentle guidence instead of incentivising students not to take the class. Also, the conversation was always very lively and linked things not normally linked in early modern history.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - maybe it is just how the class is structured, but I felt like there were many days when we made recourse to anthropological work just because none of us had read extensively on the same topic. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is that it is small. You have a lot of contact time with the professor and other students. As always, seminars can be improved by more ardent participation, but Professor Wrightson is always capable of filling in any gaps in the conversation, so structurally the course is sound. ",
            "\u00a0great format, really helpful to do four papers spread out and building up\r\n\r\nno weaknesses that I can think of, it was the course I was looking for! ",
            "\u00a0I think Professor Wrightson embodies a broad-minded and thoughtful approach to history, based on a personal encyclopedia of interesting anecdotes. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: lots of variety in the readings, great feedback on papers "

            "\u00a0Absolutely. This class is incredubly mobile  in what it teaches because of wrightsons incredible nimbleness with the material. Wrightson is very welcoming to all sorts of thoughts and office hours with him are invigorating ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in Britain, getting to spend time with Professor Wrightson is the best choice you could make. Honestly, he's hilarious and really fun to talk with, so I would recommend the course even if you're only tangentially related in Britain. Professor Wrightson is the best reason to take the course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0yes! Professor Wrightson is super insightful, and really helps students hone their writing skills. \r\n\r\nthe readings are in my field, so I really enjoyed them. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, even if their specialist field was very different such as my own. I think many of the works we read are models of how to do excellent historical research. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend this course for the interesting range of readings and getting to hear Prof. Wrightson's perspectives in class. You have a lot of flexibility in choosing what you want to read and Prof. Wrightson is very available for consultation and advice. "
