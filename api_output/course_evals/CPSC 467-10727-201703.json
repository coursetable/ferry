            "\u00a0I learned more about cryptography and how computer security works. The process of encoding a message, encrypting it into a ciphertext, decrypting the ciphertext, and decoding it. I learned a lot about different security protocols and how to analyze a protocol and find loopholes as well as all the different sophisticated algorithms that rely on number theory that have been used to secure our computers and networks.

I think there were large parts of the course that I engaged in only by reading the slides/textbook, and found that without any problems \r\nchallenging me to work with these parts, I was a little ill-equipped to think about them during exam time. \r\n\r\nThen again, if I really had wanted to, I could have searched for relevant problems in the text. Maybe future students could benefit from a list of problems in the textbooks they could use to practice reasoning about certain topics further, even if these aren't required as extra homework. ",

            "\u00a0Lecture was very dull and he called people out if they weren't paying attention on their laptops. However, it felt necessary to come to class because there was a sign in sheet. The assignments were easy. If it was coding assignment which only 3 were 90% of the difficulty was just remembering how to code in C or C++. The exams were fair I guess. ",

            "\u00a0The main weakness that I could think of and that affected my understanding throughout the semester is the lectures. I really enjoyed the material it was very interesting but the lectures were very boring. It was incredibly hard for me to follow what the professor is saying and I had to study some of the material by myself. This course has also needed some basic understanding of C++ but that was not stated as a course requirement. It would have saved a lot of time if I had known some C++.\r\nThe homework was very clear however, and I really enjoyed solving the homework questions and studying for the tests. ",

Professor Fischer does a great job of making sure we see the big picture of things...what the GOAL of all the number theory protocols are in terms of who has access to what kinds of information....before we actually learn what computations are happening. I recommend you put way more time into the course than the homework requires in order to leave the course an expert (and to get a much better grade on the exams than I got, I'll bet) ",
