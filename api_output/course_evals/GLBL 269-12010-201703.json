            "\u00a0I learned to look at conflicts from many different angles and to consider the research on how conflicts unfold. ",
            "\u00a0A much more nuanced, analytically rigorous understanding of civil war and other forms of intrastate violence. The weekly memos proved to be my favorite assignment this semester because they were a good way of focusing interesting research to create a concrete final product. The films we watched really improved my understanding of violence even though I often felt as if watching them took too long. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to analyze and organize civil conflicts into their fundamental components and theories. I learned how to write memos on specific aspects of a conflict and synthesize my ideas into a large final research paper. ",
            "\u00a0Kalyvas is an awesome scholar. His insight will be missed. Also, this course was entertaining. ",
            "\u00a0An excellent and thorough analysis of the many dynamics of civil war theory.  I developed a very strong and comprehensive understanding of my particular case-study as well as a great overview of conflict and civil wars in general - their relationships to poverty, colonialism, natural resources, geographic location, government institutions, etc. ",

            "\u00a0I saw no weaknesses to this class, I thought it was great! ",
            "\u00a0The major weakness was that there was no thesis or lecture goal. I really don't fee like I received strong insight into the scholarly work behind conflict. I didn't learn anything that I couldn't have learned by reading the news. ",
            "\u00a0Great workload (lots of self-directed research), frequent and detailed feedback, interesting subject material, improved my understanding of violence (which is really complex and hard to understand better), interesting/edifying films, and Professor Kalyvas is extremely smart and fascinating (if you've read his work for other classes, it's exciting when it pops up in this one). \r\n\r\nThe class is sort of nebulous but I think this is a product of the nature of civil war and not of how the class was taught / structured. ",
            "\u00a0The structure of the class to focus on one civil conflict throughout the semester is wonderful. It is by far its major strength, though some might disagree. I think this class would work greatly as a seminar, but Prof. Kalyvas did a good job of keeping us involved even in a small lecture. I wish we had more to do with our conflict than write memos, but I really appreciated getting so deeply familar with one war. It helped me realize that even after a semester of study, there is still so much to know about one single war. And thus I am now more aware of my ignorance and the ignorance of those who say they fully understand war. This course encouraged me to look beyond conventional narratives. ",
            "\u00a0The TA was absolutely atrocious. Other than that the course was great. ",
            "\u00a0Wonderful course in all regards; would appreciate greater feedback on the memos, particularly form Professor Kalyvas directly.  In that same vein, I wish this could count as a Writing credit, as this is the most I have ever had to write for a single class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include how interdisciplinary the course was, its centrality around film, and the professor. Weaknesses include how overly ambitious it was in what it attempted to cover. "

            "\u00a0Definitely! I feel like I learned a lot, improved my writing and research skills, and really enjoyed the class and films. Also, Professor Kalyvas is a legend. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! ",
            "\u00a0This is a really interesting, insightful course on civil war and the role of violence in such conflicts. Prof. Kalyvas is an absolute genius -- probably the most brilliant professor I've had at Yale thus far. He is an expert in civil war studies and it shows with every lecture. His slides are dense with information and he does a great job of explaining even the most abstract concepts. The main flaw/strength of this course is the coursework: you write weekly memos on ONE civil war throughout the entire semester, culminating in a final paper. The main pro of this approach is that you get to understand the aspects of civil war deeply and personally. By getting so invested into one conflict, you can repeat your approach after the course to look into others. Still though, the work can get dry if you don't like your conflict. We watch movies every week and break down their political dynamics -- which is also interesting but sometimes a chore. He does a current event analysis most classes that is incredibly insightful, but it often takes a huge chunk out of lecture time. ",
            "\u00a0Only if the Prof. is knowledgeable in the subject and there is a different TA. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely beneficial to gain a greater world view and understanding of the dynamics of conflict, if those interest you. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!  You will learn a lot about civil war in the context of one conflict as Kalyvas promised. "
