            "\u00a0I got to understand the limitations of a race-blind approach, and learned about different themes of Critical Race Theory, including intersectionality, racial realism, and strategic racism. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to be aware and critical of the operation of race in my daily life, as opposed to the \"racism without racists\" structural understanding of race that I had previously felt relatively comfortable thinking about. I became familiar with the tenets and history of the field of Critical Race Theory, which directly will influence how I choose to move through public and nonprofit sectors in my life after Yale. ",
            "\u00a0A comprehensive understanding of critical race theory and the skills to think very critically and challenge concepts. I also learned a lot about storytelling and performance. ",
            "\u00a0By far the greatest class I have ever taken at Yale. We talked about race with people from various backgrounds in an effective way. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Feimster introduced the key concepts of Critical Race Theory and allowed us to explore them in the context of our own lives and current political context. The title may sound like this is a general/intro course about race, but I learned that critical race theory is a field that was named and focused on in 90's Black law, but with roots in Black literature and civil rights discourse, that can apply in different contexts to other groups of people of color. This class also highlights the importance of performance within race, and allowed students to perform race themselves. ",
            "\u00a0An amazing foundation in Critical Race theory, a legal theory that focuses on the permanence of racism and its construction both socially and legally. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a much greater understanding of the concepts of Critical Race Theory through the course.  Using a variety of different mediums, I was able to work on developing a critical race theory lens through which I could read and interpret situations.  We practiced on using this lens not only through traditional academic work, but in literature, television, performance and personal experience.  I found this development of a critical race theory lens to be important not only in my academic life, but in wider experience as well, which is why I would recommend the course! ",
            "\u00a0I developed a much better ability to handle theoretical texts in an intellectual manner while also thinking about ways to apply them to the real world. I also found that my writing improved a great deal and I had a much stronger foundational knowledge on the themes of Critical Race Theory which will be probably continue to be a basis for much of my future work. ",
            "\u00a0In Critical Race Theory we learned both the ideas of critical race theory, how we may apply them to our lives today, and in general how to have conversations with each other and further understanding about race and inequality and systems (for us this term in the end it was through performance, which was surprisingly effective and very enjoyable). "

            "\u00a0The discussions and readings were great, and our professors helped us understand these concepts well. I do wish we acknowledged critics of these topics (and their validity) a little more, especially since there are notable scholars that disagree. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that the assignments were creative and forced us to think hard, operating at a perfect distance outside of our comfort zone. The pacing and quantity of the readings was very good, and the variety of media made it very interesting. Sometimes more clarity on projects (ideally a digitally-accessible \"assignment\" file that clearly outlays expectations) would have been helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this course! I think it was one of the most supportive and close-knit seminars I have ever been with-- I felt like Professor Feimster had a lot of trust in faith in us and really cared about us. Everyone really contributed to discussion and the space was very welcoming. I learned so much. The only improvement I would suggest would be slightly clearer guidelines and feedback. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- the syllabus, Prof. Feimster, the group projects, the topic \r\nno weaknesses ",
            "\u00a0A major strength of this course is that, because of the admissions process, discussions about race are with people who are invested and didn't just start thinking about race and power for the purposes of this class; we were able to get into deeper discussion about race than I have in a lot of my other classes, even as an ER&M major. We ended up cancelling a couple class screenings that I was looking forward to (Get Out and The Life and Death of Marsha P. Johnson), so I think adding those would have been helpful for having more media material to discuss and for class bonding, which was a really important thing for a class that people spoke candidly and personally in. ",
            "\u00a0The TA fit awkwardly into the course, but the rest of the course was fantastic. ",
            "\u00a0This was a very strong course in introducing the concepts of critical race theory.  Professors Feimster and Vermeulen did a good job of providing a welcoming and engaging environment, using various mediums.  They were always open and welcoming professors, who gave very helpful advice and feedback.  The reading load was never too heavy, with work manageable week by week, with engaging class activities, including performances.  Overall, one of the best courses within the African American Studies department, with the wonderful Professor Feimster! ",
            "\u00a0There is a decent amount of reading, and I got a lot out of the discussions we had at the beginning, but I really enjoyed the group presentations-- both putting one together and being able to see everyone else's. I also appreciated the mixed media of the material we were assigned-- it both varied the workload but also was a reminder of how critical race theory can be applied to many different aspects of our lives. The only thing I'd recommend, perhaps, is more time to reflect on the final performances as a group. "

            "\u00a0This is a great class that helped me understand the limitations of a race-blind approach, and learn about different themes of Critical Race Theory, including intersectionality, racial realism, and strategic racism. Our professors make the class interesting with videos and creative assignments, which makes the experience a very enjoyable one. ",
            "\u00a0I think that any student could greatly benefit from taking a course like this one, that forces meaningful reflection and introduces students to a praxis-oriented body of theory. In its current format, it is clearly an upper-level AFAM class that would only be most accessible to those already somewhat used to thinking about race in America, which practically limits the number of other students I would push to take the class. ",
            "\u00a0YES! Take this course if you get in, it is so wonderful! ",
            "\u00a0Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes ",
            "\u00a0YES! if you get in, TAKE IT! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to other students who have already taken some classes about race and are comfortable talking about it within the context of their own lives and in the current political moment. This is not a race 101 course, or a course where discussions of power and privilege can be stripped of their political urgency. For students who are interested and already invested, Critical Race Theory is personally and academically enriching, and makes you re-think a lot of your preconceptions about race in the 21st century. ",
            "\u00a0Yes anyone who would like a better knowledge of how American racism functions should take this class! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student, without question.  I think the ability to see and think about race critically is a skill that everyone in America can use in the racialized society of the United States.  As such, learning what critical race theory is, its concepts, and how to apply it to viewing the world is incredibly important.  As such, I would recommend this course to all students, but particularly to those students who already have and see the world through a racial lens and are interested in exploring issues related to how race functions in society. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I think that especially in the current world we live in, having a firm grasp of these concepts and issues is essential to understanding much of why the world and society are the way they are, ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student! I learned an incredible amount about critical race theory, realities of racism in our country, and how we can bring these topics into our work as artists, students, and society members. It was a bit of a perspective change and reorientation of self as we progressed through the material, but a welcome one. The classroom environment also felt very welcoming and patient and understanding, which Dr. Feimster purposefully established from the start. The assigned material mixes a lot of different mediums and is really engaging and intriguing. The final assignment/performances and paper ended up solidifying for me all of the things we learned really nicely. Dr. Feimster is absolutely lovely, invested, and understanding. Take this course if you can! "
