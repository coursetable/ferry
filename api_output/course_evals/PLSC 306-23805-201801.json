            "\u00a0This class taught me to process the world of information around me in a much more nuanced and critical manner. ",
            "\u00a0More than just discussing the role of the media, this course mostly focuses on the meaning of truth and different ways in which truth is mediated. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to analyze media from a range of new perspectives. And I learned new theoretical frameworks for thinking about truth. ",
            "\u00a0A thorough understanding of the various complexities and problems associated with the relationship of media to truth and facts. The course taught me how to be more reflective and analytical on these very interesting and prevalent issues. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much. Between the readings, class discussions, and the speakers, we covered tough questions and much material. Our weekly themes ranged from the public sphere to the creation and coverage of events to the etymology of the word information. Both rooted in film and journalism, this course really thrives from students' individual interest and the professors' knowledge. Having two professors and carefully picked readings made this class incredibly engaging and unlike many other Yale courses. ",
            "\u00a0I learned strategies for navigating the media landscape and for understanding the ways truth is mediated by different sources. I also gained a lot of historical context for understanding media and different approaches to it. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this course was an excellent seminar covering philosophy, media studies, and film. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided an interesting and deep introduction into the study of how media can influence the dissemination of and interpretation of information. I improved my writing skills and ability to critically analyze media. ",
            "\u00a0I feel like I learned so much about how we as humans interact with the truth. In that process, I believe that I have learned how to ask better questions and evaluate how the truth is being mediated and discussed by individuals and the media. "

            "\u00a0Incredibly engaging professors and fascinating texts.  No real weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0The guest seminars were one of the strongest parts of the course. At times, the course seemed to have lost its direction a little, but that's also part of its charm. ",
            "\u00a0While I found the readings and screenings stimulating and the guests amazing, I felt the syllabus was overly ambitious. Often, our Monday class time sessions felt rushed as we struggled to get through all the readings AND talk about the film. Besides that, expectations for the midterm presentation assignment felt a little unclear. Because the course followed such a trajectory of thought, I think it was ambitious to expect students to choose a case study early in the term that would then become the basis of a final project. However, despite these quibbles, I thought it was a great class overall. The readings and discussions were great. And the inclusion of guests provided a unique opportunity to connect our theories to the real world. ",
            "\u00a0I thought there was a disconnect between our weekly guests and the highly theoretical texts we read. The guests from the media industry (which I thought was the best part of the course) weren't really speaking to or at the level of the texts we were reading. I think a course with so many guests is an incredible \"only at Yale\" kind of opportunity that I would preserve. Also, I really struggled with knowing if I was going in the right direction because we did not receive any feedback for any of the four parts of the grade (class participation, reading responses, final paper, presentation). And we did not receive very explicit directions on any of the assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Overall this was an exceedingly strong course, with stellar faculty, insightful guests, and well-chosen topics and readings. A minor weakness is that we weren't able to do justice to our discussion of the films, since there was already so much to cover. ",
            "\u00a0I think it would have been helpful for this course to have more assignments. This would have facilitated more consistent feedback and more engagement with the material. \r\n\r\nI thought the content and selection of readings on the syllabus were very strong. Another strength of the course was definitely the guest lecturers. Getting to talk to people from different departments and from media industries was incredibly valuable. ",
            "\u00a0I think we could have benefitted from more engagement in the lecture portions about the texts; however, I think that the course moved towards that as the semester went on. ",
            "\u00a0This is a strong course, though at times the material can be difficult to fully grasp. ",
            "\u00a0I would have liked to receive more feedback throughout the course. I wish we had more time for discussion. It often felt like we had to cut our discussion short because of class ending. Though I won't have wanted to cut any of the readings, the films, speakers, or case studies because I thought they each added an interesting and new dimension to the class. It was definitely an ambitious syllabus but I enjoyed it immensely. "

            "\u00a0Yes!!!  This was an incredible experience.  You'll learn so much, listen to so many accomplished and insightful guest speakers, and have fun with the assignments. ",
            "\u00a0If you get the chance, absolutely take this course. Professors Casetti and Shechtman are fantastic. The guest seminars alone are worth the price of admission. ",
            "\u00a0Advisedly, yes. It would have to be a student who I know would be into spending the semester diving deeply into media and performance theory. ",
            "\u00a0In its current form, I would not recommend this course to another student. I think that the topic and weekly guests are interesting. But the three times we met each week (once to discuss readings, once to hear from a guest, and once to watch a film) all felt very separate. If you don't have a background in social or media theory, you might struggle with the readings. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! There's something for everyone in this course, regardless of your academic background or interests. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! As long as you are interested in either film theory, media theory, the history of film, or the role of journalism in the past and present, you will really enjoy this course. As a seminar, your voice will really be heard and you will learn so much from many different kinds of people. A must-take for aspiring journalists! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. It offers very valuable insight that makes understanding our complicated modern media much easier. The media today is overwhelming and confusing, and the historical context this course teaches is very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would recommend this course to anyone, regardless of major. These texts are relevant especially to the current age, but as Professor Casetti says, fake news isnt new. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student interested in media studies or in how the media landscape affects information exchange and processing. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. "
