            "\u00a0The evaluative tool used in this course are sorely lacking. One midterm and one final exam, with no regard given to participation or any other assignments, is not a good way to evaluate students. The exams were rote memorization tests that did not in the least test my ability to reason or use the tools we were introduced to in class. I would propose having a paper requirement or grading class participation as a means of better evaluating students. "

            "\u00a0No. Euro-centric, nationalistic, justifying using war as a political and economic tool without creating a welcoming atmosphere to challenge these notions ",
            "\u00a0No, the course contains some interesting ideas and topics but I would just recommend that they read some of the better readings, which would provide them with 90% of the course value without having to sit through anecdotal lectures and the less useful readings. ",
            "\u00a0This course is easy, but frustrating. You need to memorize all of the materials for the exams. "
