            "\u00a0A framework to understanding corporate debt, and understanding how it differs fundamentally from investing in that same company's equity. We visited topics such as coverage/recovery in a bankruptcy, how a bankruptcy could proceed, as well as how to evaluate the value of a bond with maturity/yield/etc. ",
            "\u00a0I gained an amazing introduction to credit investing. ",
            "\u00a0I gained applied skills for how to value a company, both quantitatively and qualitatively, and how to perform various analyses for a corporate credit instrument. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting class, Learned a lot through the final presentation project, Not a lot of instruction regarding how to do the problem sets ",
            "\u00a0This course touched on basic methods of corporate credit valuation, from DCFs to waterfalls of credit claims. The material is interesting, but I dont feel like Ive walked away with a great grasp of these concepts. ",
            "\u00a0Anything and everything corporate credit related ",
            "\u00a0You learn intricate models of banking, bankruptcy, excel, and corporate debt of course. ",

            "\u00a0One of the best things about the course was that Professor Rapaport would bring his own real-world experiences into every lecture. While the theory behind much of debt investing could be taught by anyone, being a partner at debt fund offers a lot more nuance into how decisions must be made. For example, there are obvious levers to maximize financial value, but the equation changes when the side losing out is a labor union who loses their pension plans. It was really great that Professor Rapaport would talk us both through the theoretical and practical standpoints.\r\n\r\nA weakness of the course was that some of the presentations that Professor Rapaport used could have been cleaned up to display clearer figures or tables, some of which could be very difficult to follow especially for a first time viewer who was unfamiliar with the concept he was attempting to explain. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of this course are definitely the amazing instructor who has an invaluable perspective being a credit investor himself, and the engaging class content. Only weakness would be the lack of introductory/beginner material to assist those who may not have as much prior experience with credit investing or valuation. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are how we can effectively apply finance theory into practice through the student exercises and problem sets, which give us a much better understanding of what goes on by investment professionals. Professor Rapaport is also very nice and willing to answer any question. A weakness would be that sometimes Prof. Rapaport would go too quickly in class and we might be so far ahead that no one will have the proper understanding to ask a good question that would bring us back on track. It would be better to go in finer, step by step detail, especially in any slides that contain excel work on them. I recommend for next year that Prof. R send us the spreadsheets he uses for the slides as they would help enormously in our understanding. It would also be better if the readings were more closely connected with what we learned each week in class. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting material and cool guest speakers, wish there was clearer guidance on how to solve psets ",
            "\u00a0The material is good, and Prof. Rapaport definitely knows his stuff, but the class is poorly structured and poorly equipped to help students learn. The lectures are terribly structured, the slides are next to useless, and there isnt much connection between lecture content and problem sets. \r\n\r\nDisorganization leaves much to be wanted from the course. ",
            "\u00a0The material and its presentation can use some work. Many unlabeled graphs in power points and lectures, and a very unorganized class folder made for difficulty going back and reviewing the information. Don't get me wrong, the professor is amazing, the class just needs some improving from the teaching perspective. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the depth of material and the specificity.  Along with the firsthand accounts and guest lectures.  Weaknesses include the substantial financial knowledge and excel manipulations expected to be known before the class starts. ",
            "\u00a0This is an amazing course! It requires, however, a very detailed and complex understanding of credit finance. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This course is a good overview of credit investing - topics learned in class are coupled with case studies, which is helpful for clarifying understanding. However, the course demands background knowledge of finance or else the psets and exercises will seem very confusing. There is not a lot of guidance; you mainly have to figure things out for yourself. Take it with a friend! ",
            "\u00a0Interesting if you have a finance background--otherwise, will be a struggle. Professor Rapaport is awesome and knows his stuff. Lots of interesting guest speakers and a fun final project ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only to students who have an already strong financial background. No matter how interested they are in debt investing, it is too difficult to play catch-up with some of the Excel modeling that is required in the class that is necessary for better understanding how debt waterfalls work/payouts in recovery/future value etc. That being said, this course was really great in that it touches a subject that many students would have otherwise never had. In working with the endowment office to develop it, it really accomplishes its purpose in guiding students in how to properly evaluate debt of a company. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course! Exceptional instructor with really interesting material. ",
            "\u00a0Its a great way to learn about debt. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you have sufficient finance experience, which includes knowledge of excel, bond math, and most importantly, accounting. Accounting is hugely important so brush up before this class. This course would be impossible if you haven't taken some sort of intro finance course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes if you are interested in distressed investing ",
            "\u00a0No.  Not a great class to take for learning this material. It is pretty unfortunate, since the instructor is insanely well-equipped to teach this class. Really a shame that the material is poorly conveyed. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if this is something that interests you, and you have already been a banker.  Do not expect to just take the prereqs and feel comfortable doing the work in this course.  Beyond that, the professor is a great guy and makes the class very enjoyable.  He brings in fantastic speakers, and it is some excellent exposure if you haven't worked in the specific area.  Be aware though that mostly everyone in the class already has. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in the subject, there is no better course for this. Take if you are ready to work extremely hard as a senior. It is very rewarding. "
