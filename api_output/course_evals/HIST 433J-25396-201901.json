            "\u00a0This class introduced me to population history and the Demographic Transition Theory. We used this theory and applied it to specific cases from various countries. ",

            "\u00a0I learned a lot through this course. Demography is something that I had always had an idea of what it was, but never really thought about the effects that demographic changes can have on a regional, national, and global scale. This class not only gave me insight to these effects, but also the statistical mechanisms through which the magnitude of change is calculated. We learned about changes in different regions as well as trends in demographic change on a global scale. "

            "\u00a0overall interesting readings, just too much reading per week. enjoyed doing the reviews of previous weeks material. project was interesting, maybe more discussion in-class about them / presentation of results? ",
            "\u00a0The material was interesting and class discussion was exciting. I enjoyed many of the readings but felt like the chronology of the class was confusing. I wish we had done the more theoretical material at the beginning of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I think that it was a great introduction to the course and the readings for each week tied to a central theme very well. The discussion based aspect of the course was also done well as people had different interpretations of the readings, potential criticisms and resolutions that I had not thought about when I had initially done them. The assignments for the course were very reasonable. \r\nOne thing is that I wish there was a group project as I learned a lot from my peers and it would have been interesting to bring different ideas together for a final product.
