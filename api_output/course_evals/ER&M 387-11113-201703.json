            "\u00a0I got an overview of a lot of immigration policy as well as more about the lived experiences of migrants and the ways in which immigration can operate outside of the legal realm. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the creation of borders, citizenship, the nation state, and migration. I learned a lot of untold truths about the US and its rampant militarization of the border and citizenship. ",
            "\u00a0Best course I have taken at Yale thus far. Would recommend to anyone. I learned so much, not only about the subject at hand, but at how students react and take control of the subject in their own respects. ",
            "\u00a0I learned alot about current day politics regarding the criminalization of migration amd how this affects so many people. I also learned about the importance of the migrant narrative and was constantly reminded of the humans behind these stories. I also learned about the importance of applying what we learn in the classroom to the outside world, and this was one of the only classes that I have taken here with an actively  attempted doing this. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about the experiences of migrants making their way to the United States through the lens of migrants with different identities. Also developed research skills through the research group project. ",
            "\u00a0Learning about the current state of immigration both in Mexico and U.S., as well as the ways immigration enforcement has become punitive and restrictive ",
            "\u00a0In depth analysis of immigration issues, particularly the US-Mexico border. A migrant-centered approach to immigration issues. New frameworks to grapple with current emergent political phenomenon. ",
            "\u00a0The history of the US-Mexico border, how has it changes and which effects does it have on people not only in these two countries, but in the whole region. "

            "\u00a0I enjoyed most of this class a lot, the only thing is that I think that the project sometimes detracted from class time and we didn't have the time to talk about the material we had prepared for. ",
            "\u00a0The material was interesting and thorough. Prof. Camacho is great one-on-one and knows so much about these topics. Sometimes the class felt a little slow and boring however. I blame it on people being on their computers and trying to kill time. Sometimes I felt that people brought up the same point, and really didn't add much to the conversation. Would love to have a section of what we would want the future to look like in terms of migration. Maybe rename the course too, since we never talked about people south of Nicaragua much. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Gives students the space to engage with the material\r\n\r\nWeakness: very vague with the projects. Not a lot of feedback with projects ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I enjoyed how passionate Prof. Schmidt Camacho during discussion. Readings varied well and the research group project helped me develop research skills. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not enough guidance on the research group project. While class discussion was great, there was often not enough time to discuss the readings which I would have liked to do. ",
            "\u00a0Great discussion with students. Perhaps assign more academic books and articles ",
            "\u00a0Like Professor Camacho's Intro to ER&M, I think this course could have greatly benefited from greater organization and structure. Professor Camacho is a incredibly brilliant scholar of migration and there were moments during this class when I felt I was being enlightened with every word. But there were also moments when I didn't know what I was learning/ supposed to be doing. Each week of the course is labeled with a theme, but they aren't drawn together or organized logically, I don't think. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Camacho is amazing and everyone in the class also brings a lot of experience and expertise on migration. However, I wish class discussion had been a bit more structured/demanding to ensure that people were doing the reading seriously and engaging with the ideas of the readings -- and each others' ideas on the readings.\r\n\r\nProfessor Camacho was helpful throughout the research process but I would have liked a little more feedback on the first short paper. ",
            "\u00a0This class had many strengths including strong course material, a strong political analysis, and a unique approach. I really enjoyed course readings, and appreciated that they were online and didn't require the purchase of books. The class was decently organized, though I would have appreciated more of a road-map at the start of the term about what we were studying and why, which might have helped it feel more cohesive. The seminar was also too unstructured for my preference - having a student present on the readings each day or bring discussion questions, or other more structured class elements would have helped a lot. The project structure - group projects - was a strength as well, particularly for those who had a stakeholder interested in their research. ",
            "\u00a0I would like more discussions about the readings, but I understand how important are personal experiences are for this class so a balance between both things "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to another student. There are weekly readings and short blog responses, one short paper, one final paper and a final group project. Yes, there are two final assignments but there's plenty of time in class devoted to them (sometimes too much). We occasionally will go down a tangential rabbit hole, but professor Camacho is really engaging as a seminar leader and when she lectures its so interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah, this course is great and provides many opportunities to study what you're interested in within the realm of migration and borders. Prof. Camacho is amazing as well, and someone worth taking a class with, you'll learn so much from such an amazing scholar and person!! ",
            "\u00a0YES. Take this class. Professor Camacho is an amazing professor and you should take one of her classes before you graduate. If you are curious about anything regarding immigration, I highly recommend this class. ",
            "\u00a0The material in the class is really significant work to be engaging in. The one thing I will say is that the class is designed to be driven by the students, so depending on the willingness of everyone to speak and participate, you will either get a lot out of it during a class or not. I would definitely recommend it, but with the disclaimer that you must be willing to be a part of the conversation and engage in the ideas professor Camacho presents in front of you. ",
            "\u00a0Please take this class!!! I learned and gained so much from it and I think all students can. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course if you're interested in learning about the migrant experience. Prof. Camacho is great at providing feedback and facilitates discussion well. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you want to learn about the interplays of undocumented migration and undocumented migrants and migrants in the U.S. and Mexico ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you want to learn from Professor Camacho (and you should), but be prepared for it to lack organization/ clear direction at most times. The final projects, if you take the necessary initiative, can be great opportunities to develop and design projects around your own interests (and can be great additions to your personal repertoire), but could also, I imagine, be frustrating and disorganized if you want more direction. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course! Exceedingly relevant and Professor Camacho is a brilliant and patient professor. Absolutely take it. ",
            "\u00a0If you have research project(s) that you're interested in doing on the subject, then absolutely yes. This is the space for that. If you know less about the subject and want to learn from the readings/classroom I'd caution against it. The class often felt too big to have productive discussions, and I just don't think a good discussion climate emerged over the course of the term. \r\n\r\nProfessor Camacho, though, is a really amazing scholar and role model for how to be an academic that engages in the community and in political issues. Half your work for the class is research for a community organization -- in groups, which can be a little tough -- and half is your own project. ",
            "\u00a0This class, and everything that Professor Camacho teaches, is great!! An incredibly important topic taught through Camacho's migrant-focused lens. Definitely take this course if you're looking to further your analysis about border and immigration issues, if you're interested in cultural studies (Camacho is very open to multi-media analysis), or if you're hoping to work on longer projects about migration. Small warning that the seminar is somewhat unstructured. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I believe this is a course anyone interested in the US-Mexico relationship should take ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Alicia Camacho is an amazing professor! "
