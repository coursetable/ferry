            "\u00a0I got much better at Italian, especially grammar. ",
            "\u00a0I furthered my knowledge of Italian speaking, reading, writing, and understanding of culture. ",
            "\u00a0This was a continuation of L1 and the grammatical structures became more complex but the transition was rather smooth. ",
            "\u00a0Taking this course helped develop more skills and grammar to form more complex sentences in Italian. It helped me gain more abilities to express my thoughts in Italian. "

        [
            "\u00a0I really think the course teaches Italian in the best possible way. Everything was taught in a very understandable way. That said, it is hard to get the feel of the language without actually being in the country, which is why I am going on the Siena summer session, so perhaps one of the weaknesses was that by the end of the course (for at least me) I still needed to keep all the information in my head to speak. It's like tying your shoes by remembering the movements and the knots before you do it so many times that it's second nature. But that's not really a blameable fault of the course. ",
            "\u00a0I think that this is a very strong course. ",
            "\u00a0Simona, and the rest of the Italian department want nothing but to make students enjoy learning Italian. ",
            "\u00a0Italian gives more examinations than some of the other language departments at Yale, but it was really helpful in terms of constantly assessing our progress and the topics that we needed to review more. A weakness would be that although we had presentations and an oral exam, I still do not feel completely comfortable speaking the language as much as I do writing it. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this class are the dedicated professor, the focus on grammar, and the emphasis on collaboration. There was a lot of time to work with classmates during class activities, which was always really helpful to practice the material. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. It is not difficult, but only because the teachers are so good that it makes the learning easy. You learn a lot very quickly, and you get a real appreciation for the language. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. The Italian department is full of fantastic professors, and the classes are run well. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is the best language department at Yale and that is what I tell other students. ",
            "\u00a0The Italian department is great; the teachers are engaged and very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it because Italian is a wonderful language to learn. It is fun and not too difficult. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend it, because it is a great opportunity to learn the language. "
