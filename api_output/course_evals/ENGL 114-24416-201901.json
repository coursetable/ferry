            "\u00a0I learned how to closely read, how to write research papers and make my argument clear, and how to organize my ideas. I also learned a lot of writer's views on beauty, which were very interesting to read. ",
            "\u00a0My abilities to form arguments and present well-rounded opinions was enhanced by this course. My approaches to literature and art were refined, allowing me to gain more from almost any experience. ",
            "\u00a0This class was more than just argumentative writing; it was about making your own view and opinion on topics that didnt always have straightforward controversies or sides to argue for (like art), and thus having to establish your position clearly ",
            "\u00a0Better writing! ",
            "\u00a0I feel like my writing improved so much over the course and I am better able to write many different varieties of essay. "

            "\u00a0I really liked the small classroom environment. I thought the discussions were always very comfortable and enriching. I also really liked peer-review sessions and other class lessons that were geared toward our writing to help us improve. ",
            "\u00a0The context was great for argumentative writing; if youre into art, beauty and philosophy, its really interesting to write about \r\n\r\nIf you dont care about art specifically dont take this class, its more focused on art than human beauty \r\n\r\nSometimes classes are dry when the professor just asks people to read aloud ",
            "\u00a0One of the strengths was the discussion that went on during class. it was really engaging and I feel like everyone got to contribute. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to someone who is looking to take a Wr/English credit and improve their writing. The small class environment is also really nice and Ms. Jones was an amazing discussion leader. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. Its focus on art and beauty added another level of interest, letting it be more than just an english course. I benefitted mentally and intellectually while bettering my argumentative skills. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend if you like art and want to write interesting essays and arguments about art and beauty, even if youre just a casual art gallery-goer\r\n\r\nProfessor Jones gives good tips and really pushes you to improve your writing, but heavy workload and readings that you cant skim \r\n\r\nIf you have absolutely no interest in art and just want to fulfil a writing credit, dont take it (but it might make you like art by the end) ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes I absolutely would! It was really fun and engaging and I feel like I truly improved as a writer. "
