            "\u00a0I learned a lot about agrarian societies, that's for sure. Tons of discussion, too! ",
            "\u00a0I learnt a lot about history and contemporary politics around agriculture and how it is tied with different modes of governance, capital, market and ideas of development. The course offered a lot of insights to pursue further research in the fields of agrarian studies, development studies, environmental anthropology and political economy. The close reading of the assignments by the instructors and the long discussion sessions in the class were of immense help. ",

            "\u00a0It was great to have multiple perspectives from lectures and discussions via the three professors. However, some bridges between material would have been useful both in better understanding the course material as a whole and in helping students develop strong paper topics by midterm and thereafter.\r\n\r\nOne weakness was that I did not receive any feedback on reading/discussion response papers during the course of the semester; even a little feedback would have been helpful to gauge whether or not I was actually grasping the material and interacting with it in a meaningful way. ",
            "\u00a0More opportunity for writing feedback from both professors and fellow students. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: strong syllabus, interesting readings, having three different professors and guest speakers. Diversity of the class was also good, having so many people across different disciplines and in different departments/schools added a lot to discussion.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The main one is that this class absolutely should not be four hours long. The content is so interesting and important, and hammering it for four hours actually does it a disservice because people's brains are fried. It would be better to break the course up into smaller chunks, even two hours twice a week.\r\n\r\nI also wish discussions were a bit more driven, or had stronger leading questions to jumpstart discourse. I like the idea of a students leading discussions, but many times students would just read a long dense speech they had prepared on the readings, not leaving the group with any problems or questions to debate. It often felt like people were just talking to fill airtime. ",

            "\u00a0strengths: well-prepared and clearly presented lectures, lively discussions, and interdiscplinary approaches\r\n\r\nweakness: I feel a little bit lost by the sheer diversity of the topics in agrarian societies. Perhaps better to present main threads of debate in this field at the beginning of this course so that the readings in the following classes are better organized together ",

It's a rare opportunity to have three excellent professors in the room together once a week and be able to share ideas with them, rather than being simply lectured at. They were all willing to accommodate student perspectives in the classroom and happy to help us work through our paper topics. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. It's intense but totally worth it. ",
            "\u00a0Mixed feelings on this class...but it's what you make of it. Readings are really fascinating. Discussion often fell flat or went nowhere, which was disappointing, but my biggest takeaway from the course was probably ideas from info in the readings. Also be warned that a four-hour seminar is...long. Like, really long. ",
