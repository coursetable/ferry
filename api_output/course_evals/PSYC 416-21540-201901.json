            "\u00a0In this seminar, we learned about the dynamics involved in group life and group interactions. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about the different ways social species live and the complexity of human group life. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me about the implications and effects of group life, and the ways that groups affect individual psychology. We had class discussions, had a really interesting guest attend a seminar, and our final was a research study proposal. It was a really fun course and I learned a lot! "

            "\u00a0Strengths: (1) always a lot of content to discuss and people came prepared due to the weekly reading responses, (2) Professor Dunham's energy. Weakness: Sometimes the same people talked too much. Would've been nice to hear more voices. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very engaging. The readings were great, and class discussion was always intriguing. ",
            "\u00a0Discussions were good along with the professor's guidance. The day in which we got into groups to talk about readings each group was assigned was fun! ",
            "\u00a0you get to learn about intergroup cognition from many approaches - from comparative psychology, developmental psychology, and evolutionary psychology, among others ",
            "\u00a0I think it being discussion-based was one of its strengths. Not only we were exploring the depths of a topic in group psychology every week, but we also learned a lot from the ways our classmates looked at the readings. Everyone brought in their perspectives. \r\n\r\nThe class might be improved if the students try to build upon/engage more with what has been brought up in class. Sometimes, it felt like Professor Dunham would ask a question, someone would answer it, and then the next person to speak would just ignore that comment to go on their own tangents. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course was that it was clearly structured, had excellent readings, and good class discussions. The assignments were manageable and there were opportunities for feedback throughout the semester. "

            "\u00a0I think so. The course didn't necessarily teach me anything incredibly new, but it made me appreciate groups in a new way and was rigorous in doing so. If you're interested in groups, this course will give you a number of great perspectives to learn about them. Great course if you need a psychology senior seminar. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This course was incredible. Class discussions were always very engaging, and Professor Dunham was fantastic at driving the conversation forward. The readings were great and spanned a wide variety of sub-topics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! Solid class, not too challenging, really interesting material and great professor! ",
            "\u00a0If they are even a little bit interested in group psychology, then it's a big yes from me! We cover a good amount of ground and manage to go in depth thanks to Professor Dunham and the readings. \r\n\r\nSomething else I appreciated a lot were the assignments: the rabbit holes and the final project. I felt like I learned a lot while I was doing these assignments and they all felt like they served a purpose. I wasn't doing them just for the sake of doing assignments, they were assignments that made me grow academically. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course! It was a lot of fun, the readings were really interesting, the work was very manageable and the professor is great! "
