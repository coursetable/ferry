I had to go to office hours to refine my understanding of these explanations. Perhaps, going through sample equations in class that pertain to those in the problem sets would be helpful for future students. ",

            "\u00a0This course provides an extremely useful foundation for students interested in studying water. However, it was extremely challenging at times. Students were often expected to teach themselves how to apply mathematical concepts. This was difficult for many students, especially those without a strong background in the physical sciences. The homework assignments took much longer to complete than the assignments for any of my other classes. The class got better after the midterm and I really enjoyed the lectures covering the practical applications of what we learned. The lectures were also better when the professors did not rely too heavily on the slides. Powerpoints enabled the professors to move too quickly through the material and the whiteboard was generally a better platform. ",

            "\u00a0Having the course be taught in tandem was informative at times, because having two professors allowed for different styles in teaching and subject expertise. Sometimes, there was a bit too much of a gap between lecture material and questions on the homework, which led to students feeling like they were spinning their wheels a bit on assignments. Overall, there was a high expectation of students to show up and do their work, which I appreciated. ",
