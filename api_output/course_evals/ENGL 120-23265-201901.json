            "\u00a0I learnt to write compelling essays, formulate my thoughts better as well as read more attentively. I loved that Chris introduced essays beyond those in the Norton reader, it really helped me expand the scope of work we considered and hence had the opportunity to learn from. Given that we were in a small section, we got to know each other pretty well and that made for a great time. ",
            "\u00a0We learned much about the purpose of writing and how to write effectively and with purpose. ",
            "\u00a0At least for me, I have never taken a creative writing class, and certainly never a class on creative nonfiction, so taking English 120 was integral in introducing me to this style of writing. \r\n\r\nHaving five \"units\", divided by the genre of essays (personal, place, argument, profile, and our last unit was selecting our own genre), was really useful in understanding the different ways to approach creative nonfiction. Each unit, we would read several essays from the genre of the unit and discuss what worked and didn't work in each essay. Afterwards, we would write our essays, often relying on the example essays as a model, and then workshop our essays together. This process of seeing diverse examples within each genre and collectively workshopping our own writing was really helpful in sharpening my writing in each genre. As such, I feel a lot more confident in writing my own personal essays. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write a creative essay in a succinct and precise way. I learned how to be more thoughtful in my reading and writing. I also learned some important teaching skills. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: 1. essays that we have to submit -- i love that they are broad enough to let us write pretty much anything, but also narrow enough to make us focus\r\n2. workshopping -- we did four workshops each and it definitely helped to be actively reading so much work and making suggestions on it\r\n3. readings -- great fun to read and discuss\r\n4. teaching demo -- i dont think all classes do this but I really liked this addition Chris made\r\nWeaknesses: that there are very few other courses like this at Yale :) ",
            "\u00a0I didnt learn much from the readings. If we analyzed the readings more for purpose of techniques we might learn more from them. ",
            "\u00a0One of the strengths of this course was the diversity in terms of readings. I felt like I got to read all types of essays, and we even got to pick out our own essay to present to the class. The main strength was definitely workshopping. The amount of feedback you receive on each essay is incredible and everyone is very thoughtful and caring when providing commentary. I think one the weakness was just that sometimes people didn't really do the readings, but other than that nothing comes to mind. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - I feel like most people come from high schools that don't teach creative nonfiction, so if you want to understand the craft of writing New Yorker-quality essays, English 120 is really helpful in understanding the different approaches to creative nonfiction. This isn't specific to 120, but my class ended up having 7 people. With such a small class, I thought we had really great camaraderie and got along with our instructor Chris really nicely. I feel like the small class size meant that I was able to participate more in discussions and could receive ample feedback on my writing. We were able to workshop every single person's essay for every unit, which I found to be extremely helpful. \r\n\r\nWaknesses - I wish we could have more feedback for the final draft. We ended up with a final grade and some comments on how to improve for the future, but because there was no \"final final draft\", I didn't feel much of an incentive to further revise my essay. But this is such a small concern that I don't know if it even counts as a weakness. "

            "\u00a0Yes yes yes! I absolutely loved this course because it helped think about issues that have been at the back of mind for a while, as well as discuss them with a bunch of thoughtful people. I have always been very self-conscious about my writing but this course instilled a certain confidence in me. Take it take it take it! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it has helped tons with my ability to write and communicate on paper (which is important in most areas of life). ",
            "\u00a0Everyone should take this class!! It's such an amazing writing course. It's amazing to be able to work on writing essays that aren't purely analytical and evidence based and you can have so much fun with all the assignments. I became a much better writer from this class. ",
            "\u00a0English 120 is a class that teaches you not only about writing but about who you are as a writer. Each assignment has a deeply personal aspect that enhanced my enjoyment of the work I was doing and the writing of the fellow classmates. The learning environment was fun, engaging, and just casual enough to allow us to get to know each other as we read about each other's lives. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! You know it's a good class when it's a 75 minute seminar and time flies by. I never felt like time dragged on in the class because our discussions always felt rich with ideas and critique. I also like that the class allows us to read a lot of diverse essays from many different perspectives, and now I feel like I can be pretentious and namedrop a bunch of essays/authors that we looked at. \r\n\r\nI can't speak for all 120 sections, but Chris is a wonderful, caring, thoughtful instructor that made a huge difference in terms of my enjoyment of the course. I don't think this is something that was immediately obvious, but because the writing in the course can become deeply personal, if you don't feel like you can trust your instructor/peers, it can be extremely hard to write about the topics you want to. However, Chris is a very kind person who never made me feel embarrassed or hesitant to write what I wanted, which made me feel more confident in writing on the topics that mattered more to me. As such, I now have five essays that I am proud of and feel ready to share with other people (including in publication/print). I also feel equipped to write more personal writing that I hope to publish, and I know that I wouldn't have that confidence without taking this course. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely suggest this class to another student. Being my first English class, it was an amazing introduction that taught me a lot of amazing writing skills that will help me with other English classes and other papers during the rest of my time in college. "
