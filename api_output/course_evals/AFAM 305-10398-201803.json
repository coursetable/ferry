            "\u00a0How to critically engage with and analyze literature, and how to examine autobiography as literature. ",
            "\u00a0So much about how to read literature! ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus is incredible. Everyone should read these books. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to close read a ton of material in a short span of time. I really appreciated this skill, it is particularly useful for humanities majors. I also feel that my ability to engage in dialogue with other students and a professor was seriously augmented by this course. I found discussions to be mostly relevant to the material, a welcome change for a Yale seminar. ",
            "\u00a0This class dramatically reshaped the way I think about life writing and subjectivity in art in general. The main attraction here are the books, but this isn't a class where I would recommend someone just download the syllabus and read the books on it. One reason is that no one ever does that. The other is that I think there was something invaluable about being able to discuss these books with Sarah Mahurin. She is an expert discussion leader adds fresh insight in a way that I never imagined before. I think this is the perfect American Studies class (especially in the cultural track) because the books blend the more pragmatic disciplines of history and politics with the beauty and aesthetics of literature. All in all, the canon of Black American letters is one that deserves a class like this. Not to say that it covered everything (Malcom X, James Weldon Johnson, were not on the syllabus, for example), but I think this class was comprehensive in a way that is rare for seminars that often bite off more than they can chew. ",
            "\u00a0Literary analysis, how to articulate my ideas in class, read some books I had hoped to read in my life. ",
            "\u00a0The course provides insights into the history of changing approaches to narrative in African American Autobiography. We discussed the blending of lines between fiction and nonfiction, between prose and poetry, and the links between personal and generational experiences and memory. Discussions touched on the limits of authors' ability to provide an account of other people's experiences, to generalize their own experiences, and the question of political and social obligation to address race issues in America. We spent a lot of time working on close reading of important passages, analyzing how use of form, image, and narrative strategy contributed to the work as a whole. ",
            "\u00a0I read a comprehensive overview of African American autobiographies spanning time and theme. I also improved my writing by expanding the scope of types of papers I have experience writing. ",
            "\u00a0Much about the many dimensions to autobiography, especially that of Black folk. "

        [
            "\u00a0This was a great course-- the books we read were wonderful, and Professor Mahurin is excellent at facilitating the seminar. I would have loved to be able to submit a draft for the first paper so I understood her expectations better, but she was really willing to meet with students and was very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Everybody did all of the reading because we felt really accountable to Prof. Mahurin. One of the most engaging and engaged classes i've taken. ",
            "\u00a0Dean Mahurin is an amazing discussion leader. She is especially great at creating a warm and unpretentious seminar environment. I always came out of class with a new perspective on the book at hand, and I never felt that our discussions were over-intellectualized. She also held us to high standards on our papers, but I really appreciate how much she took our writing seriously and she was very willing to meet with us to help us become better writers. I think a weakness of the class was the presentation component -- this took up a lot of class time, and I felt like our regular class discussions were more meaningful. The 10-12 page final paper and the three-hour final exam were also a lot during finals period. Finally, Issa Rae and Chris Rock weren't particularly funny (some parts were a little uncomfortable/offensive) and I think there are better pop-culture-y books that would fit the syllabus. ",
            "\u00a0I think Issa Rae should not be on the syllabus. It was awkwardly placed and took away from the readings writ large. ",
            "\u00a0This is the perfect Yale class. There, I said it. The people who gravitate to the subject matter are generally more invested, the syllabus is well thought out, (both in terms of chronology and thematic breadth) and the books are devastating. I've never cried more while doing readings for a class. With that being said, it was a very non-black space (my class had a plurality of white women) and that led to some weird tones during the discussions. Sometimes I felt that people were having too much fun analyzing the formal aspects of books that are dealing with tragic content. Be prepared to talk about commas during a rape scene, for example. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: great professor, engaging discussion, classmates that weren't afraid to disagree and engage in debates\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I don't feel like I walked out of this class better writer or how to convey my thoughts on paper. ",
            "\u00a0I think one of the strengths of this course is its curriculum. So many of the books were incredibly strong on their own or read in conjunction with other authors on the text, particularly Angelou, Lorde, Hurston, and Dandicat. While reading Issa Rae and Chirs Rock was a novel experience, I didn't think they particularly added to the conversations that we were having, and I think the time could have been better spent on different books or by extending the amount of time we spent talking about other texts on the syllabus that were longer or especially thematically rich. \r\n\r\nAnother aspect of the class that I would have changed is spending more time with passages in the book, rather than abstractly discussing the decisions the author made. This didn't happen every class, but there were some days when we only looked at one or two passages, and \r\nI think keeping class discussion more focused on the texts would have lead to more interesting conversations. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are Dean Mahurin, weakness would be having both a final exam and final essay. "

            "\u00a0Yes! It's not an easy course, but the texts are great and the professor is wonderful. ",
            "\u00a0YES ",
            "\u00a0Yes. STEM majors, good exposure to a different field about a different culture than one in the lab. Literature is also very enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! Dean Mahurin is awesome and the syllabus is incredible. It was a class I looked forward to every Monday and Wednesday. If you are considering taking it, just know that you do need to do all the readings. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely. This is a deep and engaging examination of a genre that is so crucial to understanding the experiences of a people in this country. Take it if you are willing to commit the time. These are important texts and discussions and they deserve respect and attention. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class if you are ok with reading a book every week. If you don't do the reading, the class is essentially useless. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but be prepared to read a full book a week and know how to do literary analysis before you go in. Not an easy Humanities credit. ",
            "\u00a0YES ! This course provides a solid introduction to this one style of black literature in America, intersecting with other forms of art and media as well as with political issues and history. The individual presentations were fun and also did a lot to expand the scope of the biographies alone and put them in wider context. The books we read are all amazing, some more somber and dense, some easier to get through, but all giving valuable insights into different aspects of the black experience in America. We moved roughly chronologically through the works, starting with Frederick Douglass and Harriet Jacobs and ending with Chris Rock and Jesmyn Ward. The class atmosphere was inclusive and close and it was a lot of fun to hear everyone's perspectives. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student--many of the books on the syllabus are fantastic and getting the chance to read them in an academic setting is really enjoyable. Professor Mahurin is a dynamic class leader and really worth taking a class with before you graduate. The reading load of the course varies from week to week but can get fairly heavy at times. Grading on essays is tough but presentation and final exam grading is very manageable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would, especially if they were interested in taking English classes about something other than dead white men. "
