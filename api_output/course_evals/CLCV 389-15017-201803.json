            "\u00a0In this class, I learned a lot about Ancient Egyptian history, culture, religion, and temple development. Through the assignments, I got exposure to reading primary and secondary sources and developing an argument regarding those sources. Additionally, through the powerpoint assignment, I was exposed to what it is like, at an academic level, to give presentations to a group. "

        [
            "\u00a0This course is well set-up to facilitate learning and ensure that every student does well. Assignments are broken up so that no single grade can decimate your final grade. Additionally, for final papers, students were encouraged to write on a topic that interests them, so long as it has some relation to the class. With that approach, students were able to apply cross-disclipinary approaches to the course material--which I personally believe helps students to learn the material in a way that truly benefits them. "

            "\u00a0I woud certainly recommend this course to other students. The class is set-up so that students are able to engage with the material in a way that most makes sense to them. The instructor encourages students to apply their own academic knowledge to the material of the course, so that students remain engaged, interested, and learning. "
