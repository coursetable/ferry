The extended bibliographic essay forced me to further develop these skills.\r\n\r\nInsights:  I definitely have a better \"innate\" understanding of U.S. national elections. "

We mostly discussed the content of the readings whereas sometimes I was more interested in dissecting the methodological elements.  That's alright though, it was a grad/undergrad combined class so I expected this going in. "
