            "\u00a0Organizing thoughts for thesis, where to find help when you need it (which most thesis writers do) ",
            "\u00a0This class did help develop my thesis, and some of the readings about structure of writing and research were helpful. ",
            "\u00a0This course was good preparation for writing the senior thesis/ essay. I learned a lot more about the process of writing such a long piece; talking to past ER&M seniors was really helpful for that. ",
            "\u00a0This course was incredibly helpful in beginning the work of my year-long senior project toward fulfilling the ER&M major requirements. The reading assignments (in The Craft of Research as well as excerpts from other past, relevant senior thesis projects) were highly useful in considering methodologies and writing styles. The small groups within the seminar were helpful in promoting accountability during the research and writing processes, and I believe I will keep in contact with other members of the course in the spring semester to check in and work together. Professor Tran is thoughtful and her advice was always practical and detailed! ",
            "\u00a0This course introduces research methods for ER&M senior theses. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course that guides you and makes sure you are on track when writing a senior thesis! ",

            "\u00a0Liked having the time to meet with students in the major and discuss what we have been doing for the thesis. Not really sure the assignments helped with my thinking or organization, because I've been in contact with my advisers and came in with a field focus that I wanted to write about (so didn't really need the basic \"here's how to write an introduction\"), but appreciated the chunk of time that I needed to dedicate to thinking about my year-long thesis every week. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were in its emphasis on small-group discussions and reading examples of past theses. It could really be improved if we didn't meet so frequently. Having the assignments was helpful in pushing us toward thinking about our thesis, but being in class really was not. ",
            "\u00a0I wish this course had dealt more with research methodologies. I thought it would cover that more; like different ways of researching/collecting data/ learning more about what characterizes ER&M as a discipline.\r\n\r\nSome weeks were much more helpful than others. The book we read was pretty helpful but talking it over, less so. I really liked hearing about others' projects. Editing what we wrote wasn't that helpful and I wish we had spent fewer classes on that. I think most classes in the second half of term didn't feel super useful, but could have been. Perhaps more time could have been spent on what characterizes research in ER&M or looking at different models/ways to do it. Reading last years' senior theses and talking to them was really helpful.\r\n\r\nI wish prof. Tran had given us more feedback on our written assignments. I know that's what our advisers were for, but it would have been really nice to have more specific comments from her too.\r\n\r\nLastly I wish we had found more ways to share with the other section. I really would have valued getting to meet with them and hear more about their ideas/progress/work. I hope there are more opportunities for that second semester. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a necessary guiding hand for seniors, but unnecessarily drawn out. I think that the course could be an hour a week and fulfill the same goals with fewer awkward pauses. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Tran is extremely helpful in guiding you through the thesis process. I did not feel that the class structure was as helpful though; perhaps more hands-on writing workshopping would help? "

            "\u00a0It was really nice to have that community of students who were all struggling together with their thesis writing, and to be able to bounce ideas off peers who could relate to interests that I wanted to write about. Would recommend. ",
            "\u00a0Sure, I mean it's mandatory for ER&M students. Ideally it will be structured a little differently in the future, because some weeks were really helpful and others didn't feel like a great use of time. Overall, though, this class is definitely a great resource for writing the senior essay or thesis and I'm very glad we have it. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, just as I would recommend consideration of the ER&M major! I feel the structure of this course would prove useful to students prior to the beginning of their senior requirement projects, but nonetheless the work of the course is spaced out in a way that is manageable and keeps the student on track to complete the amount of work they should be. The seminar was very productive for my project, and it was a nice form of fellowship amongst fellow classmates in the major who are working on similarly structured projects. Professor Tran is a fantastic facilitator of class discussion and her feedback was always thoughtful and effective. ",
