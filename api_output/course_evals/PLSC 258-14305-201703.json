            "\u00a0Professor Turner did a great job in teaching us how to connect abstract bureaucratic and managerial concepts to real world situations. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a ton about the inner workings of the bureaucracy, as well as theory and systems surrounding it. Gets you thinking about government in a completely different way and is very very insightful and Prof. Turner has so much knowledge on the topic which he gives to you. Great course. ",
            "\u00a0I gained an appreciation of the constraints inherent in running a huge bureaucracy, first and foremost. The class gave me a plethora of counterarguments for common criticisms levied against the government and its perceived inefficiencies. Anybody taking this course in the future will also see that it is possible to support the operations of a large government without succumbing to the idea that federal agencies should be involved with every aspect of our lives. Also, this class opened my eyes to the absurdity of the \"just privatize it\" argument. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a comprehensive understanding of how federal bureaucracy is organized and how it operates in our modern political system. More specifically, I learned how to apply public administration theory to case studies, which gave me a concrete understanding of the sometimes abstract ideas we discussed in class. ",
            "\u00a0This class was great at teaching the basics and some complicated areas of interaction between the bureaucracy and other institutions of government. It also taught how certain practices of the bureaucracy were applied through the weekly case studies. This class also is great in developing writing and critical thinking via the decent amount of writing, which invites you to write about new ideas not explores in class. "

            "\u00a0The course had engaging and flexible assignments, and the evaluations were very fair. Professor Turner is a fantastic lecturer. Some of the case studies (Education, Model Cities, and OSHA) were not terribly related to the course material for that week. If those cases were improved, I would have no complaints! ",
            "\u00a0Course was very well structured, ideas in each week built off one another and readings were extremely helpful. Lectures were super engaging and the case studies were a great way to see how the ideas in the readings applied in the real world. Reading responses also helped you connect ideas to practice and the public comment assignment was such a fun assignment but you still learn so much and get to use the theories to support your opinions. Only weakness perhaps is that feedback was a bit slow for assignments, but not a huge issue. ",
            "\u00a0My advice to anybody taking this course is to pay special attention during 2 portions of the course: Reinventing Government and Managing Decision-Making. My only recommendation for the class moving forward would be to cram the last two reading responses into the weeks following the November break. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly, the worst part of this class was the fact that it was a 9am. I think more people would have attended if the class was held later in the day. Nonetheless, I really enjoyed the structure of the class; we would learn theory on Mondays and then apply it in a case-study on Wednesdays. This structure helped us see how abstract concepts played out in real-world scenarios. ",
            "\u00a0The class was very well structured and the professor was always prepared to teach the class. The class also did well in staying on topic and exploring many aspects of the bureucracy in a short amount of time. A weakness is that the course material can be a bit boring at the time, but that is often diminished by the funny, energetic professor. One improvement for the class could be to find ways to make the topics relevant to current political events. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely! Professor Turner can make any subject matter interesting and engaging (even at 9am on a Monday). ",
            "\u00a0This course seems like it would be dry, just because of the topic; bureaucracy isn't the most well regarded part of government. But this course really brings it alive and lets you see it in a whole new manner as a key part of our political system and not just a scapegoat to blame all your problems on. Take this course, even if you aren't a Poli Sci major, this is stuff you need to know to be a good citizen. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Not only is it a great class to take after learning the foundations of the country's political structure, Democracy & Bureaucracy illuminates why future decision-makers need to take a logical, centrist mentality to government/private involvement in running our daily affairs. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, especially if you are interested in politics, education, or any career that involves bureaucracy. I think the knowledge I gained from this class will certainly be useful in my future career. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this class to any other student, as it is very much intellectually stimulating but also interesting, in large part because of the professor. The topics taught are very important to understand as it can explain many of the operations of government that are a bit obscure. Also, the bureaucracy is one of the main government institutions we commonly interact with, so knowing about how it is meant to serve us is a worthy reason for taking this course. "
