            "\u00a0I learned about the history of the past and how things evolved and changed throughout the millions of years, what were important events during this time and especially the focus of the environmental changes were interesting to me. We talked about animals, humans, plants, fossils. ",

            "\u00a0The lectures could follow a more clear development: I constantly was lost on where we were. I think main points could be summarized and repeated a little more as well. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of information in the course that I wish was structured a bit better ",
            "\u00a0Could be improved by coordinating more between all three instructors. It was jarring to pick up each instructor's method of teaching. Celli's review questions were especially helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Well taught for students with little background, doesn't leave you behind, always fascinating.\r\nWeaknesses: Very specific field which has little usefulness beyond just being interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I think the sections could have been made mandatory to facilitate our engagement with the weekly topics better but the class and lectures were all great and the ways the professors focused on different topics enabled connections with other classes and topics I was interested in. ",
            "\u00a0Wonderful course, I found it well oriented to learning. ",
            "\u00a0I thought it was taught very well but having 3 different lecturers made it difficult to adjust to their presentation style. The three professors in the class had a spread of teaching styles and mixing them from one lecture to another made it hard. ",
            "\u00a0I found the examinations to be very difficult to study for; even the study questions given to help prepare didn't seem to help that much. I often felt helpless as to what to do in order to sufficiently learn the information, and even when many hours of studying have been put into working through the material, there is always a concept that has been missed. The lecture slides are very unhelpful to look back on if trying to review and create a lot of confusion if a lecture is missed. ",
            "\u00a0Having three different lecturing professors each with their own teaching style made for  a disorganized and confusing albeit worthwhile class, ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated having three professors with different areas of expertise, which provided for more in-depth analysis of the course material. The problem-solving approach to the course (highly engaged with interpretation and actively considering alternative interpretations of the fossil record) made it more engaging than simple memorisation of facts would have done. The weakest part of the course was the assessment model, which was somewhat difficult to understand - having three different people setting the exams and different TAs giving different information about what would be tested made it difficult to prepare to answer the questions in the expected manner. ",
            "\u00a0This course is fun and interesting. I really enjoyed my time, and learned a lot every lecture. However, the lectures are not conducive to being able to catch up if you miss class. The lecture slides are bare, with little information clearly presented directly on them. There aren't any lecture notes to gain information from, either. ",
            "\u00a0I think we spent a disproportionate amount of time on really ancient geologic history (Prof Briggs' section) and would have preferred a stronger emphasis on the sections taught by Profs Bhullar and Hull. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, I would have appreciated if the slides were better designed to convey important information. The slides were basically treated as visual aides to the lecture, which made it really confusing when going back to review them. A lot of taxa in pictures on the slides were not labeled, and sometimes slides would show a completely anachronous organism to show comparisons with what was present in the era we were talking about, but the slides would have no labeling telling you that so it was very confusing. \r\n\r\nAlso, more clarity would be appreciated. One time there was a completely unexpected pop quiz in section, which did not feel very fair. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course is disorganized as a result of the three professors. They each have their own strengths in topics, but as a result, the time periods overlap making it hard to follow and fully place species/evolutions in the right big picture timeline. "

            "\u00a0Yes. Was fun and very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes but only if you're prepared to study really hard for a final worth 50% of your grade ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I learned a lot about paleontology (it's more than just dinosaurs!) and I'd highly recommend it for anybody who has any kind of interest in that. All three professors are great ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Not a gut, but a good Science credit nonetheless ",
            "\u00a0The course is entirely based on memorization, so if you find the material interesting you could enjoy it, but otherwise I would not recommend it ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It's just really cool and a great way for non-stem people to learn about a topic that seems intimidating to people with little background. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think the course had a lot of material that helps us understand life as it came to be as well as the applications to other majors and topics. ",
            "\u00a0This is the best class I have taken at Yale. That is likely in part because I am naturally inclined to be interested in this, but I found the lectures to be seriously enthralling and the workload very manageable. A good, reasonable science credit for non-science majors. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course although its a pretty hard class if your diving head first into this type of topic ",
            "\u00a0Yes, with the caveat that the student must be willing to think beyond the lecture hall in order to synthesize a narrative for otherwise weakly strung together lecture content ",
            "\u00a0course definitely started off a bit slow, but second half was pretty cool. Just getting an overall picture of the entire history of life and the fact that the earth has looked so many different ways and there have been so many different animals AND the fact that WE are a part of that is honestly amazing!! You look at a squirrel outside and youre like oh my god we are both part of this insane history - thats totally insane. \r\nIf you go into the class just thinking its a gut that you have to get through to fulfill a bureacratic requirement, youll prob end up annoyed and getting a bad grade. But if you can get yourself enthusiastic about it  which is easier in the second half  it can be pretty sweet. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested in the environment - it is an excellent introduction to natural history and gives insight into how ecosystems and organisms react to global and local environmental change, as well as questioning how we come to those conclusions and form that knowledge. The course may sound dry and content-heavy but is taught in a highly engaging and critical manner. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was super interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this class. By the end, I just wanted another whole semester of this class to dig deeper into the materials! It is a lot of fun. Overall, some of the best instructors I've had at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0This course is fine. I wish I had more prior interest and knowledge of the history of life before taking it, so if the topic doesn't really interest you right away, it can be a little confusing and boring at times. "
