            "\u00a0Sustainable Food and Agriculture took a highly interdisciplinary, open, and creative approach to learning about farm practices and food systems, which allowed a lot of student-driven leadership over their own content and research projects. Our discussions on food, and who has control over this source of life, often diverged into fascinating discussions on power dynamics, philosophy, and histories of control, oppression, and colonialism. We made sure to talk about the very human aspects of agriculture that are intrinsically tied to that which is defined as 'natural,' and also importantly highlighted the environmental and food injustices that take place to keep the world's people fed, while millions are still left hungry and impoverished. I really enjoyed the freedom and diverse angles of thinking this class provided each student in developing their understandings of food systems. ",
            "\u00a0Sustainable Food & Agriculture provides multiple perspectives on the sustainable food movement. I was exposed to both social approaches to sustainable agriculture and more analytical, science based approaches. Through this course, I learned how to be critical of otherwise widely excepted projections that have shaped the sustainable food movement as we know it. I also learned how to conduct dialogue that is both insightful and welcoming to all levels of familiarity with concepts of agriculture and ecology. ",
            "\u00a0This class helped me to develop research skills and writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0I got sense of a number of opinions about how to sustainably approach food on a local and global scale. ",
            "\u00a0I gained the ability to better synthesize readings and reach larger conclusions using ideas presented in the readings ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about the current methods for sustainable agriculture that are being implemented. I learned about different aspects of agriculture and how they are interrelated. ",
            "\u00a0This was the first class I took at Yale that focused on neoliberal critique and a broad theme of systems. I learned how to stay invested in the coursework and how to scale my thoughts around the subject to avoid total despair in the face of capitalism. I also learned a lot about the Yale Farm!! ",
            "\u00a0I learned to critically evaluate prevailing narratives about food systems and consider how frameworks of interpretation presented as defaults or universal truths often represent politically or culturally biased viewpoints. I became more skeptical of simplistic models or explanations of multifaceted processes and grew to view the global food system as a dynamic entity inextricable from other global networks. "

            "\u00a0I think a great strength was the way Professor Bomford provided students great independence in choosing what readings they wanted to reflect on, how they could reflect on it, and how we could direct our larger assignments and projects. Perhaps to adapt the class, I would allow more time to have small group and large group discussions rather than longer presentations at the beginning of class. Although they were quite helpful, some were around 40 min long introductory lectures that I feel could be condensed to 20 mins. Or I think it could also be great if Professor Bomford facilitated more activities during different class times, in the weeks before we headed to the Yale Farm. ",
            "\u00a0The course really requires students to take the task of engaging with the material seriously. Reading in depth is the only way to effectively participate in class discussions. That being said, the requirement of weekly reading responses encourages students in a helpful, non forced way and provides an opportunity for students's questions to be answered. A weakness of the course is that there is little instruction on how to do reading responses, which make up a large portion of a students assessed work. ",
            "\u00a0The course could have more structure other than just discussions everyday. ",
            "\u00a0I struggled at times to engage with the material of this course. I felt like i was lacking a background in environmental studies, economics, or hard sciences that would have given me a framework through which to interpret the sources that we read for homework. I would have appreciated more grounding in the subject before entering some of the high level conversations that largely consisted of critiquing ideologies that I did not always feel I had the best grasp on. That said, we were able to have some very good conversations about concepts like scale, place, and representation due to the level of discourse in the readings that we did. ",
            "\u00a0It takes a part a lot of ideas and really makes you think and question current systems ",
            "\u00a0The course was decent overall. The readings were a little bit disjointed and felt somewhat unrelated to the class. Professor Bomford was knowledgeable, but often dominated the discussion and did not give student enough time to contribute. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course has a lot of potential to provide an introduction to sustainable agricultural methods if the course had a different structure. First, although this was a seminar, Professor Bomford lectured for most of the class, leaving little room for student discussion. I found it strange that even though we had long discussions on Canvas, we were not able to have these kinds of discussion in the classroom. Oftentimes, the lectures consisted of loosely connected facts that did not facilitate discussion. While I think having an introductory lecture is helpful, I think the students who presented that week were able to provide a good introduction. My recommendation would be to assign the majority of class time to student discussion (not including the student presentation). \r\nSecond, the modules should be revised. In Module 1 and Module 2, I felt that the readings and discussions were very similar. For this reason, I think Module 1 could be covered in two weeks and Module 2 in two weeks. This would give more space to Module 3, which I felt was rushed through. Throughout the course (but particularly in Module 3), there should be more authors of color and women authors and articles about people of color and people. I think this would also provide more class time for students to discuss and brainstorm their final projects. We didn't really have time to share our work until the last class, which was a missed opportunity. \r\nIn the last class, Professor Bomford addressed that he wasn't trying to disorient us in the class and that we should look at these issues across different perspectives. I wished he had said this throughout the course, because I felt like the readings were making the class very cynical. I think considering a new structure for the modules will support a more critical and possibly optimistic perspective on these issues. ",
            "\u00a0One of the strengths of this course is the structure because it is very student driven and makes it so that the students have more of say in how the discussion goes. Professor Bomford is very involved with the class and he really cares about his students. A weakness is the length of the readings for each week. Some of the weeks readings were too long and I felt like I did not have the ability to fully go through them. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- students led lectures and were held accountable for readings. Farm visits, and creative syllabus that drew from a variety of perspectives\r\nWeakness- sometimes because students were facilitating discussion, less ground was covered or something  was not explored in depth to the extent it may have been with more teacher led supervision. Also readings were too hard to access for a few weeks ",
            "\u00a0This course promotes critical thinking and encourages dialogue between students. The lessons it imparts are applicable to most any academic discipline. Class time is loosely structure, which allows students to drive much of the discussion, but occasionally, more directed prompts would have been helpful to keep the discussion moving forward. The course readings could have incorporated authors from a greater diversity of cultures and disciplines. "

            "\u00a0Yes, this seminar on Food and Agriculture is relevant to every students lives and is not limited to people hoping to study 'advanced agricultural techniques.' Anyone interested in relationships of power between humans and environments would enjoy this class and learn a lot from it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because the subject matter is so crucial in this moment and there is no other course like this at Yale. If you are not ready to struggle with obscure theoretical texts once in a while, do not take this course. If you are looking for a hard science course, you are in the wrong place ",
            "\u00a0This is a very interesting class and you will learn a lot. It could be taught in a better manner. The feedback for grading could also be improved. If you have no problem with this, then take the course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student that has some familiarity with the topic. Although I did not always agree with the structuring of the class, it is something that I think could be really constructive for someone with a better background in food and agriculture studies than I have. The classes on the Yale Farm are also a great experience. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - as long as you are interested in the material ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Professor Bomford is a great teacher and he tried to present the material in a way that was more focused on the students than on him lecturing. I really liked going to the farm because it was a nice change from the typical classroom setting. I feel like I developed lots of skills at the farm and that we were learning topics in a more informal way. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student hoping to complicate their thinking about food systems. The class pushed me to hold myself accountable intellectually; my ideas about food systems were continually challenged and I was forced to settle some big questions about the nature of governance, policy, and academia as a whole. In short, this class is most helpful if you're looking to answer bigger, more abstract questions than smaller ones. "
