            "\u00a0Strengths - ??? None? \r\nWeaknesses - a lot, which I will discuss and pray that someone actually reads this review. There is NO REASON this class should be part of the graduate curriculum when half of the graduate students dont do imaging. Not ONE concept I learned this semester will ever be applicable in my research. I hated every moment of this class, and the professors wonder why some students never attend lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Strength- could be useful for students interested in medical imaging\r\nWeakness- sometimes hard to follow the contents. A lot of homework. ",
            "\u00a0Good content, lots of very interesting lecturers, but I wish there was a centralized set of resources to study from/learn. it seemed a little scattered since there wasn't a core text that took us through the whole course, and each lecturer had a different set of notes to go through. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures can be improved. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were divided into sections based upon the different module of imaging. The different professors teaching the sections were very knowledgeable about the subject. All of the assignments, exams, HWs, and the paper, were all designed to reinforce the concepts covered in the lectures. One weakness of the course was that the assignment deadlines outlined in the syllabus weren't always followed. Sometimes the problem sets would be posted late but the deadlines were also always extended accordingly. ",
            "\u00a0Course material is well organized. ",
            "\u00a0Some content of the course is very difficult for students like me who are from pure biology background without any experience in Bioimaging. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: This course covers a broad range of topics and introduces enough in each area that students have a jumping off point for researching these subjects in depth.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It's hard to figure out what is being asked on some of the homework/exam questions. Often the answers are simple, but deciphering the problem takes longer than it should. Or something's been typed incorrectly in the question and that needs to be sussed out. I don't think I understand of the methods covered well enough to use them. "

It may be worth searching through the syllabi of similar courses to make sure that this class contains the content you're hoping for. I heard that there are a number of other courses that cover medical imaging. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the assignments were very straightforward. Showing up to lecture helped clarify topics but all the lecture notes were posted online and easy to follow. The grading was also fair and the professors were very accessible. If you're curious about the science behind modern medical imaging techniques then this is the class for you. ",
