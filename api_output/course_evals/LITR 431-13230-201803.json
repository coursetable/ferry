            "\u00a0I gained a new way of understanding a decade: in terms of its \"languages\" and modes of expression. Seeing philosophy and theology as languages of a temporal moment alongside theater, film, and song is imaginative in the spirit of those times and led to critical discussion of the material and its legacies today. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me access to texts and material that I didn't know existed. We explored so much about Latin America that never gets taught in the U.S., and it was a completely different, more open atmosphere than in a lot of courses I've taken. I really appreciated this course because I learned a lot, including how to be more critical and analytical. ",
            "\u00a0Introduced to a lot of literature that is critical to understanding Latin American Thought. Developed my understanding of the politics of the region. ",
            "\u00a0-different perspectives on the power structures and problems in Latin America, and around the world\r\n-dissecting readings for important information\r\n-listening and learning from others ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about different Latin American movements, songs, and histories.\r\nOne highlight was learning about the theater of the oppressed, and thinking about the connection between protest/ liberation and artform. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the importance of reading about places and events from authors who have lived in those places and experienced those events. I learned to think critically about sources and about intended audiences and accessibility of publications. I was pushed to think about how we engage with material in a way that no other Yale course has pushed me. ",
            "\u00a0The readings were amazing, and the class environment helped us think through them critically. I learned how to engage with texts written in a different time period, and forge connections between the texts and contemporaneous social movements. ",
            "\u00a0In this class we did everything we could to deeply immerse ourselves in the spirit of the 1960s in Latin America. That means reading some of the texts that inspired revolutionary movements to form in that era, not just in Latin America but across the Third World. We also listened to and sang cannonical songs from the 60's that contributed to the growing feelings of anger and hope for revolution among the public in that era, and we watched films and practiced theatre exercises that emerged at the time too, all in the same vein. Through these multiple forms of engagement we were able to see and feel, for a moment, the incredible capacity that Latin America possessed (at least at the time) to generate ideas about what the world could look like that hadn't been imagined before how the state could be organized, how teachers could relate to their students, how the different social classes could be shuffled. ",
            "\u00a0It's difficult to describe everything I learned in this course as I am still processing much of what we discussed and debated throughout the semester. Broadly speaking, I gained greater knowledge of the period circa 1968 in Latin America with an eye to Latin American philosophy, literature, music, and historical works. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a tremendous amount about Latin American history and liberation philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0Everything. You learn everything in this course. Don't believe me? Take it and find out. "

            "\u00a0This course was great because it wasn't only taught in the style of a traditional lecture or seminar  that was only part of it  but we also engaged in theatre and singing, which is something I've never been exposed to here (unless you're specifically in a theatre or music course). I also liked that students were given the opportunity to present the readings and lead the discussions in class. The only thing I'd change would be to add some sort of system during discussions for when people talk because there were a few people who constantly dominated the discussion, which was a problem. ",
            "\u00a0Moira is a massive strength as she is probably the most committed teacher I have ever had. She will stay hours past the class' allotted time to make sure you understand a concept or got to say everything that you wanted to. The course could have been a bit more tightly organized in terms of facilitating discussions specifically about how the literature situates itself within Latin American history and not just liberation movements/social movements in general. That being said, the class attracts a certain kind of student and it could be a bit much sometimes in that they were often overbearing during class discussions and it felt uncomfortable for me personally to voice a differing opinion about contentious issues like class, immigration, etc which were essentially at the root of every discussion in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Stengths: size of class, discussions, and the texts/videos/music used \r\nWeaknesses: background knowledge on Latin America is assumed to follow discussions ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nMany passionate students and a very passionate professor\r\nA lot of interdisciplinary study\r\nProf generous with time and had us to her house and it was v fun\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nsomewhat performative environment,  felt people were trying to be the most radical person\r\nsomehow, despite conversations about it, a few students (and one in particular) were frequently dominating conversations in totally unnecessary ways\r\nclose reading not prioritized (doing readings becomes almost unnecessary?) ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are tied to the revolutionary knowledge and diverse learning material used throughout the semester such as readings, films, songs, and plays. \r\nThe weaknesses of this course mainly involved participation but where resolved later towards the end. ",
            "\u00a0This course was fantastic. The structure of each class day could probably be slightly modified to encourage more student input in discussion, but we worked through that together to some extent during the class. ",
            "\u00a0The course syllabus was incredible, I've read some of the best material that I've encountered in this class. I loved how we focused on cultural production in many forms, including song, film, and theater. I think the class organization could be improved, such as the way that discussions were led. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are hard to sum up in a response like this; mainly, the syllabus for this course is amazing, and Moira really makes sure that you have to engage with the material in more than one way (i.e. not just through reading texts but also watching films, doing theatre/improv exercises, singing and listening to music, etc.). We got up  and moved our bodies and made our voices sing in this class, which I've never experienced in any other class of this sort, and I think that's pretty cool. I'd say this course could be improved with more active guidance of our discussions of the texts in seminar; Moira has such a wealth of knowledge about Latin American history of this time period, and I think we all could benefit from maybe hearing mini lectures to contextualize each text before we read it, to put us on the same page. This is important because unfortunately we don't learn much Latin American history at all in school, and you really have to fight hard to learn it at Yale, and so I think many of us weren't sure how to engage with a few of the things we read because we didn't have the background knowledge necessary. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was wonderful and wouldn't have wanted to structure it any other way. I think that the texts themselves were thought provoking and challenging, and I am grateful to have been introduced to them. I would say that it might have been perhaps more productive for class discussion if we had only certain chapters or sections to read and prepare for discussion as we often did not get to many of the articles we'd been assigned for reading. ",
            "\u00a0I very much enjoyed all the content of this course. The level of engagement with and by my peers was astonishing, and it was a wonderful learning environment. At times I felt a little disadvantaged because I did not have the background in philosophy or Latin American history that many of the other students had, but on the whole, I learned a great deal. Also, having section and class the same day became a little overwhelming. At times, it was a little difficult to follow the structure of the course, but that was just a by product of the fact that we were curating our learning experience together. This class was the best learning environment I have encountered at Yale so far. Everyone was genuinely engaged and excited to be there. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The 50th anniversary of 1968 happens only once, but I do recommend a class with Professor Fradinger. The class and community that forms is unlike any I have experienced and really demonstrates what teaching and learning could be. ",
            "\u00a0I would 100% recommend this course! Students from all departments and majors took it and we all got something out of it. It opens your mind, lets you think from a different perspective, and teaches you a lot about Latin America from a Latin American perspective that never gets taught in the U.S. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - it is pretty essential in terms of the texts you read (Fanon, Freire, Kusch) and I DOUBT that many other courses at Yale will discuss these if any. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course and any course with Moira. She is an exceptional professor and the learning done in her class is not comparable to any other.  The content was amazing, as well as its delivery. ",
            "\u00a0Maybe, it depends -- if you're excited about interesting readings in Latin American revolutionary movements and culture, I'd say totally. I was a bit impatient because of the conversational environment but not everyone was. The readings were awesome and should be taught in more classes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I find that this history of the Left and of Latin America's history is crucial for any History, Latin American Studies, or Ethnicity, Race and Migration major, ",
            "\u00a0Yes THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST CLASSES IVE HAD AT YALE ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This was one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. My understanding of myself in the world was shaken for the better. I left feeling inspired and connected to my classmates in a way I haven't felt in any other class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It's definitely a unique experience but one of the few courses at Yale that you can read these materials and engage with them in an energetic classroom setting. ",
            "\u00a0I would 100% recommend this course to another student. Moira is an absolutely fantastic professor who deeply cares for her students and the texts you'll read together over the course of the semester. I would say that her style of teaching is purposefully different from many other professors at this university, so if you find yourself frustrated with the teaching style, I would urge you to lay back a bit and let go of the conditioning you've been subjected to at this university...The way you'll learn in this classroom is what some would describe as \"unconventional,\" but incredibly valuable nonetheless. Take this course if it's ever offered again! Take all of Moira's courses! ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would recommend this course. It became very clear that all my peers were interested, invested, and well informed regarding the subject matter, creating a great environment. I learned a great deal, and I very much appreciate the content we covered, from protest song, to film, to liberation theology. ",
            "\u00a0Pretty sure this class was a one off, but if it isn't, I would definitely recommend it. It is like no other course at Yale, and it introduces you to facets of theory and history seldom taught here. If this isn't taught again, I would highly recommend taking one of her other classes. "
