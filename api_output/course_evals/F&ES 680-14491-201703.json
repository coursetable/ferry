Maybe you could do another iteration of the first assignment before moving onto the second assignment. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe lectures were dry, mostly because the material was dry. Sitting in a U helped the dynamic considerably. I also would have liked more discussion moments.\r\n\r\nI appreciated the input of student presentations but they could have been structured better. I would have gotten more out presenting and out of watching other presentations if we had presented together: one set of summary slides (instead of 3), followed by an analysis of how each of us approached a project differently. Looking over spreadsheet models together to build that presentation would have enhanced my learning. ",
