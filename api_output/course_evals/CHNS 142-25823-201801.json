            "\u00a0I learned so much in this course! Before entering, I could not read or write Chinese at all, and now I have made so much progress. We have watched movies, had discussions about culture, learned more formal and difficult ways of expressing things, and practiced speaking/listening/writing/reading Chinese. ",

            "\u00a0I think this course is structured well - the professors are very kind and helpful, it meets every day, and we have a daily quiz that forces us to learn the characters.\r\n\r\nSometimes because the course is every day, the workload is quite demanding, but the professors are pretty understanding of that. Students often get tired in class, so perhaps if there were more fun activities that would be nice. We did watch some movies outside of class and take a field trip, but perhaps watching a fun movie at the end of the year, like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon or some movie like that, would be fun! ",
            "\u00a0It was pretty fast-paced, and we covered a lot of new material each week. Sometimes it felt like the amount of characters we were learning was overwhelming, so it was easy to forget what we learned during the previous week. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, if you have the time. This class is very time intensive. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course is very effective in improving students' Chinese skills. ",
