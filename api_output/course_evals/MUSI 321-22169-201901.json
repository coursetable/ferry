            "\u00a0Great class to take if you want to start getting a feel for composition. I started composing in 320, and while it was rough, I definitely learned a lot, so don't let not having previous experience deter you! ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me the skills and confidence to grow and develop as a composer. ",
            "\u00a0Developed my compositional ability & understanding of music theory ",
            "\u00a0This course allowed me to become a much better composer and feel more comfortable in general with the prospect of writing my own music, and it especially allowed me to think of writing music as a more collaborative endeavor between composer and performer, rather than always strictly thinking about composing. ",
            "\u00a0My composition chops, I'd like to say, were somewhat improved by the many hours spent practicing, and the Portfolio Projects pushed me into areas of jazz theory I otherwise wouldn't have ventured near  but perhaps the most important takeaway was a clearer knowledge of the music industry. What are professional composers like? How do they spend their days? What's film scoring like? Our dozen or so seminar discussions with industry composers provided an unrivaled glimpse into this world, supplied some fascinating stories (more than a few about the tyrannical demands of movie directors), and gave me a much clearer sense of if and how I might enter.

            "\u00a0The biggest strength of this course is definitely the weekly meetings with the TA's from the School of music. Also, the seminar format, where Yale brings renowned composers of various genres to speak about their work and their compositional process was invaluable. ",
            "\u00a0Because of the fairly independent nature of this course, a student who takes it will get out of it what they put into it. For me, this was probably the most rewarding class I've taken at Yale, as I loved the freedom to be able to compose my own piece, and the weekly feedback through composition lessons was invaluable. My only suggestion would be maybe introducing a bit more theory or technical music instruction into the course during lectures in which there are not guest composers. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength, hands down, is the opportunity to get credit for writing music. Before taking the seminar, I felt somewhat guilty pulling out my staff paper  it was procrastination! But now, with the reality of deadlines and homework, it's a mandate. I feel all the happier for it. You'll even get some feedback on compositions, though there's a high likelihood your instructors will create radically different sorts of music, and won't be able to offer anything but general comments. Most improvement in the discipline might be obtained through your own discipline.\r\nThe seminar part of the course, which occupies by far the vast majority of our once-a-week meetings, is irresistible. Where else do you get the chance to hear the composer behind James Bond talk about his craft? Their passion is itself a lesson, and many have quite relevant career tips (and leads) for those interested in joining the professional composers' guild. "

            "\u00a0This course was excellent all around. The partnership of Yale College with the School of Music is invaluable--I was able to bounce off ideas with an extremely gifted student of the School of Music, attended seminars featuring world-renowned composers, and was given the space and freedom to work on composition that mattered deeply to me. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who has an interest in composition and knows that they're going to be motivated enough to pursue a semester-long project. ",
            "\u00a0For the self-motivated composer, this course is a must take. It fits quite easily into even busy schedules  the nature of the passion is that you'll *make* time. You may be slightly overwhelmed by the sheer variety of musical styles in subscription, but buoyed by the community, the amazing guest composers, and the happy recognition that underlying all music is some common language.
