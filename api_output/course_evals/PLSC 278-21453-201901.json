            "\u00a0Some quantitative methods in social science, and reading/summarizing long case briefs ",
            "\u00a0The course provides a profound examination of theories of judicial decision-making. It also invites students to evaluate the strength of various research designs. ",
            "\u00a0A deeper understanding of the empirical and current political science understanding of the Supreme Court. ",
            "\u00a0The course gives a great overview of the Supreme Court's decision-making process through the lens of political science and strategic interactions. The readings for the class can be dense at times, but they cohere into the theme of the class. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting way to look at the intersection between politics and the SC. The course is not very theoretical and based on different models and actual political science which can get boring. Somewhat redundant towards the end. ",
            "\u00a0This class really allowed to me think deeply about the political aspect of the branch of government we think of as the least partisan. Really fascinating class with great readings and conversations. ",
            "\u00a0This course deepened my understanding of what motivates justices to make the decision they do. Perhaps, more importantly, it exposed me to rigorous empirical political science studies for largely the first time. "

        [
            "\u00a0Great reading list. Sometimes discussions were a bit circular. ",
            "\u00a0The course is designed to invite student involvement. The approach is systematic, well-organized, and interesting. At times, the readings require great political science understanding. ",
            "\u00a0This class is well organized and structured, though the discussions in class sometimes seemed to just be repeating the same thing over and over again until there really wasn't anything more to say. Overall, though, Professor Rader was excellent and the material she selected for the syllabus was engaging and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0As someone who didn't have a lot of experience with statistics, it would have been great to have a primer on the research design and methodologies of the journal articles we had read in class. ",
            "\u00a0I wish there were more case studies. ",
            "\u00a0The course I think was great but could have incorporated more varied readings to enliven class discussion further. ",
            "\u00a0This course has no weaknesses! The assignments were very well distributed with just the right amount of freedom for creativity and personal interests, while still allowing us to engage with and apply the course materials in conjunction with our own research. ",
            "\u00a0The course does a very thorough dive onto a relatively specific subject - the political science surrounding the Supreme Court. This comes with pros and cons. On the one hand you learn a lot about so many facets of what might influence judges and how judges influence policy. On the other hand, the readings were often very dense, complicated, and filled with complex numerical figures making them difficult to understand. To improve the course, I would suggest spending a little more time helping students develop stronger reading comprehension skills for these studies. "

            "\u00a0Yes, if you are willing to read a lot of political science scholarship rather than just narrative/normative texts ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course to students interested in judicial decision-making on the Supreme Court. A little background knowledge in the Court would be useful. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend if you are interested in learning more about how the Supreme Court is understood through the lens of political science. If you are looking to learn more about court doctrines or constitutional law, this is not the class. We focused primarily on empirical explanations of the Court's behavior and interactions with other parts of the political system. Not the most engaging class and sometimes discussions seemed to drag on, but nevertheless a solid class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes this is a fantastic course that really delves deep into the nature of politics within the U.S. Supreme Court System. Professor Rader is very knowledgeable about the material and explains it well to facilitate student learning. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend the class to those who are interested in political science and politics as a whole. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely!! A must-take class! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student who has a strong interest in the Supreme Court and is willing to delve into often complicated readings to satiate that interest. ",
            "\u00a0While I did find this class interesting, I am much more interested in the content of supreme court cases and analyses than in models of the Supreme Court. If you are someone who is interested in looking at overall trends of the Court and efforts to model/quantify them, this is a good class for you. If you are more interested in the reasoning behind individual decisions, this is probably not the best class. "
