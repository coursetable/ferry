            "\u00a0The course gave me a good grasp of the main theoretical debates in the theory of mind literature!  I feel like I'm equipped to actually talk about different experiments and issues outside of the class in a comprehensive way. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about an extremely broad range of topics relating to a contemporary debate that's really exciting because a lot of past theories seem to be in question and a lot of new exciting theories are cropping up. We also spent a lot of time putting past theories into their social and cultural context, which  I've never done in a  class before on any  level and it was extremely valuable. It helped a lot to think about what sorts of moments, theories, commitments, and fads might be impacting our work and how we think about it. ",
            "\u00a0Critical reading and thinking, thinking about primary research within a sociological and historical lens ",
            "\u00a0While I've been familiar with parts of the theory of mind literature for some time, this course was a deep-dive. I learned much from the readings and from class discussion--much of which has benefitted the way I think about my own research. At the skill level, I learned to digest papers faster (which, as Laurie noted at the start of the semester, is an extremely important skill), and to think about findings as the cut across disciplinary and methodological lines. ",
            "\u00a0I feel like I really, really know the theory of mind literature now. I also learned a lot about the following topics: \r\n~simulation theory\r\n~theory theory \r\n~Grice's maxims ",
            "\u00a0This course was instrumental for me in  developing a rich understanding of theory of mind as well as new research ideas on the topic. ",
            "\u00a0The course gave me a broad survey of theory of mind literature - considerably wider than I would have read on my own, and a great selection of readings. It gave me an access point to primate research, and insight into the history of the subfield that was helpful in understanding researchers motivations in the present. There were several interesting guest speakers as well "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Laurie was amazing in leading the discussion.  The class was well-structured, and the readings were well-chosen. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: putting studies into historical context, a lot of reading but it felt very useful and foundational, feedback and discussions were really great, guest  speakers were all really interesting and fun to talk with. \r\nWeaknesses: none, really. Only complaint is that there was a lot of reading but again, it felt like it was useful so i can't complain that much. ",
            "\u00a0I thought it was a great mix of new recent papers and key papers in the literature. I only wish that it met twice a week to help break up the discussion and readings. Sometimes it felt like we couldn't get through everything or had to quickly go over something because we only had one course period a week, and 2-5 papers. I also liked the guest speakers and thought they really added to the discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Interesting readings + discussion, good course structure (including an opportunity to do a research project), fantastic instructor + guest lectures\r\nWeaknesses: None ",
            "\u00a0This course was excellent! My only criticism is that it was really hard to keep up with the reading--there was A LOT of it. ",
            "\u00a0This course had excellent readings and the assignments were quite useful in connecting the course material with my own research interests. ",
            "\u00a0A strength was that Laurie chose readings relevant to the students in the class and left the syllabus flexible for the same reasons. Also, it was beneficial when Laurie occasionally redirected conversation or summarized what people had said, especially when the comment may have gone astray. Laurie's integration of primate and animal research was a unique perspective in this field I had not yet considered and I think that, because it was outside of so many of the students' area of expertise, was a novel and interesting perspective to be brought to the discussion. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the \"historical perspective\" Laurie offered. I also was really grateful for her feedback on my reading responses. The reading responses offer an opportunity to synthesize the readings and think about them on my own, and feedback on my writing is, I think, especially effective for me because I'm more confident I was able to convey a whole idea sufficiently carefully. Laurie's feedback usually seemed very positive, which I appreciated, but I'd have been perfectly happy to have more critical comments as well - constructive, of course, but seeing what someone's broad-stroke reaction to an idea is helps me develop my own intuitions about what has potential and what doesn't.\r\n\r\nDuring the class itself, I appreciated Laurie's leading the discussion, but in this class as with almost every class I've taken at the graduate level, I'm in favor of more decentralized discussion. Professors' expertise is a fantastic resource, but if nearly every student comment is followed by a comment or response from a professor, it's not exactly a \"discussion\" as much as question and answer session. That can of course be helpful, but with 10 other very smart people who have just read a bunch of material on a topic curated by an expert, I find it helpful to hear back-and-forth between the other 10 people. It's hard to get that going when every comment is filtered through the professor. Again, that's not about Laurie at all - it's just something that I see as a way to improve seminar courses. "

            "\u00a0Yes!  If you're interested in theory of mind, but even developmental / comparative psychology, you should take the class.  Laurie was also very interdisciplinary -- bringing in cognitive psychology and philosophy to inform a lot of our discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Especially if they're interested in the topic, but Professor Santos was great to work with and learn from, and putting things in historical context was a valuable exercise I think any grad student would find useful no matter what their work was on. And we were engaged to connect this topic to our own work. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Laurie is amazing and the course readings were thorough, diverse, and interesting. I also think it would be really useful for all graduate students in the department to practice thinking about the context of each paper (like we did in the course) before discussing it. ",
            "\u00a0Though it definitely takes a bit of work, I got a lot out of this course. Would absolutely recommend. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely!! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely - it's a great overview of theory of mind, and the final project is a great way to orient students towards applying the readings. "
