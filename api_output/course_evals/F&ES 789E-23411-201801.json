            "\u00a0An incredible course that makes you personally reflect on your place in the universe. All FES students should take this course - I believe anyone coming out of this course will be better equipped to handle environmental issues in the future because they will have a larger personal stake in the interconnectedness of the Earth and universe. One of the best courses I've taken at FES. ",
            "\u00a0Re-orient myself within the wider web of matter and happenings. It brought me a sense of self of my purpose for being here at FES--and that is to improve myself through changing my ideologies, and in doing this, I now feel more prepared to take on the challenges we all will face in the next century. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting discussions.\r\nInteresting to meet other people in the room. ",
            "\u00a0This course imparted an incredibly comprehensive overarching way for thinking about the intersections of science, cosmology, ecology, community, and faith. I will very much operate differently on account of the insights this course provided. ",
            "\u00a0This class was overwhelming in the effect it had on my daily life. Completely reshaped how I interact with people, life, and matter around me. Connected me with a new sense of wonder, gratitude, and spirituality. ",
            "\u00a0A creative and profound perspective to understand the whole universe and all the evolutionary history with all our knowledge, combining religions and science. ",
            "\u00a0It was wonderful to learn about the universe from both scientific and spiritual lens at the same time. ",
            "\u00a0This course should be required for students at FES. It prompts us to think about the world that we've inherited, and cosmic evolution as a creative process based on connection, interdependence, and emergence. We examined a range of dynamic interactions and interdependencies in the emergence of galaxies, Earth, life, and human communities, and thought through how this influences our current moment and the work that we are doing.
