I would also recommend cultivating more discussion early in the semester, and even doing part of the class without laptops before diving into the labs. More collaborative coding would also be welcome. ",

            "\u00a0Amazing professor with a contagious passion for the subject. Neat, interesting lab exercises. It was fun to uncover insights on bias in text through the final exam. The only improvement I can think of is for canvas links to be posted early for homework submissions. "
