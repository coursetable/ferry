            "\u00a0This wonderful course imparts a unique perspective on what history is, fundamentally. You'll learn that history  by which I mean the collective entity of historical actors  is, in part, a product of environmental conditions. The connection will be made clear through concrete examples in modern Latin American history. In a symbiotic parallelism, you'll also study how the environment is ultimately a social construction, through the lens of droughts, hurricanes, earthquakes and other environmental disasters in the nineteenth and twentieth century. In concert with the latter idea is the way that states and civilizations have altered their natural environment, through hydroelectric works, deforestation, and water works. But the history that is studied is anything but exclusive to the modern era; this is just the time period whose environmental history is best studied. Much of the history discussed in the course is placed in the perspective of the longue duree. If you're at all interested in environmental history take this course: it's required reading. ",
            "\u00a0I came into this class with an interest in Latin America and environmentalism, but I did not know anything about the intersection of the two. This class helped me to become more aware of global trends in politics and the environment, as well as educate me about the importance of history of science and medicine in non US and European countries. ",
            "\u00a0The ability to analyze Latin America critically. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me an overview of the political, economic, social, and environmental histories of various countries in Latin America in the last century or so. I learned a ton about the socio-political trends in these areas, as well as the different ways in which we can analyze their histories. I really enjoyed getting insight from our professor on how we use different lenses to look at history. I also learned how to become a closer reader, a better analyzer, and a stronger researcher. ",

            "\u00a0The course is organized by topic, rather than chronology or local geography: examples are drawn from roughly the past two hundred years, and each example serves to expose the interaction between humans and their environment. This is a strength of the course: it takes a long perspective on the subject matter. Environmental history, in this perspective, seeks to uncover a much more fundamental truth about the way humans, regardless of their time period or immediate historical conditions, relate to their environment. Of course, in our analysis, the immediate social, political, and economic conditions in each individual case are still considered. What stands out, then, are the commonalities and interrelations between drastically different and distinct situations. It's a cool and liberating perspective on the subject of history. The final paper project is another strength of the course, allowing you to focus in on a specific area of investigation and \"become and expert\" in a particular example of historical-environmental interaction. ",
            "\u00a0This course had really engaging content and conversation, its main strength was learning about a wide variety of themes that all tie together in some way. This course could be improved if the readings were a bit shorter and discussion questions were sent out before class so everyone could know what to focus on in the readings. ",
            "\u00a0Not very organized. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Ragas was wonderful--total strength of this course. He was very intelligent, understanding, funny, humble, and totally willing to shape the course in new ways just so that it would best suit our learning needs and desires. We learned so much from him about how to learn about Latin American history, the ways in which we can look at those histories, and how to be a strong researcher.\r\n\r\nI felt like the course had a solid level of organization and the level of work / grading was fair, but I do wish that we could have had a bit more structure with how we treated the readings. We always seemed to discuss the topic more than about the readings themselves, and the readings were usually fairly dense. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were the power of conversation and understanding various points of view in terms of histor and the environment. Weakenesses were repetitive seminar discussions, would have liked to see other engagement activities. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the content of the class was very valuable, but the structure of the class could be improved on a little bit. For example, we had to read a new unit every weekend to prepare for discussions on Monday and Wednesday. The four essays required for the class were due before discussions but had to be about the new unit. I thought that this set-up made it really challenging for me to construct a well-written essay due to the time constraints. However, this was not a huge problem and could simply reflect my own writing inadequacies. \r\nWhile each unit was extremely interesting and informative, I thought that some could use more background. For example, I was slightly lost when we read about Mexican reforms and Brazilian droughts because I did not know enough about their historical and political backgrounds. If a generalized overview of the history of each country was introduced before we talked about specific issues, I would have absorbed even more information. \r\nI also would have liked more feedback on my writing. Since this was a freshman seminar, I thought that learning how to do better research and write better papers was also a perk of the class, but I did not grow in those areas as much as I hoped to. \r\nHowever, overall this was a great class and I definitely looked forward to our new units every week. This is an important class to offer to students because I had never learnt that much about Latin America in high school, and I think Yale classes do not usually focus on that area either. "

            "\u00a0Yes, I certainly do recommend this course, for any individuals interested in environmental history or the history of Latin America. There is really no prerequisite. Don't be afraid if you've never studied any Latin American history before; you'll learn what you need to know as you go. And if you've never studied environmental history, come to this seminar to gain a new perspective. The seminar is really an excellent introduction to the environmental perspective on history and to some portions of Latin American history. It should be clear, however, that this is not some broad survey course on Latin American history. It is not a traditional or sequential description of the history of the continent during a specific period. It is driven and unified by the common topic, namely, how humans have related to their environmental conditions. The history is used to explain and provide context for these relations. The history is these relations. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class, it was an interesting introduction to the intersection of politics and environmental issues in Latin America. It was nice to hear about research being done in a non-European context. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course! Professor Ragas is absolutely wonderful, and he has so much expertise in this region--as he is from Peru and has studied Latin America extensively--that you gain a ton of insight into each topic that the course discusses. He always shares his wisdom on how we can interpret histories in different ways, and how we can become stronger researchers. I found myself laughing and learning each class, which was really special to me. I really looked forward to every session that we met and felt that Professor Ragas went out of his way to make sure that the class was working for all of us. He was very flexible and understanding but still held reasonably high expectations. It is incredibly interesting to learn about Latin America, since that is a region which American courses typically do not focus on, and to pair that with environmental studies was just wonderful. I loved this class and will really miss Professor Ragas in future years. ",
