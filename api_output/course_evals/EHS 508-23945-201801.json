Forestry students generally don't have classes on Fridays, so I think that Friday labs might discourage their enrollment, if that matters.\r\n\r\nThe taking of attendance felt not great.  I'm more pro people doing what they need to learn, not being forced to come to class if it's not useful. ",

This would include the types of instruments to use in different situations, how to use them, and the appropriateness of each. I know we covered this briefly in class, but I think it might be useful to go a little more in depth. \r\n\r\nI would also like to see more hands on work in general. Move it from a full lecture to more opportunities for student engagement. ",
