            "\u00a0This course is engaging when conceptual, but the computational side of the course involves tedious proofs. ",
            "\u00a0This course was poorly organized and I felt that I didnt have the resources to do well.  I wasnt sure what material we were supposed to be learning.  We also didnt receive enough feedback; for example, we didnt receive graded problem sets in time to use them to study for exams. ",
            "\u00a0This course covers some really interesting topics, but I found Prof. Fedorov's lecturing lacking sometimes. Oftentimes he would just describe graphs on the or derive equations instead of spending more time on application and really physical concepts. ",
            "\u00a0The problem sets involved a lot of guessing in terms of what assumptions to make, what math we had to use. Would have been useful to have more office hours/study hall in the day or two before the psets were due. (Sometimes the office hours would be right after they were due.) The second half of the course was based in printed notes that detailed a lot of complicated derivations. It would have been helpful to focus less on the derivations and more on the implications of the results. I did not think I had a good understanding of the physical meaning of the results because we did not talk about them enough to begin to understand (particularly about topics like potential vorticity). Also, a problem set required Matlab even though it was not a prerequisite. "

            "\u00a0This course seems to only be accessible for G&G majors, and some physics or applied math majors. If that is the case, I recommend taking this course as an elective. ",
