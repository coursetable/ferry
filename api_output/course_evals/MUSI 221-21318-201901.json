            "\u00a0This is a wonderful course! The only way to improve it would be having consistently scheduled coachings-- I've had previous semesters where I would have two coachings in a weekend and then the same thing would happen two weeks later. I know we have to adjust to the coaches' schedules when they travel, but it's much better/fairer when all the groups get them every week. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are in the coachings by the wonderful musicians that help teach this class, who really help you in any way possible to form a good sound as a group and to really work through a piece during the semester. I think programming could be improved - there is so much chamber music out there, but I think it would be much more interesting and a much DIFFERENT challenge to learn a chamber piece that is performed less standardly. This is not to say that standard rep should not be given, but I would like to see the course be open-minded towards considering other pieces as the classical music sphere becomes increasingly open-minded as well. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course with excellent teachers. My complaints are: Sudler is a little dark, it made me tired. Also, it would be great if this class gave a Humanities credit... The Performance of Vocal Music does, so why doesn't chamber? ",
            "\u00a0This course is fantastic! I am so thankful for my chamber group! ",
            "\u00a0This course is very well-structured and ensures that every group has enough rehearsal and coaching time to be adequately prepared at the final concert. The coaches are excellent, and group members are generally matched very well. My one suggestion is that some sort of pre-scheduling for studio classes be organized - it seems like we either have too few groups perform to fill the time, or (more often) too many. One could argue that setting a schedule might result in under-prepared performances in some classes if a group hasn't been given adequate rehearsal time ahead of time, but it could also serve as a good checkpoint to keep each group on track in learning their pieces at a good rate. ",
            "\u00a0I really like the structure of the course! It works really well given our busy schedules  we can still get a lot done, but it's flexible. I appreciate the opportunities to perform in studio class and hear what our classmates, in addition to course faculty, have to say about our playing. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student that loves to perform chamber music and learn from wonderful coaches/musicians. If you are okay with learning more standard chamber repertoire (Beethoven, Shostakovich, Brahms, Dvorak) I would recommend this course, but otherwise, be wary that more \"untraditional\" works will not be performed.
