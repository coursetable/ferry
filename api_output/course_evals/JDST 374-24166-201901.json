            "\u00a0A very detailed investigation of Jewish magic and its practitioners, from antiquity to modern time. I developed my critical thinking skills from analyzing and evaluating theories, proposals, and speculations of scholars in the field. Jewish magic is a young field of study, and I'm glad to have received an introduction to the approaches and methods of the subject. ",
            "\u00a0This class was focussed mainly on Jewish magic according to chronological organization. We did spend the first couple weeks setting up a framework for the understanding of magic through an anthropological/cultural lens. However, the knowledge developed in the rest of the course was much less about understanding magic conceptually (in general or in Jewish life), and more focussed on developing a broad familiarity with the history, texts, and artifacts of Jewish magic that are known to us. Most of the readings were papers that had been published on specific items of Jewish magic (manuscripts, incantation bowls, amulets, etc.) or else surveys of some broad aspect of Jewish magic (the influence of Islam, the importance of texts from the Cairo Genizah, textual parallels between manuscripts as a phenomenon, etc.). In class, Alessia would usually bring in other examples related to the readings, and then we would discuss the readings in the remaining time. She also often had class at the Beinecke or other cool places where she could actually present real examples of things related to the readings for the week. Because the class moved chronologically, I would say that it was less focussed on the role of Jewish magic in various societies, and more focussed on the transmission and continuous themes as well as development of various aspects of Jewish magic. If you are familiar with Hebrew and Aramaic, Alessia can also help you develop research skills so you can work on original manuscripts that Yale has! If you aren't, then you still have a lot of leeway to design your own research. The knowledge developed in this course is definitely aided by some familiarity with Judaism, but Alessia goes out of her way to make sure references are explained and everything is done in translation. Ultimately, you leave the class with a broad knowledge of the mediums, contents, history, and uses of magic by Jews across historical time periods. ",
            "\u00a0I learned an insane amount about the subject, and also just a greater understanding of ancient eras as I haven't really gotten to study ancient history since sixth grade -- obviously it was a different experience. ",
            "\u00a0I learned quite a bit about studying magical texts today and how these can be interpreted to learn about society at the time. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The course can be classified as a \"leminar\" -- about 70% lecturing and 30% discussion. We got to see very cool manuscripts and objects in the Beinecke, Medical Historical library, and the Babylonian collection. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths-Alessia is incredibly thorough in her feedback and incredibly generous with her time! She is so willing to help and gives incredibly detailed feedback on reading responses as well as the final paper. She also is ridiculously willing to spend time helping with research. The courses is also well-organized in terms of chronology. Also, she does such a great job of presenting actual artifacts and manuscripts of Jewish magic, which really brings the class to life. I also appreciated that she presented new sources in class, and kept things interesting by having us present on topics of our choice. Weaknesses-I think the class could have been a bit stronger on theory. Magic is a fascinating topic but we spend a lot of time looking at specific artifacts of magic and reading about textual lineages/translations of specific sources, and very little time on magic as a phenomenon/how it functions socially. Also, the readings often felt long, and could be a bit dry. There were often multiple articles assigned which contained a lot of translations and annotations of sources without too much colorful argument to augment them. It would have been nice to have a bit more diverse readings, looking at magic in other religions and also maybe some theory as well some ethnography on how magic currently functions in Jewish communities and in other cultures. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: subject matter, professor, use of amazing resources at the university, organization\r\nweaknesses: exclusion of some central subjects like the golem ",
            "\u00a0There is a lot of interesting information that is reviewed; however, I wish there had been more time for discussion. I also wish that discussion had been more directed, as often students would fixate on what they found interesting or could easily understand, so I never felt like I was getting all of the information I needed to out of the texts. However, it was really nice to explore all of the different Yale libraries and look at the artifacts themselves as often as we did. "

            "\u00a0It's a pleasure to learn with professor Bellusci. Jewish magic is a fascinating study, and this class really delivers a huge amount of exposure to the subject. It's not too much work, and there was never a dull moment. But if you're just looking for a fun class, this may not be the best for you because the materials really require lots of critical thinking and reasoning. If you have some background in any magical studies, Judaic studies, anthropology/history, then you may find this course easier and more familiar. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, and it definitely depends what you're looking for. For students who are interested in magic, this class will obviously be great. For those interested in Judaism, I wouldn't take it for a general introduction to Judaism. But you definitely don't need any background to take the class. For those raised Jewish, it is fascinating to encounter an aspect of religion and Judaism that might seem foreign to the experiences of most Jews at Yale. It also provides an interesting framework and vocabulary to reevaluate the things you thought you already knew about Judaism. If you hate readings that can feel repetitive, it might be a bit of a slog. But I did all the readings, and I'm sure other people will take the class and read more selectively. Overall, a very cool and unique class! ",
            "\u00a0yes!!!!!!! Love this course!!!! Even if you're not Judaic Studies. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student if they were interested in the subject matter. "
