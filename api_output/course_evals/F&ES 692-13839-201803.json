            "\u00a0I gained knowledge about practical application of agroforestry, beyond typical academic papers. I gained insights into how to create a management proposal for a client regarding their needs for agroforestry. ",
            "\u00a0Unfortunately, I think this course was a textbook course. I could have bought a temperate agroforestry textbook and got the same information in a two-week time span. I did not learn anything new. I was incredibly excited for this course offering, but when it was said and done - I regret taking this course. The same material is taught in Silviculture in a two-hour time span. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about various types of temperate agroforesty practices in terms of 1) how they are defined, implemented, and managed, 2) the benefits and limitations of each practice, including social, environmental and economic aspects, and 3) what natural and social science research exists for each practice and the shortcomings or gaps in that research. Overall, I learned that agroforestry has great potential to alleviate some of the environmental and social problems of modern agriculture, but that its implementation and benefits are very context dependent. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about the five practices of agroforestry.\r\nLearned both the science behind the practices, and the practical challenges and implications of actually implementing those practices in the real world. ",
            "\u00a0Both a philosophical and practical understanding of agroforestry. ",
            "\u00a0I learned new information on tapping for maple sugar, silvopasture, and other agroforestry techniques for land management from irrigation to tree selection. "

        [
            "\u00a0They aligned with what I was expecting given the course syllabus. ",
            "\u00a0Not at all. A comment was made by the professor that as Yale students we needed to hit some high caliber of excellence. Whether or not it was a joke, the teaching of this course didn't hit the high caliber of Yale excellence. ",
            "\u00a0I took this course because it seemed solution- and management-oriented. In that sense, the course fully aligned with my expectations. It exceeded my expectations in how well it integrated social and natural sciences and explored each topic critically and in depth. ",
            "\u00a0I expected to learn about agroforestry, which I've never learned about before, and the class met those expectations. ",
            "\u00a0Almost perfectly. I felt that Joe brought us from the most basic fundamentals onto the more technical at a great pace. Very thoughtful syllabus. He seems perfectly aware of how much a student knows who knows nothing about the topic, something often lost on professors who've been in their field too long. He knows what questions we'll be asking, and strikes an excellent balance of social/technical science integration. ",
            "\u00a0They aligned pretty well. Given that many of the subjects from week to week were topics I had limited knowledge of, the course met my expectations of expanding my foundational knowledge of agroforestry practices with a focus on realism and practicality. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Strengths of this course were definitely the field trips and hearing Joe speak about the work that he had done personally to implement agroforestry practices. As a smaller course, it was easier to talk more frankly about what was being done currently in the field and have discussions in a comfortable environment. The reading load at the beginning of the semester was too high, but was addressed following the mid-semester evaluations. ",
            "\u00a0This course needs to be lecture-based. Orefice needs to sit down with another professor and go over the logical schedule of what this course needs to incorporate. It was a hodge-podge of silvopasture here and there, two weeks on definitions, four weeks on, basically, what is silvopasture, and a week on historical background on agriculture. It was messy. How can it be improved? Get rid of the agricultural history section - if agricultural history is going to be mentioned, do it in 30 minutes. We all have some agriculture background - we don't need to sit through. Incorporate traditional knowledge of agroforestry techniques - this is important! We BARELY mentioned Native Americans and the techniques they used, but we focused on current, mostly white, farmers and their proposed DEFINITIONS of agroforestry. I think in general, Orefice should consider revamping the Powerpoints and his talking points. This course could be ASTOUNDING and it's lackluster right now. ",
            "\u00a0I like that this course gets into the technical and practical aspects of agroforestry, while maintaining a focus on the big picture. This is a difficult balance to achieve! I also felt that the tests were well designed for evaluating student progress (even it it was sometimes hard to know which details to include in the answers), and that the final project helped me apply what I had learned in a particular context. The lectures were all engaging and well organized. Most of the readings were interesting and useful, especially the social science studies. The technical readings sometimes provided too much detail. A few changes to the course would make the course even better: 1) skip the lectures on the history of agriculture and problems with modern agriculture since this material is not entirely relevant and is covered in other FES courses--that said, the history of agriculture in the Northeast provided great context for other lectures, 2) try to find field trip locations that are close by and don't take an entire day, except for the weekend trip to the Adirondacks, 3) on the weekend trip, give students a little time to regroup before dinner, 4) present technical material in lecture and make the associated readings recommended, and 5) make primary literature readings required and discuss some of them in class. ",
            "\u00a0Major strength of the course is that Joe definitely has the academic acumen - conducting well-thought-out studies, writing clear papers, getting published - AND can share the practical side of actually implementing some of the outcomes from other studies. \r\n\r\nA weakness is that there is too much of a focus on silvopasture, but this is understandable as that's the instructor's personal passion and expertise. However, I hope in future classes it gives a more balanced approach to agroforestry. ",
            "\u00a0I think it could be improved only on a very small scale. For instance, he could assign slightly less reading. But, he did do this after the mid-term evaluations and assigned the right amount of reading, so this change is already in effect. There were several classes where Joe aimed to give very particular examples of farming techniques i.e. giving numbers and statistics on practices like timing and quantities of forage. Students tended to enjoy that. ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Orefice lectured best on the materials he was most comfortable with: tapping for maple sugar and silvopasture. Early lectures on the history of agriculture and industrial agriculture fell a bit flat. The field trips seemed like a huge bonus for the course, putting lecture material into the real world. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Go on as many field trips as you can! They may be long, but they are definitely worth it. ",
            "\u00a0Read the articles and the texts, go to lecture - you'll be fine. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course for anyone interested in agriculture and/or forestry who wants to gain practical knowledge and skills. You'll also get to learn from the regional expert in silvopasture! ",
            "\u00a0Take this if you have any questions at all about agroforestry - even if you have no idea what that is.\r\n\r\nTake this if you want to learn a bit about trees, but from the agricultural side of it. ",
            "\u00a0This class covers many topics. Understand that you will gain a basic understanding of many topics, and you will not become an agroforester. I do not think that becoming an agroforester is a good expectation, but it is one that some students seem to have had, but this is the classroom. If you expect to learn about agroforestry as a study, it is fantastic. Also, invest in Joe. You can do as much work as you would like to, and Joe is available to push you if you care to push. "
