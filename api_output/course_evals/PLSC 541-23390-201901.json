            "\u00a0This course helped guide me through a year-long research project. Though it did not result in a publication-ready paper, it did plant a seed that will become my prospectus. More than anything, though, it taught me about the challenges of doing practical research. "

            "\u00a0The structure of the class generally works well in guiding us through the year. Feedback is often useful, and the deadlines are helpful. \r\nI think I would probably hold a meeting at the beginning of the summer before the class, to insist on the need to start thinking of the project during the summer (a lot of us wasted too much time figuring out the research question and picking an advisor at the beginning of the semester). \r\nI would also probably put more opportunities for feedback during the year. Not necessarily based on a paper (it's time consuming to read a paper, and papers are usually not very good at this stage), but scheduling more presentations during the year (at least one at the beginning of the spring semester) could be very useful. ",
            "\u00a0The course could have benefitted from more early-stage feedback. ",
            "\u00a0At least one or two class sessions in the spring to discuss presentational skills, etc. ",
            "\u00a0I think the main strength is the freedom the class affords.  I think the main weakness was the structure.  In my opinion, both the fall and spring terms could have had more structure, and this structure would have made the course more valuable.  Covering \"basic\" things, like \"what makes a good intro,\" \"how to write an effective literature review,\" etc. would have certainly benefited at least myself.  Perhaps the course could cover these topics, then give people say a month to write a certain section (like the intro) and collaboratively give feedback.  I think this structure would be great. ",
            "\u00a0Unclear guidelines, moving targets. I wish I had been given more guidance as to what was expected and how my plans might or might not be feasible in the given timeline. ",
            "\u00a0There need to be meetings in the spring semester. I felt really lost with how to proceed with my project. ",
            "\u00a0The course was a bit uneven. The first semester had more structure. While I appreciated having greater freedom to work on my project in the second semester, it also became very difficult to budget time for it and was something I could only work on sporadically, which was frustrating. Some more deadlines -- possibly breaking the project into smaller pieces, like a literature review, a theory section, etc. -- may have been valuable. "
