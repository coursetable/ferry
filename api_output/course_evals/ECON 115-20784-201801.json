Sometimes the professor will be behind in the course material, and you will end up doing a pset on material you have never learned.

I never received a single actionable piece of feedback on my problem sets - only question marks, like those were supposed to magically help me understand concepts. I often felt in sections like TFs were unprepared to teach the subject material - several times, after members of the class asked questions, they adjusted their answers to the problem set that were doing wrote on the board. Only saving grace was Eoin McGuirk - energetic and clear, if a little prone to overexplanation. ",
            "\u00a0The fact that this course fails to address the calculus background of economics does it a disservice by removing it from a logical, connected system and instead teaching it as disparate parts accessible through memorization. Also, the lecture addressed the conceptual parts while the PSETS addressed the mathematical parts, creating a disconnect, once again dividing the course into separate chunks. I think it would serve every student MUCH better if the math was taught more effectively in lecture, and the PSETS strove to strike a balance between concept and math more. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly, this class was VERY, VERY frustrating. As someone who'd never taken economics before, I knew I was in for a tough time. But COME ON! This was probably one of the most irritating academic experiences I've ever had. Meeting two times a week for 1 hour and 15 minutes was inadequate. The structure of this course was NOT conducive to student learning. We learn the most basic form of whatever we're studying in lecture, and then we're asked to apply that information to extremely difficult problems. We hardly ever do numerical examples in lecture. Although we do them in section, having a base-level example from the lecture itself would've made a HUGE difference (in my opinion). We're also expected to rely on out-of-class resources and example problems from previous years. Sure, it was helpful having old problem sets, exams, and section materials to use. However, it's too easy to turn to example problems for help when you get stuck on problem sets instead of working through them. I just don't think this class was structured in a way that would maximize students learning and success. "

If you have a lighter semester, however, I would try to get into Tolga Koker's section of 110, because you get better teaching (but a slightly heavier workload, and lectures are required). ",
            "\u00a0Only if they really need a QR credit or are interested in Econ. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course because I feel like it could have been taught better. ",
            "\u00a0No. The theory is boring and (with a few exceptions) almost self-explanatory. Section is extraordinarily boring and nearly useless. TFs comments on PSETs are also useless (I never received feedback on what went wrong in my problem sets -- just question marks next to places I went wrong.) Saving grace of this course is Eoin McGuirk, who is an engaging and fun lecturer and TF. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Everyone should learn Econ basics and this is a great way to do it. ",
            "\u00a0If they are interested in Economics or market forces more generally, this is the place to start. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it if you are naturally very interested in microeconomics. If not, it's really difficult to get engaged and do well. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if they want to understand if they like economics, then they should take this course to figure it out. ",
            "\u00a0Only if they are majoring in economics or EPE; it is one of the least interesting courses offered at Yale and is not a fun QR for a non-STEM major or a fun SC credit for a non-social sciences major. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It is a great introduction to economics. ",
            "\u00a0I think this class was helpful for getting a taste of economics but I personally did not enjoy the subject. ",
            "\u00a0Boring. Do not take. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this class teaches pretty simple things which help you think about the world in a different way.  Especially if you're comfortable with quantitative reasoning, the psets are all very straightforward, very relevant for the tests, and pretty fun to do.  Review your notes after class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think in material, this was a great class to take. I think that the lecture wasn't very engaging so in that respect I might urge them to take the seminar. ",
            "\u00a0Lol no. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student interested in economics, however I think I would suggest the seminar version because the lecture was often not very clear or engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, microeconomics is a big requirement for a lot of majors, and this course is a good first step in. ",
            "\u00a0For students interested in economics or who value the conceptual importance of economics, this course is a good start. Students must be engaged in order to succeed, however. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0absolutely not. instructor was lovely but the course itself sets any kid from a disadvantaged high school up for failure-- this was super disappointing and my heart breaks for the first-years whose mental health suffered as a result ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student because it taught me things that I needed to know. It is extremely useful to have this foundation off of which to build more knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I thought it gave me a good feel of economics and helped me decide that I want to continue with the subject matter. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend it as an intro microecon course, but would not recommend it for fun. It's necessary for starting to learn econ. ",
            "\u00a0It's a really interesting course: it doesn't really have gimmicks or memes during lecture to hook you in, but it covers seem really cool topics (particularly in the second half) and is taught in a clear, straightforward way. It's unlikely to completely change your outlook on life, but it is interesting and really worth taking. I'd definitely recommend it. (Also, make sure to read the textbook - it definitely makes learning the material easier.) ",
            "\u00a0Good, relevant stuff to know. Many majors need it. Take it for some intro econ that can be ~kinda~ relevant, but don't go into this thinking that you will be applying ECON 115 to your everyday life because you won't. A lot of what you learn is fairly abstract. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to be an econ major you have to take it. Also its good to know the basics of micro. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - the material was interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend this course. It was a good way to start the econ track ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the seminar-based version of this course to another student -- I only understood the material fully after section each week, which I imagine was similar. I did also have Eoin as a TA, though, which could've skewed the experience positively -- I'm not sure how section went with other TAs. ",
            "\u00a0An interesting course on Econ. Manageable and straightforward, but not thrilling. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Very nice if you have no experience with economics and want to learn the basics. ",
            "\u00a0I feel like it is an important course to take at least once, and it was a good QR credit that will feel relevant to many majors. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I really enjoyed the course ",
            "\u00a0Ya ",
            "\u00a0No ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because it is a good introductory course to economics ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in economics or math, yes. The lectures were really boring and very hard to sit through. The problem sets were fun if you like problem solving and math, and I found the material to be interesting. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a prereq to a lot of other courses so in many cases, one doesn't really have a choice about taking it. I took the course to see if I would like economics - I enjoyed the material, just the class was not well organized nor engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It offers a simplified look into the idea of a market, and the different economic situations. Teaches a valuable understanding of the economy around us. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I think it gives you a good foundation for understanding economics ",
            "\u00a0N/A ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you are genuinely interested in the material or pursuing economics in the future. If you are taking this class for a QR credit, however, I think there are better and easier options. The class doesn't require that much of a math background but much of the problem-solving requires the same skillset. I did enjoy learning about the real-world applications, which motivated my desire to take the class and understand the influence of economics in political decision-making. ",
            "\u00a0With Prof. Goldberg, then yes. Otherwise, no. She made the course GREAT. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because I think it is a good course that helps people understand the basics of the economic world. ",
            "\u00a0Yes its a great introduction ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I would recommend it for all econ majors as it is a required class as well as to other students as it gives a general overview of what micro-economics or as a whole, what economics looks like and provides good information to be an economically aware citizen. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student who already feels comfortable with microeconomics or if it's a requirement for a major. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is an excellent introduction to the field of micro economics. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend for building a solid base in microecon. ",
            "\u00a0I think everyone at Yale should probably take this course at some point. You might prefer the seminar, but it has some important lessons unless you took Econ in high school. ",
            "\u00a0Only take this course if you are actually interested in economics. If you are only taking it just for the sake of taking it, you probably will not engage with it enough to do well. With that said, the content of the course is interesting. But make sure you get a good TF. ",
            "\u00a0I would because it's very useful for not just your career at Yale, but also for general knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's a must-have course pursuing anything further in economics. Don't try to skip it even if you have a strong econ background! ",
            "\u00a0No - take the Seminar. This course convinced me I should only take seminars at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0No. I have heard from many, many students, and in keeping with my own opinions, that they went into this course interested in economics and truly disliked it and were discouraged from taking any more economics. This course seems to be a weeder course, which is a shame, because I think many students truly only want to take one or two economics classes to understand the basic economic background of the world, and when they are treated as necessary but not intellectually stimulating courses that must be taken for an Economics major, the students who take the class simply because they want to learn the material cannot derive any enjoyment from it. ",
            "\u00a0Unless a student absolutely has to take this course for their major (or wants an in-depth introduction to economics), I would not recommend this class. Someone could probably learn the same amount of information (or more) by watching Khan Academy (as I did) or reading a textbook by themselves. I just did not enjoy this class, and I couldn't want to put anyone else through it. "
