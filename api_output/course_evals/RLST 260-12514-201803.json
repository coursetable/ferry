            "\u00a0This class really improved my ability to think critically about history (particularly secondary sources) and analyze arguments. The emphasis on secondary sources over primary sources taught me to engage with authors in a way that I hadn't in my previous history courses and will improve my abilities as a historian going forward. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the role of religion throughout America's history and, though it is far from obvious, its strong role in foreign policy. ",
            "\u00a0Regularly interesting class discussions about American religious history and how it has shaped and interacted with our foreign policy and expansive history of foreign conflicts. ",
            "\u00a0I got to think deeply about the role of religion in American foreign policy and politics and I had never had a chance to do that before very deeply. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how religion has informed United States diplomacy from the colonial era to the present. ",
            "\u00a0This course definitely had a thesis: it was clearly structured around Prof. Stout's sense that American civil religion and our approach to war are deeply intertwined. I wasn't entirely sure about it coming in, but I was convinced. My main takeaway was a very new perspective on American war and religious history, which is a rarity. ",
            "\u00a0I thought a bit more deeply about the role of Christianity in American warfare, and learned to apply the theories of just war in most cases. ",
            "\u00a0More of a history class than anything ",
            "\u00a0I gained a historical overview of America's various wars and, more importantly, several analytical lens through which to examine the complex relationship between American identity, religious belief, and war. There are so many riveting ideas in this course (Bellah's thesis of civil religion, the Civil War as religious sacrifice, Niebuhr's Christian realism, just to name a few). ",
            "\u00a0America, Religion, War and their interrelations ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about America's relationship with war, which I'd always thought about peripherally but never looked at in depth. This course truly changed my perception of American history, and made me consider the religious undercurrents of American government. "

            "\u00a0The strength of this course is the fact that the professor is a leader in this field. When the professor is too humble to assign his own books but several of the authors you read in the course mention him as their inspiration, you know it's a good course. However, I think this course could be improved if Professor Stout assigned more primary sources. I'd love to really dig into the documents that he has used to reach his conclusions about war and religion in America. ",
            "\u00a0I think this was a very strong class that was well organized and thought out, with readings that complemented the discussions excellently. ",
            "\u00a0Subject matter super interesting, really enjoyed hearing people's thoughts and Professor Stout always came prepared, friendly, and ready to engage with the material in an intellectually honest way. \r\n\r\nHowever, at times I felt that class discussion encouraged people to talk for long amount of time without having much to say. The presentations from students were of inconsistent quality, and I enjoyed much more when Professor Stout took the reigns of the discussion. I think this is just a thing about Yale history seminars in general--lots of brilliance, but sometimes lots of fluff too...\r\n\r\nI wish the two small-papers were worth more. I felt I put a lot of effort into them, and for each one to be worth so little made the class grading feel just a bit back-loaded and a bit ambiguous given the stress placed on participation. This might have incentivized some of what I spoke about above. ",
            "\u00a0I truly loved everything about the class, from the readings to the class discussions. \r\nThe only thing I wish were different is the essays. I think it would have been more valuable to write our short essays on course concepts rather than an evaluation of a reading or author. While that is valuable to do, it would have been far more interesting and far more beneficial to me at least to write about and think out course concepts in a deliberate, intensive manner that an essay format would have provided. ",
            "\u00a0The reading list for this course was fascinating, and Professor Stout did a great job ensuring that all the assigned books were discussed in class. Seminar debates were lively and thought-provoking. I cannot think of any ways the course could be improved. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Prof. Stout is amazing! Well-structured, both in terms of the syllabus (doing a war a week worked) and the assignments (2 5ish page response papers, one 20 page final, broad prompt, not a research essay). Course content is very interesting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: While the weekly Canvas posts weren't particularly arduous, clear expectations weren't set for them (some people would write mini-essays, others would only write a couple sentences), and I didn't get the sense that anyone but Prof. Stout read any of them. I would get rid of them. ",
            "\u00a0I think Professor Stout is an excellent seminar leader, and organization of the course is excellent. However, I feel the Preston text is repetitive and not necessarily conducive to good seminar discussions. I would be more judicious about including the Preston readings. I also felt this course had a bit of a \"great men\" style of historiography, which I found rather dull. I would want greater variety in the primary source materials as well, including more grassroots or \"history from below\" sources. ",
            "\u00a0I could have done with a wider range of reading types a little more about religious philosophies of war maybe ",
            "\u00a0Great professors, great readings, great discussion. Pretty much a pitch-perfect seminar. My only suggestion would be less readings--not because they aren't doable, but because we didn't always have the time to discuss everything in class, and when we would try to cram in everything we would end up glossing over a few. It's the classic trade-off between depth and breadth, and I typically favor depth. ",
            "\u00a0No weaknesses, fantastic class ",
            "\u00a0The course is organized around the theme of religion and war, with each week focusing on a different war. Necessarily, this means that a lot of detail is left out, but I liked that it covered a 400-year timespan because you got to see how ideas evolved (and didn't). The course had a great mixture of primary and secondary sources, even though sometimes I felt like there was too much reading and things got lost in discussion. Throughout the semester, one frustration was that there wasn't a single primary source by a woman (except for one two-page reading at the very end). The makeup of the class was also very male-dominated (which is not the fault of the class, but exacerbated the issue of feeling that the subject was very masculine). Half of the grade is based on a 20-page final paper, but it wasn't introduced at all until November and there was not much in-class guidance on it besides asking us for our topic, so it was very self-directed and I think many students ended up putting it off completely until there were only a few weeks left in the semester.

            "\u00a0Yes to anyone interested in studying the United States should understand the role of religion, which is underappreciated in its role. ",
            "\u00a0I would. It shares many of the same strengths and weaknesses as other classic Yale seminars. If you do well in seminars, take it. If you find them frustrating, take a lecture class instead. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely would! Professor Stout is incredible and if you put thought and time into the course, you will get a lot out of it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student interested in American foreign policy. To not understand how religion has influence war in the United States is to overlook a major component of U.S. diplomacy. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This is a model Yale seminar  he's a fantastic professor and the content is quite interesting. \r\n\r\nFor what it's worth, just be warned that for some reason (maybe the intersection of war and religious history?) the class tends to attract a strange cohort of remarkably opinionated students, who, because Prof. Stout is quite friendly, feel very free to express their opinions. It's more entertaining than anything else, but be warned! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course, but I would warn--the readings can be repetitive, and the other classmates tend to be those who love America(n history). Moreover, there is frequently more consideration of military history than religious or moral critique (although that may have been an externality produced the composition of my seminar). If this sounds like you, by all means, jump in. ",
            "\u00a0Its a fine history seminar if youre into that kind of thing. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely--fantastic professor, readings, and discussions. Workload is pretty manageable, with weekly reading responses, one reading presentation, and three papers (reading were sometimes heavy though). The course has a handful of strong themes that it rarely strays from, which means occasional but always helpful repetition. Some people might find this relatively narrow focus restrictive, but I thought it allowed for some fairly in-depth exploration of the core themes over the duration of the semester. Certainly said themes (all relating to the complex ways that war, religion, and American identity constituted one another) received more attention than the actual details of the wars themselves. Each American war only got a week, and as such the particular historical happenings, while they were certainly discussed, were generally subordinated to the broader thematic discussion (though I recognize that you can't so cleanly disentangle the micro from the macro). Ultimately the brisk pace ensured that we were always discussing something fresh, whether it's a different angle on a familiar subject or something new altogether.  \r\n\r\nThis course equipped me with a far more comprehensive conceptual toolkit for thinking about religion, in its sacred and secular forms, and its manifestation in American consciousness, which is exactly what I wanted. Seminar did basically amount to a weekly two-hour session for (academically) meditating on critical questions of American religion. That worked for me, since we had a great group and discussions were reliably captivating. I looked forward to them every week. \r\n\r\nProfessor Stout is wonderful. He's kind, cultivating a warm class environment; knowledgeable, guiding the discussion in consistently fascinating directions without ever dominating it; and best of all, very funny--he's bursting with humorous anecdotes, and his witty energy always kept the class interesting. \r\n\r\nOverall, definitely highly recommend for those even mildly intrigued by the topic. ",
            "\u00a0100%, fascinating sense through which to look at US foreign policy ",
            "\u00a0This class changed the way I think about American history, and about the legacy of the country's religious roots. Professor Stout is so knowledgable (and so kind and helpful), and is incredibly well-regarded in his field. I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in American history it covers a massive period of time, and is taught through a very interesting lens. "
