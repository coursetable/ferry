            "\u00a0In some of the sessions such as Cryo-EM and crystallography, the lecturer didn't take into consideration of our limited knowledge about these two technologies and went through the lectures very quickly. ",
            "\u00a0One strength was definitely how the last instructor showed us the machines. I wished that more of the other professors did that as well. But time constraints probably prevented this from happening. ",
            "\u00a0It was nice that have people who specialize in the particular topic come and teach the lectures. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the class are the information imparted.\r\nThe weaknesses are the administration of the course, specifically the homework assigned. Students often time are not given advanced notice of the assignments, especially from the faculty not in charge of the class. \r\nThe course could be improved by a detailed syllabus with deadlines and all of the homework associated with the course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: application of different methods\r\nWeakness: too much technique background which are hard to understand ",
            "\u00a0The course offers different topics to explore; however, the relevance and applicability of this course to my PhD project is virtually non-existent. So far this has been the least relevant course I have taken so far in my academic career which includes my undergraduate, post-bac, masters and PhD studies. I think this course SHOULD NOT BE a REQUIRED class but instead an ELECTIVE, as many students struggle to find the connection between the topics covered in this class and their research interests. ",
            "\u00a0The course should be designed more to allow understanding of how biochemical/biophysical analysis is done logistically, not just theoretically/hypothetically. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Pollard is a great teacher and knows his field well. Some of the guest lecturers were obviously great scientists, bot not always great teachers. Given the lack of biochem/physics some of the class has, the ability of the instructor to teach was critical to the success of the lecture. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is that it introduces us with different techniques which will be incorporated in research. However, I think some topics need to be covered in more depth rather than one or two lectures. \r\nAlso, it would be nice if there was office hour for students so that they can ask questions outside of class. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the description of how different techniques work and how they can be applied to specific kinds of problems, what techniques can and cannot do, was really useful. The weakness is the same weakness I've seen in every course that relies on many guest lecturers, which is that some of the lecturers spoke well to the purpose of the course, and others gave such surface level dives into a technique that it didn't impart much useful information. Naming many versions of a technique and saying that they exist is much less meaningful than taking a more in depth approach to how one might use a specific example of the technique, and then pointing us to a resource that has more versions. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest weakness of this course is the final paper assignment. While having students write a grant proposal can be very useful practice for their PhD, the restrictions of this assignment do not allow for good critical thinking and experimental design. ",
            "\u00a0The structure of the class makes sense, and I enjoyed breaking up lecture time with discussion. I also found the peer review of my final project proposal to be very helpful. \r\n\r\nSome of the lectures were less useful than others. For instance, the microscopy and kinetics lectures made me feel like I could go to lab and know which controls I needed, which machines to use, and how to prep the sample. Other lectures, (mostly the cryo-EM and Cytof lectures) taught me a lot about the theory behind the system and less about how to actually implement the system. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - The most useful lectures were binding kinetics, cryo EM, crystallography, microscopy, and mass spec. The most useful assignment was the final paper.\r\nWeaknesses - There were too many homework assignments given that this was a graduate level course. More than one assignment a week felt like a distraction from my lab work. I would've preferred a bi-weekly problem set and that the paper discussions didn't require a turned in assignment.\r\nAlso some lectures were too focused on that professor's research rather than general principles. ",
            "\u00a0I think that some of the lectures by certain professors were not as well organized or thought out.  Dr. Pollard's lectures were especially good and he had a great grasp on what he wanted to do with his time in the classroom which was especially helpful.  His homework assignments were also very helpful and helped to make sure I understood the information necessary.  Dr. Reinisch's were also excellent!  Some other assignments were much more basic or did not provide a great deal of insight.\r\n\r\nI thought it was difficult that the assignments were not really graded on any sort of scale, so I did not know where I stood in terms of grades in the class going into the final paper at all and am unsure what my grade will be, especially given that I'm not 100% sure how the final proposals will be evaluated. ",
            "\u00a0I didn't seem very useful to my field of study, and the methods were outdated. I think it should be an elective. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: help students learn some useful biophysics method and encourage them to think in a biophysics way. \r\n\r\nWeakness: it should not be a core course. Should be a elective course "
