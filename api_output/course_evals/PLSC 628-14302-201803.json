            "\u00a0I loved the readings and also liked the questions that were sent out ahead of time. Some weeks it would have been nice to have gotten the questions a bit earlier. Towards the end of the semester the discussion became a bit more natural, but for the first half I often felt that the flow was a bit off. It seemed like everyone was very engaged and had a lot to say, but somehow we weren't really speaking to each other. It was sort of like people would comment, and then the instructor would respond directly, and it would throw off any organic discussion that the students could have had between us. I think it better facilitation between students would have helped to move the discussion past a basic reconstruction of the argument. "

            "\u00a0Yes. The readings dealt with a lot of complex ideas that were very helpful to talk about in a group.  The prompts were excellent at guiding the readings and discussions. "
