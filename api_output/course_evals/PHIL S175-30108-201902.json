            "\u00a0I was introduced to a brief overview of different fundamental schools of philosophical thought, and how their principles can be applied to different scenarios. I also learned how to write a philosophy paper, which is different from papers that would be written for other disciplines. ",

            "\u00a0The strengths of the course were the ability for us students to engage in discussion and the availability of the professor and the TA for any questions.\r\nThe strength might be its weakness in that for a seminar intro course a lot of time was delegated to students engaging in resolving their own pursuit of a philosophy rather then academic introduction of certain theories taking away time for others to engage in learning. ",

However, it would be helpful to have a bit more of a lecture component to the course, as well as regularly scheduled breaks to keep the discussion engaging. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that the course was very well organized by topic and had a good number of assignments. I particularly liked the policies of requiring a reading question before each class and structuring discussion on the basis of those questions, as well as having an ungraded first assignment. An opportunity to rewrite the midterm essay was also quite helpful.\r\n\r\nI think the course could have benefited from handouts on each topic. ",
            "\u00a0This course could be improved by focusing more on certain concentrated issues for discussions, which makes the discussions more valuable. During the course, I felt like often the discussion was shifted before the original focus was fully explored. "
