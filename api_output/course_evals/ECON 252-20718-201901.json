He invited his friend who is currently working in Hedge Fund industry to give a guest lecture to us, which helped us better understand the investment industry, what's more,  two Shiller Salon he held also gave us the opportunity to talk with him and other students to share our understanding on some financial issues. He is excellent. ",

            "\u00a0The lectures were kind of deconnected from the book and the exams. I wish Prof. Shiller spent more time on the math we were tested on. Another difficulty I encountered with the lectures is that Prof. Shiller goes on tangents every now and then and even though the tangents are super interesting it is never clear to me which tangent is something to memorize for the exam and which tangent is not. ",
            "\u00a0The general structure of the class and order or the lectures is very logical. However, the material is poorly taught and does not give you a deep understanding of the material and how it can be provided to the real world. ",
            "\u00a0Professor shriller is a very dry lecturer. Mainly just rambles on about topics in finance. Do not take this class if you do not have a firm understanding in financial theory. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are in Shiller's anecdotes, personal stories, the guest lectures, and interactions with Shiller in general. \r\n\r\nThere are a lot of weaknesses, including class being boring, the TAs not coordinating well with Shiller, uncertainties on what was to be tested, arbitrary homework grading, and uncertainty in grading.

You will get to know more in depth his own thoughts and theories on the financial markets and this is indeed very valuable since most of other classes in the economics department focus on mainstream textbook theories. However I do believe this course can be significantly improved by making class materials more organized in a fashion that provides clear relevance to the exams and homework. I often needed a lot of extra self-study and help from TAs to finish the homework and study for the exams. ",
            "\u00a0The class was organized poorly. Lecture slides were not helpful. Shiller was a boring lecturer and talked about whatever he wanted for an hour and 15 minutes. ",

            "\u00a0Yup I would like to strongly recommend this class to other students if you want to hear the lecture given by Nobel Prize Winner and also want to have an entry level financial knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommended this course to individuals who want a low workload finance course. However, I will warn you that the material is taught in a theoretical setting and you will often be tested on information that you maybe, at best, glazed over. It is really up to you to teach yourself the material in your own time. ",
            "\u00a0No. ",
            "\u00a0You are likely taking this class because of Robert Shiller. I thought the same going in. But please... don't do this. On the positive side, Shiller is an amazing human being. For someone as accomplished and distinguished as himself, he's so humble and nice to the class. He tries to get guest lecturers that are involved in the field, and this year, a few of us got to eat at Mory's for free with one of them. He also hosts two \"salons,\" which are like 90-minute sessions where you and a few people in the class get to talk with him about economics and stuff. The value in Shiller is in his personal anecdotes, stories, and relationships, which are super cool to hear because he knows so many people of importance in this field. However, there are a lot of negatives. First, Shiller isn't a great lecturer. The slides are dry and sometimes not updated. If you didn't go to class, they are incomprehensible. Even if you were one of the few who went, the lecture is hard to follow. The lectures attempt to be historically-focused, but they are more like a hodgepodge of random facts that you're still expected to know for tests. Shiller doesn't teach math in lecture, and he asks his TAs to do so. They were helpful, but the lack of coordination between them and Shiller was awful for the students. We had such little expectations of what math or history to know going into tests because the TAs and Shiller didn't talk regularly. Ultimately, don't take this class for Shiller. Consider your sanity. Consider your sleep. And consider how much effort you want to put in by yourself, because this will be a self-teaching class. \r\n\r\nAlso, the course was at 8:30 AM at the business school this year. That's a huge L. In addition to the class being super boring, you will also not be motivated to wake up, walk a long way to the business school, and pay attention for an hour. I feel like the percentage of people going to lecture went from 100% in the first week, to 50% by halfway, and 33% by the end of the year. It's really tough to see.\r\n\r\nTake this course if you really really really want to be with Shiller, but even then I'd advise not to. Take this course if you're 100% confident in your ability to memorize a textbook and math formulas. But please be thoughtful in your decision. Yeah, Shiller was cool to be with, but it was not worth the effort in the end to say \"I took a class with Robert Shiller.\" ",
            "\u00a0Yes. For Shiller ",
            "\u00a0Boring lecture bad time coursework unrelated to lecture ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Take this course with Shiller. You might not learn the formulas from Professor Shiller, but he can speak very well about the world of finance. He helped me gain financial literacy. Someday I am sitting in a board meeting I will be able to talk to a CFO and understand the terms he/she is using. Forget about your grades for a minute and focus on learning real skills. ",
            "\u00a0No. Dont take this class unless Shiller retires. ",
            "\u00a0go and check online course, if you want to have some personal interactions with professor Shiller, this course may help "
