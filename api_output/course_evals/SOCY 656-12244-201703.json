            "\u00a0I think the course spends too much time having us informally chat with faculty versus coupling informal networking with intentional skill-building exercises led by faculty experts. However, I did appreciate having the chance to ask questions and learn from/about the experiences of faculty members in our department. ",
            "\u00a0More focus on professional development skills ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed hearing from the faculty. However, I felt like at times they said too much about their interests and not enough about the professionalization piece. I definitely wanted to meet them and hear about their work, but it is called \"professional seminar\" for a reason - so I expected professionalization topics to be discussed. "
