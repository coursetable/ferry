            "\u00a0I without a doubt would recommend this class. I am not someone who excelled in the intro and intermediate sequences, so I was nervous taking this class. However, Professor Lindenlaub explain difficult subjects extremely well. She also uses recently published papers to teach us the topics, which is something I found extremely cool. This class changed my opinion on economics. Ive come out of the class with a revived interest in the subject. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely, I would recommend this course to you if you are interested in learning theoretical models of the labor market. It helps us understand the determinants of wages and employment. "
