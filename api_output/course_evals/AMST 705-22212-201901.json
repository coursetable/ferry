            "\u00a0I feel like I left the course having a good sense of the recent history of the subfield of American religious history. I also think my ability to write a book review improved, as did my ability to put two books in conversation with each other and with the historiography. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided a help introduction to the academic literature on American religion. I appreciated the wide breadth of readings, including Professor Wenger's desire to have us engage with a variety of disciplinary/methodological approaches to the study of religion. I found the assignments -- two academic book reviews and a final paper that combined historiography and primary source analysis -- to be useful practice for writing styles common in academic history. ",
            "\u00a0I gained an understanding of historiography and the art of writing history that I did not have before. The focus lenses of history and the ways in which they affect representation and interpretation were enlightening. ",
            "\u00a0I feel like I have a broad understanding of the state of the field in a way that makes me feel confident moving forward. ",
            "\u00a0Practice in critical evaluation of recent historical texts. ",
            "\u00a0Working through the intricacies of a single book per week \r\nConstructive seminar participation \r\nOverview of American religion that can be parlayed into dissertation research \r\nStructural comparisons between different intellectual projects \r\nBook reviews "

            "\u00a0I think the student interventions were extremely helpful. They helped contextualize the readings for the week and exposed me to a wider literature. I also thought the experience of presenting was helpful as well. For the final paper, a preliminary assignment like a paper proposal would have been helpful. It would have encouraged me to start thinking about the final earlier. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n-Great, varied reading list\r\n-Prof. Wenger was a good discussion facilitator\r\n-Very manageable workload\r\n-Class presentations on related books were helpful for expanding knowledgeable of the field\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-Could have been more effort to include books on non-Christian religious traditions ",
            "\u00a0I thought this course was excellent! It might be helpful to have a brief introduction to the theory of history/historiography at the beginning of the course, but I recognize that other student enrolled might not need such a survey. ",
            "\u00a0Too little time devoted to each reading.  A number of the readings would have warranted several class meetings.  Needed to devote more time to identifying exactly what historians mean by \"intervention.\"  What do they mean by a \"primary\" sources?  Would have appreciated more direction for final paper. ",
            "\u00a0This course was fantastic overall and was often the highlight of my week! The only thing I would recommend is to have a proposal due a few weeks before paper submission that would allow us to flesh out some ideas and get our bibliographies in shape before we head in to the maelstrom of finals season.

            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this class for those interested in American religious history ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This was a great introduction to the historiography surrounding American religion. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course. I feel like I left the course with a good overview of the history of the subfield and the various ways that people have written American religious history in the past few years. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in studying the history of American religion at the graduate level. It was a very helpful introductory class and I now feel that I am much more familiar with the literature in this area. I also have a better sense of the kinds of methodological approaches that can be employed to study American religion, and of some of the major challenges/controversies in the field. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I thought the course was excellent. If a student is looking for a grounding in American History in the context of religious studies this course is perfect. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely.  I think it should be cross-listed in the Div School for MAR students to get better acquainted with religious studies more broadly. ",
            "\u00a0I would take another class from this instructor.\r\n\r\nThis is not a course for everyone.  It is an advanced seminar intended for graduate students in American Studies and History.  Perhaps too specialized for M.Div. or S.T.M. students without a strong background in Church History.  Again, rather intense reading (it is, after all, a \"reading course\"); not as much feedback as I personally needed. Perhaps should require one-on-one with each student after second book review. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Not only did it allow me to find a group of fantastic, committed graduate students, but Tisa is such a generative thinker who is generous with her insights and time. "
