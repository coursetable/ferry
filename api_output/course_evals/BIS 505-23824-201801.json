            "\u00a0Strengths: Lab assignments were open-ended, which I found to be helpful.\r\nWeaknesses: Lecture could have been more focused. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly, I went to class about five times this semester. Since there are no exams, the motivation is kind of lost to go to class especially when I felt like I wasn't learning anything that wasn't covered in Biostat I. The labs were a little helpful in learning concepts, however since the codes are written for you, you aren't learning SAS either. Strengths: Easy Honors Limitations: Not really learning anything besides reading your SAS output. ",
            "\u00a0The course overall was too easy. It was nice to have a chill class, but the course didn't really motivate us to retain anything. We just had to know how to do the lab for one week and then we didn't have to use any of it again. It wasn't necessary to attend classes either, just the weekly labs sessions. I wouldn't say the course progressed my knowledge of biostatistics. ",
            "\u00a0It was too easy, we weren't motivated to learn anything other than how to complete the specific lab report for the week and then we didn't have to remember how to do anything after that. Most people stopped going to class because we didn't really need to. ",
            "\u00a0The knowledge of this class is useful, however, if the instructor can teach the knowledge points more detailed, that would be better. ",
            "\u00a0Labs were fairly easy. Everything you need to know is in the lab slides and textbook. Overall I feel that I didn't learn much or gain many skills in the context of stats. Wish there was a better focus on public health and that the data was used was more relevant. Would have loved to have actually learned how to uses SAS or R. ",
            "\u00a0One strength of the course is it allows students to be creative in interpreting data and answering statistical questions. A weakness is that the course should be more structured so that in each lecture we walk away with more than a concept based understanding of the statistical theories. ",
            "\u00a0This is the absolute worst course offered at YSPH. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course could be improved by having more of an incentive to put the necessary work in to understand the concepts.  The lab reports were graded very easily and there were no exams, so it was easy for the class to become less of a priority when other courses required more time. ",
            "\u00a0Joke of a class, but I know they're getting rid of Zelterman next year and restructuring it so this review probably isn't helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The textbook is really helpful for working on the assignment, by saying this, meaning most of the gains from this model is from self learning of the textbook. ",
            "\u00a0Course could be improved with better R resources. Otherwise, I enjoyed the personal approach to lab reports. ",
            "\u00a0This class was entirely useless.  I don't think I've ever had a class, whether that be in middle school, high school, college, or grad school, that required less work or critical thought.  I learned not a single thing.  All I did was run a SAS output that was given to me and use basic skills that are required on the ACT science portion I could do in tenth grade.  After two semesters of \"biostatistics,\" I do not know anything I didn't already know from taking high school statistics.  Actually, perhaps less since material was covered in a more confusing way. ",
            "\u00a0This course had a lot of potential but needed a great deal more structure. The lectures were not particularly helpful and moved slowly, often repeating the same material without introducing new concepts. Lab assignments were a chance to apply concepts, but given that code was provided, not much was actually gained from the process of using SAS/R or even in writing the results up. I had a great experience with my TA (Kevin) but I got the impression from other students that they did not receive much feedback on their labs so they did not have a basis on which to improve. I think this class would benefit from having lecture slides instead of using the document camera for hand written notes and references to the textbook - this would provide structure that would help students know what to expect from the class and follow concepts better. ",
            "\u00a0One of the most flexible courses where the student is not thinking in terms of passing exams. One can learn a lot from the slow paced, in depth lectures where the stress is on the ways learning biostatistics can be made more student friendly. ",
            "\u00a0I have spent a very long time reflecting on the course and trying to give feedback that is both fair and helpful (which has required a lot of self-censorship). On the whole, I found this class extremely frustrating, not helpful, and unstructured. I consistently turned to StackOverflow to help me understand code and the underlying concepts behind each pset, because I simply was not able to glean this information from class. Professor Zelterman consistently said that the course was about biostatistics, not computing. However, trying to teach statistics without providing helpful coding information does not make sense in the present day. Additionally, understanding the coding can help students to understand the statistical concepts. \r\nI honestly don't think I would have gotten through this class without already having a very solid grounding in R -- I learned no additional computing concepts through the course. Additionally, as per the syllabus, 100% of the grade was meant to come through the psets. If a syllabus is set up in this way, then the lectures need to be helpful (even essential) in the completion of the psets. This was not the case. In fact, Professor Zelterman began taking lecture attendance without announcing this change -- if an official change was made to the grading scheme, this needed to be made clear via Canvas (while I want to give him the benefit of the doubt, the way he started taking attendance came across as vindictive). No student would typically email a professor about needing to miss a large lecture due to illness, but thanks to Professor Zelterman's unannounced change, such a student could have been penalizing for missing lecture for a legitimate reason. \r\n\r\nYSPH: You need to support and provide additional training to your instructors, because this course was unacceptable. PLEASE consider reaching out to Professor Jay Emerson, who teaches statistics at Yale College. He has found rigorous and clear ways to teach statistics, and I think the stats professors at YSPH would find talking with him extremely helpful. I really, really hate writing negative reviews (and feel quite bad doing it), but this class ultimately felt like a waste of my time and money, and I think I need to give that feedback honestly without being mean about it. I don't want anyone else going through a class like this, and I'm sure Professor Zelterman wants to relay his knowledge in clear and effective ways. Please make sure that something changes, so that these modifications can be made. ",
            "\u00a0This course should not be a CDE requirement. Most of the material was already covered in AME and taught in a much better fashion. This course was very disappointing, partly because Professor Zelterman meant well and really wanted the class to learn but it was painful to attend class because there was no structure. After ~3 classes, literally 3/4 of the class stopped attending because the textbook was more useful. I did appreciate the critical thinking involved with the weekly labs. ",
            "\u00a0Poor quality and overall overlap with other courses. ",
            "\u00a0should not be in core ",
            "\u00a0This course is more about conceptual basics of the biostatistics, it is fundamental for future work, but it didn't provide so much new knowledge comparing to the intro to biostatistics course. ",
            "\u00a0The book of the class written by the professor is really good -- clear and concise. But his class is a little bit not fully arranged and lack focus. Some of the SAS codes are outdated. ",
            "\u00a0Very good lectures with funny stories. Can definitely improve your writing skills in statistics summary. ",
            "\u00a0Horrible Course, Learned Nothing. Mainly due to professor, this needs a complete revamp. ",
            "\u00a0The course raised some interesting thoughts, but I failed to see why this is a mandatory course. The content can surely be covered in half a semester. And it might be better for students interested in doing serious analyses to take a higher-level class. ",
            "\u00a0It had potential but was not very well organized ",
            "\u00a0I think the course has suffered from going back and forth between being a required course for some MPH/PhD tracks one year, and then not being required the next. The goals are sometimes unclear, and it did not necessarily feel like a progression from Biostatistics 1. While learning to interpret the SAS output for various statistical tests was very valuable, I think it is equally valuable to experience writing some of the code for yourself. ",
            "\u00a0It intergrades the knowledge of 505A and hand-on-hand using it in SAS.\r\nIt could be more practical in some cases. ",

            "\u00a0The course did not feel very structured at all, with the instructor often starting off the class by asking us what WE wanted to learn. I don't know, I'm here to learn from you! Because of this, some lectures felt very repetitive and it was hard staying motivated to attend class. ",
            "\u00a0great textbook. I respect not having a final exam, but would make lab reports more difficult to motivate students to participate ",
            "\u00a0Great and useful ",
            "\u00a0The weekly lab assignments are most valuable parts of the course for me as I gained most from it.\r\n\r\nThe low attendance rate of the class (both for the lectures and the labs) was little annoying. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, the lectures were alright on the surface. However, most students did not attend lecture at all except for the first few lectures and the last one. There was no motivation to attend lecture because there are no exams in the class and you don't really need to understand the material to complete the labs. If info from the lecture is needed you could look at the class notes (handwritten) that he posts online. However, these are hard to follow without context and it is much better to just never look at the notes and only at the text if you need help with lab assignments. Essentially, the lectures could provide some useful info but was overall useless and did not provide much more information than other classes. \r\n\r\n If this is not a required course for you, don't waste your time and money. If this is a required course for you, petition to waive the requirement, or spend as little time on this class as possible and focus on more important ones that will actually increase your knowledge of SAS and statistical analysis. ",
            "\u00a0Biostats II builds on concepts that Biostats I covered very well. I appreciated the fact that the course did not focus on technical aspects (such as calculating p-values or memorizing formulas), but instead emphasized critical thinking and mental analysis. I liked the incorporation of a term project that forced us to revisit one question throughout the entire semester (as it related to the various topics). It felt like a very comprehensive class on linear models, although I would've a wider range of topics (on other types of regression models, for example). ",
            "\u00a0STRENGTHS\r\n-- Lab assignments were prepared in advance and presented in the syllabus at the start of term, so students had the opportunity to plan ahead and work at a measured pace, in congruence with individual schedules.\r\n-- Class material and computer labs balanced each other nicely.\r\n-- Grades were based on weekly assignments rather than a heroic final exam or paper. This privileged steady, cumulative work over a last-minute rush of questionable value.\r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES\r\n-- Students were not engaged during class. I recommend 5-10 minutes during class for students to work through questions in small groups, before sharing with the full class. Also, incorporate methods to gauge understanding of the material during the lesson, and adjust course accordingly (if 90% of students answer a question correctly through a polling/voting/handraising system, move on to a new subject; if 30% of students answer a question correctly, the educator has not effectively conveyed the concept and must backtrack, rephrase, explain, elicit questions from students). ",
            "\u00a0-The lack of homework assignments (aside from labs) meant that our knowledge and understanding was never really challenged or assessed\r\n-I appreciated the emphasis on statistical thinking (as opposed to memorizing formulas or \"plug and chug\"), however it would have been nice to have a more rigorous format. I did not learn very much "

            "\u00a0I would, if you have a heavy courseload and need an easy Honors. But, Applied Analytics might be better to learn SAS and biostats at another level. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course for a student just looking to fulfill a requirement without much effort, but not to those who really hope to advance their knowledge and skills in biostatistic. ",
            "\u00a0It's a great course for someone looking to fulfill an easy requirement, but not for someone who truly cares to advance their knowledge and skills in biostatistics. ",
            "\u00a0For school of public health students, I think the contents of this class has a bunch of similarities with applied analytical methods in EPI, so there is no need to select both of these two classes. ",

            "\u00a0I would absolutely not recommend the course. Unless you are already a coding genius, you will not get anything other than frustration and sadness from the class as it currently stands. I know that sounds unnecessarily harsh, and I feel horrible for saying it, but I do stand by this assertion. While Professor Zelterman seems like a perfectly nice man and a good researcher, his teaching unfortunately leaves something to be desired. ",
            "\u00a0Opt for AME if you have the choice. I do not think it is worth expending tuition on a class that could be learned strictly through the textbook. There was little to no work, which unfortunately created a lack of incentive to really delve into the material. ",
