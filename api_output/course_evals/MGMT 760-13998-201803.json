            "\u00a0I spent a lot of time in this class practicing being critical of research, including well-established research. I think I definitely got better at picking out methodological issues, as well as issues in terms of the actual relevance or implications of research. Also got the chance to discuss some topics in psychology very important to society as a whole, in much more depth than in any other setting. Also used the topics discussed to motivate a research project of my own. "

            "\u00a0I don't want to recommend this too highly because if a bunch because of undergrads took it it wouldn't be the same. Very different from undergrad courses. Met for three hours at a time which is a lot, so if you can't handle that, stay away. But, if you're interested in controversial research findings and willing to talk about things like, for example, gender-based intelligence differences, it's definitely worth checking out. Anyone would benefit quite a lot, regardless of your area of study, from the approach this class takes, which is tackling controversial and pressing questions about social issues from a very data-driven perspective. It is a great check on the inclination we have to selectively believe some facts and not others. "
