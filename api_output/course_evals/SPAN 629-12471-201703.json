            "\u00a0Professor Gonzlez Echevarras marvelous course instructed its students to decipher and analyze many essential Spanish Golden Age plays and to develop their own critical viewpoints towards them. Professor Gonzlez Echevarras presentation of his own insightful and illuminating interpretations and analyses of these plays especially exemplified the intellectually challenging research expected of the students taking this course. For instance, Professor Gonzlez Echevarras profound and detailed analyses of many works, such as El burlador de Sevilla and La vida es sueo, through the framework of the clashing yet coexistent interactions between the Ptolemaic universe and the Copernican universe expanded these works literary capacities. Additionally, such interpretation demonstrated to students how a particular key concept, in this case, the different conceptualizations of the universe, can incorporate itself into different works and thus formulate an intellectual trend within works of Golden Age theater. Also, Professor Gonzlez Echevarra showcased how profound analyses of literary works originate and found themselves upon careful interpretation of the details of the work, such as its diction, poetic form and verb forms utilized in its poetry. Professor Gonzlez Echevarras wonderful teachings expanded themselves even beyond the scope of the works discussed in class and developed his students knowledge and perception of literary criticism and the very conceptualization of literary history itself. For instance, Professor Gonzlez Echevarra dispelled the frequent interpretation of the Renaissance and Baroque literature as Europes comprehensive separation from Medieval literature and rather introduced students to a much more continuous and inclusive viewpoint, in which Renaissance and Baroque literatures manifest themselves as a grand continuation of Medieval literature. Therefore, Professor Gonzlez Echevarra effectively instructed students to question and challenge frequently accepted conceptualizations and perceptions, both towards particular works of literature and towards overall literary history. All in all, Professor Gonzlez Echevarras class consists of a wondrous and comprehensive development of his students reading and research abilities. ",
            "\u00a0I delved in the textual analysis of Golden Age Spanish Theatre, contextualized with reading from world renowned specialists and with the insightful scholarship of Prof. Gonzalez Echevarria, whose lectures were as eyeopening and enjoyable as the plays themselves. ",
            "\u00a0The course allowed me to learn more about Golden Age drama, through the reading of numerous authors I didnt know and others to whom my previous approach had been very superficial. I could also develop my close-reading skills, my capacities of associating the content of the works with other texts or artistic productions, and my knowledge of the period. ",
            "\u00a0The course gave me a greater understanding of the recurring themes of the Golden Age Theater of Spain, and sharpened my close reading skills. "
