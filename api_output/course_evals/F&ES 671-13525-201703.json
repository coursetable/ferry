            "\u00a0I learned so many different trees and shrubs! I learned to look at leaf margins, branching structure and ecological habits. ",
            "\u00a0I have acquired expert-level skill at identifying woody plants (major trees and shrubs) around CT. This skill is in depth; I have become successful at identifying 130+ plant species in temperate eastern U.S. forests. This skill is also vastly transferable to any ecosystem; I now have the fundamental ability to rapidly learn field identification of plants in any ecosystem. \r\n\r\nAs an aspiring forester, this is an incredibly crucial skill. ",
            "\u00a0Learned to identify plants and associate them with habitat and community organization. Also got to see a lot of interesting sites in the area and connect human land use and natural history to plant ID. Also learned how to continue to ID plants not covered in this course using plant traits, ID books, and online resources. ",
            "\u00a0I obtained a greater understanding of Northeast flora. This included taxonomic relationships, family and genus traits, and how to read the landscape. I also developed tools that would allow me to analyze plants and plant communities outside of the Northeast. ",

            "\u00a0Loved the course. I think Marlyse should teach it every year.\r\n\r\nWe learned fundamental woody plant identification and ecological context for 100-120 woody plants native to New England. Absolutely crucial for the MF degree at F&ES. I also gained a deeper appreciation for herbaria and plant collections, as well as a better understanding with phylogeny and hierarchical classifications in biology.\r\n\r\nI thought the quizzes and tests were very fair, even if I didnt always do so well on them. I cared a lot more about learning my treeseven though I appreciate the importance of the understory. But you can be fairly confident that I now know my 7 oaks apart based on bark.\r\n\r\nProjects: I found the final project really valuable, as Ive already mentioned. I also felt myself pulled toward some kind of herbarium-like projectand I think if I were a 1st-year thats what I would have done. Might be a useful addition: a 1-day class on collecting and mounting, and each person takes 10-20 species to do on their own really welland then with 10-12 people in the class, youve got a 1-200-species class herbarium to use for future classes? ",
            "\u00a0Most of all I learned just how much more there always is to learn about plants, and that was really cool. I love how much more confident I am now in my ID, taxonomy, and ecosystem skills, and I want to keep improving. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to identify common and important plant species in the field both leaf-on and leaf-off. I also learned about the important taxonomic distinctions between certain groups of trees and what characteristics are considered in determining these groupings. ",
            "\u00a0I learned SO MUCH about tree ID, tree physiology, natural history, and the ecosystems all around me at Yale and in Connecticut. I love being able to walk around the forest, city, and parks and identify and understand better what I see. ",

            "\u00a0In this class, we learned pretty much exactly what I expected to learn. The one qualifier that I will bring up here is that we spent a lot of time on woody shrubs and understory plants. Although I fully appreciate the value of this, in hindsight I would have expected that we would have covered identification of large, basal area important woody species, such as identifying a fir or spruce to spp level, before covering 7 spp. of Viburnum and 4 spp. of Ilex. ",

            "\u00a0I loved the field trips, including to the NYBG, the Peabody, the cedar swamp, the trap rock ridge, the Richards property, and the Berkshires. Particularly valuable: getting to see a wide range of ecosystems in CT (and nearby), getting to visit herbaria (which Id known essentially nothing about before the class), and getting to see a few rather rare biomes.\r\n\r\nI ultimately did do a good portion of the reading, but not on the timetable you suggestedand I think that was my mistake, because I think I would have gotten even more out of the class if Id been reading the phylogeny stuff earlier on. Not sure how to push more students to do this reading up front, but something to think about. ",

            "\u00a0My expectations were largely met for this course. The weekly quizzes and generous amount of time spent in the field were both effective ways of developing confidence in woody plant ID. \r\n\r\nA few things that I wish we had also covered:\r\n- more family-level plant characteristics\r\n- a little more practice with dichotomous keys\r\n- a short reading for each ecotype we visited (coastal, mesic mid slope, sandy glacial outwash, etc) like the one we had for trap rock ridges could also be nice "

            "\u00a0Strengths are that it's always outdoors and engaging. Weaknesses that maybe we couldn't have like 30 extra class mins of lecture? But maybe everyone would hate that? ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Dr. Marlyse Duguid is an incredible instructor. Her knowledge about the plants and ecosystems in Connecticut is unrivaled by any other expert that I have spoken to. I will qualify this statement:  I went to an elite Connecticut institution for my undergraduate, where I studied ecology and environmental sciences. I have also worked for Connecticut Fund for the Environment and Save the Sound, and interacted with a handful of F&ES professors in class and at F&ES.\r\n\r\nThat aside, Dr. Duguid is likewise an incredible instructor. The level of detail and enthusiasm with which she approached each minute of our classes was exceptional, and met the high expectations that I bring to my classes at F&ES. She is an amazing asset to the forestry faculty, and I hope that she remains an integral part of the faculty here during the rest of my time here. ",
            "\u00a0Loved going to the field sites, and appreciated the weekly quizzes to keep me learning. \r\n\r\nWould have liked to learn plants to the level of order (taxon) from the get go. This would have made the final (phylogenetic relationships) easier. Would also have liked plant material to be available for study during the week (at Marsh?). ",
            "\u00a0The strength, above all else, was being in the field with Professor Duguid and learning how to identify plants by traits and environmental characteristics. The corresponding element picked up was how to read and understand the landscape based on the plants present. The weakness of the class was perhaps its size, which at times impeded the ability to have access to the information taught. To resolve this issue, it may be worth maintaining a cap on the class size. ",
            "\u00a0Smaller class size, and inclusion of all students ",
            "\u00a0The number of people didnt seem a problem at first, but as the semester went on I became more and more aware that it was a slowing force. My recommendation would be: be firmer and limit it to 10-12, with a priority list, and that ultimately it should be a core class for virtually all 1st-semester MFs.\r\n\r\nAnother thought on phylogeny: the first class could include a little more overview of the families youd eventually cover, and their relations to each otherthe last 2-3 pages of the syllabus, basically, to set the stage for later. I also think that one way to build on ID more from week to week would be to either ask for the generals at first and gradually ask for more and more specificity, or ask for species first, adding gradually higher levels of connectionor both (i.e., start by asking for just genus, then genus and family, then genus, species and family, then genus, species, family & order). ",
            "\u00a0I wish we had spent more time on taxonomy/phylogeny throughout the semester. It was hard to go back and study those things for the final exam when we hadn't talked about them much since the very beginning of the class. Similarly, it was hard to suddenly have to learn twig ID right at the end (I know that the twig ID used skills we had been cultivating all along, and it was definitely necessary and fun to learn, but it still felt like a departure from the rest of the class). I loved the field-based nature of the class but it would be helpful to also have just a little more structure to help keep up with learning and retaining all of those other things besides just the new plants each week. ",
            "\u00a0The course had many strengths and was very hands-on. Importantly, we also covered various specimens multiple times, which ensured that we could recognize the specimen across a varieties of contexts. My only suggestion for something that could improve the course would actually be to have one or two classroom-based sessions explaining some key identifying and taxonomic concepts before going into the field. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of the course are that every week is in a different location around CT - this was amazing! Also that the professor was SO knowledgeable and truly loves her craft and the material and was eager to share it. The course is structured in a great way for me to learn.\r\nThe T.A. was great, especially in leading \"study sessions\" in the woods outside of normal class time to bolster our ID skills - these were so much fun and so helpful! ",
            "\u00a0The only thing I would have liked was more reviewing of species in different locations. Also it would have been nice to have a more formal twig review before the final. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- Ample field time\r\n- Very Southern New England focused and thus extremely useful for anyone doing local field work\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Sometimes I wished for more higher-level information about plant genera and families. We spent most of our time looking at plants in the field and rarely had time to synthesize information and discuss general patterns\r\n- The class size was just large enough that we were a cumbersome group out in the field. It was sometimes hard to hear the professor speak or see plant details. "

            "\u00a0Expect to be outside and learn lots of Latin. The course gets harder as the semester gets deeper. ",
            "\u00a0Do the readings in the beginning of the course; the plant ID traits that you learn will make more sense. Likewise, keep up on taxonomy, including orders of plants and phylogeny of orders (as well as families, but that part is required so should be obvious) so as to facilitate a higher level of learning with the material.\r\n\r\nAlso, focus on buds even when there are leaves around; you'll be better off when the leaves fall off in time for the end of semester twig exam.\r\n\r\nEnjoy! ",

            "\u00a0a)Do all of the readings on the suggested timeline--you will get far more out of the course\r\n\r\nb)Create flash cards for yourself early on and review them regularly--not just cramming for each plant ID quiz.\r\n\r\nc)Learn twig ID from the get-go--this will end up being far more reliable and useful for you by the end of the semester (and through the winter--beyond the course) than relying on leaves (and mature bark's not always available).\r\n\r\nd)Learn the relationships between the different species you're memorizing early on--not just genus and family, but also order and above. ",
            "\u00a0This was the most fun class I took this semester, and also the most immediately practically applicable. Even people who don't plan to work in forests should learn this material. ",
            "\u00a0Do not focus too much on leaf identification, but do on habitat range, bark and buds. ",

            "\u00a0Take the class! It's a lot of fun and you learn so much about what is all around you. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely recommend taking this class for students planning on doing field work in New England. For MF and MFS students, I think it's an appropriate class to take in the first semester, along with Forest Stand Dynamics. The class is also a wonderful opportunity for anyone interested in plants, natural history, and ecology, to gain a better sense of place in Connecticut as well as develop plant ID skills that can be widely applied to plant communities across the globe.
