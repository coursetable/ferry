            "\u00a0I learned how to analyze readings for point, style, and voice, and how to apply techniques from the readings to my own creative nonfiction essays. ",

            "\u00a0We learned a lot of specific writing techniques. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about various skills and tools utilized by major essayists and writers, but also ways to improve the unfavorable writerly habits I end up falling into - the class really introduces you to a variety of great writers and gives you the opportunity to improve your own writing and discover your own voice. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about different writing techniques and became more confident as a writer. ",

            "\u00a0A strength of the course was that Pam gave excellent feedback on the drafts of the essays that really helped my writing to improve. Also, the readings were fun and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Fantastic course. One of the best I've taken at Yale. Few to no weaknesses. Only strengths--teacher, format, curriculum, papers. ",
            "\u00a0The readings for this class were great but I thought discussion could have been better. It sometimes felt like  a high school class because we were expected to give very specific answers to discussion questions. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are the opportunities to write in itself - we really got a chance to showcase our writing and workshop them to get the most out of each assignment and each students voice; however, with the assigned readings and discussion in class, I feel as though discussion became increasingly redundant and a bit unproductive, albeit interesting nonetheless. I think by letting discussion roam more freely among students, each seminar meeting could be more interesting and productive, especially later in the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I like the writing workshops and being able to submit drafts of my essays. ",
            "\u00a0My strengths lie in my syntax and precision of word choice. ",

            "\u00a0the essays on the syllabus were so great and the way we discussed them in class was super effective and interesting. the format of turning in a draft then getting to revise it the next week was really great to help get specific advice on how to improve my writing ",
            "\u00a0Too many readings at times; I feel as though the class could benefit from narrowing down a survey of readings per genre to a few enlightening pieces. "

            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to another student because the feedback received on the drafts helped me to improve my writing skills and become more confident in my voice and style. ",
            "\u00a0Yes--ABSOLUTELY. No matter what major a student is, the skills they will develop in this course will help them. Fantastic way to get a WR credit. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the reading and assignments and liked class a little but less but still would probably recommend it because the assignments were very interesting and the peer editing process is cool/ a good experience. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone looking to improve their overall writing ability. The course isnt necessarily about perfecting your writing or writing extremely experimental creative works, rather modeling your essays off the essays we read and mastering a more objective craft of good writing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the readings are wonderful and have helped me improve as a writer. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This course definitely explores non-fiction writing in a nuanced yet interesting way. You learn a lot about the different techniques employed by authors and about ways you can incorporate the ones you like into your own writing. The feedback on essays are very detailed and helpful in providing directionality for improvement. English 120 was honestly one of my favorite courses this year. Truly, it was an amazing, eye-opening class. Don't believe me? Take it and see! ",
            "\u00a0Yes--it was quite enjoyable, and did develop my writing. ",
            "\u00a0yes!!! i think it really improved my writing skills and increased my confidence in my abilities as a writer. plus the essays we read for the class were soooo good! overall a great and fun class -- i think everyone should take english 120 before graduating!!! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It was a good class, but I definitely think it was hyped up more than necessary. Don't expect a life-changing class or anythin ",
            "\u00a0Definitely recommend this class if you're interested in journalism or magazine writing. It's a good way to write about non-fiction without it being boring like a textbook or history books. "
