            "\u00a0I appreciate the fact that the professors approach the texts with the context in mind without being historicist. Bringing in texts from various religious traditions also helps the students understand the prevalence of apocalyptic thinking and its relevance to the contemporary world. It is wonderful that the theme of apocalcypticism is examined with an interdisciplinary approach, with a focus on the fundamental texts and issues transcending disciplinary boundaries. "
