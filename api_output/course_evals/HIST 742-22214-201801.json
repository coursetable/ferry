            "\u00a0I learned a lot more about the different approaches to writing about the environment and its connection to human life in this course. Although I still dont feel like I really know what the environmental humanities is, in terms of a concrete definition, I have a much better sense of the kinds of work that can be done in the environmental humanities and which disciplines can be involved. ",
            "\u00a0none ",
            "\u00a0This was an extremely useful and lively course, and introduced me to the major questions, issues, and challenges that the environmental humanities deal with. It also helped me to think more about how to engage with the environmental humanities outside of my own discipline, and learn to think across fields and disciplines. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: graduate student engagement and leadership (through designing the syllabus and leading class discussions); very good syllabus; visits from outside professors/authors; high level of class discussion; very good written comments from the professor, as well as guidance outside of class. Weaknesses: not enough historical background on some of the materials and areas studied. ",
            "\u00a0interdisciplinary and engaging conversation ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course was definitely its interdisciplinarity. We learned a lot from each other and about the differing orientations across our fields. At the same time, the capaciousness of the environmental humanities and the multitude of disciplines represented could create a sense of disorder and lack of coherence. While we had fascinating discussions, some were more productive than others. ",
            "\u00a0One of the greatest strengths of this course was in its syllabus design, as well as the student participation/discussion. Each week, we had two student leaders for the topic, and having a multiplicity of voices, viewpoints, and ideas in \"leadership\" positions was such a rich and wonderful element of the course. The syllabus was also designed in such a way that the readings spoke to each other across the different weeks and themes, and I loved that we had key-terms that helped to articulate and focus our discussions and thoughts.

It's a great opportunity to read crucial works outside of one's discipline, and to engage in discussions in a really encouraging, lively, and diverse space. "
