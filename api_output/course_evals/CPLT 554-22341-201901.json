            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about narrative theory, the application of cognitive science to literature, techniques in third-person narration, and external representation of interiority. ",
            "\u00a0Deeper understanding of narratological theory, terms, insights, ways of encountering texts.\r\nExposure to theory of mind literature - cognitive psych and philosophical/ethical aspects.\r\nConnections - similarities, differences, links - among Austen, Eliot, James, Woolf.\r\nAnalytical perspective on how these texts \"work\" that will be helpful in my own writing. ",
            "\u00a0I renewed a love for literature in this course.  I also developed skill to think in new ways about the cognitive lives of characters.  It was fascinating to grapple with the minds of literary characters.  This course seems to have been designed to guide us through distinct styles over time, which it did, but it also beautifully connected the theorists and concepts from the beginning to the end of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Ruth's brief overviews of stylistic characteristics before class conversations were some of the most informative \"lectures\" I've had at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0This was a helpful course to begin thinking about narratology and trends in the portrayal of minds across several styles of authorship. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were its carefully chosen primary and secondary sources, its sustained focus on a complex concept in literature, and Ruth's incredibly able discussion-leading. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: extremely knowledgeable professor who was both rigorous and kind; excellent readings (primary and secondary); excellent lecture portions of each seminar; great \"mini-conference\" in which we all had the opportunity to read each other's mid-term papers and discuss them; the professor was available and generous with her time, both in responding to our written work and in discussing paper topics.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: class participation was hesitant and/or desultory (I'm not exactly sure why); the professor signaled a discomfort with, or lack of enthusiasm for, the secondary readings that were not classic narratological theory, and I think this may have stifled what could have been a richer discussion of those aspects. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course are the sequence of readings (both novels and theorists) and the wonderful weekly time of discussion.  Though it might not be feasible, this course could be improved if held over a year-long period, potentially giving students an extra week to read some of the longer/more difficult texts, and also to expand even more upon the aspect of consciousness in literature. ",
            "\u00a0A strength was the diversity of novels, but it might have been nice to read some more recent or perhaps even more divisive critical pieces. "

        [
            "\u00a0Absolutely. It was an incredible subject, taught well. It's easy to imagine transferring the concepts gleaned here to many another context. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if the person is interested in writing narrative, in becoming a more thoughtful reader of fiction, or in thinking about theory of mind and consciousness. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to another student.  However, I would encourage that student to do some preliminary reading that bridges the gap between literature and the cognitive sciences. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, students who are interested in doing literary work on the novel should take this course. Though challenging, I would encourage students to take this course even if they need a 19th C novel primer. ",
            "\u00a0I would strongly recommend this course, because it provides a way of reading these texts, which are very important on their own, in a justifiably interrelated way, and the importance of the portrayal of interiority is crucial to the novel genre. "
