            "\u00a0This is a fabulous course! Within three months I learned about a variety of global governance organizations, challenges, and new developments. Overall, this has been one of my most favorite classes at Yale - mainly because Ambassador Sergeyev is such an insightful teacher. He goes out of his way to ensure that all possible resources of information, opportunities, and ideas are thoroughly explored. He is a wealth of knowledge and Yale is blessed to have him as a teacher. "

            "\u00a0Very good overview of the issues, while simultaneously allowing greater depth of study on specific topics based on student interest. ",
            "\u00a0Wonderful  course! ",
            "\u00a0Lectures are boring if no one does the reading, but topics are mostly interesting. A lot of dense information about policy. Prof is great though, and subjects are important. They provide a good foundation for moving forward in the field. An easy course if you put in the work and are engaged in class! ",
            "\u00a0I do not know if there were any weaknesses in this course - perhaps that we did not have more time to visit the UN on several occasions rather than just one - which was mainly due to the fact that students' schedules did not overlap cohesively. This course is incredibly fair and not politically skewed. Ambassador Sergeyev always goes out of his way to address both sides of an argument - constantly asking us to list the strengths and weaknesses and to question everything. He is a genuine and personable teacher who is passionate about his work and wants to impart that same passion to the younger generation. His view of global affairs is engaging - especially seeing as he has lived and worked in innumerable countries and has had a variety of experiences. "

            "\u00a0Without hesitation, I would strongly recommend this course to other students if they want to develop a stronger understanding of the process and challenges of global governance. "
