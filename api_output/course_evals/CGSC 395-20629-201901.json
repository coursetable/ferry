            "\u00a0This course was great for getting a better understanding of the diversity of cognitive science-related topics being researched by Yale professors. The weekly assignments also helped to develop critical reading skills and my ability to analyze scientific papers. ",
            "\u00a0Heard some lectures ",

            "\u00a0A strength was hearing professors from different disciplines speak, and thus gaining a baseline level of knowledge across various topics. A weakness was that having gone into this class knowing my particular area of focus within Cognitive Science, some of the lectures that were very unrelated to my area of interested (e.g. philosophy, anthropology) seemed a bit irrelevant and boring. ",
            "\u00a0The course should have been a Fall semester course; by the time the end of the semester rolled around, it was too late to start working in some of the labs that we were hearing about. Moving the course earlier would only help to improve the entire purpose and goal of the class: helping us find a research spot for our thesis.\r\n\r\nIt was also a surprisingly high amount of work for a half-credit course, given it met for a full seminar time slot every week, and had two weekly assignments and an (albeit short) final assignment. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are very disjoint, but some are good. the main thing this class could use id more stuff to help you prepare for your thesis directly, since that's the point anyway (e.g. like more in-depth versions of the three senior thing). Also make it later in the day. half the class was always asleep. ",
            "\u00a0it was very well organized to give junior cogsci majors guidance. while the double weekly responses were annoying, they did help me get more out of the class by keeping me engaged and making sure I was thinking critically and asking deep questions about the material "
