            "\u00a0I mostly learned bits and pieces about the home cities of my fellow classmates, as the course is structured on personal research and presentation each class. There's very little actual instruction that happens. I did feel like my presentation skills and design skills (e.g. Adobe Illustrator) improved. ",
            "\u00a0I have gained the ability to notice trends within urban development, and how to notice designs within the urban landscape that can better assist in economic development of the area. I learned what bad designs look like, and real-world contextualizations of those bad designs. I also learned about both national and local efforts to redevelop urban areas, and how those myriad efforts both failed and succeeded in their respective times and places. ",
            "\u00a0Introductory urban planning and general negotiation skills ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to analyze cities from an economic development perspective, as well as a planning perspective. \r\n\r\nI also developed my skills in Adobe Illustrator (thanks to our great TA) and my presentation skills in general. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about the theory of urban design; I am so happy to have taken this class. ",
            "\u00a0While the course's insights on theories of planning throughout the 20th century are offered elsewhere at Yale, STCY is unique in its down-to-earth approach to teaching students about the various actors at play in the process of specific development challenges. "

            "\u00a0It would be extremely helpful if we were taught concepts broadly before doing research and presenting on our home towns, because that would give us a framework to use when doing our research. I don't think assigning readings is sufficient. Similarly, in the \"games,\" I think there should be more background information and clearer expectations for each character. Being thrown in with no existing knowledge is stressful and overwhelming. ",
            "\u00a0The course is lacking in substance. More thorough explanations of real estate dynamics and a more well-thought-out lesson plan would be appropriate. A lot of the time it felt like we were reading the textbook, looking at a whole bunch of examples, but not being able to clearly understand what is linking everything together, or what the compounding variable between them all is. Strengths include the development of presentation skills. ",
            "\u00a0This course really pushes students to learn quickly through the independent weekly projects that are required, and through the games. I like that the course pushed me out of my comfort zone, but I do wish I had had a few more resources to  ultimately improve the quality of my work. The extra technology help sessions with the TA were helpful, and more guidance on how to research and present our work would have been helpful too. ",
            "\u00a0This class is taught straight from the book of Professor Garvin. If you agree with his theories you'll love it, if you don't, then you won't. ",
            "\u00a0The games forced students (or me, at least) to do a great deal of independent research pertaining to their role, and consequently had a lot to offer. I would not know what a REIT is, or how to fill out a proforma were it not for the games. Overall, though, the workload was far too high for a 1-credit undergraduate course, and not enough guidance was given on an assignment to assignment basis. ",
            "\u00a0I really loved the variety of teaching methods used in this course. I enjoyed researching and presenting about various aspects that affected the development of my hometown in our weekly assignments and discussing the differences between mine and my peers' hometowns in our discussions. In addition, although the three \"games\" required a lot of preparation work, I found the role-playing very engaging and felt that I learned a lot from the real-time adaptation during class time that was necessary to being \"successful\".\r\n\r\nHowever, I am extremely concerned about the lack of female representation in the course. All of our assigned readings that weren't from Professor Garvin's textbook were written by male authors. All three of our guest speakers for the games were men. Furthermore, in our final assignment, we were directed to \"[use] both primary sources....secondary sources...and the theoretical framework provided by MEN like Thompson, Firey, Egli, Christaller, Park, and Burgess [to] write a provocative essay...\" (emphasis mine). I find it immensely frustrating that a course strongly recommended to Yale freshman interested in architecture (a predominantly male industry) did not make even one attempt to highlight successful female architects or urban theorists. How are we to encourage more young women to become involved in architecture if they are not exposed to female role models in the field and thus do not feel that there is precedence for them to succeed?

            "\u00a0Take it - Garvin is a jewel ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student that is seriously interested in economic development or urban studies. Keep in mind that this class (unlike many others at Yale) does NOT take a social issues approach to urban studies. This course is rewarding in that the work you do for independent projects and games feels realistic and important. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to anyone willing to learn more about the cities we live in. It's such an encompassing part of our lives that doesn't often get noticed. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course if you have no prior exposure to commercial real estate development and want to learn about it, because STCY forces you to do so. I would not recommend it to students looking for a survey course on planning. "
