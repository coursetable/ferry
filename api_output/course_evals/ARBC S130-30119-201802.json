            "\u00a0I gained a much more thorough knowledge of Arabic grammar and vocabulary, as well as a great improvement in my speaking ability and my listening ability. ",
            "\u00a0I developed my comprehension skills a lot more and I feel more confident about my speaking skills. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt new vocabulary and grammar concepts. I also improved my writing and speaking skills. ",
            "\u00a0a continuation of MSA; learning the grammar and vocab in Al-Kitaab part 2 but more importantly, learning vocab concerning in class discussions. gained the skill of being able to communicate very complex ideas such as racism and terrorism which was surprising. "

            "\u00a0The small class sizes and long class hours were a major strength of this course. This gave us plenty of opportunity for individualized instruction and speaking practice during class while still having time to cover vocab and concepts. I think the weaknesses were in the overall layout. There was no clear syllabus given out and there was a lot of material to cover in a very short amount of time and this lead to some chapters and concepts feeling rushed. ",
            "\u00a0The small classes really helped students achieve personalized instruction and clear understanding of topics. ",
            "\u00a0The course enabled me to immerse myself in Moroccan and Arab culture and in the Arabic language. I was compelled to communicate in Arabic and became more confident speaking. The class size was small which allowed us to receive one-on-one attention from our professor. The trips and excursions were wonderful, and I enjoyed calligraphy and cooking. I loved my host family. \r\n\r\nThe chapters could have been paced better so that we could have finished chapter 5 before the final exam. The language tables could be improved and the lectures could be made simpler. Tuesdays and Thursdays should have been made less busy. I also feel that students should be provided with an outline of the course before they apply for it so that they can get a better idea of its pace and demands. ",
            "\u00a0The strength was definitely in Karim and Taofik because they are both incredible professors that made 4 hours of MSA feel like 1. They were engaging and so brilliant in assessing our needs so fast. The rest of the staff at qalam was also incredible. Also the excursions were great, however I feel like we could have done without the US embassy visit. \r\n\r\nThe weakness was in the often messy schedule. Sometimes we would be waiting around for 20 minutes for an activity only to know it was cancelled or would be taking place in Agdal. Also, the schedule just didn't accurately reflect the activities of the day as some would be nonexistent. Also, language partners were not helpful. Lastly, I feel that although talking about different subjects in class that werent directly related to the lesson was helpful, i also feel like more time could have been spent on grammar. "

            "\u00a0If you are interested in pursuing Arabic in L5 and beyond this is very much worthwhile. You will improve so much in such a short amount of time and it will save you from two whole semesters of having class everyday. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The course was very intense and requires a lot of work, but all of the experiences are amazing! The trips, the people, and the classes make the experience one of the best experiences a student will probably have at Yale. The program taught us Arabic, but also let us have fun and bond with other Yale students in a way I personally had not done at school. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course but would warn that it is fast-paced. The teachers and institute are excellent. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I had the best summer ever. I would definitely recommend this to a student interested in A) focusing on MSA and B) wanting to enjoy a study abroad experience while still being productive. "
