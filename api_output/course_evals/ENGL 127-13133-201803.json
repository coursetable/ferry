            "\u00a0I learned how to further develop my close reading skills as well as incorporate arguments by another literary scholar in my writing - I can now say that I feel comfortable close reading a text and then writing an essay about it. Furthermore, I learned to question traditional notions of English. This course made me question what American Literature is, who is \"American\", and which of these Americans get to decide what goes into the canon. In doing this, I discovered new ways to think about race, class, whiteness, and sexuality. ",
            "\u00a0We read an incredible mix of authors from different periods of American literature. I loved how Professor Hickey constructed a syllabus that allowed us to read everything from Moby Dick to Ocean Vuogn. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read deeply, engage in a conversation regarding what we read, and take the knowledge gained from the deep reading and conversation to better understand what it means to be American. ",
            "\u00a0I gained close reading skills and learned how to write a paper combining close reading with outside research. I also gained a deeper understanding of what \"American literature\" truly is, and why the definition is still being debated. The literature we read was thought-provoking and meaningful, and I left feeling as if I learned a great deal about history and literature. ",
            "\u00a0This class not only strengthened my critical reading and writing skills, but also the experience demanded a deeper thoughtfulness and interrogation of literature (as a historical and social product) that I had not previously been called upon to exercise. This is a fabulous, deeply meaningful class if taken with Professor Hickey. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to critically read a greater amount of text in a given period between classes, became a stronger and more daring writer, and became more aware of and attuned to questioning what the parameters of the canon we typically consider \"American literature.\" I also found that class discussions were extremely fruitful, as the texts we read allowed for and benefitted from the broad variety of my classmates' interpretations. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read critically and use secondary academic sources in my essays. ",
            "\u00a0I feel like I learned a lot about identities and what it means to identify literature/American literature/what have you. For skills, I learned how to think critically about what we read and why we were reading it which is something I definitely think is worthwhile. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: PROFESSOR HICKEY! PROFESSOR HICKEY'S READING LIST! PROFESSOR HICKEY'S DOG AT OFFICE HOURS! There is a common thread here - if you can take this course with Professor Hickey please do so! She's the only reason I got through this course. \r\nWeaknesses: It would be nice to turn \"rough drafts\" in for feedback like ENGL 114 and 115 allows. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the variety of authors that we experienced during this class. I thought class discussion was also structured very well. I love how Professor Hickey sometimes led class discussion and, at other times, had a discussion leader. There was also a variety of ways to express opinions on the text- from discussion boards to in class to essays to office hours. I'm not sure that I can even name one way that this class could be improved because I enjoyed it so much. Maybe having in class time to workshop essays. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths\r\nvaried authors (though Moby Dick was a lot, perhaps too much)\r\nsmall class size allowed for thorough conversation\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\nsome works felt outdated (Moby Dick)\r\nI liked how we read a variety of authors, specifically ending with There There. ",
            "\u00a0American Literature with Professor Hickey was interesting, fun, and thought-provoking. Readings were usually very manageable (aside from the monstrosity that is Moby Dick, but even that wasn't too bad), and you leave the class feeling like you've accomplished something. We received guidance on our papers and the professor encouraged us to come to office hours to discuss our ideas, so I never felt truly in the dark. Overall, this was the most enjoyable English course I have taken at Yale so far (and I've taken quite a few). ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus with Professor Hickey is very good. We read some books that I now count among my favorites: Night Sky With Exit Wounds, The Fire Next Time, for example. Professor Hickey is also an AMAZING Professor. She is so, so thoughtful, SO SMART, so eloquent, and so supportive. I think there were some points where our discussions lulled (mostly during Moby Dick, though), but she is otherwise super engaging and very kind. ",
            "\u00a0The way that the course is set up as an examination of American literature from a critical standpoint makes sense and works. I think it would have been nice to mix up the order of what we read, as opposed to going chronologically. There wasn't enough time to go as deep as we wanted to into a lot of the texts, but I'm not really sure how that could be improved without reading less, which would not necessarily be an improvement. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is the syllabus which provides a fairly broad and balanced set of materials for the course. Another strength is the fact that it is a seminar, which is really important for discussion. The weakness at times was the students, who threw around big terms  toxic masculinity, heteronormativity, racism  with a kind of reckless abandon. This made conversations hard because this was very charged language that they often didn't ground in the text. ",
            "\u00a0Ive shopped a lot of American Literature courses in my time at Yale before getting into this one, and I have also heard a lot of things about different professors in the English department that teach this course that is required for the major. I think a weakness is that some professors solely wanted to focus on the white male American narrative (why they persist to make Walt Whitman into the hero of all heroes, I will never know), and since it is 2019 now I think that is something they need to get over, but you know, live your life. A HUGE strength of this section in particular is that that syllabus was so diverse! It made me come away with even more questions about who the hell qualifies as American and while the syllabus is up to every professors discretion, if the English department ever reads this evaluation - you should definitely not start with Walt Whitman. I mean just go to the Beinecke of all places if you want ideas for other American authors (Indigenous - arguably the most American-y Americans can get) like John Rollin Ridge. The Beinecke has a shit ton of papers that predate Whitman. Honestly, the only reason I have problems with Walt Whitman is because he is considered the threshold of where American Literature truly began. Fuck that. Walt Whitman wrote some poetry, it was pretty good, I will give you that, but it did not start with him. Just because he had enough money and privilege to get his own works circulated at that time should not make him the start. I brought this up in class one time that we should do what AP US History did where they now have to teach starting in 1491 as opposed to 1492 in part due to Charles Manns book (you guessed it) 1491. I cant believe I am allotted so many characters to write this evaluation! Do people actually use all of these characters? Surely not. Anyways, English Department at Yale, if you are listening, please make your American Literature syllabi include more People of Color/Women/Transpeople/Whoever because not all of us (in fact, some might argue, a majority of us) resonate with the white American man that you persist to teach.

            "\u00a0If you're an English major I would definitely recommend this course for one of the three foundational courses that we have to take as it exposes us to the \"classics\" and those seem important I guess. If you're not an English major - yes. This was a pretty easy WR credit with only three essays plus it introduces you to some important topics in English and your writing will improve. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was definitely challenging but even if you are not an English major, I think that every Yale student should take this course to experience American literature. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I felt like we read a wide array of American literature, and we addressed many problems associated with what can be reliably coined American. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course, especially with Professor Hickey. It was both enjoyable AND challenging, which is a wonderful mix. ",
            "\u00a0YES. But take it Professor Hickey. Throughout the course, we keep in mind the identity politics of \"American\" literature (what does it mean even for literature to be \"American\"? What voices are represented or silenced?) Such a fantastic class, and it's about so much more than just dry analysis of Moby Dick. The class is really colorful, and offers valuable insight about the historical memory of this country and our present world. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I read a lot of texts that I may not have picked up on my own, and I'm glad that I was able to understand and process them in a class. I feel like I grew a ton as a writer and contributor to discussions. Professor Hickey's clear passion and ability to connect to students makes the classroom dynamic casual enough for discussions to be comfortable and honest without ever sacrificing the intellectual rigor of the class. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! It is a joy to read canonical works like Moby Dick, Civil Rights masterpieces from James Baldwin, and new entrants like There There by Tommy Orange. "
