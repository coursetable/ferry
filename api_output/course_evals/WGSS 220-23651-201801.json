            "\u00a0Knowledge-wise, I better understand the causes and consequences of women's political under-representation worldwide. I also know more about gender stereotypes in politics.\r\n\r\nSkill-wise, I believe that I am a better writer. I also better understand the structure of empirical political science research and can critically analyze it better.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this course, I hope to become a better ally of women in politics. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about research design of political science studies. Specifically, I learned more about how political science research is conducted and how to further understand these research articles. I also learned quite a bit about governments around the world, especially in regard to women's political participation. ",
            "\u00a0This course covered a broad range of topics relating to gender and politics. Although the focus was on gender, it also taught a great deal about political systems themselves, and helped us learn about the ranging impacts of different structures. The course also focused on research itself, helping me learn about research design and further understand the papers we were reading in this class, and in my other classes. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a multifaceted understanding of the interaction between gender and politics, primarily with regards to the ways in which the gender of candidates affects their ability to both get elected and actually have a substantive impact once elected. In gaining this understanding, I developed insight into the ways in which we might start to redress the gender discrepancies that established political institutions perpetuate. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about research methods in political science and the class operates in some ways as a literature review of what kinds of things are political scientists thinking about right now re: gender. This class is not about critical approaches as much as building a sweeping picture of gender in western democracies. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about gender (and also race and sexuality) in political systems.  As part of that, I learned much more about political science research, as well as about different political, electoral, and party systems as a whole. "

        [
            "\u00a0Knowledge gaps were easy to overcome in this course. I think that first-years interested in political science can thrive in this course without feeling intimidated and that senior political scientists like myself have much to learn too. \r\n\r\nIn terms of attracting students, this course is weak in that it requires a lot of writing without the \"reward.\" Majors would consider this course more heavily if one could earn a WR. ",
            "\u00a0The class itself is very interesting, and the readings are fairly easy to get through. I think the class could be improved by discussing the readings more in depth, or perhaps varying the readings to they aren't almost all research articles. ",
            "\u00a0This class rendered interesting discussions, led by both the professor and the students. I sometimes wish that we read more narrative or first person pieces connecting gender and politics. ",
            "\u00a0This class would benefit from narrowing its focus more explicitly either in the title or the components of the syllabus. We read many kinds of empirical articles but not much theory and our readings heavily leaned towards western democracies so the class could be more self aware/ transparent in what is going to be learned. ",
            "\u00a0The readings and discussions were very interesting.  I enjoyed the mini-lectures as well, I think the course was well structured to facilitate learning.  My greatest frustrations were with the syntheses of the readings--it was a nice check to make sure I really did them, but they seemed to be graded so harshly!  I felt like I got better grades when I didn't do the readings and made stuff up based on the abstracts and intros. "

            "\u00a0I love Professor Aldrich. She cares about our well-being, as evidenced by the fact that we began each class with at least 10 minutes of talking completely unrelated to course material. In most of the early weeks, she also began class with \"mini-lectures\" that help us understand more about the practice of political science research. Having students co-leading discussion with Professor Aldrich chiming in makes participation easy, but interpreting a few of the articles was rough. \r\n\r\nRegarding the other assignments, it took a couple weeks to figure out how to write the \"perfect\" reading response. Not all of the readings could easily be synthesized in the way that she wished. The three-essay option felt less demanding than the research design option, and Professor Aldrich is also very helpful in office hours.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in women's political representation, I recommend the course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I absolutely would. Professor Aldrich is great  she genuinely cares about the class and values the feedback from students. The readings are interesting, the work load is manageable, and you'll learn a lot about female involvement in government around the world. Beware, it is a lot of writing, but Professor Aldrich is very supportive and makes it manageable. The class itself was very fun and Professor Aldrich creates a great learning environment. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course, as it provides an overview of the ways in which gender plays into politics on a global scale. It explicates the challenges faced by women seeking to enter politics as well as those that have gained entry into a still male-dominated political arena, highlighting specific causes for their relative successes and failures. The understandings and insights provided by this course are crucial for anyone seeking to study or enter politics. ",
            "\u00a0I think this would be a good class for people who like to study the social sciences with data and proof. This class is also great for good discussions and the professor is awesome. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great class.  Very social-science hard-hitting, will teach you how to really analyze political science papers and construct good research.  I really came away from this class understanding that underrepresented political groups are underrepresented not really because of social factors but because of political structures.  This class has really influenced my interests within the political science major. "
