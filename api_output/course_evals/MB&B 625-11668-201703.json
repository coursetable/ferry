            "\u00a0I enjoyed that we would learn a topic in a broader sense and then discuss a paper that dives deeper into the topic. There has not been much feedback on the homework. Therefore, the students are unable to learn from mistakes. Another weakness is how the discussion is set up. Rather than an actual discussion based conversation, many instructors had each person answer a question regarding the paper, which didn't seem to promote discussion. ",
            "\u00a0The course provides a general background of genetics in many important ways. However, it is too short to get a solid understanding of many interesting concepts and have a deeper understanding. \r\n\r\nI think for students interested in genetics and considering joining the department, I would like to see more genetic courses included in the 1st curriculum as opposed to cell biology and biochemical approaches. Particularly, I would recommend adding courses in human genetics as this an area that has been overlooked by the department, some examples include: human molecular genetics, genomics (should be mandatory for every geneticist), statistical genetics/probability, cancer genetics, among others.  Also, courses in animal models and gene-editing, should be given as potential electives for first year students \r\n\r\nIn practical terms, out of all lectures taken in this course only six are relevant to my research, and sometimes it made me feel taking this course was a burden rather an intelectually stimulating experience. In addition, It is  important that the professor lecturing about a particular topic has a wider understanding of their field and a solid background in genetics, as for some of them it was very clear they were physicians who have been trained in medicine and then made the leap into human genetics.\r\n\r\nHow to improve the course: talk less about genetic screens (I think 4/7 THQs were about genetic screens) Talk about cancer!. Break the section into smaller groups 15 people, and do not force to talk instead let them express when they are confortable. \r\n\r\nChoose the room locations better and have all discussions meet at the same time perhaps with a multiple professors as it is done in the cell molecular biology course. \r\n\r\nYou might even change the grading scheme, perhaps instead of assigning  big THQs give more but smaller homework focusing on different topics covered. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are very well-organized and can expand our knowledge in genetics. I just have one suggestion for the discussion part. It would be great if the teachers or TAs can give us some feedbacks on our synopsis. I actually take it seriously and regard it as a good opportunity to improve my writing skills. However, it turns out that all students get 3 points no matter what and there are no feedback about the synopsis. ",
            "\u00a0It would greatly improve the course if the students could receive a feedback on their homework. Without knowing the proper answers to the questions, THQs effectively have zero educational utility. Currently, the sole purpose of the THQs are to stratify students and give grades. It is unclear how beneficial that is to a graduate student.\r\n\r\nOffice hours was a temporary solution but it is still not as accessible as having answers distributed. Even for a graduate student, while juggling between other courses and rotation lab work, it is difficult to fit into an hour window of specified day in a week to listen to a feedback that could have been provided via online. ",
            "\u00a0The layout of this course is broken. Lectures were fine (depending on the professor), but the grading and discussions were terrible. I loved the open ended nature of the THQ, and I love that they really made me think critically about the lecture material. However, almost all of the professors gave either no feedback or gave positive feedback and then marked you down substantially. The goal of a graduate course should be to promote critical thinking and to better understand and fix the holes an individual has in the knowledge before joining a thesis lab. All I got from the THQs is that I have holes in my knowledge, professors see those holes, and that I'm out of luck on identifying them myself and fixing them. Either change the requirements of the THQs to be less grading for the respective faculty, or require faculty to mark up and hand back the THQs so that students can actually learn where they're making mistakes. ",
            "\u00a0This course covered a wide survey of genetics from the 1970s to modern day. The course content was excellent - two courses on each topic was sufficient to introduce the topics from scratch and delve deeper into some interesting material. ",
            "\u00a0Having rotating lecturers was both beneficial and detrimental. The change up was refreshing, but many lecturers had a text-heavy, read-off-the-slide lecture approach. This made many lectures that could have been engaging and drive interesting discussion, lack-luster and unappealing\r\n\r\nImprovement would also be gained through communication between lecturers to prevent large material and topic overlap. This would save time within the lectures if the individuals knew that material that took up a quarter of the time had been covered previously. In general, communication seemed to be lacking (especially at the beginning of the course). \r\n\r\nThe homework assignments varied in difficulty, expectations of responses, and grading. The lecturers whom graded work in a timely manner usually lacked responses. While those who took weeks sometimes had detailed responses to the material and mistakes made. Overall, keeping assignments and encouraging the lecturers to respond in a timely manner to reenforce misconceptions on material taught would allow the knowledge to be built on throughout the course. ",
            "\u00a0Lecturers often had room for discussion, but could have expanded/increased to be a component of all lectures. Discussion sections were not really discussions as much as they were attendance grades. Didn't think the unstructured, inconsistent nature of the discussions added any more depth or knowledge to the material covered in lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Some lecturers didn't put enough efforts in this class. ",
            "\u00a0Pros: \r\n1. The topics are wide-ranging and a majority of them are up-to-date.\r\n2. Some of the instructors are very good at teaching and interacting with students.\r\n3. The literature assigned for discussion are very useful and quite interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Stop going around and forcing people to answer questions about the papers. Have a discussion. Just call on individuals who aren't speaking up. ",
            "\u00a0Weakness: some professors call on students one at a time in order to discuss figures. This is not very conducive to an actual discussion. Discussion sessions ran more smoothly and were more informative when anyone was allowed to explain the figure and the entire class chimed in. ",
            "\u00a0The course got off to a rocky start--there was no clear way the assignments were being evaluated and no feedback that helped students get better scores. However, the course largely corrected this about halfway through.\r\nThe variety of lecture guests was great and a strength, but it was also a weakness when some of the faculty assumed a particular background or presented in overtly dry manners. ",
            "\u00a0- The sooner we get feedback, the better we can answer the questions. Waiting weeks for feedback is not ideal, but I know that it can be difficult to manage a large number of responses. "

        [
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course for those who are interested the study and discovery in the genetics field. ",
            "\u00a0If the research focuses on more than one of the topics presented during the course (rare variants, animal models and genetics screen), this would be a useful course (although quite basic). However, in my case I would have gained more insight into my area of interest by taking some other genetic courses at the School of Public Health (e.g. Genetic Concepts in Public Health/Genetic Epidemiology), Statistical Genetics, Gene-Environment Interactions. ",
            "\u00a0It is a mandatory course but it really can be a great one with some improvements. ",
            "\u00a0In its current state I would not recommend it. I also think it's important to note that class had STRONG feelings about specific professors that they were looking forward to voicing on the evaluations, however we are only given a choice for the class director Jun Lu. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This course is suitable for people with or without a background in biology. Strongly recommend. ",
            "\u00a0If improved upon to be more engaging and facilitate more discussion, this could be an excellent core course. ",
            "\u00a0For students that are not obligated to take this course, I would only recommend it for those who: 1) truly loves genetics and would love to apply genetic approach to their research, and 2) are used to the structure and style implemented in this class (very big class, instructors are not fixed for each topic, decent amount of participation). ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because the content is important and good. My issues with the course are the the manner in which it was carried out. ",
            "\u00a0It was a great survey of the topic. There were challenging weeks, but, by in large, was not overly intense. ",
