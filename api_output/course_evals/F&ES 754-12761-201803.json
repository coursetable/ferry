The weekly homework assignments ensured that we continued to employ these skills, and the final project where we develop a geospatial analysis tool on our own enabled us to demonstrate that we can apply these skills to questions and topics we're interested in for our professional careers.

            "\u00a0I would love more feedback on the homework, if possible. That being said, it's already a lot of work and getting feedback on homework would only increase that workload. I appreciated how Dana required us to work on project from time to time (proposals etc), I learned a lot more and advanced a lot more because of it. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated the flexible structure of the course- it was nice not to have graded assignments but get to work on substantial term projects instead.  I looked forward to the class every week.\r\n\r\nI think it could use 2 teaching fellows or more office hours.  I would love to have learned about open-source python libraries for GIS software.  I would have loved the opportunity to present my projects, and learn about the projects that others were pursuing (orally, instead of the poster contest). ",
            "\u00a0The format and structure of the course is very good I think. The open-ended homework gave me a chance to apply what I learned in ways that are interesting and relevant to me, which I really appreciated. However, I sometimes felt as if the class was a little too open-ended, as I was somewhat unclear on expectations sometimes. For example, I wasn't super sure what to do for the final project other than the fact that it needed to be more in depth than the weekly homeworks. Also, honestly I'd skip the Python API stuff and just do more Desktop ArcPy. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: great online support, up to date tools and applications, flexible weekly assignments\r\nweaknesses: people without a background in spatial analysis can still find it challenging (from what I heard but I wasn't one of them) ",

            "\u00a0The major strengths of this course: it offers a hands-on experience of programming and processing data to complete course projects. The knowledge and skills learned in this process is practical and will continue to be useful in the future. And the professor and TA are very helpful in helping answer questions. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very useful. No weakness! ",
            "\u00a0The course has sufficient resources for self-teaching the tools needed to do homework assignments and final project. However, there is a very steep learning curve to excel in this course, and everyone comes in with a different level of computer programming experience. This makes it difficult to optimize the course for all students. From the perspective of someone with little to no computer programming experience, the lectures were good for understanding what you can do with geospatial software development conceptually. However, I would have appreciated spending more time on the fundamental techniques (such as the language and mechanical structure of the code). ",
            "\u00a0This course provides good exposure to Google Earth Engine and ArcMap and Professor Tomlin is an excellent instructor. However, I think it's important to evaluate your goals before taking the course since the materials can be kind of intangible if you don't have a clear application in mind. I wish the instructor or TF provided more feedback throughout the course instead of providing little feedback throughout and having all of the course grade be assigned to the final projects. "

This course is a significant time commitment, particularly if you have little to no computer programming experience, so make sure you have the time to give the course the time and effort it deserve. That being said, this opens new doors into the geospatial analysis field (or in the professions that benefit from heavy geospatial analysis skills). The more of yourself that you put into this course, the more Professor Tomlin will support you in this course and beyond. ",
