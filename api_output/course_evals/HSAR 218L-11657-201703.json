            "\u00a0The lab was overall an interesting look into the world of the science behind art conservation. Generally a good refresher of lab techniques as well. Students also learned how far away West Campus was. ",
            "\u00a0art conservation research\r\nwest campus resources ",
            "\u00a0I discovered how greatly biomolecular chemistry can intersect with art conservation, embarking on a fairly \"real world\" kind of research throughout the semester. My particular project aimed to create a tool that would distinguish heat-bodied linseed oil from fresh linseed oil, with the hope of eventually applying this tool to cross sections taken from Rembrandt paintings (and beyond). ",
            "\u00a0I learned the process necessary for investigating questions that conservationists have ",
            "\u00a0I really loved this class for the opportunity to see my own interest and project through a semester. I really appreciated learning about cutting edge science, DNA aptamers, in an art conservation context. It helped me think about both research and art in more inquisitive, deeper ways. "

        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: Interesting science and generally exciting to be using \"cutting-edge\" technology, especially when put into the broader context of science, generally a small course that should have allowed for better teacher/student interactions, advisors were able to become invested in student's projects if they so chose \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Frequently disorganized, which is somewhat understandable with this being the first course on West Campus, access to West Campus consistently proved difficult throughout the semester, arriving to class on time could be an economic burden at times especially for lower income students, generally felt disassociated from the history of art aspect of the course, \"High School or intro understanding of biology\" did not feel correct in describing the knowledge level necessary to succeed in the course, distance in traveling to West Campus  especially returning was frequently inconvenient, rules and instructions felt shifting throughout the semester and it was hard to get a clear reading on my grade at any point in the semester ",
            "\u00a0there doesn't seem to be a need to hold the course on west campus -- it would be a nice field trip, but students mainly use the labs, which also exist on central campus. that adds at least an hour to students' time every week  in commute\r\n\r\nthere was little inclusion of art history in the class after the first two weeks, and the connections should have been drawn more ",
            "\u00a0We were incredibly lucky to get such personal attention from the professors, as well as the benefits of west campus (our own laboratory, occasional trips to the art conservation center and the genome sequencing center). I would say that I learned most from my personal preparation for the midterm and final presentations/papers. Perhaps shifting the first several weeks of the \"chemistry overview\" towards more art conservation-related techniques would make more sense than a more abstract introduction (i.e. \"here is what an atom is\"). I would also appreciate getting more exposure to scientific articles during the writing process, so that we can familiarize ourselves with formatting and structure to a greater extent. ",
            "\u00a0the course was very intensive, but there was not enough time to do everything or to learn everything necessary ",
            "\u00a0The course covered a lot of ground in not very much time, which was both good and bad. I am so glad to have learned all I did, but often was playing catch-up even having put in a lot of time. One of the reasons many students often felt lost was that expectations, deadlines, and appropriate knowledge to do assignments were not conveyed in time. The course lacked structure and assignments often popped up out of nowhere, it seemed. I would suggest putting every assignment as well as expectations on the syllabus and making sure students understand what is expected well before the deadline. "

            "\u00a0I recommend this class if you: are looking for a lab that is tangentially related to art, have an already an intermediate understanding of biology and lab practice, and are willing to put in a significant time commitment (3-4 hours) every lab day. To succeed you must be frequently check in with the professor, as standards for assignments and lab practice expectations can change frequently. I do not recommend this course for history of art students or other humanities major, whose interest in conservation may be somewhat limited and interest in time commitment to a lab course is low. ",
            "\u00a0I think it's a good course for first years or sophomores to take because the relatively low level of science makes it quite accessible and it is interdisciplinary so it allows exploration, and may drive future research projects ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this course! (Do not be intimidated by the fact that lab is on west campus. It is a trek, but the professors are understanding about the commute and help fund the trip on the way there. You get to work right next to Yale's art conservation center and can benefit from conversations with the experts there). This is perhaps the only opportunity for non-stem undergraduates to take an interdisciplinary, creative approach to getting their science credit. The environment is very friendly -- you befriend your professors and classmates while working on your own project. Do it! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students who have an interest in conservation, but do not know where to start. I would also advise to leave a lot of time for this class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class, only if you are willing to put in a lot of time, including the travel time to West Campus. This is not an easy science credit, but it will teach you a lot about art conservation and a very novel, cutting-edge biological tool: DNA aptamers. "
