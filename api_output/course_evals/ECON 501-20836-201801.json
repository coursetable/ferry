You begin to formalize game theoretic concepts in a rigorous manner, and analyze topics ranging from incomplete information to moral hazard.\r\n\r\nAlmost certainly the most difficult class I've taken at Yale (although game theory is also a relative weakness of mine). Still, the range of topics covered - auctions to contracts - makes it worth it, if you're willing to put in the work. ",

            "\u00a0Organizationally there were some challenges with this course. I think some of this has to do with trying to coordinate multiple different profs, but they should still be addressed. Students weren't made aware of when the midterm was -> Prof said \"We have a midterm next week\" and the TA had to point out that the syllabus only said \"Midterm: TBA\"\r\n\r\nTA section/office hours could have been adjusted to better assist students with the assigned work. The course had the only scheduled office hours happening immediately AFTER the assignment was due, making them more or less worthless for asking questions about the problem sets. ",

Having 50% of the mark be on the first 3 weeks of material that Ryota taught is very odd indeed (or at least have the final be 3 hours so questions on mechanism design and moral hazard aren't completely left out -seems to me that was the most important part of the class) ",
            "\u00a0Q3: Good broad overview of topics, repeated games were very well taught, but it seems we focused too much on basic Nash equilibrium and then sequential and trembling hand perfect were covered quickly at the end. Problem sets were sometimes so challenging that no one could get them, so maybe recalibrate. Q4: Fair exam, problem sets mostly reasonable, but class could be more engaging. ",
