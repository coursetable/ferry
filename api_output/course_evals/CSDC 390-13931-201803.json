            "\u00a0I gained a great framework from which I can evaluate issues in international law. I learned how to approach legal analysis, research, and writing. I came to strong, informed opinions on complex issues, like espionage, surveillance, and torture. ",
            "\u00a0I got a great base knowledge in International Law. Both in the Law itself as well as the views regarding it. I learned how to engage in legal thinking, especially with the legal memo assignment. ",
            "\u00a0Asaf was really dedicated to familiarizing all of us with the various aspects of a legal education, including the style of exams and the style of writing. I also now feel confident in my ability to recognize and understand most of the foundational aspects of international law. ",
            "\u00a0SUPER IN DEPTH introduction to International Law. Literally the best introduction to IL you can get during Yale undergrad. \r\nI learned about spying/espionage, its history, and how its been regulated over time by countries as a matter of strategic interaction, and as a practical matter under international law. ",
            "\u00a0There is a tremendous amount of learning that takes place in this class. It can be divided into two parts. First, you will learn a ton of material. You will learn the ins and outs of international law and you will dive into virtually every aspect of how espionage can be characterized by the law. Second, you will learn how to write legal papers and how to take law exams. ",
            "\u00a0Really great introduction to international law! ",
            "\u00a0While taking this course, I was taught a whole new to evaluate the readings that I have. The course introduced me to the basics of legal thought which greatly improved my analysis and understanding of the various resources we read. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about international law, especially how it relates to espionage and torture. It taught me how to read about the law and understand it. It also showed by both how important and tenuous international cooperation is. I also was challenged to write about the law critically. ",
            "\u00a0Legal research and writing, what international law is/how it works/why it matters, how espionage is really all around us (not just the cloak and dagger kind of image) ",
            "\u00a0A fantastic introduction to international law and legal writing. Also learned a lot about espionage. ",
            "\u00a0For starters, I learned a ton of international law: specific statutes, but also a lot about how the international legal system works. Graduates of this seminar probably know more about international law (and not only the international law relating to espionage) than just about any other undergrad at Yale. And they will be able to provide a more nuanced answer to the question \"is espionage legal under international law\" than almost anyone else in the world. Of course, I also learned about espionage in its many forms, how it's practiced, and then how countries do or don't respond to espionage within the international legal system. The focus of the class is on peacetime espionage, whose international legal status is much less clear-cut than wartime espionage. ",
            "\u00a0This was one of the most engaging classes I have taken at Yale. While the readings were dense and difficult at times, I believe each one was hand-picked and especially pertinent to each class. The knowledge I gained was both tangible and intangible. One one hand, I learned a significant amount about how to analyze legal documents and understand international law as a whole. On another, parallel hand, Asaf taught us about the importance of the law and how we can each engage in it. I am truly lucky to have had the opportunity to take this course, and to have learned both material and life lessons. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The class is really interesting. The readings didn't seem too bad to me at all. And the professor does a goo job of helping you understand them in class and leading the students through the class. I do think labelling this class as a seminar is a bit misleading. There was discussion at times, but not full free flowing stuff. Defintely a small, great class though. Would recommend for anyone interested in law or spy stuff. ",
            "\u00a0This course over all is very good. As an introduction to international law, I was able to learn a lot of information because of the way to was presented. I have already been able to apply topics covered in the course to other areas of study. My one critique was that not enough time was allowed for questions, but this got fixed for the second half of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0AMAZING course, the best ive taken at Yale. Super engaging classes, and very very very interesting material. You will be on your toes every single class. Readings are very interesting, and Asaf does an amazing job of picking a very good selection of people that make the class interesting.\r\nClass is more of a small lecture than a seminar though. Is mostly Asaf talking, not that that's a bad thing. Everything he says is very interesting, and you will learn a ton. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- Asaf is wonderfully kind and engaging professor. He's incredibly responsive to student questions and concerns\r\n- You will learn a ton about the law, international law, and espionage\r\n- You will receive extensive individualized feedback at every stage of the process leading up to the completion of a hefty 20 page legal memo\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- None! There is less time for class discussion particularly in earlier sessions, but I think this is unavoidable given how much new material there is to cover at first. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot but it was a ton of information so maybe slightly better organization of the info would have been helpful ",
            "\u00a0The course did a very good job to keep students on top of their work and readings without being overly restricting. CSDC390 was extremely interesting throughout every single meeting. I never found myself bored, nor stuck doing tedious work. I genuinely enjoyed every moment I spent working and participating in this class. The only weakness I can think of would be the necessity of having a little more guidance on the final legal assignment. Specifically, details regarding the exact structure and style of analysis that was expected. ",
            "\u00a0One strength was that it covered a lot of material deeply. It was sometimes difficult to complete all of the reading, but it was not impossible. Doing my group presentation taught me how to be able to digest and share complicated aspects of international law, which gave me confidence going forward in the course. I liked that it was a small seminar because it felt like we were in a team together. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is definitely Asaf. He is a gem! So willing to help, always accessible, and a great presenter. My favorite professor so far. A weakness of the course is its trajectory; it's a lot of material to master upfront and the sessions feel jam packed. This changes though further into the semester. ",
            "\u00a0It is a phenomenal course. ",
            "\u00a0The professor is fantastic, and the course is great because of him. Although he is quite young, Asaf is already one of the world's leading experts on the application of international law to espionage. He is also tremendously dedicated to the course and a super engaging teacher. The course is more lecture-heavy than a traditional seminar, but that's a good thing because the professor has really interesting things to say, and listening to him is frankly better than just sitting through a typical discussion. Asaf was also tremendously helpful on the essay assignment, providing some of the most detailed feedback I've ever received on my writing, which I really appreciated. I always enjoyed going to class, and would strongly recommend the course. The biggest change I would recommend is cutting down on so-called \"rule memorization,\" which is a euphemism for memorizing literally hundreds of treaty article numbers for the midterm and final. (Both tests ask you to match something like \"Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, Article 29\" with something like \"The inviolability of the person of a diplomatic agent.\" Be careful not to confuse that with the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties' Article 29, which was also in the scope of the test! Now add in over a hundred more similar-sounding treaty articles. You get the idea.) The professor said that although he knows it is painful, he asks us to do this so we can get used to what life is like in law school. That's fine, but we have all memorized many things before and know quite well what that is like already. I don't feel that memorizing these added to my understanding in the class at all, but rather that spending so much time on rote memorization detracted from time I could have spent engaging with the super interesting course material. But overall the class was awesome! This was my only complaint. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths\r\n- This course was highly organized and very well executed. \r\n- The readings were very strategically selected, and always pertained to the class discussions. Similarly, the lectures were always clear, and there was enough repetition of significant material, which facilitated our learning. \r\n- We received constant feedback about our work in the class and were given substantial time to discuss our work and prepare for what was coming up next.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- The readings were very long and dense, and it was sometimes difficult to summarize each reading efficiently, and also understand the main purpose of those readings. \r\n- At the beginning of the course, it was unclear how the exam would work, but when Asaf gave us more detailed examples after the midterm, it helped clarify how to prepare for the exam. \r\n\r\nImprovements \r\n- It would be helpful to have very clear outlines about how to do legal analysis from the start to finish. Although we were given general guidelines, I found it difficult to understand how to start research for the Legal Memo, and found myself struggling at the beginning of writing it. \r\n- We may benefit from receiving the slides ahead of time.

            "\u00a0Yes. Espionage and International Law is the best course I've taken at Yale, a sentiment I think is shared by the majority of my classmates. \r\nIn the first half of the class, you will learn all of the law (including 100+ treaty articles) relevant to the topics explored throughout the course. It may be a bit overwhelming at first, but is manageable. Asaf does an excellent job of reviewing past material throughout the semester with regular, ungraded quizzes that we go over together, so that by the time of the exams, you are well prepared.\r\nIn the second half of the class, we spend each week evaluating a different topic in international law, including human rights issues like mass surveillance and torture. These are some of the most interesting classes, and the readings and cases are carefully selected and thought-provoking.\r\nThere are about 120 pages of reading assigned each week. Though it's not all necessary, most is interesting and enlightening and should be completed. The exams are challenging, but you will be well prepared. There is a 15-20 page research paper that gives you the opportunity to conduct your own legal research and analysis, while receiving incredibly helpful feedback from Asaf. It is all a lot, but seems like most people end up doing quite well in the course. \r\nYou will finish this course with a strong and informed intellectual and legal framework that you can use to evaluate all kinds of legal issues. Take this course if you have the opportunity. ",
            "\u00a0Yes take it. If you have any interest in law or spy stuff, its really interesting. Also, the professor knows that nearly everyone has no experience in legal thinking, so he does a good job of talking to you about law related things (the though process and law school). Also, I think its a great class all around. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone looking to expand their knowledge of international law. Asaf is incredibly knowledgeable and his ability to make complex legal frameworks understandable is one of the main reasons the class was both enjoyable and productive. While focusing on espionage, the topics from the class can be applied to many different areas of study. Asaf's personal anecdotes make the sometimes abstract concepts very real, and he is able to impart the real gravity of what we are learning. Asaf is very available to help students with classwork, papers, and questions regarding law school. My only complaint is that he doesn't teach another class for me to take. ",
            "\u00a0The content of this class is super interesting and Asaf is really dedicated to his students' learning of the material. The class is less of a seminar and more of a 2 hour lecture, but Asaf is such an enthralling speaker and there's so much to retain every week that it goes by super fast. The exams are a lot but they tend to be curved pretty significantly so no one ends up doing too poorly. Also, for a professor that does not even live in New Haven Asaf was way more available (via phone or email) than some professors I've had on campus, and he's always super helpful if you have any questions. ",
            "\u00a0YES! BEST CLASS IVE TAKEN AT YALE, Asaf Lubin is such an amazing guy! Super smart, has amazing life experience from working for Mossad in Israel, and is an expert in the field. This is a often overlooked field, and Asaf does an amazing job covering every facet of it in-depth. \r\nNot only will you learn about espionage, you will get an in depth coverage of international law, its main bodies, and how it is interpreted and enforced around the world. \r\n10/10 course, MUST TAKE if you can get in ",
            "\u00a0This class is an absolute gem. Espionage and International Law is hands down the course for you if you have any interest in (1) possibly attending law school, (2) state run espionage and intelligence, or (3) the intersection of technology, law and policy. I cannot recommend this class highly enough if any of these ring a bell for you. Asaf is a wonderful professor, and you will have the opportunity to learn a lot. That being said there is one big caveat: there is plenty of reading and Asaf expects a lot out of each of his students (don't worry -- he grades very fairly). You will get a lot out of this class but only if you have the time and energy to commit yourself to the class as well. ",
            "\u00a0Best class I've taken at Yale. Asaf is great! You won't find someone more enthusiastic and engaged. After taking this course I have found that in super interested in the field of international law. ",
            "\u00a0Without hesitation, I would recommend this course to any student that has any intention of going to law school or has an interest in what legal thought is like. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class for students who are interested in international law, security, or are considering law school. ",
            "\u00a0As wonderful as this course is, I don't think it's for everyone. You have to have the time for it. You really have to be willing to fully commit to it, do a fair amount of reading, and chip away at the legal memo throughout the semester. It's not the kind of assignment that lends itself to throwing something together at the last minute. I'd recommend this course if you're interested in law school and want to develop legal thinking skills by engaging with the topics of international law and espionage. That being said, I loved this course! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. You learn an incredible amount about an important subject and Asaf is a great professor. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Because the seminar has received great reviews in the past (and presumably will again this year), it is hard to get in to, and of course six spots are reserved for the host college. You've got a better shot if you are ROTC/military-connected. If you do get in, I'd definitely recommend taking the class. Two things you should know beforehand: 1. As the syllabus also makes clear, this class is an international law class first, espionage class second. Of course, the topic of the international law is espionage, and we spent most of the seminar talking about espionage. But it's all about how various courts handle the cases; treaties; issues of standing and jurisdiction, etc. regarding espionage. It will be super interesting even if you have no interest in attending law school, but only take the class if you're okay with that legal focus. 2. The two exams, especially the midterm, test the readings in a major kind of a way. You can get away with skimming them for the discussion, and still get a lot out of the class. But when the midterm asks you to name and describe each tenet of Baker's functional approach to espionage from that Baker reading you skimmed last month along with seven other readings assigned the same week, don't say you weren't warned! (That is an example question that did not actually appear on the midterm or final. But it is quite similar in spirit to questions that did.) These questions about the readings were generally fair, but you've got to know who said what if you want any hope at answering them. And you should also be prepared to put in work on the legal memo assignment (really just a research paper with plenty of support available from the professor) and memorizing article numbers for the exams. The case study isn't too bad. ",
            "\u00a0This was one of my favorite classes I have taken at Yale, and I highly recommend the course to anyone who has any interest in international law, or the law surrounding the protection of any human rights. It easily touches on a wide range of topics in law, and also is very practical in understanding how the law works, in general. It was both fascinating the learn the foundations of international law, and also made meaningful by the stories that Asaf would tell about the work that he has done. "
