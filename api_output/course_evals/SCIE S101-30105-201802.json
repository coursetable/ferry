            "\u00a0The organization could be better and the expectations should have been more straightforward. Often times we received different feedback from different instructors/TAs. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of this course include great feedback from professors and TAs regarding how your work can be improved. Its weakness includes not providing details about assignments until two days before the assignments are due. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course include constant assignments for presentations and constant rehearsal time in order to fully polish the presentation. The weaknesses of the course involved some classwork that seemed a bit unneccessary. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were that it was really helpful and helped me gain confidence in doing undergraduate research.\r\nA major weakness was that it was extremely disorganized. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a fine workload. The problem is that they forget that you are in lab until 6 or 7 pm each night so I barely got any sleep. The workload was sometimes unrealistic for the time we had allotted. Also, the communication between the instructors and the graduate students was non-existent. We would ask our TA for clarification on something and they would have no idea what we were talking about or completely different ideas than the instructors. Finally, the workload could be improved if the written assignments were tailored to what day you presented. I had to present on Tuesday after all the writing assignments were due on Mondays. Despite my best efforts to manage my time, the TA's did not send out the expectations for the writing assignments until Friday, so I was stuck writing a very detailed scientific paper and preparing a 5 or 13 minute presentation in 3 days as well as participating in mandatory weekend events. It was terrible and I never could sleep. Never ever sleep. ",
            "\u00a0One strength of the course is the small discussion section sies in order to get more support from a professor or a TA. Another strength of the course is the constant feedback from others in order to improve for the final product. One weakness of the course is the lack of organization and communication that is seen from the professors and the TAs. Another weakness of the course is the unnecessary assignments that do not pertain to our project or the articles we read in class. An improvement to the course could be better organization of the class prior to its start. ",
            "\u00a0communication needs to be improved - although there was a calendar of deadlines at the beginning of the course, other deadlines and assignments / assignment modifications were added, sometimes the day beforehand, and it wasn't exactly made clear to all 30 of us. Also, I understand sometimes that information may not yet be available, but if we could at least be told a rough idea of when to expect that information (i.e. our symposium presentation times) that would have helped with planning / inviting people. \r\n\r\nAlso, this course is structured to target the biological sciences. There was the engineering journal club, but even so the articles were either of environmental sciences or physics but on a chemical scale. As someone who is pursuing computer science, the journal club aspect of the course did not particularly help me since computer science articles are completely different (some are more technical, others are more similar to psychology studies)\r\n\r\nHowever, I think the second half of the course that was about us giving our presentations really helped me prepare for the symposium. \r\n\r\nI feel like the \"big baby\" human growth proportion project was a bit unnecessary, especially since the stats lectures were not helpful at all. The two sessions were mostly about why stats is useful, and only spent about 20 minutes teaching us how to actually do statistics. I ended up not even doing statistics for that group assignment because I had no idea what I was doing - we divided up the work and I let others who had taken stats beforehand help. This project is difficult for those who have no previous experience with statistics. We also didn't have much time to do this assignment and it was a bit stressful, trying to turn this assignment around in time with other lab work. ",
            "\u00a0This course is great because they give you enough work to keep you (mostly) out of trouble and boredom, but the work doesn't stress you out too much. I actually enjoyed the group assignments! Plus Dr. Moreno promoted group work throughout the class which helped me connect with more of my peers. The only weakness is that some of the assignments seemed a little unnecessary; I felt like they were only given as busy work. ",
            "\u00a0This course did very well at helping students develop valuable skills in presenting scientific research. The lectures were informative and the constant feedback and suggestions from the professors and TAs were extremely helpful. I liked that the class was split up into 3 different groups because it allowed for much more individualized help and attention. One thing that I wish was better was the organization of the class in terms of deadlines and assignments; I was sometimes confused about what assignments to turn in and when to turn them in. The assignments and deadlines on the syllabus would sometimes differ from those on Canvas, and the TAs seemed to be a little confused as well. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked that the course had us practice different parts of our speech over several weeks so that by the end of the course, we would be confident in our presentation. However, I wish that we were able to switch up our audiences with each presentation, perhaps by rotating the professors for each section, so that we could get a more varied feedback. I believe most of the lectures were good (visual design elements, how to organize information), but some of the presented information was quite repetitive. As for the trips, learning about the conservation of art was very interesting, but it was hard to stay focused during the trip to the genomic sequencing center since we did not get to see any of the actual technology for a long time, and it was mostly just an oral presentation. In regards to the lecture about statistics, it would have been nice to actually learn about some of the statistics instead of just about the program. Another thing that could be improved is that the feedback from the different instructors was not very standard, and the instructions were not always thorough, so it was difficult to gauge exactly what was required (ex. how many pages to write, how in-depth an article should be, etc.). Lastly, I think there should be a lecture on how to create the figures itself, because a lot of students did not know how to use Photoshop or Excel properly, and so some figures were not as well done as others. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Moreno was a great speaker and was very engaging. She made very insightful powerpoints. The field trips gave another perspective into research except the genetics area did not provide much information. \r\n\r\nThe deadlines however were not very clear. ",
            "\u00a0I dont know ",
            "\u00a0The course certainly had good intentions.  In the class we  read a variety of research papers and discussed the best way to approach each. We also were given lectures on how to present data in a way that is engaging and clear. I think the main qualms i have with the course is that the assignments felt like busy work at times and the grading was inconsistent. We spent around 8 hrs a day in lab in addition to this class, the homework assigned should take this into consideration or at the very least make the work feel worthwhile. Also it sometimes felt that points were taken off of assignments for things that we were never told about. I might just be bitter though, all in all it was a good class. I just wish they would have dialed it back and been more selective in the work that they gave us. ",
            "\u00a0I felt that there were some inconsistencies with what the professors wanted on our powerpoints. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is that you have weekly presentations and the instructors and students critique and provide feedback. This creates a very communal learning environment. The presentations are all recorded for reference and improvement. I think the course could have been organized better. ",
            "\u00a0I think the professors do a great job of working closely with students and providing detailed feedback. ",
            "\u00a0i could be more dilligent about asking for more work "

        [
            "\u00a0Yes because its a good writing course for STEM majors since it teaches relevant writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to students who are interested in STEM. Through this course, they can learn how to present scientifically. ",
            "\u00a0YESSS! You can only do this course through STARS, which is an absolutely phenomenal program for minority students in STEM. I highly revommend applying for this program and the class is absolutely amazing and really helps build your presentation skills, which is valuable for anyone interested in research. ",
            "\u00a0The STARS program was phenomenal however this class was very straight forward. I didn't feel like I was learning anything that was not covered in the introductory biology sequence. It simply felt like a high amount of busy work before we actually got to work on our final presentations and paper. Even then, parts of the paper were due far before I was finished with stuff in lab so I had to completely rewrite those parts for the final paper. It was a waste. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The workload of the class is not a lot compared to other classes. There is a lot of support offered in this class by the professors, TAs, and other students in this class. It may not be that obvious at first, but the class teaches how to become a better writer and presenter for the future. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would - although it is more helpful if you are interested in biology or something related to biology. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely!!! If you get into STARS that's great, and this class is also a fantastic class to take during the summer. Dr. Moreno is amazing and Dean Chang really cares about the students success at the symposium at the end of the class. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student because I really did learn so much about how to effectively present scientific information that I didn't know before. The individualized help and constant feedback was extremely helpful and I was very lucky to have Dr. Moreno as my main instructor because she was so wonderful. Taking this class alongside doing research in the lab helped me create a presentation on my research project that I was really proud of. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, most definitely. I improved my writing and presentation skills tremendously. The TAs were extremely good about giving thorough feedback for each draft, so I was able to fix any mistakes before turning in a revised and approved version for grading. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend it. Aside from the obvious advantage of a writing credit, this course does truly teach you how to approach scientific literature and the best way to present it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because it is very helpful to develop your presentation skills that you can use in lab meetings and in life in general. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would highly recommend this course to another student. You learn a lot and gain very important skills. ",
            "\u00a0yes especially if you want to learn more about the research field "
