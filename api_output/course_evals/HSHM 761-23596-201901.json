            "\u00a0I gained a rich understanding of the early modern period across Africa, Asia, Latin America, North America and the Atlantic. I engaged in seminar discussions tackling deep issues in historical study overall - especially questions of ethics and the archive. ",
            "\u00a0Topically: Deepened insight into the encounter of colonialism/empire/race/enslavement/disease/medicine in the caribbean world. Methodologically: awareness of historical methods, historical writing, and pedagogy. ",
            "\u00a0To distill the main arguments of the book ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me to think about the archive as a subject/object as well as a body of primary sources. How do archives replicate past and present structures of power? Also, this course helped me to think about how to ethically interact with a body of knowledge that is built at least in part due to the suffering of enslaved people and Amerindians. ",
            "\u00a0This was hands-down one of the best classes I have ever taken. I not only learned about medical histories but also explored questions about building a historiography and highlighting voices that have been erased from or that are silent within historical sources. In other words, this course gave me the opportunity to examine history as a subject and to think critically about what types of history I eventually want to write. ",
            "\u00a0So many! I learned how to think about writing history of marginalized groups, how to critique what I read honestly while also being generous, and I learned a great deal about medicine and empire. ",
            "\u00a0Better historiographical skills\r\nLots of background knowledge about the early modern period, medicine, and the slave trade\r\nHow to ask questions ",
            "\u00a0This class was extremely important for my development as a critical thinker in the social sciences, for engaging with a wide variety of questions that historians of the early modern period must wrestle with in doing responsible scholarship. ",
            "\u00a0In this course I learned about the Atlantic and Indian Oceans worlds in the pre/modern world. I also gained professional insights within academia. Also, Dr. Roberts provided a superb example of how to be a professor that creates a classroom in which students can thrive, emotionally, academically, and professionally. ",
            "\u00a0I was exposed to a brand new historiography and approaches to history. I also gained a better sense of what is meant by history of medicine. "

            "\u00a0The texts were well-chosen and the discussion was always enriching. Student presentations were also some of my favorite aspects of the class.\r\n\r\nI think that at times when Professor Roberts called on particular students to discuss their online posts, it felt like the conversation was a bit forced. I wonder if there are other ways to bring in new voices into the conversation. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a wonderful introduction to the topic and was full of useful and exciting exercises. ",
            "\u00a0Great structure. I loved how the professor organized the books we read in a logical and accessible way. Her syllabus is the clearest and most helpful syllabus I've ever seen in my life. ",
            "\u00a0This course did an excellent job of providing a safe space where we could discuss difficult issues that are inherent in being a historian. We engaged with controversial and sensitive topics that really challenged me to think about how I can be an ethical historian. While Dr. Roberts did a great job of facilitating our discussions and allowing us to express ourselves, I wish that she would have given her opinion more frequently. She has so much knowledge, I want to hear what she thinks! ",
            "\u00a0This class was amazing in every way! I loved the diversity of readings, the manner in which Dr. Roberts led the classroom, the grace, generosity, and love she brought to every seminar. ",
            "\u00a0This class is pretty much perfect, despite it being the first time being taught. The strengths were a great group of students, an incredible professor, and a very good syllabus, and flexible/interesting assignments ",
            "\u00a0This course was really wonderful! It taught me so much and people brought so many rich insights to the table. I don't think I'd change anything about it. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: DR. ROBERTS!; discussion-based; incredible syllabus and thoughtful course structure\r\nWeaknesses: absolutely none ",
            "\u00a0This course's strength was the transparency by which we were to be assessed. Dr. Roberts also provided many avenues for students to participate and contribute in our written and oral participation. This alleviated any anxiety about performance within the classroom and in our homework. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths--the readings and assignments challenged us to reconsider what it means to be a historian, and what is at stake in our work.\r\nWeaknesses--the classroom discussions could be hit or miss for me, and I felt many times we did not have an opportunity to fully sit with the text. perhaps there were too many undergrads allowed in the class.

            "\u00a0Absolutely. I think that although the course concerns the Early Modern period, medicine, slavery, indigeneity, and empire, it really has us grapple with questions that are relevant to studying any period or geographic area. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Professor Roberts is an incredible instructor and the scope of the course was illuminating and enriching. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, Professor Roberts is great ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, this course really challenged me to think about the ethical implications of my work as a historian as well as the implicit biases that I bring to my work ",
            "\u00a0Please please please take this class! Dr. Roberts' is an absolute joy, and it's a privilege to be around her, let alone take her course. You'll be challenged and you'll be fulfilled through this class. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, it was absolutely amazing. I think that for anyone doing history and HSHM, this course is invaluable in teaching us how to analyze sources and read against the grain when talking about marginalized groups ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, these histories are so important for thinking about how to create more just medicine and healing in the present ",
            "\u00a0I HIGHLY recommend this course as an opportunity to learn from Professor Roberts, who is a wealth of insight, compassion, and intimate knowledge. I recommend to anyone grappling with epistemological and ontological questions about the state of medicine and health throughout time. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Dr. Roberts is an excellent scholar and cares about preparing her students for holistic well-being. She creates a space for us to be scholars, and acknowledges how graduate students will soon be on the \"job market\" and makes sure to incorporate practical insights and projects relevant to our goals.
