The class is as hard or as easy as you want it to bethe homework takes around 30 minutes a night, but there is additional work you can do if you want to improve even more quickly. The professor and the TA are wonderful people who are more than happy to meet with you whenever you want; both have genuine interests in trying to improve your Russian, which forms a great support system. ",

            "\u00a0Yes! The Russian department here is great, very personal and very invested in your learning. Plus, Professor Dolgova is absolutely incredible. She's one of my favorite teachers by far. And Ingrid is just the best TA. "
