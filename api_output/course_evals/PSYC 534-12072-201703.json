            "\u00a0This class was a reiteration of content from other psychology classes. There were only three assignments, and I did not receive any feedback for any of them, so I don't think I learned any skills. I gained the most insight by doing my final paper, but that was because I picked a topic that I genuinely did not know much about and thus had a lot to learn. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: The opportunity to do the practicum was the one big strength of this course. I learned a lot by being out in the community and getting a better understanding of the challenges of treating children with mental illness. Also, some of the guest speakers were really good, and it was helpful to hear perspectives of people who are not Yale professors.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class wasn't challenging. It was basically a survey course in developmental psychopathology, but I had basically learned all the content already from other classes. I received zero feedback on the few assignments all semester, and I honestly have no idea what my grade will be, because I received no feedback. That's not a great feeling.\r\n\r\nSome of the topics were really interesting, but they were ultimately superficial in content. It was hard to stay engaged at many points because there was no real depth to many of the lectures. "

            "\u00a0If this is the only psych class you ever take, it's probably fine. If you actually have a solid background in psychology and especially developmental psychology, I would not recommend this class. "
