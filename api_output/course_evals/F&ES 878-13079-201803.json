This is how one learns how to do groundbreaking and novel work of the sort that all PhD students hope to do someday. A highly engaging and valuable course. ",

            "\u00a0I think the lecturing could engage with students more often by drawing in student commentary throughout the class session. Professors often incite brief discussions during class, and I think confining most of the discussion until after the lecture makes the course moderately less engaging. "
