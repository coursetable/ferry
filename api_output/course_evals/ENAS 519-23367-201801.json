I enjoyed discussing these topics with peers and other faculty (besides my own research group), as it showed new perspectives. Although I don't think much of my opinions changed (most people in the room agreed with me on most topics) a few definitely did.\r\n\r\nI learned how to request permission for figures from other groups' papers. (Links on their paper's web page.) ",

Much of the time was just waiting for them to think about what to say next, or for them to repeat something they said many times before, without emphasizing a particular important aspect. \r\n\r\nStrengths: the topics presented were the most important (general, not field-specific) aspects of research ethics and research practices. ",
            "\u00a0This course was terrible. Lectures were long and rambling without any indication of how long they would last. Lecturers would slog through the slides, reading every bit of text word for word and then proceeding to mumble the same information again in their own, but less succinct words. All of the information provided in the three lectures could have been condensed down to a single 45 minute lecture, rather than 5 hours. ",
            "\u00a0While I know this course is needed to comply with government grants, but I felt like this class was too long. The first lecture was better since we had discussion groups. The other two was 2.5 lectures that could have been taught in 30 minutes. They should incorporate more discussion groups. Since the class is going to be taught again, I think it would be a better use of time to have to class held all at once on a Saturday, if possible. ",
