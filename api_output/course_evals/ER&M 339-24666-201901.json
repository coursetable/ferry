            "\u00a0I learned a lot about writing in this course, even if it wasn't English and how to really engage with the stakes of an argument. I also learned how to think critically on issues like race, gender, blackness, interracial love, and actual fictional form through Baldwin's works. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to ",
            "\u00a0I became a braver and more adventurous reader, writer, and thinker -- I was consistently challenged in new and interesting ways. ",
            "\u00a0Through reading Baldwins work and discussing him in class I gained a feeling of almost in person familiarity with him as a writer and thinker. Reading him has completely changed my understanding of the role of literature and art making and the meaning of good writingeven the tone I use when I write has changed over the course of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about love, anger, the way racism and all forms of oppression hurt not just the oppressed but the oppressors as well. I also thought critically about writing form and all sorts of ways that art can be used in service of collective liberation. ",
            "\u00a0This class opened my eyes to the incredibly rich and beautiful world that is James Baldwin's work. I think there's something really valuable to be gained from diving deeply into a single author, especially when that someone is the mastermind, prophet as Hilton Als says, that is Baldwin. In this class I think I refined my ability to speak succinctly and thoughtfully in a seminar setting and being mindful about choosing how to articulate these ideas. ",
            "\u00a0We read many essays, novels, and films by Baldwin while also reading critical analyses and responses to his work. The class felt like a literature course through the lenses of ER&M. We placed Baldwin's words and his critical reception in the context of the civil-rights and post-civil-rights era. We broke down how the negative responses to Baldwin during his time were fueled in part by homophobia and masculine gender norms, while simultaneously looking in depth into Baldwin's own internalized sexism and homophobia. Overall, the class was very well balanced in terms of scope and interest. ",
            "\u00a0I would say that while skills were certainly refreshed/developed (for instance it had been a long time since I had written an analytical essay of a piece of text, and I developed some skills on close reading) but I think what I most gained from this course was the perspectives I received from my classmates and professor and James Baldwin's work. The classroom served as a propellant of my own self growth and is greatly appreciated for that. "

            "\u00a0This course has an amazing reading selection! ",
            "\u00a0The texts in this course, both Baldwin texts and the secondary scholarship, were incredible. It was so exciting to be exposed to such great material that looked at writing, literature, music, politics, and so much more through the lens of Baldwin. Prof. Mirakhor is an excellent seminar leader, probably one of the best I've seen at Yale. She brought an incredible energy to the classroom and it made all the students really invest into the works. ",
            "\u00a0I wish we would have read some pre-1964 material in order to better compare / evaluate / critique Baldwin in his trajectory.  Still, the discussions were some of the best I have had at Yaleeveryone seemed incredibly engaged and Professor Mirakhor did a great job facilitating this. ",
            "\u00a0Really excellent course with a great professor and an interesting reading list. I sometimes felt like there was a little too much reading assigned for me to read closely every week, but otherwise I loved the class. ",
            "\u00a0The mix of Baldwins original writings and the complementary readings by other thinkers and writers was incredibly useful for my understanding of the books he wrote and the context he wrote them in, as well as his influence on future generations of writers and thinkers. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a deep, challenging look into James Baldwin and his later work, and class discussion was almost always well-run and interesting. However, sometimes organization was lacking-- Professor Mirakhor changed dates and readings around a lot without much online communication, including one book that I had already bought that was taken off of the syllabus at the last minute. ",
            "\u00a0This is an amazing class - a great blend of letting Baldwin teach you, and also letting yourself be critical of the politics and art of someone who has few flaws (finding those flaws and challenging them was one the more illuminating parts of the course.) Prof. Mirakhor is far and away one of the best professors I have ever had. ",
            "\u00a0Good emphasis on student voice, I liked the way prof. Mirakhor facilitated discussion and tried to make everyone feel valued. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course could have used more feedback in terms of the discussion posts and ways that I as a student could improve my writing earlier on in the course. I think this course very well hones in on the latter half of Baldwin's works and really interrogates the historical and social surroundings of the work. ",
            "\u00a0Baldwin is my favorite writer, so take my words with a grain of salt; I loved every part about this course. I struggled to keep up with the readings each week, yet when I did them they were fulfilling and insightful. Class discussion was lively and interactive. The professor was receptive and also supportive. The assignments were engaging and constructive. ",
            "\u00a0The one day a week structure of the class feels limiting because there is so much material to be covered. At times it felt like too much to engage with fully. Additionally, at times the sheer amount of reading felt too much just because it is one thing to read 300 pages, and another thing to read them carefully, especially with work that can be as rich with content as Baldwin's writing. As for strength, the looser structure of the class allowing for us to all choose what we wanted to discuss from the class, and somewhat tailor it to our desires and interests was great. Additionally, some of the outside screenings and discussions we had were incredibly valuable opportunities to me. "

            "\u00a0Yes! James Baldwin After 1964 is a great class in which you just read Baldwin's books every week!! Class conversations were never dull and although most of you work is to read you learn so much about America, race in America, love, and the fictional form through Baldwin texts. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This course was amazing, and I read some of the best material that I've encountered at Yale. Professor Mirakhor required us to think really deeply about the materials we read, which are supplemented by secondary sources that provide much needed political and biographical context. We need more classes on Baldwin and Black writing at Yale! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely!  Amazing syllabus, fascinating topics, great professor. ",
            "\u00a0yesss!! Professor Mirakhor is an amazing professor who is willing to give you the advice that you need to hear to improve ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely recommend this course, especially to students who've read Baldwin before (especially his earlier, more famous works) and want to engage really deeply with his writing. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Having Professor Mirakhor as an instructor is really a life changing experienceespecially so in the context of Baldwins literature, which is one of her focuses as an academic. If you are willing to give yourself over to the texts and to being vulnerable in the classroom space you will gain so much as a writer and thinker over the course of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely-- Baldwin changed the way I think about almost everything, and once you hear his voice, both written and spoken, you can't get it out of your head. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! Prof. mirakhor is great, and you get to read James Baldwin for yale credit.. what could be better! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! There should be ten classes on Baldwin, so seize the opportunity to take this one or any offered by Mirakhor! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to other students. The topics touch a broad range of interests, including English, History, Race, Gender, Identity, and many more. I initially took the class because I enjoyed reading Baldwin; yet, I enjoyed every aspect of the class. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to further investigate what it means to be human, what it means to be in this country, or really any place in this world because there are societal problems everywhere on this planet, above all, if you want to further interrogate what it is that you believe in, you should absolutely take this course.
