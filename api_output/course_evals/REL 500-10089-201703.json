            "\u00a0TF was knowledgeable, accessible, and professional ",
            "\u00a0**My teaching fellow was actually TJ Thames, who was not a choice in the box above...***\r\n\r\nTJ was great; he was very available for help and made our section really interesting. He was very knowledgeable as well and we all appreciated that he made the effort to come all the way to YDS since he doesn't live close by. He also came to our mid-term exam review session which was not required of him but was super helpful. The only weakness I would say was just not having enough time to go over all the material we were supposed to cover in section. Our class had a lot we wanted to talk about so we always ran out of time. ",
            "\u00a0Justin is a great guy and highly knowledgeable. My only critique would be that sometimes his organization of a section collapses a bit and its mostly him who does the talking -- overall section was really good though. ",
            "\u00a0Justin prompted discussion in ways that were very respectful of the different perspectives, backgrounds, and career goals of students in the classroom. We reviewed material in a way that was very helpful for understanding the different interpretive lenses laid out in the course, and our conversations allowed for productive and courteous dialogue. ",
            "\u00a0Engaged well with the section each week. Can make subtly sarcastic comments that I sometimes indulged in but probably had a little bite towards particular students. Open to dialogue about many things - individuals work, different things more or less relating to the class. I hope to have him again next semester. ",
            "\u00a0Justin was available for discussion about topics covered in class and paper assignments. He was prompt in responding to student questions via email. I appreciated his attempts to continually connect our class discussions to the basic question of \"What is the Bible?\" However, I would have appreciated greater direction of discussion during section rather than allowing students to pontificate on their own personal queries. ",
            "\u00a0Justin is extremely knowledgeable of HB.\r\n\r\nAlways makes time to answer questions and comments from students. \r\n\r\nRather good at deconstructing an argument being presented.\r\nThere were times I felt like he was more susceptible to misunderstanding an argument being proffered because he was too quick to apply what the person was saying into his already formed paradigm. \r\nMore questions for clarification/understanding would be helpful.\r\n\r\nJustin does an average job of facilitating/moderating conversation. \r\nSometimes his questions were leading. \r\nHis questions at times weren't conducive for discussion.  \r\n\r\nGood preparation. \r\nWhen presenting, he is a great communicator of the points and ideas he wants to get across. \r\nHe shows a great propensity of anticipating counter-arguments. ",
            "\u00a0My TA was TJ Thames, who is not included on this list. ",
            "\u00a0Justin did a great job of breaking down the material in a way that was easy to understand. He always allowed for engaging conversation by asking the right questions and guiding the conversation if it got off topic. He also is very helpful one on one, and his knowledge and passion of this subject is evident in the way he interacts with his students. ",
            "\u00a0well prepared\r\nknowledgeable \r\ninteractive \r\norganized \r\nrespectful ",
            "\u00a0Justin ins a very knowledgeable scholar who can answer pretty much any question about biblical scholarship with more detail than you imagined. He is a very logical and comprehensive thinker who is committed to his field. I felt as though he was able to guide us through discussion well, and he could direct our conversation to key themes when necessary. \r\n\r\nHowever, his opinions as a scholar were very clear. He made no effort to hide his own biases, and we definitely got the impression of what kinds of scholarship he thought was valid or not. he put us in the position of defending what we thought was valuable in different readings. \r\n\r\nTo improve his teaching for the purposes of this kind of a discussion section, he might try and save a little of his own opinions for the end of class, and yet I'm not sure that I would have preferred that, as his genuine opinions and experiences made me trust what he was saying and listen to him from his own position as a scholar. ",
            "\u00a0My teaching fellow was John Tracy Thames (TJ) but he was not an option in the multiple choice. \r\n\r\nTJ was clear in what he expected out of our assignments and tests. He also facilitated section discussions well. He held space for everyone to speak and asked questions that helped students delve further into the material. I felt that this was a strong section that I was able to get a lot out of. ",
            "\u00a0I didn't have Justin, I had TJ. ",
            "\u00a0Justin was a great TF. ",
            "\u00a0Accessible and extremely generous with his time \r\nGave excellent advice on sources and books \r\n\r\nSections were too short - not his fault, but it left some of the material for section not covered in the depth it required ",
            "\u00a0Justin is a very good Teaching Fellow. He encouraged lively discussion and debate. He also provided really good background information on many of the hermetical issues. ",
            "\u00a0Mark has a really great sense of how to run a section - starting with names, and then moving to the topic of discussion he emailed us about.  Usually there were reading questions sent out in advance, or he would tell us to come to section with our own questions about the reading.  Mark's use of the board was also very effective - too often in other sections, everyone talks, but because the board isn't used, we end without a clear sense of what the key points were.  It was a pleasure being in Mark's section this semester. ",
            "\u00a0Mark is brilliant yet concerned pragmatically about how he delivers information.  He constantly asked for feedback about his teaching, and had TF peers sit in on section to review him.  If he thought he had misdelivered on material, he humbly went back and retaught the material.  He was considerate in class and approachable outside.  He will make for an excellent professor after Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Mark has been the most impressive teaching fellow I have worked with at YDS.  He is respectful, organized, and facilitated discussions that extended the classes core text and lectures.  His feedback was helpful and, when asked, he offered criticism in a constructive  manner. ",
            "\u00a0Mark was great.  He was really responsive to questions via email and gave good feedback! ",
            "\u00a0My Teaching fellow was TJ Thames, and there is no option to check him as my Teaching Fellow. Dr. Thames led discussion excellently and graded fairly. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, Mark was pretty good. He led section well and fostered discussion with skill. ",
            "\u00a0Neither of the above TFs were mine. I was with TJ (John Thames.) He led a fast paced, demanding section, easily the most challenging class of my first semester at YDS.  I was a bit left behind, despite having done the reading, and reached out to TJ. I was afraid to do it, thinking perhaps at an Ivy League school it was sink or swim. Without dumbing-down the section, he made adjustments so that those of us who were completely lost in the beginning might find our way. He was responsive, and seemed to sincerely want us all to succeed, especially regarding the exegesis paper, which was confusing for a lot of us who had never written one. A+++ ",
            "\u00a0Mark was a wonderful TF. He brielfy reviewed lecture material as necessary and was always well-prepared to discuss section material. He clarified questions and concerns from class and encouraged conversation creatively, whether it was in small groups or as a whole. Overall, one of the best TFs Ive had. ",
            "\u00a0Mark did a great job this semester. I greatly enjoyed his section and thought he was a fantastic teacher. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Recieved feedback gracefully and made changes to his class accordingly. ",
            "\u00a0Mark was an excellent TF. He engaged us in further discussions that expanded our ability to interact with what we were learning in class. He was able to facilitate those discussions in such a way that we never went off topic but were challenged to think deeper and/or broader. In this process, he was also patient and affirming of our perspectives and ideas before he then challenged us to think further about those perspectives and ideas. ",
            "\u00a0Mark was an excellent instructor. He seemed to have been deflecting the course disorganization and insensitivities to LGBT and disability issues. Mark was willing to learn from student feedback. He was incredibly responsive and available via email and in person. He was willing to meet with students to resolve issues and aid in student learning support as needed. He was helpful with comments on exams and term papers. ",
            "\u00a0Mark is one of the most helpful people associated with YDS I have come to know. ",
            "\u00a0My teaching fellow is not actually listed here. John Thames, my teaching instructor, was consistently prepared and knowledgeable. He was approachable and knew how to push the class discussion forward. ",
            "\u00a0Mark was thorough, thoughtful, and asked us to critically apply the techniques we read about to the text. His enthusiasm for the field, and his willingness to take seriously the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches to the text were invaluable for diving deeper into the texts each week.\r\n\r\nI think Mark is a great teacher, and will continue to grow as he goes forward. He took our feedback seriously and worked to modify the class format to better meet the needs of his students. He could grow in terms of noticing who doesn't contribute in class and setting up some exercises that engage the more introverted students. ",
            "\u00a0Mark was a wonderful TF. He is extremely quick to understand the often-unclear questions raised by students, and always thorough and direct in his responses. I greatly appreciated his extensive suggestions for improvement (which were encouragingly-worded!) on my paper, even though I received a high grade. My only critique of Mark's teaching would be that he could improve his discussion questions to be more provocative and engagingit often seemed that more time in section meetings was spent presenting or articulating the material, rather than establishing \"in-roads\" to the material, which I think would have been a good thing for a survey class such as this one.\r\n\r\nAlso, Mark was consistently able and willing to meet with studentsif the discussion questions did not necessarily draw students farther into the material, Mark's impressive facility with the material of his field and encouraging presence certainly did. ",
            "\u00a0He was very good at engaging all of us in discussion.  If someone had answered a lot of questions, he would always be sure to make sure others had a say, too. I think this is a great strength of a teacher. Cant think of anything Mark did poorly! He was incredible, intelligent, and kind to us all.  Would be delighted if he ever were to be my TF again. ",
            "\u00a0Mark was an excellent teaching fellow. His comments on my paper were both thoughtful and encouraging. As someone who hopes to be involved in academia, his feedback was an example of the feedback that I'd like to give someday. His leading of discussion was, for the most part, very good. He allowed us room to speak and structured our often disjointed thoughts on the board. However, there were times that I wished that our section meetings had a more set agenda than simply reviewing material. Sometimes, Mark's questions to us as a group were too broad and left me with more questions than answers. While I recognize that this is a hallmark of higher education, I believe that it could be scaled back a little bit. ",
            "\u00a0Mark was a great teaching follow. He was available during section to answer questions as it related to class lectures or readings. He showed a great deal of knowledge regarding the Hebrew bible. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Too many to name. Mark Lester is better than most professors I have had. He is kind, careful and thorough. He is also very clear, well paced and an excellent lecturer- as well as an amazing discussion mediator. For a class that is split between people who are interested in the material for academic purposes, and a class that is required of MDivs, Mark Lester easily has one of the most difficult tasks at YDS: managing a healthy and respectful discussion on religion for 50 minutes every week. He handled it beautifully. Moreover, he somehow managed to maintain authority and demand respect from students, while simultaneously breaking down the student/teacher hierarchy and treating everyone like equal colleagues. This is a quality that I do not see from many TFs, as most feel like they have to bully their way into demanding respect from people who are sometimes their peers in age, experience and education. When asked a difficult question, Mark was able to express that he was more than competent in the topic, while also being able to say \"I don't know, I will have to think about this more, that is a good point I did not consider, I will get back to you,\" etc.. He is generous with his time, and generous as a person. He will make an excellent professor. \r\nWeaknesses: I'm a critical person, and I love to write about weaknesses in people. I cannot think of a single one about Mark Lester. "
