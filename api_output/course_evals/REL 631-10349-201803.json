            "\u00a0Very knowledgable, enthusiastic about the subject matter, and engaging. The only complaint I have is that sometimes we'd seem to go a little too far down a tangent in discussions, but overall I enjoyed them. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Super enthusiastic about the content. Made me not totally hate the class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: did not always provide enough space for discussion to happen ",
            "\u00a0Great at encouraging discussion and supplementing Prof Herdt's lectures with clear explanations of the material. Gave helpful feedback and comments. Clearly invested in helping students understand and wrestle with the topics of the course. ",
            "\u00a0I think Justin definitely brings a dynamism and charisma to the way that he teaches, and it is clear that he is very knowledgeable about the material in class. I appreciate that a lot in an instructor, and I think that he did try to make the class somewhat accessible. However, that being said, I also felt that his demeanor could also have come off as somewhat intimidating - and I think most especially, that I found it particularly difficult for me to approach him because of my lack of knowledge or understanding of the material. ",
            "\u00a0Justin is a very knowledgeable, enthusiastic, and generous teacher.  He was well-prepared and energetic, and always eager to help us understand the material and get to the bottom of difficult issues.  I'd suggest that Justin mellow the \"socratic method\" approach a bit - occasionally the discussions felt a bit like we were playing a game within slightly artificial rules he had set.  I liked his insistence on participation - I just think he could have been a bit more flexible (not too much!) in letting the discussion evolve a bit more of its own accord. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed Justin's enthusiasm, intellectual rigor, and professionalism that he brought to the classroom. Some others have commented that he comes off a bit presumptive, but I tend to disagree because I sense the nuance and openness to others' ideas around the seminar table. He treats each students' perspective with respect and shows he values them by engaging with them on their own merits. ",
            "\u00a0Justin knows the material really well. Probably he is the most helpful phD student during my three-year YDS experience. His written comments were also helpful. ",
            "\u00a0He showed a mastery of the course materials ",
            "\u00a0Justin is an excellent teacher and lecturer. His feedback in writing and in one-on-one meetings was very helpful. He is a charitable thinker, and he knows how to identify the best kernel in someone else's work and make that kernel as powerful as it can be.\r\n\r\nHe knows the tradition inside and out, and he can render complicated concepts simple. He believes  the stakes are very high, and he can clearly communicate these stakes to his students. It's clear that he cares desperately that students understand important ideas in the theological tradition. Theology is very much alive and dangerous for Justin Hawkins, and this is a gift to all his students.\r\n\r\nOne suggestion: Justin could benefit from moving a bit more slowly in discussions. Although his energy breathes life in the classroom, it can intimidate some students and close space for contributions from less confident students. That said, I think Justin does try to leave space in discussions, and he does table overly technical discussions, and he does ask follow up questions to students who contribute less. ",
            "\u00a0Justin clearly demonstrates a mastery of the subject matter. I felt he was more than capable of handling the class discussions. He was also very good at providing timely and apropos feedback for class assignments and participation. Excellent job. No perceivable weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0Justin brought energy and enthusiasm to each class, and seemed genuinely excited to dive into the readings. His teaching style is unique, and at times a bit hegemonic, though I don't think he means to come off this way. I wish he had presented some of his interpretations of the readings as being \"an interpretation\" as opposed to \"his interpretation\" or \"the interpretation,\" which might have signaled that these views were up for debate as opposed to being authoritative. For example, phrasings like \"one view on this might be...\" or \"A possible way to read this text is...\" followed by a \"Does this seem like a helpful reading to you?\" or \"Do we see any problems with this interpretation?\" ",
            "\u00a0Justin was an incredible Teaching Fellow. He always knew the material in great detail, could explain anything and make connections with other writers, and he was fantastic with facilitating discussion. I really appreciated how much he pushed us to be the best students we can be, and I truly learned a lot from him both in terms of content and in terms of being a better graduate student. I really hope to have him as a teaching fellow again. ",
            "\u00a0Enthusiastic but teaching style felt a bit too directed as my understanding was it was meant to be more of an open discussion of the topic.  Marking felt a bit naive on certain topics when compared to marking and comments from other professors in similar areas. At times it felt like he was not open enough to other styles or interpretations. Comments felt more like how to make the response the answer he wants when I think a good teacher should give comments to develop or challenge the argument being presented. ",
            "\u00a0Justin had an amazing grasp on the material and was extremely helpful both in and out of class.  Truly felt as though he cared about his students and their success in the class. "
