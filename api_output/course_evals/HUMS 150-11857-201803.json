            "\u00a0Bloom asks great questions about the texts and we had stimulating class discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Gained experience with deep dives into Shakespeare's language and characters, learned how to ask powerful questions about the text. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a different way to read Shakespeare and analyze his works, mainly through Professor Bloom's own lens. He pointed out many similarities between the texts and, mainly, his own study of how Shakespeare describes and develops his characters throughout the play. "

        [
            "\u00a0It is hard to conduct the class over Skype -- sometimes there are technical difficulties and sometimes it is just awkward -- but all in all, it's actually not a big deal. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: laid-back yet engaging discussions, low workload, passionate classmates and professor (obviously), lots of reading the text. \r\nWeaknesses: takeaways were not always clear, more just hearing one (albeit expert and interesting) perspective on the plays, with a large focus on characters. Lots of great but unanswerable questions. ",
            "\u00a0The obvious strength is that you get to work with the renowned Professor Bloom, and get his insight directly from him, rather than just from reading his texts. It also benefits from being a small class and (in my opinion) from focusing only on Shakespeare's comedies and histories. You have the opportunity to focus in on a really specific subject and participate in the discussion, which I found a strength. A weakness, however, is that the class is taught via Skype, which definitely changes the dynamic. Also it's an informal requirement of the class to visit Harold every week or two weeks (it's about a 25 minute walk or a 7-8 minute Uber, and he prefers to meet in the mornings on weekends), which isn't necessarily a weakness but it is something important to keep in mind. "

            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely. It's a no-brainer to take a class with Harold Bloom, who is still mentally sharp even in his old age. You read a play a week and, guided by Bloom, ponder the delights and difficulties of Shakespeare. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. A rich learning experience, but also not much work at all. Tends to attract really good students, so the class discussions are always lively and interesting. Prof. Bloom is still whip smart. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student who already loves Shakespeare and knows some of his work. Bloom's class will not provide you with the background on a text and is not about close reading, but his questions are brilliant and added another dimension to the way I read Shakespeare. ",
            "\u00a0This felt like an indulgent course for getting to just dive into Shakespeare once a week with the most passionate of Shakespeare scholars and great classmates. I loved the excuse to read the comedies I'd never read before and be guided to the most interesting aspects by Harold Bloom. We spent a lot of discussion time reading scenes aloud, which was fun and also an important starting place for any discussion of Shakespeare. However, sometimes discussion could be slow because Harold would hit us with a huge, unanswerable question, and it was a little thought to get traction. And his proposed answers are based on his lifetime of experience of this language, so sometimes he discusses at a high level and doesn't always explain where in the language and structure of the plays his ideas come from. So not as concrete as the lectures perhaps, and less chance to try your hand at writing about the plays.  But it's still great to wrestle with and hear his perspective on those questions. A joyous class if you love Shakespeare. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Low workload, great literature (obviously), great professor (also obviously). Just be prepared to get cold-called! ",
            "\u00a0#1 course at Yale; a tutorial experience with the world's preeminent humanities mind, for which one attends university. (Especially in moments of languishing in academic freedom, as all are wont to on occasion, it very much is Yale's Slug Club, complete with +1s to the annual holiday party at ol' Harold's home.) ",
            "\u00a0I think you have to know what you're getting into with this class. First of all, it's only Shakespeare's comedies, so you have to know if you're willing to read and talk about Shakespeare all semester long. Also, you have to know that Harold Bloom tends to prefer his own views (naturally), so it's not really a survey course on Shakespeare - instead, it's a class on Harold Bloom's perspective on Shakespeare, and only his perspective. Of course he has a very interesting and well thought out perspective, but it tends to differ from most scholars. So just know that this class will differ pretty significantly from the Shakespeare lecture, which is much more balanced. Also know that it's a small class where you are expected to visit Harold at his house pretty frequently (there will always be tea waiting for you). If that appeals to you, then I absolutely recommend this class. "
