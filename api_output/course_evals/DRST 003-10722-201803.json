            "\u00a0I learned how to read and evaluate arguments carefully. Writing the essays forces you to scrutinise short passages really carefully and to break down the reasoning in each sentence into extensive arguments. ",
            "\u00a0Acquaintance with the major thinkers from Plato to Aquinas. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to logically reconstruct the arguments of the philosophers we read and understand them in the context of their larger tradition. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write papers that analyze philosophical arguments. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write a good philosophy paper, how to think in terms of premises and conclusions, and the thoughts of our great thinkers. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write a philosophical analysis. I also learned how to think critically and philosophically about classical philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0My main takeaway from this class was that I learned how to think philosophically. I learned how to boil down my arguments into simple, easy-to-understand points so that I could argue more efficiently, and see things more clearly. I am someone who had little experience in philosophy and was much more attuned to literature; this way of thinking was extremely helpful both in understanding the arguments of major philosophers and in critically assessing their arguments as well as arguments and discussions I would have with my peers. \r\n\r\nThe other big takeaway for this class for me was that I learned a lot of the philosophic basis of Western thought, which is pretty cool. A large focus on Plato and Aristotle really comes in handy for talking about philosophy in general. ",
            "\u00a0This was my first exposure to studying philosophy ever, and I think it was an ideal one. The DS Philosophy lectures were consistently good, allowing me to gain exposure to how the professors work through philosophical problems and outline arguments. This was key as I began to write my first-ever philosophy papers, and by the end of the course I can say that I have gained practical skillsways to conceive and construct an effective philosophy paper, how to talk about such ideas in seminaras well as a general knowledge of early philosophical thinkers. ",
            "\u00a0Learned the basics of writing and thinking about philosophy, gained a foundation for thinking about philosophical thought in antiquity ",
            "\u00a0A general understanding of western philosophy from Ancient Athens to about 1200 AD. You get out of this course what you put into it, and I found that got exactly what I wanted out of it. I can now skomewhat eloquently speak about complex philosophical principles that form the foundation of more contemporary philosophical thought. Additionally, the papers helped a great deal in terms of giving me an opportunity to explore a few topics more in depth than we did in class, which I liked. Overall, a great course. ",
            "\u00a0I gained insight into how to relate the questions raised in the canon of Western philosophical thought to modern philosophical questions and into the everlasting and interconnected nature of those questions. I also learned how to read philosophical texts and then ask questions about them and discuss them academically in speech and writing. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a basic understanding of ancient philosophers and schools of philosophy. Began to train my philosophical and critical thinking, especially regarding the evaluation of an argument's validity. "

            "\u00a0This survey in particular felt more comprehensive and in-depth than the other courses, because we were engaging with arguments and key ideas. It was really fascinating, especially for someone who had never studied much Philosophy before. One weakness was that the class discussions - particularly at the beginning - could be a little meandering and off-topic, because at the beginning it's a little difficult to know what to discuss about the arguments. ",
            "\u00a0Maybe not enough direction from Professor; sometimes class felt unspecific-- wandering a bit. The material is really difficult, and students come into class not always really knowing what was going on in what they just read-- so a bit of summary, major concepts etc. -- concision-- would be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very engaging in forcing every student to add their input on the texts we were reading, although it could have been improved by forcing the students to debate closer to their initial values as it relates to the text. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths was the course material. The weaknesses were that we were thrown into writing philosophical papers and there is a steep learning curve to that. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n- I learned how to think philosophically\r\n- My peers were incredible and my teacher was amazing \r\n- I learned how to write a philosophy paper \r\n- I had fun doing so \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- It's a fast pace, and it's hard to cover this much ground with so little time\r\n- The fast pace of this course also makes it challenging to learn how to write a philosophy paper in so short a time. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were amazing! My professor was amazing! I think that makes all the difference. I think there could be more support provided for the first paper, since this is many students' first philosophy paper ever. I definitely felt very thrown into it the first time, and I wish there were clearer sources of support, example essays to look at, etc. so I could have a better idea of the task I was setting out to complete. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: lectures were really helpful in helping to understand readings, really wide range of course material that connected in surprising ways\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes too much material to read through thoughtfully and process before/during class ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is the seminar. While the lectures were not always the most engaging or easiest to follow, the weaknesses of some of the lectures were compensated by the seminar discussions where we were encouraged to voice our confusion and often worked as a group to bring us all to a place of understanding. The biggest strength I believe of our seminar was that a remark about being confused was always allowed and welcomed and never looked down upon. Another weakness of the course is that when the majority of the class had not read the assigned material, seminar discussions would obviously decline steeply in quality and productivity. This would especially take place during the seminar meeting right before a paper was due. This could possibly be improved through making the readings during the week of a philosophy paper deadline less heavy. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Great overview of numerous philosophers and their ways of thinking, particularly Plato and Aristotle. The focus was metaphysics (world view) and humans' relationship with their soul, if they had one.\r\nWeaknesses: A lot of variation in amount of deep analysis of material, one week we covered less than a chapter of Aristotle's Metaphysics and the week after we looked at works of four philosophers from the Epicurean and Stoic School. "

            "\u00a0This was a really excellent introduction to philosophy - although obviously we couldn't focus much on any individual philosopher, as a whole you could see how the different thinkers were distinct from each other. One thing that I found particularly brilliant about the course was on its insights on god and religious belief, because it was the first time I considered these questions on a philosophical grounding, and there was so much unexpected openness and strength on both sides of the argument that I feel like I need to take much more time to learn and understand more. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the material is essential to any sort of canonical understanding of the history of philosophy: each reading informs the next. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it if they had an interest in reading a lot of Plato and Aristotle and understanding the foundational ideas of Western Philosophy, struggling a bit in their reconstruction of those ideas, and ultimately coming out a better thinker and writer. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to people that are interested in a foundation in philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would. DS is amazing, you get access to great teachers and great peers, and if you enjoy reading a lot and a lot of discussion this course is for you. If you love philosophy, I would strongly recommend taking this course. If you do not like reading a lot, fast-paced courses which can't by nature cover everything on the syllabus with as much clarity as you want, or writing 9 essays over the course of a semester, don't take it. If you're on the fence, try it: I found this class especially to be highly engaging, extremely fun, and worth my while. ",
            "\u00a0I would take DS if just for philosophyI really enjoyed learning how to think this way for the first time. It definitely is a personal thing thoughsome people hated it, I happened to love it. Thus, I would recommend putting full heart into this DS course and seeing whether you enjoy philosophy or not, since this is definitely a great introduction to the field, especially given how much close access and time you have with a professor whose expertise is in this field. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - I would recommend DS in general, but esp. philosophy to anyone who is interested in taking other philosophy courses (I learned so much about approaching philosophical texts and thinking about fundamental questions in philosophy) ",
            "\u00a0See response to question #1. ",
            "\u00a0If one is interested in the course and willing to do the readings, I would highly recommend it. However, an interest and a willingness to work hard is key because you will not be getting out of the course its full potential if you do not engage with the texts on an individual level. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend! I never took philosophy and it was one of my favorite subjects last semester. Section discussions were very engaging, sometimes we veered off topic but overall I was ready to be very perplexed by the end of every class and have my views challenged. The readings are quite dense, so be ready for that, but they are very doable. "
