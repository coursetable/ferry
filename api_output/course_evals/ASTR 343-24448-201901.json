            "\u00a0Survey understanding of exoplanets, black holes, and cosmology. Really cool stuff! ",
            "\u00a0- Some familiarity with the mathematics of special and general relativity.\r\n- An understanding of the Minkowski and Schwarzchild metrics, and how to apply them to understand black hole dynamics.\r\n- A basic overview of the Lambda-CDM model of the universe.\r\n- An introduction to modern research topics in astronomy, from the CMB to Big Bang nucleosynthesis and inflation. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about exoplanet detections ,black hole metrics , and cosmology history (including  FRW metrics importance and how to use it in various situations such as CMB) ",
            "\u00a0I Learned about black holes ",
            "\u00a0I learned some basic principles of how to detect/understand exoplanets, special relativity, an introduction to general relativity with a focus on GR (including gravitational waves), and an introduction to cosmology (identifying cosmic parameters, dark matter, dark energy, etc.) As a non-physics major, I also got good practice with how to approach problems in physics and how to search through the literature and write a review paper. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about astronomy, generally and some specifics. We did lots of derivation and graphing too. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about exoplanets, relativity, and cosmology. As a non-major, this class was the only way I was going to learn any of those, realistically. And because this is the non-gut astrophysics class, I even understood them at a more than cursory level, which is extra nice. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The class covers a lot of really interesting material. However, I don't think it's quite struck the balance of survey course vs. in depth math/physics course -- sometimes it felt like we were going through complicated derivations too quickly. The prof and TA were always available and helpful after class, though. ",
            "\u00a0The tests are very much computation heavy when the point of the class is a conceptual and cursory understanding of a large variety of topics. Not a good thing. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- Tackles some mathematically hairy topics with grace, enabling students to engage with the technical material without having to learn tensor calculus.\r\n- Is clearly organized into three modules, each of which serves a distinct purpose.\r\n- Provides tons of great resources from which to learn more, if you're so inclined.\r\n- Gives you a chance to think about things you might never consider otherwise unless you plan on becoming an astronomer.\r\n- Good curation of topics that allows you to drink water from the firehose without drowning.\r\n- Familiarizes you with plotting and other data visualization techniques, as opposed to pure mathematics.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Jumps the shark a little bit midway through its treatment of black holes, and accelerates in esoteric difficulty from that point.\r\n- Teaching can be fairly tied towards the textbook(s), which makes the material hard to follow when you don't understand the presentation.\r\n- At times less mathematically detailed than you'd like, at others, too much so (to the point of tedium rather than confusion).\r\n- If you want to fully keep up with the course, there's a _lot_ of technical reading. It isn't necessary to do well in the course, but especially if you feel lost, you'll want to do it. This makes the class a lot more work than it feels worth, at times.\r\n- The exoplanets module is mostly an application of PHYS 180 to other solar systems, and I personally didn't find it very compelling (it felt like a lot of algebra for not a lot of reward). This could be due to the alignment of my personal interests rather than a weakness in the curriculum itself, but I would have prefered more time be spent on the more interesting material (GR, black holes, and cosmology). ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were very engaging. The psets sometimes required coding and that proved to be troublesome sometimes. ",
            "\u00a0It was a little disorganized I would say, and having to code for one random problem set was not great. Didnt really build. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this class! The biggest strengths were Professor Newburgh (who is great) and the material, which I found just inherently fascinating. I also really liked the level of the class, which is relatively uncommon: we went beyond simply skimming the surface of the topics and actually did problems and engaged with the math and the big underlying questions, but we didn't get bogged down in proofs and details so it was accessible to a non-physics major like me. I would say that the breadth of topics and the fact that we didn't go incredibly in-depth into them is probably also the weakness, though, as it's true that to really deeply understand most of the topics presented I would have to spend more time with each one. ",
            "\u00a0This course is really interesting, but not well taught. I felt that Prof. Newburgh would skip over things that felt important or describe confusing topics like special relativity, in a non-linear way. I think she should branch more from the textbook so that we can learn about topics in two different ways. ",
            "\u00a0There's little to improve on. The course gets through the material straightforwardly and thoroughly. And with the intricacy of the material at hand, and the ambitious amount of ground to cover, it would be difficult to do it any other way.\r\n\r\nSometimes, though, it felt like I was writing down formulas without getting what they mean. Some of the onus for that is on me, of course; and maybe smarter students in the class saw the conceptual connections clearly while I floundered. But if there's a suggestion I have, it's to try to make it clearer what each variable represents, and what each equation demonstrates. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this class if you have a pretty strong interest in the topics covered -- the derivations can get a little dry sometimes. If you take it, make sure to go to office hours!! ",
            "\u00a0I can't really offer an appraisal of this as a course in the physics curriculum, seeing as I'm just taking it for fun. But as a non-physics, STEM major, this class was a great introduction to some of the more advanced topics in astronomy and cosmology. If you're interested in getting a mathematical background on topics from GR to black holes to the big bang, this is a great way to sample what's on offer without having to first get a degree in physics or mathematics. You'll apply some algebra and basic calculus to study everything from the strange motion of objects around black holes to the expansion of the universe (and of universes with other possible configurations of matter and energy). I found it a great technical perusal of some fascinating graduate-level topics, and I'm very glad I got the opportunity to study them as an undergrad. As someone who never plans on using this knowledge except to make dinner conversation with astronomers, I'm very happy I took the course and would recommend it to anyone familiar with the popular presentations of relativity, black holes, or cosmology, but who wants to delve a little deeper. If you _are_ taking it for fun, be warned that there are weekly problem sets in addition to a 10-page paper and two exams, so you do need to put in a bit of work to get something out of this class. But I think that, if you do, you'll find it quite rewarding. Also, if Luna is TAing again, she's the best, so go to office hours. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to another student even remotely interested in astrophysics ",
            "\u00a0I would. Wasnt terrible for a science credit for applied math. But be careful, you have to teach yourself a lot of the material even though its cool. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, I would recommend this class to anyone interested in learning more about astrophysics and cosmology as long as they have some experience with intro physics and like doing math. Professor Newburgh was one of the best professors I've have in STEM and her lectures were always fascinating and well-constructed. The problem sets were just long enough to help us understand the material without being a chore, the exams were fair, and I really enjoyed the final project, which let us write a paper about any modern topic related to the class that we were interested in. I would not recommend, however, if 1) you want an easy class (even if the work was never excessive, I found a lot of it quite conceptually challenging!) or 2) if you want to have a truly fundamental understanding of GR or cosmology, because this class is more of an intro/survey for people with limited background in those areas. Otherwise, it was phenomenal! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I thought it was really interesting! ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course! It's also hard. A solid understanding of both single-variable calculus and elementary physics, along with a decent IQ, are critical prerequisites. The difficulty difference between gut cosmology and non-gut cosmology is HUGE.\r\n\r\nWith that said, it's an awesome class which stands to teach you a lot. I get relativity now, to at least some degree--even as a non-science major. And it is so goshdarn cool. I get how crazy things like the barn-pole paradox and twin paradox can happen. I could tell you how spaghettification happens, and where it becomes painful (for really big black holes, *inside* the event horizon!). And I know the outline of how the universe came to be what it is today, and how we know that it went that way. You won't get in-depth understanding of these topics in gut astro, and this might be the only course where non-STEM majors can gain that perspective. If that sounds appealing, take this course. "
