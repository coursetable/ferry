            "\u00a0Developed strong conversational and written Vietnamese. ",
            "\u00a0I got a better understanding of Vietnamese grammar. I got much better at reading and writing in Vietnamese. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to better my Vietnamese and to correct errors that accumulated from years of growing up and speaking grammatically incorrect. ",
            "\u00a0With parents that are both Vietnamese and growing up speaking the language in the home, this class gave more solidity to the already-existing structure that I had, which was nice. I had never learned to formally read or write, or even learn the alphabet before this class - which I am very thankful to have learned in this class. I was also able to meet more Vietnamese people my age and just in general, which was great since my community at home is not very Vietnamese. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to proficiently read and write Vietnamese on a higher level than previously. "

            "\u00a0I liked how low-key, familial, and supportive the class was. Because we were all there to learn as heritage speakers, we got to go over topics that I'd always wanted to be able to talk about: traveling, family, climate, etc. And because Thay was always very supportive, the presentations didn't feel too high-pressure, which is nice if you're an anxious person like me.\r\n\r\nI think the coursework could have been reorganized. By the second half of the course, we were doing hours of homework between every class--typically a 500 word journal that took 2-3 hours to do and a homework packet that took at least 2 hours (typically 3-4). There was a lot of homework (for a 1 credit language course), but I was more frustrated with the organization of the homework. I wish that there were grammar explanations and/or examples before the grammar pages and vocabulary lists (with definitions) for the stories, songs, and other literature we went over. Because there were neither (and we didn't always get a chance to study the grammar and vocab in class before the homework), it was hard for me to learn the grammar and vocabulary in a systematic way. So, when I did the homework, I often felt confused and frustrated. We have no textbook and google translate is not the most trustworthy source, so I felt as if I was often guessing. I also wish that there were more quizzes and such throughout the course to solidify and test our grasp of the concepts. ",
            "\u00a0I wish that we knew what our grades were. I am sad to see that none of our grades were put on Canvas. \r\n\r\nI do love the class and the way it was taught. I can tell our professor really cared about us and about helping us learn the language. The class felt like family. ",
            "\u00a0I admit that I, along with other students similar to me, were thrown into the course which is a good thing and a bad thing! It motivated us to learn and try our best to keep up with the material, but it was difficult to read and write correctly since it seemed like spelling and grammar wasn't a very organized, discrete topic that was learned in one set throughout the class. Strengths of this class is that Prof. Quang is very kind and understanding and patient when students make mistakes or say something incorrectly; it makes a good learning environment to be patient with yourself and others, and to learn from mistakes without being judged. ",
            "\u00a0The professor is prepared to thoroughly engage students in this class and he creates a learning environment where students are not afraid to make mistakes. Negative is that the class only meets twice a week. "

            "\u00a0As a heritage speaker, this is a great way to improve your Vietnamese. Thay Quang is really supportive, kind, and knowledgeable. He is able to connect us with the Vietnamese community at Yale and he really makes our class feel like family. There's a lot of work involved (or a lot more than I expected, at least), but given that we were the first year without a textbook, the work felt disorganized. I suspect that Thay will adjust the course based on our comments and structure the workload better, but otherwise, I enjoyed the class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you feel you want to learn Vietnamese and don't know how to read or write this course is for you. One of the greatest gifts from your Yale experience could be learning your heritage language. I know for me, this was certainly a joy that I will cherish even beyond graduation. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to anyone who know Vietnamese remotely, even from home. It's great for developing some knowledge on reading and writing, and more formal learning especially if you've never had any formal teaching. I look forward to taking L4. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! To any student interested in learning Vietnamese, this class is a must. Wonderful professor and you'll make many friends from the class. "
