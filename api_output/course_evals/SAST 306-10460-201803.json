            "\u00a0This class provides a comprehensive understanding of the theory of environmental justice, ranging from examples in water quality, urban housing, air pollution, conservation, and the denial of democratic rights and free movement under authoritarian environmental regimes. I thoroughly enjoyed learning more about these scenarios from the context of the Indian subcontinent, and the books assigned each week were written in a way that was not dense academic prose, but very engaging narrative form that showed us how the ideas of environmental justice play out in personal and community-based examples. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt about the nuances of India - the political, economic and social diversity and challenges that it has faced/currently faces, along with the types of environmental issues exacerbated or created from these conditions. We also learnt how India's environmental challenges have changed from colonial times to present day which was really fascinating to learn. ",
            "\u00a0In this course I learned how to think critically about the world around me. We specifically focussed on environmental issues and I feel like I gained a great lens through which to view the world. I also learned a lot about how the environment ties into social justice. This course helped me gain a new perspective and now when I think about social justice and the environment (or really any other issue for that matter) I consider it in a way that is inclusive to all people. In fact, I believe this course helped me become even more empathetic towards underprivileged individuals in the world. I understand now that there are many intersections to poverty, injustice etc. and to make any sort of change we must not only accept the hierarchy that exists (in many respects) but also learn to work with it and around it in order to achieve a goal. "

            "\u00a0This class provides a wealth of understanding that combines the science of environmental pollution, biodiversity, and climate change mitigation, with important relationships of power and hierarchy that are constructed in society. I think the class was organized in a way that did a good job of balancing the historical context Professor Shivi could provide, and giving the space for us to discuss the themes in class as well. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Shivi knows so much about India, topics of justice, and just environmental issues in general. It is really fascinating to listen to him speak and to have him facilitate discussion. The class is structured such that about half the time Shivi \"lectures\" and the other half we discuss the reading for that week. Shivi's lecture portion of the class is good at providing us context that is relevant to our reading and builds our understanding of the topic. Also, the workload for this class is manageable (only 2 essays, being discussion leader once and participating). We read about a book a week, but you don't have to read the entire book extremely closely, and most books are so interesting that you'd want to read it anyway.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Quality of discussion really depends on your classmates. Since this is a small seminar (there were 5-7 of us in total), discussion can be pretty vapid and tangential when people don't do the reading. Shivi really tries to get everyone to speak by linking discussion to the reading posts we put up on Canvas, but what usually ends up happening is that we just expand out to really broad topics irrelevant to the reading which can be annoying when you do the reading and really just want to talk about that. That being said, the broad topics we talked about were still fascinating and important to talk about and I'm glad this class gave us the space to ponder these questions. ",
            "\u00a0The readings were very long but also incredibly interesting so I feel like this was both a strength and weakness--I found that I would have to pick and choose chapters that interested me most but at the same time I would want to read the entire book. "

        [
            "\u00a0Yes, it is a class that provides a lot of well-rounded presentation of environmental justice issues and allows a student to specialize in their research project about a topic they care about. ",
            "\u00a0TAKE THIS CLASS, especially if you have an interest in either India or environmental/sustainability issues! (I'm an Environmental Studies major, but there were EP&E and American Studies students as well) You will learn so much about the barriers to environmental change, connections between social and environmental justice, and how history (e.g. colonial) can have legacies that impact policy/society to today. You might think learning about India is way too specific, but I think all these concepts can be applied to any field and any country. It will change the way you see the world for the better. \r\n\r\nThe Prof, Shivi, also knows so much about India, topics of justice, and just environmental issues in general. He is SO intelligent and it was really fascinating to listen to him speak/to have him facilitate discussion. The class is structured such that about half the time Shivi \"lectures\" and the other half we discuss the reading for that week.

            "\u00a0I would absolutely 100% recommend this course. It is a small seminar so it is very engaging and the professor is wildly knowledgeable on all these topics. He is the kind of professor who is also a great lecturer and very engaging. This course was really cool because it was an intersection of all sorts of different topics and everyone in the class had different perspectives but at the same time it was fun to talk through them and it felt like everyone had a change to engage.
