            "\u00a0L1 Arabic taught the Arabic alphabet and corresponding sounds, basic reading, writing, listening skills etc. I was amazed by how much I learned after just 12 weeks of a language. ",
            "\u00a0The alphabet, basic Vocab how to carry basic conversation in present temse ",
            "\u00a0I began to get a grasp of some basic arabic; being able to make our own 5 minute presentations at the end of term speaking entirely in arabic was a ton of fun as well. And something that was really exciting for me was listening to my friend talk to her mom in arabic on the phone one day and realising that i could pick out a couple of words here and there to get a sense of what they were talking about! ",
            "\u00a0Definitely learned a lot of Arabic, as well as learning new ways to learn language ",
            "\u00a0reading, speaking in Arabic, active classroom discussion, good habits for language study "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The beginning was focused more on exams and testing basic grammar and vocab, while the second half was geared toward reading and writing using the developed vocab, which took pressure off of the second half of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very fun and engaging material and you get really close with your classmates because of all the halting conversation you go through together. To be improved: We don't practice speaking enough given the majority of the people in the room wanted to be able to converse with Arabic speakers in the US. Also homework is only counted as participation so while that decreased the amount of time you had to put in it also made me not learn as much as if it was graded for correctness. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, the class was good, but I didnt think that the homework aligned with in-class lessons very well. ",
            "\u00a0I really appreciated the way the course was structured - with a lot of small assessments where no one assessment could sway your grade too much. It took a lot of pressure off each individual assignment because it made it clear that it was about the everyday cumulative work, which also seems to me like the better way to learn a language/ to be graded on a language course. Sarab is also a great great professor, she's very clear and the workload is very manageable. It is significantly more than the workload with some other language classes but it's honestly totally doable and arabic is such a fun language to learn, I'm so glad I took it! You might hear some horror stories about taking arabic at Yale but I promise it's not like that with Sarab, take it with her!\r\n\r\nI do feel like the friday shaami sessions weren't organised that well but I'm glad that there's a levantine course that's going to happen next fall so that's exciting! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: rich learning, many activities for improving in class\r\nWeaknesses: huge amount of coursework outside of class, spent hours on he and then had to study extra on top of that, also very fast pacing in class, not enough studying of Shami, the language tables didn't really help ",
            "\u00a0the course is organized very consistently and is conducted at a very good rhythm. There is no final exam, and the evaluation process is very fair and natural. the speaking, reading and listening sections are combinated very well "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes, although it is not an easy way to fulfill the language requirement, it is a very rewarding experience that I enjoyed and hope to continue in the future. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would if you take it with Sarab! Good foundational stuff ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if they're interested in learning Arabic then this is a deep dive in, but no if they just want a class to get a requirement ",
            "\u00a0definitely, very worthwhile language to learn and the program is structured in a very relaxing yet rewarding fashion. you come out of it with a better study habits in general! "
