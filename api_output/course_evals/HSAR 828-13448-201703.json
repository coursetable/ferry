            "\u00a0The seminar covered a wide range of primary and secondary source material, both textual and visual, in relation to Diderots art criticism. We enriched our understanding of Diderots ekphrastic mode, his exploration of genre, and his sustained engagement with the painters and key thinkers of the enlightenment, by delving deep into his scientific writing, works on natural philosophy, as well as numerous articles from the Encyclopdie. Additionally, we drew on the work of his numerous interlocutors Condillac, Rousseau, Rameau, Locke, etc. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me the opportunity to delve into Diderot's Encyclopedia and related writing, texts with which I had not previously had the time to engage. They have provided me points of reference for my own personal research, which looks at certain 19th-century travel guides styled after Diderot's Encyclopedia. The course was also a good example for research methodology, in that it demonstrated a multi-disciplinary approach to research, drawing from such fields as philosophy, art history, mathematics, and music theory. "

            "\u00a0I felt the syllabus was well organized and cast a wide net, allowing us to approach Diderots writings on the arts from a variety of angles. I wish the seminar had been more consistently attended, but, small though it was, class discussions proved thought-provoking and stimulating. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: We went over a lot of the reading materials together, which kept the purpose of the class consistently clear; intimate size made for good discussions and interactiveness; interesting subject; I look forward to reading Professor Armstrong's work that comes from this course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Class times changed frequently--communication about this could have been clearer, but I appreciated Professor Armstrong's flexibility, which made meeting convenient for her students.

            "\u00a0Yes for students in both History of Art and French studies, but also students more generally interested in Diderot and enlightenment thought. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student based on the course's interesting selection of readings and its multi-disciplinary approach--the same kind of approach I wish to emulate in classes I eventually teach. "
