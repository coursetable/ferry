            "\u00a0We read a variety of papers related to biochemistry methods, which was helpful. Using primary literature as a basis to discuss these topics often works better than just learning about them in lecture. ",
            "\u00a0I learned many basic principles, logic, and methods in molecular biology and biochemistry. The class taught me how to read papers and think as a true scientist. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about different techniques in molecular biology and biochemistry. Learned how to analyze and read papers critically. ",

            "\u00a0I gained a lot of comfort with reading scientific papers.  I also learned a lot of molecular biology, which wasn't exactly my wheelhouse as an MB&B major, but is really important for historical context.\r\n\r\nThe students-only section (Tuesdays 2:30-4:20, even though that's not listed in the system!) is a great part of the class.  I was skeptical at first, but I really enjoyed getting to discuss the papers with my peers in a no-professor environment.  The Thursday class was also excellent, and Wendy Gilbert is incredible! ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read papers critically, understand experimental logic used in molecular biology, and some fundamental methods often employed in research. ",
            "\u00a0This class gives you an in-depth knowledge of how to analyze and critique scientific papers from different eras, and an understanding of how different techniques in molecular biology evolved over time. The papers you read in this class are generally not too difficult (with some exceptions) and lend themselves to good discussions, but the tone that the discussions take varies. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Because this is entirely a paper-reading class, the strengths and weaknesses are largely dependent on the choice of papers. There were some good ones and some bad ones, although it is encouraging to see that the latter are being gradually phased out. It is often good to value change in these sorts of old historic courses. ",
            "\u00a0I think it would be interesting to split the course by old and new papers (and add a lot more new papers!) to talk about current unresolved questions in biology in addition to the classics ",
            "\u00a0This class is excellent, I think it is an amazing upper level course and really does not need much change except for some of the out-dated papers. Professor Gilbert is working on those, though. This class should stay how it is under Professor Gilbert's command because it really is a special class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Very engaging, Prof Gilbert was very good at steering discussion and letting everyone have an equal say\r\nWeaknesses: Very dependent on the class, other professors sometimes less efficient at partitioning the time, papers not always 100% fascinating but also the survey at the end will hopefully mitigate that, I know prof Gilbert doesn't like grades but as someone who does need to pass, I would've liked some feedback at any point as to how I'm doing ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I think the setup of the class was perfect ",
            "\u00a0Strengths  Thursday sections of the course with professors were generally led well in a way that allowed more students to participate. Tuesday sections are a bit of a wild card and really depends on how the class dynamic plays out. This year we had a few people that monopolized discussions, and it made the course experience difficult for me to enjoy. \r\n\r\nAlso, sometimes our discussions of papers became rather meta and operated on a level that I sometimes thought was pointless. Talking about underlying assumptions is important, but I thought some of our discussions often went astray/too far away from the data. ",
            "\u00a0STRENGTHS: Paper selection is quite broad and introduces a number of important topics to know for anyone going into biology research. The discussions with the professors were also challenging and really challenged me to have a deep understanding of all the papers that we read. Honestly, an almost perfect class, except for one weakness...\r\n\r\nWEAKNESS (singular): Every Tuesday, there is a Student Discussion session when the students meet without the professors to discuss the assigned papers for the week. Since there is very little way to keep people accountable in a group of ~12, many people visibly stopped preparing for these Student Discussion sections and would either talk with friends, work on other assignments, and not engage in the conversation at all. Over time, I think these people eventually set a bad precedent and so others to started to also \"check out\" (especially since there were many 2nd-semester seniors in the class...). I loved this class, however, the number of people who stopped reading the papers towards the end of the semester really made the Student Discussions pointless and frustrating. If there could be some mechanism in place to keep everyone accountable with regards to participating during the Student Discussions (even without the professors being present), then this class would be perfect. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Gilbert is the star of the show in this class, and the style with which she runs the class as well as her contributions in discussion make it one of the best MB&B classes you can take. The papers are both a strength and a weakness, as while the good ones are extraordinary relevant to modern science or explain the reasons why modern science is the way that it is, there are papers that simply aren't engaging and the discussions that result from those can be fairly dry. The biggest problem that the class faces, however, is the way in which the discussion is run: there's a lot of mansplaining and the same voices talking over everyone else, and the professors don't do much to address it. Of course, it's extremely difficult to handle students' behavior in this way especially when they are contributing to the discussion, but I think that a more organized discussion style, guided by the professors, would be extremely helpful in making it easier for students to speak up who feel trodden over by the people who take up the most space in the room.

            "\u00a0This class is more or less entirely reading papers, which may sound daunting at first. In practice, though, the amount of work per week in this class is low. Plus, the papers are pretty interesting. This is definitely worth taking for anyone in MB&B as an elective, although it will probably appeal to few people outside of the major. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, a breath of fresh air at the end of the MBB major. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly highly recommend this course to another student because you learn so much and its a great overall experience. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, Methods and Logic was a really fun course that helped me learn about research methods/techniques and \"logics\". Reading the papers describing the major advances in our knowledge of molecular biology (the triplet code, the DNA transcription machinery, splicing, even CRISPR) was really cool, especially after taking MB&B 301. For those who like prestige, the number of papers related to Nobel-prizes was astounding. For those who like thinking about biology, most all of the papers presented a very cool conceptual way to test an idea in biology, or introduced interesting new ideas themselves. It was also very refreshing to take a seminar class with other students who are very interested in research and get their perspective on how they thought about the papers. I also enjoyed the chalk-talk presentation and project proposal at the end - though the guidelines for the final paper were kind of unclear. All the professors are wonderful people and although sometimes people will get grilled lol, the conversation is very friendly and fun. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course! It does depend on the group that you get in the class, but Prof Gilbert is spectacular and getting to experience MB&B as a seminar both brings you closer to your classmates and enhances your understanding of actual lab techniques and how to propose an experiment ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It is a great way to learn about a lot of important papers in molecular biology. You leave with a knowledge of how to read a paper in great detail and thoroughly. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but make sure you would be able to have productive class discussions with the other people taking it. Your experience will in large part be dictated by your classmates. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend it!  This is a must for an MB&B major, especially one planning on graduate school in science. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who plans on going into any type of biology research. This is the first class I have taken that has challenged me to engage deeply with the primary literature. Professor Gilbert, Hochstrasser, and Schlieker are all wonderful and ask good questions to bring out subtle details in each paper that I missed when reading it over the first time by myself. That being said, as a seminar course, one's experience in this class is sure to change, depending on the make-up of the enrolled students. This semester, there were quite a few people in this class who definitely did not engage with the material as deeply and probably spent very little time reading the papers...which was quite frustrating. Nonetheless, I really enjoyed the intellectual energy and ideas that the other remaining students brought to our discussions. As someone interested in pursuing research, I now feel much more confident in my ability to critically read and evaluate primary literature after having taken this class. TAKE THIS CLASS and don't listen to anyone who says otherwise (since they probably are also the people who didn't do the readings anyways....lol). ",
            "\u00a0If you love molecular biology, absolutely take this class. It should not be limited to MB&B majors, and it also should not be limited to people who are used to taking this type of class or talking about this type of material: discussing papers intensively about topics that you aren't necessarily familiar with is a skill that all scientists should have. The Professors are amazing and the ability of scientific discourse that they demonstrate will reshape the way that you read and discuss scientific papers. Be wary only of how the other people in the class react to being challenged on their thoughts or how much space they give to others to talk. "
