            "\u00a0I think the course is well structured. The workload is good. I think the tests could be more challenging. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that the exams were graded a bit harshly. I also think the course needs more peer tutors because helping a bunch of students with math problems takes quite a long time and going to office hours to ask a simple question usually ends up taking about an hour. The videos were annoying and didn't really tell us everything we needed to know. They were incredibly pointless, I'd rather just do the reading and go to class and I'd probably get more out of it. I liked the format of the classes except for the exit papers because sometimes they took me a bit when I had places to be. I also wish that the examples done in class had included more exam-type information. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Vigliotta was one of the strengths of the class, because despite the flipped classroom, she went over most of the material in class, did lots of practice examples, and was always available and incredibly helpful during office hours. Although the flipped classroom model is not popular with most MATH 115 students, I think that Professor Vigliotta demonstrated how it is supposed to work, with the videos and prep problems acting, not as a replacement for the instructor, but as a more engaging and mandatory equivalent to reading the textbook before class, while the majority of teaching and learning occurs during the class.\r\n\r\nOne of the main weaknesses of the class, perhaps inevitably, was that had a problem set due during the week of the exam, prep problems due the night before the exam, and new material covered in class during those days. It really might be worth considering removing a few topics from the course (maybe the part of sequences that sets you up to learn about series?) in order to make the classes during exam weeks review days. I think that, at the end of the course, the material that I understand least well, is that which was taught right before an exam but then not tested on the exam, because I was too distracted trying to review old material to learn an entirely new topic. ",
            "\u00a0The written homework assignments are usually more difficult than anything we would be asked to do on a test. And they take 4-5 hours if you do them well, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. But students need to plan ahead so they can get it done. \r\n\r\nAlso, we get way too many papers in class. So I have like a hundred pages of random problems/exit tickets in a drawer in my room. ",
            "\u00a0streghths- the instructor\r\nweaknesses- flipped class style ",
            "\u00a0Stop this flipped classroom nonsense! It doesn't work! I learned so much better when my professor was actually teaching me in 112. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- Instructor was very clear and her exit slips were a good indication of material I needed to brush up on\r\nWeaknesses- Did NOT like flipped classroom videos, oftentimes they were way too simplified and not helpful for applying the concepts ",
            "\u00a0The flipped format was sort of weird, but it was tolerable. ",
            "\u00a0I wish there were more practice exams (though there were plenty already, which I liked). The video aspect of it all was also very instructive. ",
            "\u00a0This course was well taught however I prefer the standard classroom set up to the flipped classroom. ",
            "\u00a0The strength was the amazing professor Sarah Vigliotta, but the weakness is that because this was a flipped classroom format, we didn't actually get to utilize her amazing teaching skills enough as we barely got taught. ",
            "\u00a0The course is designed pretty well and was much more interactive than Math 112, which facilitated learning. ",
            "\u00a0The videos aren't very effective at teaching any of the material. The prep problems also felt too difficult after the videos only gave one or two examples that were much simpler or much harder. The book did not include many examples either which made it difficult to grasp any material. ",
            "\u00a0The videos for the flipped classroom are not nearly as effective as learning in class. The videos are a nice supplement to the learning as long as the teacher also goes over the lesson in class. I feel that they are good homework but should not be expected to serve as the primary lesson. ",
            "\u00a0My professor was very helpful with helping us to understand the material. However, the flipped classroom structure was often quite frustrating and meant that I couldn't learn nearly as well as in a normal classroom. ",
            "\u00a0This course has a job to do, and it does that job really well. It basically needs to serve as a prerequisite for other calculus classes and for certain science classes. It does this well and clearly; it does nothing else. Nothing else is required of it. If you're a mathy person it will also inspire in you a sense of wonder for the beauty and neatness of calculus. "

            "\u00a0Yeah if they are interested in math I think its a good class ",

            "\u00a0I would strongly recommend taking Professor Vigliotta's section of the course, and taking full advantage of her office hours. If it's helpful, I placed into this class with a 4 on the AP Calc BC exam, and despite being concerned that my three-years old calculus would not be up to scratch, that placement turned out to be correct. Most classes at Yale are difficult, so I would recommend against purposefully leveling yourself down from your placement, if it means you'll have to take two classes instead of one. ",
            "\u00a0I would. I think calculus is super important for anyone to know and this course will beat it into you pretty ruthlessly. The workload is not too crazy, but it was still my hardest class because the prep problems sometimes proved to be more difficult than I expected and they could take over an hour. So it's about 6-8 hours a week I'd estimate, plus any additional studying you do for exams. ",

            "\u00a0This course reminded me why I love math. If you are looking to pursue a major in the STEM field, you will very likely have to take this course. It is not a particularly hard class, especially considering all the resources provided to students as extra reinforcement tools. It was a wonderful course and would recommend it to any student who liked math in high school and wants to continue on that path on the college level. ",
            "\u00a0Its about what youd expect. ",

The strength was the amazing professor Sarah Vigliotta, but the weakness is that because this was a flipped classroom format, we didn't actually get to utilize her amazing teaching skills enough as we barely got taught. The flipped classroom format was really unproductive to learning. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend Math 115 to another student because it was a challenging yet manageable introduction to integral calculus. ",
            "\u00a0This is a standard calculus course. I would definitely try to figure out which instructors are better because the teacher really makes a difference on whether you will like the class. Overall it is a good class, and the problem sets are generally more challenging than the exams which is nice. ",
            "\u00a0No, only people who want their GPA butchered should take this class. The flipped classroom teaching style  is crazy ineffective and the class isnt curved. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This course is a really really good version of what it is. "
