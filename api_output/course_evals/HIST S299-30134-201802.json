            "\u00a0I began to understand a region that I had previously learned very little about in school. Although Southeastern Europe is an incredibly complex region and holds historical significance, it is often ignored in grade and high school history classes. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a thorough history of the Balkans region from pre-ancient times to present ",
            "\u00a0Ivo Banac is so incredibly knowledgeable about the history of Southeastern Europe and by the end of the course, so are you. He covers everything from the Byzantines to modern times and it's very refreshing to learn it from someone from the region. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the history of th Balkan region, why it was easy to conquer, and why these various conquering resulted in the ethnic diversity in southeastern Europe today. ",
            "\u00a0We learned an overview of the history of the region, but also learned how to make connections in order to track how the events were related. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt so much able the history of the Balkan region, something I knew very little of before this class. I enjoyed covering a wide variety of topics, including different ethnic groups, religious tensions, changing of leadership, and much more. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to critically analyze historical facts and texts, as well as how to interpret history based on current events and situations. ",
            "\u00a0I had an amazing experience learning about the Balkans in Professor Banac's class. ",
            "\u00a0A deeper look into the recent history in Southeastern Europe. I loved the insight and interaction of learning in the classroom and then seeing what we talked about in class on the excursions or just walking around the city. ",

            "\u00a0I found lectures somewhat difficult to follow just because there was SO much information to be learned in a relatively short timespan. I would have liked a little more of a big-picture arc of what we were learning because sometimes I felt bogged down in the details. Nevertheless, it was an incredibly informative class.  And, being able to learn about events and places and then go and actually see them was an incredible experience. ",
            "\u00a0Ivo Banac is THE expert in this field-- huge strength. The lectures were dry at times. Also, there was no accountability for what we learn from lecture. Maybe a short quiz at the end of every lecture would help students keep engaged ",
            "\u00a0He lectures very much focusing on people so it's a bit hard to follow the main points at times. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that the course material are very interesting and Professor Banac is an expert in the field. A weakness would be that it is very complex at times. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very interesting. There were a lot of names that were difficult and often sounded similar, which sometimes made the lectures difficult to follow exactly during these times, but that's just because of the nature of the names. ",
            "\u00a0This course is all around very well taught and interesting, however I think that I would have benefited from lectures being a little more active. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very well structured, and we were able to get through a lot of material efficiently. Professor Banac is incredibly knowledgeable about the subject. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are the professors and the organization of the trip. The professors are very knowledgable and have experienced everything first hand. It was also very organized with the excursions and how it relates to what we were learning in the classroom. ",
            "\u00a0The history part of this corse was really really dense. We covered so many events but didn't go super in depth to many. I would have enjoyed learning about fewer events and diving deeper into the most significant ones. "

            "\u00a0YES! I would definitely recommend this course.  It is a great way to learn about a region that holds great historical and political significance in a relatively relaxed environment. It is the perfect balance of fun and informative for a summer course. ",

            "\u00a0I would without a doubt recommend this course to any interested Yale student. Not only is the basic class material very interesting, but the course being taught in Croatia, allows you to take information from the course and explore it even more in depth outside of the classroom. ",
