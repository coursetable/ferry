            "\u00a0I gained the ability to read and annotate academic papers as well. Additionally, my clarity and conciseness in my writing improved through repeated practice. I also learned to discuss well with my peers. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to gather my ideas into a thesis for a formal research paper.  I wouldn't say my actually writing skills got better necessarily, but the quality of my papers definitely increased over the semester as I learned how to structure them better. ",
            "\u00a0My writing skills became a lot stronger. I was able to develop better analysis skills throughout the course ",
            "\u00a0I developed a deeper understanding about how to write an academic paper. Through writing workshops and many essay drafts, I saw my writing improve and feel like I have a greater understanding of how to organize a paper. After this class, I have more confidence in my writing ability. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about how to write better research papers at the collegiate level. ",
            "\u00a0Writing skills, how to be more clear and concise, focus on following current events ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to develop and execute a well written essay without losing focus of my argument. As a writer, I have always struggled with losing focus as well as adding sentences and phrases that were irrelevant. This class also help changed my thinking on current events within the NFL. ",
            "\u00a0Our class focused a lot on peer editing, so I learned how effective that tool is and how valuable it is to discuss your ideas with someone else in order to give the clearest argument in papers. ",
            "\u00a0I honed my skills in the areas of research, argument development, and general essay-writing.  I was exposed and kept up to date on current news involving the intersection of sports, race, and politics, and I interacted with academic documents examining critical themes of sports for the first time in my academic career. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about how sports and race played out in history and how it continues to be relevant today. This course provided me with the foundation to understanding how sports and race intersect and critical historical figures who played a role in it all and how it is still important today. I strengthened my ability to analyze texts and current events articles as well as improved my writing skills from how to write an intro and conclusion to sentence structure and word choice. "

            "\u00a0This course does a good job of making the material seem relevant. However, there are times where I want to practice my writing skills in a general sense as opposed to just talking about sports and race issues. My writing improved by practicing on papers, but I think it could be improved further through in-class activities. ",
            "\u00a0The weakness of the course is there was not enough time spent on actual writing skills versus improving our ability to conceptualize and narrow down a thesis topic.  The strength of the course lies in the material and how interesting the material was. ",
            "\u00a0The pros were being able to deal with contemporary events.  The scholarly articles were also very good.\r\n\r\nNo cons. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were the writing workshops and the classroom discussions. I felt like I learned a lot from my peers, and I am grateful for having been surrounded by such interesting peers. The professor was very accessible as well which made the class easier to maneuver. The weaknesses of this class were the workload and the grading. Sometimes it felt like we were forced to write one paper after another paper which prevented us from gaining a lot from each paper. Every essay is graded pretty harshly, and I would have liked to know why I got particular grades on certain papers. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are really engaging course topic and interesting readings. ",
            "\u00a0More in depth class discussion was needed, higher participation by students, but the class worked in current events very well ",
            "\u00a0Luckily for our class, we took this course during a time when NFL protests were at an all time high, creating a good basis for our course to work off of. However, I would love to see the course focus on the oppression of more races, rather than primarily focusing on African-Americans. ",
            "\u00a0strengths were that it was fun to talk about all of the current events going on. weakness was that a lot of the classes were repetitive in that we just talked about the reading the whole time, some spice added to the mix would make the class a bit more engaging. ",
            "\u00a0The course dealt with very relevant material and did a great job of keeping up with each development as the NFL protests continued to be a prominent storyline each week. The discussions surrounding current events at the beginning of each class were some of the most interesting of the course. The readings were varied in how interesting and or applicable to class discussion or modern events they were, and conversation would die down into silence occasionally. A more in depth look into sports besides baseball, basketball, and football, as well as races beyond the binary of black and white could greatly enhance the course. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course was its heavy focus on writing.  Students wrote multiple essays, some involving lengthy research processes and the integration of up to ten peer-reviewed sources.  They also participated in anonymous in-class discussions of their own work, allowing them to analyze the writing of their peers and translate the lessons learned from doing so into their own writing processes.  The course could be improved by expanding the curriculum to include more discussion of other races besides the dynamics between whites and African Americans.  \"Race\" seemed to be defined strictly as \"African American\", and rather exclusive of Asian or Latin Americans and the struggles they have dealt with throughout the modern history of sports. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, this course was very strong and covered a lot of material in not a lot of time. I think some of the readings could've been shorter or neglected completely while others were crucial to engaging with the class. I also think class participation was good and played a role in improving the class. "

            "\u00a0Yes. Take this class if you like sports and race. Take this class if you don't want to read excessively jargony papers. Take this class if you want to have a chill teacher and chill classmates.Your writing will improve and the material is fun. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend taking this class only if the subject matter interests you.  I learned a lot about sport and race during this class that I did not know before. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course for someone who hopes to improve their academic and formal writing. Overall, I feel like ENGL 120 may be a better class for someone who is just trying to get out of a writing credit. If you are truly interested in the topic of the course, 114 is worth taking. Be prepared to put a lot of effort into your papers and for the grading to be hard. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, the readings are generally short so the class is not too much work, but covers very interesting and relevant material. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to students with a love of sports who hope to critically discuss and write about the cultural aspect of sports and their relationship with race. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are interested in sports and race or the idea that they intersect and inform one another, then I would definitely recommend this course. "
