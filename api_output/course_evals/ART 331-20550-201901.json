            "\u00a0I learned more about successful use of color in painting and loosening up my work. ",
            "\u00a0I think the most important thing I gained in taking this course was a level of confidence in my painting that I didn't have before. Because we painted so much, and because of the fast weekly assignments combined with the longer, slower final project, I got to really practice different modes of painting and get comfortable painting relatively quickly. Obviously speed is not necessarily the goal when painting, but I think my increased painting speed reflected how comfortable I felt painting. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to paint with attention to purpose rather than prioritizing skill. I found my style more in this class, and I'm very happy for it. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a better understanding of painting techniques and methods. ",
            "\u00a0In this class you are pretty much just given free reign to make whatever paintings you want. You learn about some other artists work during this class. ",
            "\u00a0we learned about specific artists and different painting motifs that we could be inspired by for our individual self-directed projects. "

        [
            "\u00a0It was hard to get engaged with this course. I never felt like the feedback on my work was very useful and the structure was either free work time or weeks on end of 2 hour classes devoted entirely to student presentations which were excessively long and didnt do much for me other than give me the names of artists that I could look into on my own time. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: such a diversity of painting perspectives that Sophy really embraces. You really learn a lot from both Sophy and your classmates, which is super exciting. \r\nWeaknesses: there's just not a lot of structure beyond the weekly assignments. For me this wasn't *really* a weakness because I just wanted a space to paint, but if you want a more instructional course this isn't for you. ",
            "\u00a0The class is meant to be a painting studio class, however we didn't paint much. Mid-semester and final critiques were far too long. Sophy decided that doing artist presentations would be useful, which is true. But in a class of 20, and each one taking an unnecessary 30 minutes, it was far too easy to be bored and disengaged for long stretches of time. The feedback in the critiques felt like the blind leading the blind - no one really knew what direction to take their art in. Sophy's comments were largely \"this art looks nice. It reminds me of x artist who did a show last year in y museum\" - totally uninspiring or critical. ",
            "\u00a0I believe we spent a lot of class time NOT painting, but we were also expected to complete those things outside of class. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked working with Sophy, but sometimes I felt that the critiques were too long. We could also spend less time on presentations. ",
            "\u00a0I wish it were possible to have a smaller class so the critiques could be longer. "

            "\u00a0No. I love painting but this was mostly a sit down and watch your classmates give powerpoints type of class. In the PowerPoints they would try to talk about the work but it felt a lot like the blind leading the blind, none of us were really sure what the work was about wed just be like I like the colors or something. I enjoyed my public high school painting class more. ",
            "\u00a0If you're taking it with Sophy with the goal of getting lots of painting time in and looking at a lot of great art, then absolutely! Art is such an important thing that I do for my mental health, and I feel so lucky that I get to make art and get credit for it! The class isn't very structured, but it keeps you painting with weekly assignments and then a broader project with a midterm evaluation. Also, you'll learn so much from your classmates. Highly recommend! ",
            "\u00a0If a student wants to boost their painting skills and hone in on their style, this class is perfect! I really enjoyed the crits and feedback offered by both students and the teacher. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I think that intermediate painting is a very useful course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend if you like the freedom to do your own thing. ",
            "\u00a0Would definitely recommend.  Great class if you're looking to continue with your work in a self-directed way. "
