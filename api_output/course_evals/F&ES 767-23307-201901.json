            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about land conservation projects, especially in the NGO realm. I did not know about the nuances for these projects before this course. It was helpful to apply concepts in class to our own conservation project to understand the various steps. ",
            "\u00a0This course is SO PRACTICAL. The skills--problem assessment, strategy and project selection, stakeholder engagement, and every other part of the course are things you will have to do in most professional post-FES fields. I feel so much more prepared to take a leadership role in Making Things Happen in whatever organization or agency I end up in next. ",
            "\u00a0Learned many strategies and tools towards framing conservation project, including defining conservation targets, direct and indirect threat to targets, and identifying logical chains of conservation strategies to address environmental problems at varying scales. ",

            "\u00a0The primary insight I developed in this course was an understanding of what tools are used in project design and implementation. This is incredibly valuable moving into a career as an environmental practitioner and not offered in any other course in this school.  I also gained an understanding of conservation specifically from a wildlife conservation framing. ",

            "\u00a0Mostly aligned well--some of the content was a bit more theoretical than real/observed. Was sort of expecting more of Amy and Bill's experience as practitioners to enter the course (which did happen, but only later in the semester). ",

            "\u00a0Level of discussion was too high-level and questions posed weren't meaningful to promote learning or new perspective-taking. It felt too rudimentary/juvenile. I enjoyed having a case study/project to build on throughout the semester, but wish it wasn't so theoretical. Would be nice if the professors could facilitate pairing students with organizations needing assistance in real time (like the Strategies for Land Conservation class) if students don't have a project like that lined up already. Would be helpful to receive more (or any) personalized feedback on homework assignments beyond what was discussed as a group in class lectures. I didn't feel that I gained concrete takeaways from the in-class feedback discussions and wasn't sure whose guidance to follow. Would be helpful to see more examples of well-developed, real-world conceptual models and other decision-support tools before diving in to the theoretical ones for homework. Speed up the pace of the class, and hold it in a different (earlier) time slot if possible. Also, syllabus said homework assignments would be every 2-3 weeks, but in reality they were essentially every week, so I was surprised by the incongruity there and didn't expect that much of a workload so consistently. ",
            "\u00a0It's a long course and the 5:30-8:30 time slot is really difficult, especially when so much is reliant on engagement and discussion. ",
            "\u00a0The course could be improved by different class organization and assignment scheduling. I think it would benefit students more to follow their project throughout the semester with concepts and assignments such that appendices for the final paper are built along the way. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the balance of lectures and workshop during the class period. I appreciated that Amy used real examples from our class to teach specific lessons about project design. Pairing up to share and discuss what we're working on was helpful. \r\n\r\nAt times, it was unclear when an assignment was due--more consistency in deadlines (e.g. what day of the week they're due) would be helpful. Class often ran long, especially at the beginning of the semester. It wouldn't have been a big deal if the class wasn't already at night... ",
            "\u00a0A major weakness of the course is the timing (5:30-8:30pm). Please change the timing of the course to earlier in the day! It was incredibly hard for many in the class to focus in the second half of the class, although I wanted very much to stay engaged. I think a three hour class makes sense given the content of the class, however the timing was very challenging. A major strength of the course is being able to apply the various conservation tools towards a semester long conservation project of varying interest of different students. ",
            "\u00a0The three-hour time slot at dinner time is brutal, but everything else about the course was excellent! It might have been nice to sponsor/facilitate some out-of-class time for group meetings or having the projects be group-based rather than individual, which takes away from some of the coordination aspect of project planning. ",
            "\u00a0I found the course is optimum for students planning to develop projects or working in NGOs in the future. ",
            "\u00a0Linked to question three, I think there could be examples or discussion about how project implementation does not always go as a conceptual model would expect and how to consider unintentional outcomes of projects. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest weakness of this course is that it was not a clinic with real life clients. It seems unproductive to spend this amount of time on a project that isn't real. At a certain point, you have to start guessing/making things up, which isn't terrible useful. It would also seem appropriate for students to work in teams on these projects--in a work setting, it seems fairly unrealistic that you would do this type of planning, budgeting, etc, on your own. If students worked in groups, perhaps tasks could be split up so that some students could spend more time with the tools that are most valuable to them, rather than surface-level involvement with many tools. I also think the three-hour time slot is a bit much for this class. After the first 1.5 hours, I think the utility of the class diminished. It could probably be a shorter class for a lower credit value. "

            "\u00a0Useful for considering real-world projects, but also the organizational bureaucracy and planning that comes with larger-scale conservation. ",
            "\u00a0Choose your land conservation project wisely and strategically follow and plan for your project throughout the course so that the final paper is more a final summary/consideration rather than a scramble to piece everything together. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class! Pick a project that you care about and focus on the process less than the actual outcome/product/project that you're proposing. (Projects don't have to be wildlife focused!) Go to office hours. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend coming into the course with a clear conservation project in mind that you can use for your semester long project. You need to make a decision early on in the semester about what you want to work on, so having a clear idea of that will be useful so you can hit the ground running. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this class if you want to work in the NGO or public sector on conservation work, even if you don't have a strong background in the physical/life sciences. ",

            "\u00a0The description of the course is spot on to what will occur and the knowledge and real world experience both professors have is almost unparalleled by anyone else at the school. ",
            "\u00a0For those without much work experience, I think this class can provide a much-needed reality check for the way things work in the conservation field, and it provides exposure to many important planning elements. For those with more work experience, this class may not be able to reveal a lot of new information/skills. "
