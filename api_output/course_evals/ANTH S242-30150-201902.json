            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how to view modern-day life through an evolutionary perspective, which has been very meaningful. ",
            "\u00a0The life history approach of this course taught me so many cool things about the human body and about biology in general--it taught me to take humans and data and academic studies into their own evolutionary and cultural contexts. Practicing and learning in this way taught me to be a more critical and capable consumer of scientific and medical information. ",
            "\u00a0Learned the basics of evolutionary and reproductive biology ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think through scientific problems critically and how to approach issues in a more holistic way. I also learned a lot about human evolution in general. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly a lot. I still remember most of the course content and it made me understand the real world differently. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the ways in which the course combined both social sciences (anthropology) and physical sciences (biology) in a way that was accessible and applicable to daily life. I do wish, however, that the lectures were a bit more nuanced and exciting (it was at times difficult to stay awake during class). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Purposeful and concise reading list, assignments helped students keep track of the readings, informative lectures, Claudia's availability as a resource and mentor.\r\nWeaknesses: This course was a five-week summer course, so the amount of information was at times overwhelming; however, given the timeframe of the course, there's not much that can be done about it. Claudia did a great job of gauging how much information us students could handle at once (and that's really the most that can be done, in my opinion). The five-week structure also made it harder to know other students/build class camarederie, so class sometimes felt quiet/awkward. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Dr. Valeggia is awesome. She is a great professor and values student input a great deal. The material is also super interesting and accessible for the most part. This course in the summer had a small class size which was also a perk. LOVED meditating to start class\r\n\r\nWeakness: Some sections (particularly the one on stress) were a bit too technical to be covered in only one class. This made it difficult to follow along. Because it was a 5 week course, we had three hour long classes which was too long to focus but that's unavoidable. There were tooo many readings. I stoped keeping up with them after Week 1. The good thing is you only need to know the readings pertaining to the discussion questions as the tests only cover class material. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: This course is amazing. I loved how we discussed non-Western cultures and we looked at evolution through a global lens, not just a Western lens. I loved that we talked about being ethical in different cultures, and I loved learning about the female reproductive system! I had never learned about it so in depth, and now I'm fascinated with the evolution of human bodies! I'm not even a science person, but the other day, I found myself wondering about the evolutionary explanations for certain behaviors! I 100% recommend this course!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This was a really well-organized class and Professor Valeggia is amazing! The only thing I'd say is that maybe there could be more smaller-group discussions because the larger group discussions could be intimidating at times. ",
            "\u00a0Very interesting content and an absolutely amazing instructor. However there were A LOT of reading to do. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the essay writing before class and having that background to better understand the powerpoint "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes. The class is interesting and I learned a lot about how to view my modern day life through an evolutionary perspective, which has been very valuable I think. ",
            "\u00a0I would strongly recommend this course to another student. It's well-designed, and the lectures/reading assignments pair well together. Claudia is really nice and accommodating, and is always open to conversation, discussion, and all kinds of learning opportunities in and out of the classroom. This class gave me the tools and skills to be a more critical scientific consumer and lifelong learner. ",
            "\u00a0I ABSOLUTELY would. Dr. Valeggia is fantastic. The material is interesting without being too difficult. Class discussions were  fascinating and she always encouraged student participation. A great science credit. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! I'm not a person who tends to like science, but this course was really accessible even for non-STEM majors and it was very interesting! I think everyone needs to understand the female and male reproductive systems. This course had lots of very important material, and I liked how we covered scientific topics in depth, especially looking at different sides of an issue. You might find yourself wanting to take more anthropology courses after this class! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Regardless of everything, I wouldnt miss a chance to take a class with Prof. Claudia. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The topics learned are very interesting and the instructor is 10/10 ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially a social science major looking to fulfill a science credit. Claudia a fantastic professor; she really draws students into the course material. "
