I could improve my previous knowledge and extend it to new methods and models both empirically and theoretically, whereby there was a slight focus on the empirical methods. \r\n\r\nI liked the selection of topics, going beyond the usual labor topics of taxation, labor supply, and education.

Discussion of results should not take up that much time\r\n\r\n- Maybe proceed at a slower pace. Sometimes it was a little bit too fast\r\n\r\n- End on time ",

Costas is a brilliant instructor and he puts forth a lot of effort to teach this course which can be seen in his slides and his engagement in class. ",
