The course seemed to be more focused on how to survive if you were dropped into a Japanese business seminar than actually making Japanese relationships. \r\nThe design of the course makes it very difficult to master course material before class sessions and examinations.

            "\u00a0Strength: creative and challenging teachings, and multiple ways to use new grammars in new circumstances, skit and clinic are helpful.\r\nweakness: I would like to learn how to practice what we learned in class after class. ",
