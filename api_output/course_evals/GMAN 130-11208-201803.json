            "\u00a0My German listening and speaking skills drastically improved in this course. Plenty of practice with both which I think is great for practical use of the language. ",
            "\u00a0Building of L2. Learned up to the passive. Was useful in trying to reach a point of fluency in the future. ",
            "\u00a0I developed my German skills from an A2 level at the beginning of the semester all the way to a B2 level by the end of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I deeply developed my proficiency in german, especially my listening comprehension skills. I also learnt new vocabulary through the various chapters we studied as well as aspects of german culture. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: feedback- there is plenty and it is thorough. Very helpful to be corrected on small things that are sometimes overlooked such as pronunciation. \r\nVery well organized course. Always know exactly what to study for tests. So thankful that it is 6 unit test instead of a midterm and final.\r\nWeaknesses: The tests are pretty hard. Have to do really well on other assignments to compensate. The group project is fun with a good group, but sometimes people have a hard time working together. ",
            "\u00a0It was great to have to always speak German. If I would say one frustrating thing was trying to learn some vocabulary that wasnt necessarily incorporated into what we were learning. The emails sent to a German in Germany was annoying to do at some points during the semester. I wouldnt say I took away anything big from it. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Listening exercises, watching a German \"telenovela\", and watching movies in class were great ways to improve German listening skills, and in turn, learn new vocabulary and grammatical structures. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of the course is that we are able to learn about aspects of German culture while also learning more of the language and therefore the class was more engaging. I also enjoyed watching German movies and videos to learn new vocabulary and improve my listening comprehension skills. I also enjoyed how collaborative it was and it allowed me to meet and collaborate with other students of my class. A way the class could be improved is by doing a small review session for Grammar at the beginning of class after we learnt a very important and major component, since sometimes it needs more reinforcement. ",
            "\u00a0The way the course is graded favors only those students with prior experience speaking the language. "

            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course. The workload isn't overwhelming, just a pretty constant flow of work. My vocabulary, speaking, and listening skills improved greatly over the course of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Was good! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This is a great way to efficiently learn and improve one's German skills. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to other students who wish to improve their German since they will learn many aspects of German culture, watch German movies and videos and greatly improve their listening comprehension skills. They will also learn new vocabulary and grammar and will be greatly engaged with all the different projects and assignments. ",
