            "\u00a0This course is an amazing choice for art majors and non majors alike. Make sure you shop the class to indicate you interest even if you cannot take it in the current year (this will increase your chances for future years. ",
            "\u00a0YES DEFINITELY TAKE THIS COURSE! Especially if you want to learn how to code from projects rather than exams, take this class! I learned so much from coding in HTML, CSS, and JS to the history and theory about Internet art and how humans interact with the Internet. Professor Laurel Schwulst is the biggest strength of the course, from her hard-working drive, passion for the Internet and Internet art, and generosity with her time and help. The only thing I wish could be improved is having more time for our final projects. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I definitely would. This provides a wonderful foundation for those who want to further pursue web development, and even if you didn't want to it's an excellent, creative coding experience and learning of how the internet works. The only reason I wouldn't recommend this course to someone is if that person already has a heavy workload, as this course definitely took more of my time than any of my other courses. ",
            "\u00a0One of the most practical and fun courses in School of Art. You will learn HTML, CSS and a little bit of JS. After taking this class you will have a toolkit that will allow you to build pretty sophisticated websites. The class is a bit too artsy for my taste, but Laurel is very open to what kind of projects you want to make, so you can get exactly what you want from this class. Definitely recommend. "
