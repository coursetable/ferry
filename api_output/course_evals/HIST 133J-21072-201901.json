            "\u00a0Synthesizing primary and secondary materials to better understand the early national period. Writing, writing, writing. ",
            "\u00a0Great overview of early American politics ",
            "\u00a0Professor Freeman offered invaluable help to my writing ",
            "\u00a0This course really dove deep into the analysis of the early American period and what it means to discuss politics and founding during this period. ",
            "\u00a0The course addressed the political climate and culture of the founding period. We studied both common participation in political process, as well as the behavior and strategies of the elites. I found a greater appreciation for the broader context of political history in early America, and gained a deeper understanding of the foundational tensions and developments in American politics. ",
            "\u00a0I encountered many different perspectives on politics in the early republic. The course does a good job of including some of the \"classic\" works on the period - writers like Gordon Wood, Richard Hofstader - while also including important perspectives about the roles of women and black Americans. Other reviews from previous years have questioned the extent to which the material ultimately coheres - to which I would say that it definitely does, and that the nature of politics across a 30-year period is just an inevitably broad undertaking to begin with. The real value of the class, of course, is the opportunity to spend two hours every week with Professor Freeman, who is not only an incredibly knowledgeable expert on the period, but a consummate educator. She is a wonderful seminar moderator, who is truly interested in student perspectives, and who always has a charming and appropriate anecdote at the ready. She gives tremendous feedback on written work, and goes above and beyond in guiding you through the process of writing a term paper. In short, this type of course is what makes a Yale education special. ",
            "\u00a0The research project taught me how to pursue primary source research and construct an argument. In terms of content, I learned a lot about the political culture of the 1790s, the interactions between the \"Founders\" (elite politicians) and the people in the streets, and the development of political parties. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to unpack history in an unconventional manner and really engage in short period of time from a variety of approaches. "

            "\u00a0Very strong syllabus, incredible instructor (obviously), great in the spring semester but not sure what the schedule might look like in fall (with deadlines, etc.). ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Writing tips. Plus, Professor Freeman is one of the best discussion leaders I have had at Yale. \r\n\r\nWeakness: I really wish that some of the material from the second half of the course was placed earlier in the course. It showed how diverse current scholarship is on the founding era, and this wasn't an impression I got from the earliest pieces we considered. ",
            "\u00a0The books ascribed to read and the discussions of this class are certainly its strength. ",
            "\u00a0The course is a quintessential Yale seminar. The structure of the course offers you a great deal of flexibility in writing your final paper. The readings are wonderful, and engendered engaging discussions. There is ample feedback on strategies to improve one's writing and argumentation. ",
            "\u00a0The professor is the greatest strength, and her commitment to her students is unmatched. Sometimes I thought the stress on secondary materials could have been balanced with more primary sources. ",
            "\u00a0This course has a lot of reading, but it's worth if because class discussions are really engaging. "

            "\u00a0Joanne Freeman is a national treasure. I was worried Nicolas Cage would break in and try to steal her. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely -- take any course you can with Professor Freeman. She will teach you about the Revolutionary and early national periods, sure, but she will teach you to read and write and she is an absolute joy to learn from. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. It's a great help for your writing, as well as fun discussions. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course. Professor Freeman is brilliant and never fails to amaze. ",
            "\u00a0For any student interested in American, political or legal history, this is a fantastic course! Moreover, if you aren't interested in these things per se, then the course still offers a great opportunity to study the sort of history that you do enjoy, through a different lens. ",
            "\u00a0Without a doubt. You should leap at the opportunity to develop a relationship with such a wonderful historian and human being. But only take the course if you will really do the readings - which is no small undertaking. Fortunately, every reading is truly worthwhile. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! Professor Freeman is extraordinarily committed to her students, and her passion makes it worth taking this. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course. Professor Freeman is a wonderful professor and the material was surprisingly approachable and engaging. "
