            "\u00a0In class, students read directly from the original text which exposes them to classical Arabic, helping to develop strong reading skills through practice. The class engages in useful conversations about the text and students work together with the Professor to comment on and discuss the difficult passages and concepts introduced in the Sufi tradition. The course helps one to develop a good understanding of Sufism and allows students to engage in conversation, exchange ideas, and share opinions. ",

            "\u00a0I highly recommend this course for advanced students of Arabic who are interested in the subject. The course is focused on Sufism. it does not deviate from the text which helps students achieve a good understanding of the subject. Professors often assign an unreasonable amount of reading which leaves students overwhelmed, and as a result, students walk away with less from a course. In this class, you will read every sentence with the Professor and students, and this method, I believe, has a greater impact on the learning process. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Good course ",
            "\u00a0It depends what they study. If they want to learn about Sufism, then yes since it familiarizes the student with Sufi vocabulary and thought. "
