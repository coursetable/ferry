            "\u00a0Writing my senior thesis was incredibly beneficial for me as a student. I really believe I grew as a writer in ways I did not even know I could grow. After finishing my thesis, I feel like a significantly better, more concise writer. ",
            "\u00a0All of the skills I have learned over the years have culminated into this one senior project. I learned how to manage research over the course of a year and how to organize a 50 page paper. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my researching abilities, ability to analyze and interpret primary and secondary sources, and writing skills . ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to conduct independent research, organize facts into illustrations and text boxes, design layouts, and integrate visual sources in a storyline. I really learned how to distill a vast amount of information into a readable format that combined text and visual sources. ",
            "\u00a0This class gave me an excellent understanding of how to research and write a history paper. It also gave me the opertunity to learn about and research an area of study that I was interested in, and had not been taught in other classes. That being said, I had to conduct a lot of research independently, so I really learned how to reach out to different people and look for new sources I otherwise would not have thought of. ",
            "\u00a0so many ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to synthesize a lot of research and information into a clear and refined argument. I developed skills in interpreting primary sources and using secondary sources to contextualise and support my argument. "

            "\u00a0I think a class for this project wouldve been helpful, but I enjoyed working on my own. The skills I developed were very important. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the senior essay project was a great way to finish my HSHM major at Yale. It allowed me to showcase the skills and knowledge I gained from my coursework, and it provided me the space to explore a new topic in depth. I don't think there were any weaknesses, per say, but I think the 50 page limit might be a bit restricting. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include how flexible and independent the project was; I definitely had control over my own project and had full creative flexibility over how it progressed. Weaknesses include the lack of formatting / examples of how to layout a title page, etc.--more of the technical details, the advising was great! ",
            "\u00a0This course was great in the sense that I had the freedom to study areas of history that I wanted to study. However, I wish I had had a little bit of guidance in doing so. I had never written a paper of such magnatude before, so a little more help along the way would have been benificial. Overall though, it was a great class and I definitely got a lot out of it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend group meetings for brainstorming and editing/keeping each other accountable ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Learn a tonne and writing became much stronger.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The fairness of grading. "

            "\u00a0Doing a year-long senior thesis is A LOT of work, but at the end of the project, it is so fulfilling. I would 100% recommend that every HSHM student do the year-long senior thesis ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Mostly because you have to do it. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely recommend that HSHM students do the full year senior essay because it allows you to explore your topic in greater depth! ",
            "\u00a0It's required nonetheless, but yes! You learn a lot. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. It is a feat culmination of for years of history classes, and a great opertunity to research topics that personally interest you. It is also a great way to look at new sources, and to make connections to prominent historians in your field of choice. ",
            "\u00a0you have to take it to graduate ",
            "\u00a0Yes. You will learn a lot about the researching and writing process. It also allows you to become an expert on a specific topic which is a great feeling. "
