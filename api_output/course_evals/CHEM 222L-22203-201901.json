            "\u00a0I learned lab techniques organic chemists use, like reflux, distillation and TLC. I learned how to analyze IR spectra and take lab notes as well. ",

            "\u00a0I gained basic skills in synthesizing, characterizing, and working with organic compounds. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: It's a really gentle introduction to doing organic reactions. Everything that's required is explicitly laid out, and the labs are pretty cool. It's also great that each student gets their own fume hood, which lots of other schools don't do. The labs also are usually pretty short and don't take the full 4-hour time period assigned to the class. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Doing the experimental plans every week gets pretty tedious, and it's not great to have to miss lunch if you have class right before afternoon lab. ",
            "\u00a0Most of the out-of-class work was busy work that didn't require much critical thinking. \r\nA strength of the course was that Professor DiMeglio was very forgiving and there was not much pressure in lab. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: class is well structured where I actually learned information in lab in which I used in class. \r\nWeakness: none ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course was that having taken it off-sequence, the class was much smaller and it was nice to be learning in this type of close environment. The labs were usually pretty straightforward and the TA was great at answering questions and being responsive through email. The weakness of this course are how detailed the assignments must be to receive full credit. Some of the things they would take off points for and they amount they would take off often didn't make sense, so it was important to read the directions thoroughly. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- Teaches you bench techniques\r\n- Forces you to understand why you do something a certain way\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- The grading in the course varies by TA, which can make things more stressful ",
            "\u00a0The experiments are well-planned and they promote a good understanding of how to work with some basic lab techniques and instruments. Additionally, the teaching staff are very helpful and invested in student success. The most effective way to improve the class, I think, would be to focus less on the post-lab assignments, which sometimes just asked students to copy facts from various sources and were not always informative. ",
            "\u00a0The TFs and lab crew were all very helpful and I felt comfortable asking for help when I needed it. However, it is very difficult to get good scores on the post lab assignments and the grading scale is very harsh when it comes to all the assignments in the class. ",
            "\u00a0The course is made such that absolute beginners to lab can join without fear of needing prior knowledge.  Additionally, the TA and instructor are accessible to help if there is confusion in or out of lab.  The weakness would be the focus of the graded material on particular in certain cases minimal/excessive detail. ",
            "\u00a0professor dimeglio and the TAs are great, very helpful, much more low stress environment than gen chem lab. grading is fairly harsh and nit picky though. ",

            "\u00a0Sure. If you're pre-med or a bio/chem/chem E major, you pretty much have to. If you're not and you're just taking Orgo for fun, you might as well take the lab to see how organic chemistry works in a lab setting. It's an easy 0.5 credit class, and you get an appreciation for what research chemistry involves. ",
            "\u00a0I would say only take this if you are taking organic chemistry. ",
            "\u00a0You have to. take it with organic chemistry. Dont take it if you dont need it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend taking this course only if you have to. It wasn't very engaging and you don't get that much out of it. The structure of the class was well-organized with pre-lab assignments before every lab meant to get students to understand what they are doing before they do it and the assignments were well-spaced out across the semester. The detailed graded rubrics were often annoying to work with, so reading the instructions carefully and asking questions were key! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, you learn a lot, and Dr. DiMeglio really strives to develop your awareness of other factors such as your intuition about safety, reagents to use, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Not unless either (1) you are taking orgo or (2) it's required. There's nothing wrong with the class -- it's well-taught and helps explain some of the concepts you learn in orgo -- but it's not worth taking on its own. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course because taking it off  sequence makes it more intimate and gives the opportunity for more attention from the TFs. ",
            "\u00a0For what the course is, it is good.  It is not something I would willingly take on my own as it can be a little tedious and the assignments at certain times frustrating in that you will know the material but may not do well.  Despite this, the teachers and TA's do their best to make the course interesting and engaging and at times they do succeed. ",
