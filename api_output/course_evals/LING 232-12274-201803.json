            "\u00a0A lot of good stuff about sounds, phonological grammar, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Skills in phonology and analysis of linguistic data sets ",
            "\u00a0We started out with a good overview of articulatory phonetics, and then learned the different types of possible relationships between sounds in a language (phonemes, allophony, positional neutralization, etc...), as well as how to spot and best describe these relationships. This was then followed by several units discussing different models for analyzing and describing phonological alternations, (features, autosegmental notation, Optimality Theory etc...), and then an overview of syllables and stress.\r\n\r\nThroughout the course, we learned the various steps involved in writing about phonological relationships, including how to describe them in an analysis neutral way, how to posit a reasonable analysis, and how to justify that analysis. ",
            "\u00a0I learned quite a bit in this course about phonology. I mean, I don't know what else to say. IPA, articulatory phonetics, constraints, rules, all that good stuff. "

            "\u00a0The class was really small (around 8 students), and we were mostly linguistics majors since Phonology is a core requirement. The class format was good for learning, since we were able to ask questions and work in pairs. ",
            "\u00a0Very well taught course. Everyone in class was engaged/involved. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: its a well organized course that is structured nicely around the textbook so that any questions you may have from class can be answered there and vice versa\r\nWeaknesses: expectations around problem sets were not made abundantly clear and they were not graded/returned quickly, so if youre someone that needs a lot of ongoing reinforcement and feedback in terms of regularly graded assignments, that might be a problem ",
            "\u00a0Seminat style learning was really good but sometime we didn't learn as much in a class as we could. There should be more structure. Also we got a lot of practice problems but no answers to them ",
            "\u00a0Since phonology is such a hands-on subject, it helped to go through data and problems in class. Class discussion was helpful in clarifying confusing parts of the readings. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very good overall. Professor Weber was very engaging and enthusiastic, and the small class size meant that anything potentially confusing to anyone was explained well. Most of class was spent working through problems and data sets, which was very useful overall, as it really helped me to understand and internalize the material, perhaps better than a standard lecture would. The homework problem sets could be a bit dense, and definitely took some time, but I found that I was able to get them done well as long as I started them one to two days before the due date. Regardless, Professor Weber was very understanding, and was always willing to give the class an extension if we felt that we needed it. \r\n\r\nI also felt that the textbook used was very good overall, and Professor Weber assigned the readings in a sequence that always allowed us to build off our previous knowledge.

            "\u00a0Youll have to take this course as a linguistics major, but Id recommend it to those who are interested in Linguistics as well! Although phonology isnt my area of focus, I still enjoyed the class a lot and you get to learn a little about phonetics in the beginning as well. ",
            "\u00a0If you are linguistics. It's required so I guess you'll be taking it anyway :/ ",
            "\u00a0Yeah! I mean if youre a linguistics major you have to, and its definitely not a requirement that feels like a drag. ",
            "\u00a0If you are a linguistics major you need to take it. Unless you are really interested in phonology I would pass or maybe audit because the psets are so long and difficult. ",
            "\u00a0This is a good course if you are really interested in phonology and want to learn more about sound patterns and different kinds of analyses. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. It's required for linguistics majors, and I would recommend taking it early in the major, as it provides a great introduction to the practice of simply looking at data sets and finding patterns, a skill that is very important. It was also a very good experience overall. Professor Weber's enthusiasm, as well as the small classroom environment made for a great place to learn. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class, but only to someone with a fair linguistics background. I definitely did learn new things in this course despite having a pretty decent linguistic background from other courses. If you're more \"advanced\" like me, then the beginning will feel a little slow. But if you haven't taken intro than this class can feel a little rough throughout because everything feels new. I wouldn't really recommend this to, say, a freshman interested in linguistics but unsure if it's the route they want to take. Start out with some level-100 courses, then take Phonology. "
