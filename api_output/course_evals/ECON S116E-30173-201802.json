            "\u00a0Really great intro to Macroeconomics, but also developed a lot of good economic insight into real recessions/defaults. ",
            "\u00a0This course helps to explain everything you hear on the news and in conversation surrounding the economy. If you weren't sure how GDP, the Great Depression, the Great Recession, interest rates, and the Federal reserve work when they are mentioned in newspapers and other forms of media, now you will have a much greater understanding which can be massively helpful in all facets of life. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how an online class works and also the nuances of macroeconomics. The information that I picked up from this class has already proved very helpful in understanding the economic situation in the United States and understanding the complexities behind a government deficit in an aging economy. "

            "\u00a0I think it was a really strong course overall. The only thing would be more practice problems for the Midterm/Final, if possible. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course was the small number of students and the Professor catering to more individual needs and questions (with such a small group everyone had the opportunity to get information). Excellent class so only weakness is that it may have been better in person, but overall very well run class. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the subject matter was so interesting and the structure of the course made sense because it allowed us to review the same material a few times before we were tested over it while the live online sessions helped keep us all accountable. It made me wish that my professors during the regular school year before lectures would give us those same video lectures before the class period. Sometimes though, it was difficult to stay attentive during the long online sessions, and I know I struggled with examity both for the midterm and the final. I think if there were any way to make examity more user friendly, that would be extremely helpful. In both cases, I was yelled at by the proctor and that was not preferable right before I had to take the exam. There was already enough pressure on me with test anxiety and then to deal with the online bandwidth was almost too much. I will say it was different to interact with the TA via email instead of a face-to-face conversation. Not necessarily bad, but just different for sure. I almost feel like because of the online constraints, my professor and TA were made more accessible to me to compensate for that if that makes sense and I appreciated that greatly. "

            "\u00a0It's a good course, especially because Marnix is hilarious. If you're an Econ major, you have to take it, and the summer work is very manageable (just don't fall behind). If you're not an Econ major or not sure, but you already fought through Intro Micro, this one will be a lot more interesting and give you more of an intuition-based view of Econ rather than getting lost in math. ",
            "\u00a0I would but I'm unsure how the online experience is different from the in-class experience. Both professor Amand and Pablo made the experience awesome but perhaps taking the class with them in person is even better. ",
            "\u00a0No, definitely not. To finish 9 problem sets and cover more than 12 hours of video lessons is far from a sound choice for any summer session. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I thought the subject itself was way more interesting than microeconomics and I found that the structure of the online course really suited me! "
