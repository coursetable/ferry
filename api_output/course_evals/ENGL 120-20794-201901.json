            "\u00a0I learned how to read various texts through the lens of a writer, taking away strategies and methods to apply to my own writing. ",
            "\u00a0This class greatly helped me improve as not only a writer, but also an editor. I learned a broad range of specific techniques for writing about myself, others, places, culture, and humor. The course readings were really engaging and were great models of good writing. Workshopping 4 student papers per unit allowed me to think more critically about writing and how different writing techniques can be employed. ",
            "\u00a0Learned how to become a better reader and writer ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to dig deeper in my writing and critically analyze text. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to critically analyze writing strategies and apply them to my own writing. It certainly challenged some of my preconceived notions about writing; the writing process is a very deliberate process that involves repeated practice to get better. This class will certainly help you get there if you put in the time and effort! ",
            "\u00a0ENGL 120 is a course focused on personal essays (think of the New Yorker). While I think the course does a great job of teaching students how to craft strong personal essays, I think it's main strength is teaching students how to \"read like a writer\" -- i.e. how to read/analyze a strong piece of writing, understand why it's strong, and subsequently adopt some of those techniques.

            "\u00a0I really like the discussions we had in class every day. Perhaps we could have spent a little bit more time on writing strategies. ",
            "\u00a0I think the class was a good workload and I always looked forward to doing class readings. We always received clear feedback, both from Prof Shirkhani and other students. Class discussions were always engaging and I think our class grew close and comfortable with each other in presenting ideas and thoughts about readings. Turn-around times for due dates could be fast, but overall I have no complaints. ",
            "\u00a0The class is interesting and very well organized. The semester is split into five units, all of which are challenging but fun. The assigned readings are short and thought provoking, and the class discussions are never boring. I wish we had spent more time discussing each of the readings. Besides that, however, there's not much that could be done to improve the class. ",
            "\u00a0The course is structured so well; definitely one of the major appeals of the course. \r\nI love the diverse, contemporary work that we read in 120. I wouldn't mind adding a few older pieces-- maybe some Virginia Woolf?-- because I know there are a lot of excellent older essays and I don't know any of them and I think they can help inform our understanding of contemporary essay-writing too (at the beginning of the semester we did a little looking at the history of essays and what essays should be (a jolt of joy, etc), and I LOVED that.) Perhaps--and this is only a suggestion--we can do this and drop one of the many David Foster Wallace pieces? \r\nAlso, I appreciate the structure of the course. The cultural critique unit is very strong, and placed perfectly: not at the very end of the year (because then everyone would be swamped), but 4 out of the 5, so that we have time to really build up to it and integrate everything from the whole semester. It demands a lot and the class is ready for it. \r\nI also appreciate that the Satire unit is the most casual of the units since it's at the end of the year, and it's very fun, and kind of a tone shift (haha) from the rest of the course. However, I would love to read a few more non-fictional narrator pieces in that unit, or pieces that are a little more weighty. I know a lot of really important satire is in book form or play form but there are certainly some satire essays that have a little more gravitas. I would have assumed coming into the course about essay-writing that we would read more satire-as-a-cultural-force. If we just added in one or two pieces, it would be perfect (and give people room to dive deeper into satire or just have fun with it). \r\nThis is a STELLAR class. Love love love it ",
            "\u00a0I thought the pacing and texts were good. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The small seminar style of this class allows everyone to engage with the material and talk during class. Professor Shirkhani did a great job of facilitating discussion and guiding us towards discovering a writing strategy that the author employed, and the effect that it had on the piece. You really learn some key insights into writing from these discussions.\r\nWeaknesses: I think that more discussion on the execution of these writing skills would be excellent. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength of the course is Professor Shirkhani -- she is an absolutely amazing professor that facilitates capitative discussions, is always open and receptive to students struggling with a paper, and is wholeheartedly committed to her students. \r\nThe course readings are very manageable, but just as a cautionary note, you will have either a draft or final draft of a paper due essentially every week. While this is fine for most people, I am quite a slow writer/was not previously accustomed to taking this much time to craft each sentence of my papers -- if you put in the work, you will get so much out of the course, but this is by no means just an introductory \"gut\" writing credit. Especially since the English department has a strict grading scheme for the intro courses, Engl 120 is by no means a guaranteed A. On the other hand, I felt I grew significantly as a writer, if not more as a reader, by taking this course. ",
            "\u00a0The course has a lot a lot of reading that few students actually take full advantage of. Id wonder if itd be more effective for the course to use less reading and go more in depth with these readings. ",
            "\u00a0This course was wonderfulProfessor Shirkhani is great, the reading list is awesome, and the class dynamic grows stronger throughout the semester. My only suggestion is to perhaps let discussion flow a bit more organically sometimes instead of so frequently pointing at very specific points/techniques. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Great readings, great writing prompts, great teacher\r\nWeaknesses: lots of readings, felt like sometimes I didn't have enough time to make my writing the best it could be ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Shirkhani is amazing, and I love the process of turning in a draft, getting comments, and then turning in a final copy\r\n\r\nThe one unit where I felt a little lost was cultural critique "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This was hands down the single best course I've taken at Yale, and Professor Shirkhani is the single best professor I've had. I truly cannot say enough about this course. I feel like I came away with a better understanding of the world in a way that I have rarely felt in a classroom. This is everything that an education should be. 100% worth taking, even as an upperclassman. There's nothing I can say to do justice to how incredible this course is. AAGGG everyone should take it!!!! ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to any student, regardless of if they want to pursue writing. I think the skills learned in this class are helpful to anyone in improving their personal writing, and the readings were pretty universally interesting. For those not confident in their writing, help was very accessible and everyone was given a lot of feedback and room to grow. For those who are confident in their writing, this class offered a lot of freedom to try new things and write passionate essays. This class inspired me to change my major to English as a second semester sophomore. ",
            "\u00a0I would 100% recommend this class to another student. It's one of the rare classes where you actually feel like you are learning a lot. The essays make you think, and the readings are really fun. What more could you want? ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! \r\nTo enjoy the class, you absolutely must do the best you can on the first drafts of the essays. Treat it like a final essay. Then you'll be able to get great feedback and do well. It's not easy, but it's a very worthwhile class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the professor is fantastic ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This course will allow you to write in a variety of different styles, all while tapping into your creativity and growing your abilities as a writer and reader. It will help you become more analytical, and it will teach how to be deliberate with your words. Yes, this course has a lot of work with daily readings and weekly essays. But if you put in the time and effort, you will glean very useful skills as a reader and writer. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student looking to improve their writing, though not necessarily a student looking to improve their academic writing ability. While there are definitely some skills/lessons that are transferrable, this class definitely focuses on non-fiction, personal narratives, which is a more specific type of writing than what most other papers at Yale call for. However, if you are someone looking to improve your writing overall, I would highly recommend the course -- not only does it help improve your writing, but it also gives you a unique opportunity that many Yale courses don't provide: the space to reflect on your experiences and craft engaging pieces on those experiences/reflections. ",
            "\u00a0I would very highly recommend this course. Let me preface my answer with the claim that it's always the teacher who makes or breaks the course. Professor Shirkhani is the Eighth Wonder of the Ancient World (not that ancient, perhaps). Her energy and enthusiasm is more wondrous to behold than the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. Her deft guidance of the discussion is more inspiring than the Colossus of Rhodes. In other words, she's just a really amazing teacher who you should not hesitate to study under. Of course, it also helps that English 120 itself is well-optimized. But hey. She's a Wonder of the Ancient World. Enough said. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Awesome class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, as long as you're willing to put the effort in! Professor Shirkhani is wonderful, and your writing will improve vastly if you put a lot into this class. You'll also learn a lot about yourself as a person, and you'll get the chance to read the work of your classmates, who are bound to be incredibly talented. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Great class and I felt like my writing improved a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely omg\r\n\r\nSo I took this as a STEM junior who desparately needed a writing credit. Several of my humanities friends had highly recommended Professor Shirkhani to me, although they warned that the course was hard and a lot of work. They were completely right on every point but let me just say this was absolutely 1000% worth it, and especially was a STEM major you walk out thinking \"oh so THIS is what Yale is supposed to be\". It makes you think different, question what you know and your thoughts\r\n\r\njust such a good class, wish I could take it again. I pretty much worship Professor Shirkhani-- she is so sharp and knows what she is doing! And her comments are amazing!! She doesn't only read to critique, she reads to understand, and this lets her help you troubleshoot your issues "
