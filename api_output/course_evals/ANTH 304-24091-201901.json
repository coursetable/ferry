            "\u00a0Great professor. Sad that shes leaving ",
            "\u00a0I learned about international migration, narratives of migrants, what it means to be transnational, the philosophy of why people migrate, and much much more. ",
            "\u00a0Migration patterns from and to East Asian countries, migration theories, focus on Japan ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think anthropologically through the use of ethnographic research. ",
            "\u00a0My perspectives on migration have been completely transformed as a result of this class, and I developed a greater understanding of the multiple theories surrounding migration as well as the reality of people's experiences ",
            "\u00a0I really value our pertaining to migration and agency taking into account the structures around us. I always value the discussion question component in Von Baeyer's classes. It's one thing to read a source in entirety, but another thing to read it and pick it apart and truly question. ",
            "\u00a0Insight into the human condition ... the complexities of why people choose to migrate, or not, and why they choose to stay somewhere, or not. ",
            "\u00a0So much about the field of anthropology! And about East Asia, particularly Japan. I think I really learned the foundational ideas and theories and concepts of anthropology, learned a lot about what anthropologists research and how they conduct their research, and really just learned to question and discuss how and why humans migrate and move. And how this idea of migration is changing in a developing world that is increasingly more connected. Learned so much! "

            "\u00a0Strength: interesting discussion with good pace, fascinating reading materials, clear guidance for essays.\r\nWeakness: the topics covered in class are very interesting but a little bit \"jumpy\", especially in the second-half of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0The only weakness I could think of was that sometimes we did not tie the readings that much into our larger understanding of transnational migration. \r\nEverything else was a strength, I learned so much about a topic I had not idea I was even interested about and it was incredibly. ",
            "\u00a0The strength was Prof LvB and her skill at facilitating discussion and leading in structured manner. The syllabus was cohesive, and she is engaging. Also liked the incorporation of films, which added something different. No real weaknesses that come to mind! ",
            "\u00a0This course was a perfect mix of discussion, writing responses, and papers. I really grew as a student and thinker and wish I could take the course again. ",
            "\u00a0The readings for the course and the incorporation of film really helped my engagement with the more complex ideas surrounding transnational migration theory. I think that sometimes partner discussions in class got a little long and we ran out of things to talk about for very specific prompts, but overall the conversations we had were really productive and Prof. LeBaron von Baeyer also provided great background information ",
            "\u00a0I love the readings. I like how they're tempered with film screenings, too. \r\n\r\nMaybe more spatial diversity in terms of the Asian receiving countries we read about. Everything felt very limited to China, Korea, and Japan. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor. So sad she's leaving Yale :( She's an incredibly smart person but also a great teacher, very patient. She definitely tried to engage all of us ",
            "\u00a0I loved the readings (though there are a good amount, but worth doing for sure), the discussions we had in class, Prof SLvB is super great at facilitating discussion and providing the necessary background information to supplement the readings, and I really just loved talking about and learning about migration outside of the American context. I learned so much about transnational migration in East Asia, and I think I was really encouraged to think critically and in ways that I have never thought before. Prof SLvB also tries to incorporate movies and films as well as partner and group discussion times which I really enjoyed as well. "

            "\u00a0Unfortunately, this is the last time this class will be offered with this Prof LeBaron von Baeyer and I really think she was what drove this class and made it so interesting. With this professor, I would DEFINITELY recommend this class (even if your major has nothing to do with anthropology). ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you think you're interested in East Asia/migration theories! It's a reading-heavy class but Prof LvB is good at breaking down the material. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning more about migration outside of the United States and really expand their perspective on migrant lives ",
            "\u00a0I love this course and this professor!!!!!! Sarah is the best!!!!!! You probably won't encounter readings like this again in your life. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! So cool to study migration from not a West centered viewpoint. However, this course won't be offered again because the amazing prof is leaving.. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to anyone, regardless of major and interests! You learn so much about a region of the world that is maybe not focused on too often, you learn so much about migration and why, how, and to where people migrate, and you really just learn to ask deep questions about human nature and what motivates us to move and pursue different lives across oceans and continents. You don't need to be an anthropology major or East Asian Studies major to really enjoy this class and participate in discussion. Would 100% recommend! "
