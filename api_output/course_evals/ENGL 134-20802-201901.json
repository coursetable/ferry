            "\u00a0I learned how to better analyze stories (for craft), give notes on the stories of others, and how to better craft my own fictional stories! ",
            "\u00a0I gained a more expansive knowledge of short fiction from various settings and backgrounds, as well as a foundation for fiction writing that I hope to expand upon in the near future. ",
            "\u00a0Learning to craft stories. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about my own writing style and figuring out how to look at my work critically. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about how to engage with the precise elements of craft, and to close read fiction. I have seldom worked with prose fiction and this was a fantastic starting point. ",
            "\u00a0Skills of fiction (structure, voice, character development, etc) within the context of my own voice. I also learned how to respond to and critique other pieces or writing. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much in this class. I had not done much creative writing before, and this class was a very structured introduction to the basics of writing fiction. I feel very well-equipped to write more stories in the future if I want to. We talked about character, voice, structure, plot, dialogue, and general emotional impact in a story and how different authors achieve those things. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to analyze craft in a way to help me guide as a writer. I learned a new way to approach fiction, and I also had the chance to explore amazing works of fiction. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a deeper appreciation for literature, as well as a better ability to both discuss literary techniques and understand how to implement these techniques in my own writing. ",
            "\u00a0I'd never written a short story before taking this class and for those who are intimidated by the challenge, I think this is the best way to gain a framework to begin. I learned to build a story and construct an arc that shifted the narrative and ended with a change (or in some cases, a refusal to change). I also learned to create characters who are not only compelling and complex but consistent. Finally, I learned how to pick and choose the material that makes it onto the page and how to balance background with ambiguity and subtlety. "

            "\u00a0I adored this class, and I really think that it helped me come into my own as a writer. ",
            "\u00a0No weaknesses  maybe more frequent writing exercises. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength of the class was Professor Cunningham's engaged instruction. I loved mapping stories with him as a group. ",
            "\u00a0I found this course kind of frustrating at times because it felt unstructured. I wish that there had been more opportunity for revision so that we could develop our pieces instead of moving from one to another. ",
            "\u00a0The course was hugely compelling and complex - the only issue is that the jump from course to workshop happened a little jarringly, but that feels difficult to work around. ",
            "\u00a0The class is wonderful and well structured in my opinion, but it is a bit of a nightmare to get in. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Cunningham was one of the biggest strengths of this class. He brings so much experience to the classroom, but he still seems very willing to hear about unique story ideas and to learn from his students. He put together a great group of students from all who applied, so we had a great class dynamic. All the other students were incredibly smart and interesting. \r\n\r\nI think Professor Cunningham sometimes could have explained the writing exercises a little more clearly. I frequently had questions about what we were supposed to be doing each week. I think it was because Professor Cunningham wanted to reserve class time for discussion, but I think it would have been useful if he had taken just a couple minutes each week to clarify the assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Cunningham is an extremely caring and inspiring professor and genuinely takes an interest in his students and their work. He is also very good at creating a community in the classroom so students feel free to express their opinions on different stories and share their work in an environment that feels encouraging and constructive, rather than competitive. Professor Cunningham also works very hard to incorporate student feedback and asked the class for changes to the syllabus for next year to create a more diverse reading list.  \r\n\r\nThe only way I think the course could improve would be a few more writing exercises before beginning the drafts of our stories, so we feel a bit more prepared going in.

            "\u00a0Absolutely. This course, the professor, and my classmates were all a gift, and a space like this class where one can think both critically and creatively is much appreciated. ",

            "\u00a0Absolutely. A special opportunity! ",
            "\u00a0Yesits valuable but the class is utterly dependent on who else is in it. ",
            "\u00a0Absoutely! So much wonderful dynamic work happening off each other as students, I'm truly grateful to have taken it. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class! I was a little intimidated at first because I hadn't done any fiction writing before, but Prof. Cunningham creates a welcome atmosphere in class. Everyone gave thoughtful feedback during workshops. I was surprised by how much I learned in one semester. You also get a lot of freedom with the short story final. I loved going to class each week and getting to know both Prof. Cunningham and the other students. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this class. If you are interested in creative writing, you will get a very solid foundation in the basics. If not, it is still a wonderful class that makes you think differently about writing and your relationships with others. I was not particularly intent on doing creative writing, but I still learned a lot about fiction, people, and writing.  Michael told us it is proven that people who read fiction are more compassionate in life, and after this class I can totally see why. You need to think about every character with extreme empathy and consideration. I loved that about this class. ",
            "\u00a0This was the best class I have taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0If you have the chance to take this class, then definitely do so! You won't regret it. I genuinely looked forward to our Tuesday sessions and frequently wanted the conversation to continue after class. You will also read wonderful works, both from the authors on the syllabus and fellow classmates. Professor Cunningham also provides very thorough comments on drafts and is always free to meet with students for further feedback. My only regret is that I didn't take advantage of more of those meetings. "
