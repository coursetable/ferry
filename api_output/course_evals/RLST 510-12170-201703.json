            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the similar (and different) problems in scholarship in different sub-fields and how helpful it can be to read in areas beyond one's own. Reading and critqiuing the work of other scholars allowed me to think more deeply about method more generally in the study of religion, but also made me think about the methods I employ (and plan to use) in my own work. Evaluating and commenting on unfamiliar work was sometimes difficult, but it is a very useful skill to work at for future intellectual and professional interactions. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a greater appreciation of my colleagues' specialties, insight into the literature on method and theory, and, most importantly, the practice of being a scholar of religion. ",
            "\u00a0In this course I learned how to speak across disciplines about the role religious studies plays in my scholarship. I also learned how to admit confusion or lack of knowledge on a subject without feeling inept and how to make connections and observations about aspects of religious study that I hadn't previously considered. ",
            "\u00a0I feel that throughout the course I developed an ability to critically engage with material that is not substantively related to my field of interest. I learned to interrogate methodology of scholarship with which I was unfamiliar, which further enabled me to ask questions of scholarship that is familiar and of interest. I learned how to engage with a classroom in a way that is effective and generative, and I saw what kind of leadership is necessary within said classroom to really make the room engage with texts at hand. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a deeper sense of the methodological and institutional questions being asked as both within specific RS subfields, as well as across the discipline. ",
            "\u00a0Different ways of engagement with the religious and scholarly texts\r\n\r\ndifferent ways of teaching a subject, organizing a discussion in general and teaching the materials on religion in particular\r\n\r\nlearning to think through the significance of being together with my peers/comrades in the same room "

            "\u00a0Compared to a traditional theory and methods course, this course had several advantages but also some disadvantages. It was actually very interesting to see which texts other students chose for the crowd-sourced syllabus and learning about what issues mattered to our peers was helpful. Sometimes, however, it was difficult to find connections or productive differences and that made participating and investing in the class more difficult at times. Also, it often seemed that there were too many texts assigned for the amount of class time. This was the first theory methods course I have taken and I really enjoyed it, but wish I could have some more background on some of the important theorists going forward as a way to put match my thoughts to more sophisticated language. \r\nGiven the tight course schedule, this may not be the most practiical suggestion, but it might be useful to make theory and methods a year long course. The first semester could focus on more \"traditional\" readings so students with no prior theory could at least be exposed to important ideas that have shaped our field. The second semester could then be much like this course was. Having some theory beforehand makes engaging with texts across subfields in some ways easier. ",
            "\u00a0I found the course completely fascinating. I am honestly not sure how to evaluate it in terms of strengths and weakness. Perhaps some more \"canonical\" things could be added, but I'm not sure it would be worth it to take out the readings of our colleagues. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course is its innovative approach to the material and the different specializations present among my peers. A weakness is that it took a long time to recognize the skills that the class was designed to develop. The 7pm-9pm time slot was a major weakness. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: We got to read outside the normal \"canon\" for this sort of class, which I think was not only good for people and subfields for whom that canon is less applicable, but also good for exposing all of us to atypical texts. I also appreciate having a better sense of what my colleagues in the department work on.\r\n\r\nThe assignments were great. Really practically useful, both for thinking about my place in the field and how to communicate that place to others. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Directly contradicting the above to some extent, I do feel a tad under prepared for not having read some of the foundational texts of the field. I'm not quite sure that you can avoid that, though, if you want the aforementioned strengths. Also, class conversation was less often conversation among students and more a student-to-teacher dynamic. That might be a product of the atypical syllabus? ",
            "\u00a0This was an experimental course which favored the contributions of the students over a predetermined curriculum. It therefore eschewed the traditional RS canon by design and opened new avenues for questioning what is at play in the development and entrenchment of a canon. Nevertheless, a feel a more concrete sense of what that canon is/was would not have gone amiss. ",
            "\u00a0One discussion we had was that the context is lost esp. in the primary texts, so I am wondering if we had provided just a few sentences about it beforehand, would that have enabled us to better grasp the study of religion? Not sure as it would have also predetermined our engagement in a certain direction. \r\n\r\nOne major strength and uniqueness of the course is that it gives the participants the freedom to choose what they will discuss about. The design of the papers seems to be specificially aimed to such a basic learning outcome as self-reflection. "

            "\u00a0Yes. This course challenged me to think about the field in ways that other Theory & Method courses I have taken have. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It was a good learning experience that was out of the box ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to other students, especially to those subfields who do not often engage with the work of other subfields and also as a way to think about methods and trends in scholarship on a broader level. ",
            "\u00a0Well, it's required, but yes I would. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student looking for an interdisciplinary approach to methods and theory. The disorientation that one experiences while taking the course is the great equalizer. It teaches you to be patient with others, but also patient with yourself. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to other graduate students as it will definitely enrich them by opening up new areas of inquiry in their minds. "
