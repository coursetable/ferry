            "\u00a0Seminar remains the most useful course to my intellectual development since the beginning of the PhD. It has improved my scientific writing, ability to research and propose experiments for novel problems, and taught me more than I would like to admit about time management. ",
            "\u00a0How to write an effective specific aims page directed at a single research question. How to identify the next steps of a study. ",
            "\u00a0Reading important papers in a field and being able to digest the information to generate new hypotheses. Designing experiments and consolidating all of this information into a structured, well organized 1-page proposal. ",
            "\u00a0We further developed grant-writing skills and gained additional practice in critically reading papers. ",
            "\u00a0I continued to refine my science writing skills and learned more about topics including cardiovascular disease, cancer and signaling. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very helpful for developing the skills reading literature and writing proposals. ",
            "\u00a0Academic writing, critical thinking ",
            "\u00a0How to present the paper and how to write a proposal. "

            "\u00a0The course serves its purpose ",
            "\u00a0I think the benefits of this course, although still existent, decrease passed the second semester. We have already struggled through learning to critically and analytically read the papers in with the generation of a new hypothesis in mind, We have also been able to put together a concise proposal. The benefit decreases because we cannot really fine tune our writing given the relatively shallow feedback we get, which is completely reasonable given the amount of work the professors have to put in. I think re-structuring the second semester into breaking into another skill (like method analysis, paper critique, etc..) would be more beneficial. \r\nLoved the course nonetheless and think it really helps out students transition into their PhD. ",
            "\u00a0Not reading ALL aims aloud this semester was an improvement compared to last semester. More feedback from professors is always more helpful. Having 4 weeks in a row was somewhat brutal. Having a month off and then returning for the 2 final seminars was also somewhat brutal. ",
            "\u00a0I prefer the way the course was set up this semester as opposed to the previous semester. It is more useful to go into a few proposals more in depth. ",
            "\u00a0The class helped me learn a ton. The amount of feedback we got for each proposal was sometimes very low. It's a bummer to spend 12 hours on a project and get two lines of feedback. But our class was so large I understand why that was the case. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: motivates students to think about the research, to criticize it \r\n\r\nweakness: too much topic, not systematic ",
            "\u00a0This course is a hard but good training for writing a good proposal. "

            "\u00a0Yes. 1) It's required for MMPP students, but 2) I do feel like it made me a better scientist. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because we need to know how to write a proposal if we work on science. "
