            "\u00a0Strengths -- Zhou Laoshi is a wonderful man. He is truly an incredible person, both inside and out of class. He believes in his students, has incredible English (which really helps in a Chinese professor), and is patient and encouraging.\r\nWeaknesses -- this is a more structural problem at the higher levels of Chinese, but I just think that learning more formal versions of things I already know how to say feels useless and boring. I also think that the daily syllabi are not particularly useful and make it very difficult to find what we need. I wish Zhou Laoshi would teach with a powerpoint where he actually presented grammar structures and important words instead of just talking about them - I'm not an auditory learner, so it makes it really hard for me to remember when I can't see it in front of me. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course is strong at teaching a lot of characters and grammar structures. I think it is weaker at practicing spoken Chinese and could spend more time in class focusing on speaking grammar structures. In addition, much of the classroom learning is heavily based in preparation beforehand which can be alienating before students slip into the groove of the semester. I also think the issue of limited practice of spoken Chinese can be alleviated by not allowing one or two students to answer most of the questions and discuss the most (call on people at random) and enforcing Chinese-only policies during tutorials. \r\n\r\nA final suggestion would be that because my class size was so small, it might have been better sitting around a seminar table. I think it would have been easier to pay attention throughout, as well as take notes. ",

            "\u00a0I mean, don't take it unless you have to. I took it because I wanted to keep my Chinese from turning to garbage, and it kept me at about the same level I was before. I probably can say things in a more fancy way now, but I don't think that I've made real gains this semester. If you can skip into the real L5 classes like Zhou Laoshi's Chinese Technology and Society, do that instead. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I really learned a lot, love Zhou Laoshi, and think that it was a very effective way to continue to grow my comfort with Chinese. I would definitely recommend that someone take it, especially if they've made it this far. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, Zhou Laoshi is as good as it gets "
