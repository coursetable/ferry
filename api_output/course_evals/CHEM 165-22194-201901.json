Additionally, the lectures were no longer recorded so I could go back and view them again before the exams. ",

I am sure that as an intro class it is meant to be difficult and impersonal connection to the lecturer but I found Dr. Parr to be unnecessarily condescending or sarcastic at times which was very off putting. I am sure that it can be justified being that a good quarter of the class stopped coming to class but that is not a valid reason to invoke such actions to the 3/4 of the class or at least 50% of the class that was consistently there. Also the TAs this semester clearly couldn't care less if you were in jeopardy of doing poorly for an example. They themselves have often admitted to not knowing what was even going on in the class lectures. I found myself questioning how am I, a first year student with limited STEM experience, suppose to be able to fully comprehend materials that grad students and PhD students in chemistry didn't understand. ",

I truly feel like I have a strong foundation in a subject I was uncertain about going into the year. I thought it was slightly unfair to take off for incorrect answer attempts in the daily problems. There were times when I was confused about a topic that we would be covering the next day, and it cost me points until I completely finished my progression to the correct answer. It would have also been nice to continue the livestream of the course. ",

Dr. Parr was good in the beginning until we got to electrochemistry, and from there he went through the lecture materials really quickly, talking the entire time rather than asking for class participation. There were definitely more PollEV questions in the beginning of the course, as well as opportunities for us to ask the TFs questions during lecture. By the end of the course, there werent enough practice problems in the powerpoint/lecture notes for everyone to stay engaged and know when we didnt really understand a topic. More PollEV/clicker questions would be very helpful. Also, the Sapling reading quizzes for orgo were unnecessarily brutal. ",

            "\u00a0Professor Hyunh was a shinning light in this course and last semester. It was sometimes stressful to be learning in such a large class environment, especially once we embarked in Organic Chemistry. However, even though I had never personally met Professor Hyunh, through his numerous study resources and office hours, I felt supported by an instructor. I think that having him as a resource in a position that is closer to students yet also very much involved in overseeing the course was extremely valuable. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is how closely it follows the textbook and how many resources there are for help, from TA office hours, Parr's office hours, and peer tutoring. If all else fails, you can just read the textbook. The one weakness is the last unit, organic chemistry, which was not pulled from the textbook and seemed to be a random mishmash of topics. It was doable if you had the time to Google literally every topic, but there wasn't as much support for this unit as the others. Also, Mioy Huynh is THE BEST. ",

Everything can be learned in the book, and the discussion sections are WAY more useful because you can do problems and receive real-time feedback. The whole flipped model this course uses (ie. read the material at home, do practice problems in class w/some explanations) doesn't really work.

The last section of the class - organic chem and transition metals - was absolutely horrible, because the professor barely taught any of the content, and the content wasn't in the book either. I asked the TA how to study when the material wasn't taught in class or in the textbook, and he told me I'd just have to Google information. Professors shouldn't leave the material up to Google - how much would we be expected to know? ",

Section was  hit or miss and was often not very helpful, though moreso than lecture most times. The Sapling homeworks and problem sets were often annoying because there is no notification on Canvas for them and aren't announced explicitly so you need to constantly log on and check if there is a problem set, and there is also no partial credit for turning it in a day late, which is a change from last semester and caused many people to get zeros on problem sets that are worth a lot of points because they either didn't know it was due or hoped to finish the next day for partial credit. The in-class polling wasn't too helpful but talking through the problem was. There is also no really good mechanism of feedback aside from with the online homework because of how impersonal the large lecture is, the way the assignments are structured, how poorly section can be run, etc. ",

And the TAs are pretty knowledgeable and enthusiastic. The Sapling problem sets and practice problems are also a strength. They were probably the most helpful resource and learning tool for me. The lectures were pretty useless for me; they could be improved by focusing more on the formulas and number manipulation that we really need to know. The exams were graded leniently, and I liked the combination of multiple choice and free response. But I hated the bigness of the class--it was really easy to fall through the cracks and never be noticed, even if you did go to lecture. It would be great if this class could be broken up into smaller lecture groups. ",

            "\u00a0I think it is very difficult to understand everything from the textbook and the lectures alone. I think an improvement from general chemistry 161 was that the problem sets gave you unlimited tries, so you could truly see what was wrong with your answer and work through it. Another strength of this course, in my opinion, is the discussion sections. If not for meeting with my Teaching Fellow every week after each set of lectures, I would not have understood anything that is going on in class. It might be a reality of having a 300 person class, but I felt sometimes the lecture was teaching at a higher level than the textbook, so even if you read the textbook you would be lost. In addition, we went over a lot of things in class that weren't necessarily pertinent and were not needed for the exam. I also believe it is especially hard if you haven't been exposed to the material beforehand. In terms of how it could be improved, I believe making the lectures easier to follow by avoiding leaps in logic one wouldn't know without already knowing the subject and making the lectures more engaging would make it much better.

I think it is beneficial for most (if not all students) to receive some sort of outside help, and I think I overlooked that to start because I assumed the class would be really easy.
