            "\u00a0Laboratory skills necessary to work in an analytical chemistry/environmental engineering lab, important tricks of the trade, and how to write professional research reports. ",
            "\u00a0By taking this class, I developed laboratory skills for research in environmental engineering. In particular, I learned how to use numerous tools and machines, as well as how to interpret results and understand the limitations of these devices. I also gained a broader sense of the type of work done by environmental engineers, and the types of questions they need to answer as they conduct experiments. ",
            "\u00a0I became so much more familiar with the actual tools of environmental engineering to take questions from the hypothetical to something I could actually test and answer. I came into the class thinking about some questions I had already, about how to characterize the chemical and biological parameters of systems I was interested in, and I was not disappointed! I also learned how to distinguish between NPT and swagelok fittings hehe "

            "\u00a0This class had a lot of what I was looking for in a lab class. The labs were relevant and wide-ranging. The professor and TA were both extremely engaging and cared that we understood the material. The new lab spaces are easy to work in environments that enhance student learning. I felt like I was doing real work and not just repeating steps from a procedure manual.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of the class were due to it being its first semester in existence. Class times were not always the most organized and lab reports were often hard to complete because of lack of data obtained during class. These should get better with time, however. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Plata's willingness to run interesting experiments with the class made the course extremely informative and fun. We were able to take water samples and conduct flow measurements in a nearby river, take air samples to measure particulate matter in New Haven's air, and test water samples for heavy metal concentrations, among many other interesting labs. The main area for improvement in this class would be to change the format a bit, as 1.25-hour blocks were not enough time. ",
            "\u00a0This was a great course, of course there were a few rough spots given that it was the first year it was taught, but in general we certainly learned about the techniques and got to practice them to some extent. Given the time pressure for some of the experiments, I would say I'm not sure I could necessarily repeat them all unassisted, but I have a much better sense of what techniques are used when and why, and could perform many of them. There were a couple of experiments in particular where there was some significant confusion surrounding how to analyze the data and the professor and TA were on different pages about how that is done so we did the best we could with the information we had but got sort of non-sense answers and consequently had write a report about how there weren't enough toxins in all the tar-sands in Canada to kill a mouse... which just felt like a bit of a waste of time. But I think with more experience with this course it could be run really smoothly and have a lot of potential. In some ways also we didn't really mind being the guinea pigs because we also learned a lot about troubleshooting which is honestly a very practical skill. I wish we would have gotten reports back earlier in the semester in order to use the comments to improve later reports, but I realize that the expectations for those were also a bit trial-and-error. While we complained about the expectations of writing full-length reports at the time, I do think that we learned a lot by having to frame our thinking that way and expand so much on our ideas. I feel like ideally there would be a structure though that sort of accounts for the limitations of being in a lab class and what the experiments actually were. For example, we were usually doing sample analysis rather than actual original experiments, so it seemed strange to have to write a hypothesis, yet many of the included materials about how to write a report stated that this was essential. I know its more work but maybe a short handout made specifically for this class that explains the expectations for our reports would be really helpful. In terms of other strengths though, wow it was soooo cool that we got to use all the equipment that we did--the ICP-MS and the SEM were my two favorite but there were a lot of highlights. This was a really unique and excellent experience, I felt very lucky and it got me super excited about the field and the research that you can do as a graduate student (which I was not sure I wanted to do before taking this class). So please understand that I've tried to give some constructive feedback in here but overall this course had a massive impact on me and was a very important, integral part of my ENVE course load. "

            "\u00a0This class is great, but its quality totally depends on who the professor and teaching fellow are. This year, they were both great, so the course was amazing. ",
            "\u00a0If you're looking to take a great, practical course, look no further. And even if you're not, this course answered questions about experimental design for me that I didn't even know I had. The organization was a bit lackluster, since this was the first year the course was taught, but I expected it to improve and even if it doesn't, I think it was worth it for the content and the great teaching.
