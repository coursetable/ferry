            "\u00a0So much, wow: basically the class is focused on vector calculus and linear algebra, but the first half of 230 you basically get a crash course to all of math. And you learn how to write proofs of all sorts. ",
            "\u00a0Proof writing, basic understanding of math (topology, algebra, linear algebra, calculus) ",
            "\u00a0This course is only nominally a multivariable and linear course -- the heart of it is learning how to write rigorous proofs, which are then used to \"build up\" to calc/linear content (so you start the semester with a list of things that are assumed to be true about the real numbers, and end the semester having proven major theorems such as MVT). Zero knowledge of writing proofs beforehand is required; I myself came into it with no experience but now feel much more comfortable with my ability as a mathematician. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the beauty of mathematics. This class is a calculus, analysis, linear algebra, and proof based class all in one. There is a lot of material in the course, but the class itself is well worth it. ",
            "\u00a0Pat taught me how to do real math. He showed me that mathematics involves thinking critically about a problem, proving new facts from previous facts. Mathematics is not a rote memorization and application of formulas, it is a process of creation and of giving thoughts and ideas structure. I developed skills in proof writing through different areas of math, including topology, analysis, calculus, and linear algebra. This class exposed me to a lot of new math, and it show me how exciting and communal doing math can be. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught how to partake in real mathematics. It taught how to think and solve questions when there is no clear procedure to do so. It is an amazing class to broaden one's perspective and open one's mind. ",
            "\u00a0All of the mathematical structures and content developed in class were new to me. I learned proof writing, analytical thinking, and of course the foundations of vector calculus and linear algebra to a deeper degree than I have ever experienced in a math course before. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a much greater understanding of linear algebra and vector calculus (the name of the course is very accurate). I also discovered much more about the basics of all sorts of math, as well as cool insights into seemingly unrelated areas. ",
            "\u00a0Despite going into the class thinking I knew all I needed to know about Vector Calculus and Linear Algebra, every single day taught me something new. Building up each of the disciplines from the beginning, the course led us on a journey through analysis, algebra, discrete math, topology, set theory, and more. Problem sets were hard, but each problem helped to develop problem solving and proof writing skills, and the collaborative aspect of the class taught me how to work on math with other people. This isn't a course on Vector Calc and Lin Alg - its a course on creative thinking and mathematical rigor, wrapped up with fun puzzles, problems, and games. You'll learn more than you ever wanted to know about limits, derivatives, and vectors, but you'll come out feeling stronger than you'd ever thought you'd feel about math. ",

            "\u00a0Taught basic proof methods and strengthened my proof-writing ability through repetition, application. This course gave me a taste of several branches of math: discrete, real analysis, topology. We did a lot with linear algebra in the second half of the semester. More than anything, this course taught me to expect a higher level of rigor from myself and my teachers. I think about math in a different and better way now. ",

            "\u00a0I learned a lot about calculus and linear algebra stripped to the basics. Having already learned about linear algebra and multivariable calculus before taking this course, I already knew some of the topics covered in this class, but in 230, we took it a step further and proved theorems/postulates/things I just took for granted and showed how they all tie together. ",
            "\u00a0The course taught a lot about various mathematical concepts in a variety of fields, from real analysis and linear algebra to vector calculus. It also gives students many, many opportunities to practice their proof-writing. ",
            "\u00a0Lots! How to prove things logically, and how to wrap my head around things I don't know. Sounds lame, but I also learned how to push through some difficult tasks and how to ask for help when I needed it. ",
            "\u00a0I continued to develop my proof writing skills, and gained a lot of exposure to various fields in mathematics which was an intellectual stimulating and enjoyable experience. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest part of the course is the proof-writing, but we did intro linear algebra, analysis, and calculus, as well as random bits of number theory and combinatorics and a bit of topology. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write better proofs! I'm still not great but I feel like I grew a lot and got better at figuring out how to put my mathematical hunches and intuitions into actual words that make sense. I also learned how to think more creatively when approaching problems that require unconventional methods. Now, a lot of solutions that previously seemed so unexpected to me are much clearer and I am getting closer to figuring out those on my own with the help of lots of friends and the TFs! ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to use creativity to solve proofs and I learned so much about math that I'd never thought of before. But mostly the creative problem solving thing ",
            "\u00a0I gained an overview of topics in math including analysis (limits, continuity, Bolzano-Weierstrass), vector calculus (derivatives), and linear algebra (linear transformations, row reduction, determinants, wedge products). What really helped me deepen my understanding of these concepts was that we proved many of the theorems relating to these concepts ourselves on the problem sets, instead of simply being presented with the proof in lecture. As a result, I felt that I not only gained conceptual understanding from this course, but I also developed an ability to reason logically and rigorously through problems, which is a skill that is valuable both in mathematics and many other fields. ",

            "\u00a0Most valuably, a strengthened mathematical thinking muscle, exercised by both the topics we covered and the fun Putnam problems sprinkled throughout Psets. I'd say this course showed me, more than anything had before, what it is exactly that mathematicians do. It's much more than accumulating and learning to use the various math tools we've been exposed to before (like addition, algebra, and integrals) - it's a way of cleverly knowing when to apply these tools. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot in terms of proof-writing and critical thinking. This class was unlike any math class I've taken before, and although the content was challenging, I find that I've improved a lot more than I expected I would. ",
            "\u00a0During this course, I learned the core tenets of mathematics, including how to construct a proof, and the basics of algebra, analysis, topology and number theory. Using these tools, I built the foundations of calculus, and linear algebra over abstract fields, as well as a few interesting side ventures into combinatorics and modular arithmetic. ",

Further, we learned some basic linear algebra over general fields and proved the rank-nullity theorem. I also improved my mathematical problem-solving skills and LaTeX skills by typesetting every pset. ",

To start, I feel like I learned the basics of many different forms of mathematics, namely topology, analysis, vector calculus, combinatorics, and linear algebra. Furthermore, I learned many different proof strategies for each of these topics, allowing me to think more critically about math than I ever have before. But I think the most important skills I learned related to collaboration with my peers, which was essential in completing the problem sets to the best of my ability. With over 20 hours per week spent on these problem sets, I also learned how to manage a heavy workload and how hard work can make a class feel more rewarding. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: the class was literally perfect. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none, unless you dont like math. At which point the very high workload would be one. ",
            "\u00a0Love the community and teacher. Pset-based learning is good. Math lounge and pizza are always cool too. I wish there was a official list of theorems/topics though for times I've skipped class and gotten completely lost. ",

A prospective student in this class should be aware that problem sets take 10-15 hours (sometimes more), and are often designed to require collaborative effort due to sheer difficulty. Consequently, the class can feel overwhelming at the beginning of the semester. Nonetheless, most students settle into a comfortable rhythm within a few weeks and the class is definitely manageable. ",
            "\u00a0This class is very hard at times, and the professor understand this. He and his TA's were as helpful as possible, and tried to make everyone believe they belonged in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Math 230 exposes students to lots of areas of math while still teaching the core material of proof writing, calculus, and linear algebra. Sometimes the course moves too quickly for students not used to proof-based math, but this is more of a learning curve for the student than a weakness of the course. ",
            "\u00a0I looked forward to this course every day since classes began. As far as I am concerned, there are no immediate improvements to be made. The only possible suggestion I could make is to move the location of the class to a large auditorium so that several hundred students can take it. ",
            "\u00a0The professor and TA's are extremely approachable -- as in they are practically ever-present in the math lounge, which has been critical to our learning as most of our content and skills are learned through p-sets. The course material is also accessible to people like me who do not have a strong math background but learn to think logically rather than rely on algorithmic skills.\r\nMath 230 would be an excellent model for other introductory mathematics courses, as its problem-solving methods seem more conducive to retention and engagement than standard evaluative classes. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very strong in its structure, in that there are weekly problem sets without fail and the professor moves continuously from one lecture to another. The variety of course material presented is also a strength, and besides the core areas the course also provided useful and interesting forays into varied areas of mathematics. \r\nHowever, there are also certain weaknesses. Notably, the course felt somewhat too fast at times and relied too little on student input. Some lecture days would just go by with little student participation at all and were mildly dull. Though I understand class size is a limiting factor, it felt like the course leaned too much on the professor's natural enthusiasm for math and not enough on the course's inherently interesting material and structure. Perhaps more inter-student discussion could be used to make the course better. ",
            "\u00a0No weaknesses at all. Pat's incredible engagement and love for learning and teaching makes this course perfect the way it is. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Pat is awesome, and Piazza is helpful \r\nWeakness: material is unorganized sometimes ",
            "\u00a0The professor is incredibly engaging and encourages everyone to continue in the course even though it is a hard course. His lectures were sufficient for learning (I never needed to review or read from textbook) and incredibly funny. He was very often during the TAs office hours and  gave us extra help and advice. There is no weakness I can find for this course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nThe problem sets were very well-designed. They forced us to work collaboratively (or at least they forced me to) and regularly had us prove results we would later use. They were the reason I felt so intimately acquainted with the material.\r\nThe curriculum was excellent. The course jumped all over the place, but everything we did was part of a natural progression and turned out to be important later on.\r\nGrading system. The problem sets were a good level of difficulty higher than the tests, which I prefer greatly in such a demanding course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nThis is relatively minor, but the pace of lessons could be extremely variable. At times we would introduce several new concepts rapidly, while other times we would spend an entire class on a proof that I'm confident most students could have worked out themselves. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Pat is amazing, you learn so much, you discover what you are capable of, you get hooked on math.\r\nWeaknesses: Not really any, to be honest. I sometimes wish the graders gave more feedback on the stylistic part of our psets, but that is hard, and there are a lot of psets to grade, so I'll graciously cut them some slack. ",
            "\u00a0Its a wonderful excellent course with lots of support from teachers, and Pat is the best. The pace is fast, so perhaps it could be slowed down slightly, but the onslaught of material is also what makes it really challenging and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Class is taught very well and problem sets are interesting, but lecture goes very slow and the examples are pretty easy. Also the exams are too easy and don't give you a feel for how you are doing in the class - they could be harder and given a curve. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this class taught by Pat. We learned so much about not only the course material but also took mini digressions to explore math as a field. ",
            "\u00a0The course goes over information efficiently and extremely well; through the teacher's highly capable instruction, students go through a lot of material, but  the course offers a lot of support as well. The course is overall amazing, but there remains trouble for those who want to leave after 230, as that puts them in an awkward position within the math department. ",
            "\u00a0There were many topics that weren't fully integrated or \"wrapped up\" by the end of the course, so maybe these could be molded into a coherent narrative. ",
            "\u00a0The course was quite strong in its coverage of multiple fields of math and rigorous derivations of multivariable calculus and linear algebra from scratch. There was definitely an emphasis of depth and rigorous understanding over breadth of topics, which is a fair tradeoff even though it felt like we didn't cover much compared to linear algebra courses taught in a more conventional setting. And of course, Pat is a phenomenal professor, which I'm sure all students can agree with. The course felt weak in its reliance for students of less talent/experience in mathematical thinking on help outside of the classroom at the math lounge, which I definitely took advantage of since I always felt stuck and reliant on others for help. I found myself spending an entire afternoon/evening doing problem sets, which was expected but felt defeating at times knowing that other students didn't need to. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Pat is fun, curriculum is very entertaining, environment is very supportive.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lectures could stand to be more organized and more importantly a lot faster (in my opinion). The class is a bit too big, meaning the level is far too high for some and far too low for others. ",
            "\u00a0The community and support that's built organically in the class (with the help of Pat and the TFs of course) are what got me through a lot of tough concepts that I definitely couldn't have navigated alone. Now I'm convinced that friendship is the real secret to learning a lot! Making friends was the best part of this class and I don't think I could've had a better time doing math than with all of the amazing and supportive folks I met on this journey. If you read this Pat, please keep on facilitating this sort of warm and welcoming community in math, and thank you so much for encouraging all of us to try our best together instead of upholding the more traditional exclusivity and elitism that used to take all the fun out of math for me.\r\nOn a slight tangent, having extensions on p-sets was incredibly helpful just because of how much time they take and how assignments from other classes sometimes all get inconveniently assigned in clusters. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is in the professor. He teaches the course with great enthusiasm and is really helpful to struggling students. The weakness is the difficulty of the problem sets, often needing students to look to others who'd already solved the problems ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is definitely in the problem sets. Pat does a wonderful job of putting together just the right mix of problems -- both fundamental theorems and Putnam-style problems that develop creativity and ingenuity. They challenge students who have seen the material before while still managing to be accessible to those encountering proofs for the first time. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I did not feel that I gained as much from the lectures. I felt that Pat could have covered the material at a faster rate and presented proofs at a higher level of rigor. I also feel that the logical flow of the course could have been organized so that new concepts were better motivated; for example, we could have defined the determinant and used that to motivate the definition of wedge products instead of working with wedge products first. ",
            "\u00a0The course did a great job splitting between development of ideas in lecture and practicing and discovering new concepts individually in problem sets. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: A truly challenging course that tests your ability to write proofs - I think it's a great intro course for people who are considering the math major or just generally like math\r\nWeaknesses: Lots of work - psets are long but sometimes that's the fun of it, also there could variance on pset graders ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Psets were interesting and engaging\r\nWeakness: Probably could have had more practical numerical examples in Problem sets (they aren't that difficult to add on considering how much work the rest of the Problem set is). Also, it's kinda weird to collaborate with people on problem sets. ",
            "\u00a0The workload/time investment for the course is very high if you don't have much background in formal mathematics (not necessarily a bad thing, but a lot of time was spent on psets). The upside is that Pat is an incredible instructor and is very understanding of his students. He does his best to make sure every student is doing well in his class, so grades aren't really a concern. He also encourages a lot of collaboration and is really trying to create a math community - something I appreciate a lot. ",
            "\u00a0It either needs to be optional or needs to be taught at a more rapid pace - as it stands, it is too slow for the more experienced people in the class. ",
            "\u00a0I think the strength is that the class doesn't have a certain area of focus, which made it possible for the professor to meander and address the areas in fields other than linear algebra. ",

            "\u00a0The greatest strength of the class was definitely the supportive environment. The great deal of office hours, the fact that the class was not curved, the ability to collaborate with others on PSETs, and Pat's overall enthusiasm fostered this environment. However, one of the weaknesses of the course was the threat of imposter syndrome. The class was difficult because everyone came in at different skill levels with some people catching on to the pace level and amount and difficulty of the course load at different times. The lectures were a strength in this area because they were very accessible. I do wish we had conquered some of the more challenging proofs or concepts covered on the PSETs in class because then I would have felt more prepared on PSETs and had a better foundation to make self-discoveries. Yet, these are all minor things because truly the supportive structure of the course ensures anyone's success if they put forth the effort. ",

It teaches you how to battle through hours of pset problems and emerge feeling like you have become a better problem solver and thinker. The weaknesses are probably that the lectures can sometimes feel a little scattered, and there is often a good deal of thinking and time that needs to be put in to realize how the psets connect to what's being done in class (and sometimes this connection doesn't exist).

This course offers an introduction to mathematical proof writing and exploration into linear algebra and multivariable calculus, this is not an easy course by any stretch of the imagination and every student will struggle in their own way. Even though I found that I routinely struggled I believe that I truly benefitted from the course and the community that is fostered by the course. I confident as mathematical thinker and proof writer and even though it took me some time to build that confidence, I credit that to the course and the challenges a long the way. Office hours fosters a welcoming community and the availability of TAs/TFs/Professor was incredibly generous. The only reason and situation I would not advocate taking this course is if you are already taking a heavy course load. The weekly Problems sets can be a lot sometimes and for most students they require anywhere from 3-20+ hours a week, if you think you might be on the higher end of that spectrum as well as plan on taking several heavy work load classes, shop the class and get a feel before committing.
