            "\u00a0This course helped me establish a connection between my mind and my body. As Yalies, we're constantly in our heads, absorbing as much information as possible, and we rarely are required to learn about and pay attention to what our bodies need. This class really helped me both as a dancer and a person. The readings were all interesting and diverse, from reading about Alvin Ailey's \"Revelations\" to reading a book about how water is able to hold memory and can react to how we speak to it. Classes were always engaging and built on each other. ",
            "\u00a0I LEARNED SO MUCH ABOUT MY BODY AND ABOUT DANCE. This class is absolutely necessary to your Yale career. It opens you up to a new way of thinking about your body and the world around you and art and dancers and dancing. I didn't think I could dance going into this class but I had an amazing time and was supported by Ms. Robinson and my peers. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to lengthen and strengthen my body. I learned how to open up my body to be vulnerable on stage and become ready to tell a story. I learned how to connect to  the audience. I also saw from different professionals how they have learned to connect with the audience and promote the mission of Ailey in their own line of work. ",
            "\u00a0This is by far one of the best if not the best class I have taken at Yale thus far. I learned all about the art of storytelling through dance. Through this class I feel that I not only have better control over my dancing, but also I have better control over my body as a whole. I learned about opposition, transitions, grace, and power. Ms. Robinson is one of the most amazing professors who genuinely cares about all her students. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the importance of the principles of opposition and transition in helping to crystallize the intent of storytelling through dance. ",
            "\u00a0- Two words you will have engrained into your mind, for the better, after leaving this class: opposition and transition. When dancing, these two concepts will keep you grounded while doing beginner work to mastery level work. Ms. Robinson teaches you how to tune your mind and body so that you can begin to move more effectively.\r\n- Dance is not to show all of your capabilities--it is about conveying a story for people to understand. If in that story you have complex movement, that is fine, but the every movement should have a meaning behind it.\r\n- How to look inside myself and find a story that I wanted to be told through dancing.\r\n- FLOOR BARRE will change your entire body. Your alignment will be straightened so that feel taller and able to take up more space in life.\r\n- How to understand a story that a choreographer wishes to tell, by studying the movements. ",
            "\u00a0This course equipped me with the skills to appreciate and comment on dance performances, to attempt dance sequences myself, to connect with my body, and to choreograph a challenging but not impossible piece. I learned about how to appreciate knowledge communicated and understood through dance. ",
            "\u00a0I leaned the crucial skill of indentifiying embodied knowledge within msyelf, and transferring that to others through specific movement practice. This is skill is integral to me as an ethnographer, and future commicator across many publics. "

            "\u00a0This course is great in that it is taught by an amazing person who used to be an Ailey dancer and is interested in helping all of us develop. That balance allowed for growth and learning in different areas, whether we were doing floor barre, doing combinations, or writing papers. ",
            "\u00a0Nothing. This class is structured so well and balanced out really great. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are definitely all rooted in the extensive movement practice. Ms. Robinson does an excellent job of taking the time to work on our bodies, and amends the total time for that depending on what our bodies tell her each day. A weakness is in the discussion, there were some excellent discussions at times, but that would also lead to the class getting out 20 minutes late. ",
            "\u00a0One of the main strengths of this course is Ms. Robinson. She is one of the most incredible professors. She honestly cares about every student in the class and makes it a point to work with each student individually. The readings are enlightening and the work load is very low. After each class, I left with a newfound confidence and a joy for dance that only Ms. Robinson can bring. One of my favorite experiences was going to see the Alvin Ailey Dance Theater at the end of the semester. We got a backstage tour and got to meet many of the amazing dancers. If anything the only thing this course needs is an extra half hour for each class. Ms. Robinson always goes a little bit over time, but I never minded because I enjoyed the class so much. ",
            "\u00a0This course was an amazing breath of fresh air from the traditional classroom setting. Being able to do floor barre and studio exercises but also discuss readings created a nice dichotomy between the physical and the intellectual content of the class. In the future, more rigid scheduling of class time would be helpful to ensure that class does not run past its scheduled time. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n\r\nThis class is a great opportunity to work intentionally with your body and movement in the context of a Yale classroom. Ms. Robinson is a remarkable woman with an incredible dance career behind her and insider's knowledge of the dance world you won't find anywhere else. She is radiant and cares deeply about her students. The course culminated in a trip to see the Alvin Ailey Company in New York, which was an incredible experience. Each class begins with floor barre (think warm-up meets ballet technique training), which was fabulous. I also really appreciated that the course truly was open to students of all dance backgrounds and abilities.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\nThe course was quite disorganized. Class discussions often dragged on - it would have been better to spend more time on movement practice and less time on class discussion. Readings were not sufficiently relevant to the course material. Students were required to write many reflection papers over the course of the semester, which rarely felt like a worthwhile use of time, and grew redundant given the lack of variety in the prompts. I also would have enjoyed spending much more time on across-the-floor and choreography. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- Ms. Robinson is extremely invested in every student's growth and wishes to help you find your \"brilliance\" as a dancer.\r\n- Trip to NYC to see Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater Company live\r\n- Working with one of the best dancers in the world!!!!\r\n- Seeing others transform around you throughout the semester\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Running out of time during class, but Ms. Robinson promises to get better with timing ",
            "\u00a0The students were really engaged in the course. Every class was active and we had the opportunity to talk with some unexpected and very insightful members of Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, and other artists. Each week we built up skills from the previous week, and you could feel it if you had not practiced for a week. My main critique would be that the reading and written assignments were not given far in advance so it was sometimes a struggle to come to class having digested the reading. ",
            "\u00a0It was a wonderful course, I felt that I was able to jump right in, depsite not having any dance backgournd. However, the syllabus was not always clear, so I was confused as to what to turn in, and when. "

            "\u00a0Everyone at Yale should take this course. Ms. Robinson is a fantastic teacher, not to mention she danced with the Ailey Company for 30 years. Her connections frequently brought in interesting guests to class, so we were able to learn about different areas in dance from lighting to hip-hop to physical therapy. The workload isn't that much and is totally worth it: weekly readings and responses, a midterm paper (4-6 pages), and a final project with a 2 page final paper. Pretty much all the papers have some sort of reflection element to them, so they're not that difficult. The class also culminates in a trip to NY to see the Alvin Ailey Company perform, which was such an incredible and humbling experience. I was always excited to come to class and because the class setting is so intimate and requires vulnerability, my class grew really close and supported each other wholeheartedly for our final projects. Hands down, one of the best classes I've taken at Yale and Ms. Robinson is an absolute gem who really cares about her students. If you're able to get in, take it because it will truly change your life. ",
            "\u00a0YES YES YES YES YES  a must take if you can get in. ",
            "\u00a0It is an excellent introduction to dance. Ms. Robinson is able to make every body feel like they can move in space and that is pretty cool. ",
            "\u00a0Whether you are a dancer or you have never danced a day in your life, I would recommend this class to everyone. Floor barre is therapeutic and Ms. Robinson takes each student as a separate case. I learned how to be in my own skin and be confident with my own body. The skills of presence and power that I learned in this class are skills that are irreplaceable. Anyone who can should try to get a seat in this class. It will probably always be my favorite class of my Yale career. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course if you can! It has something to offer to literally everyone, whether you've never danced a day in your life or if you're a principal dancer at the American Ballet Theater. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Dancers and non-dancers alike have the ability to change their outlooks on life as well as the way they feel when doing any kind of movement. If you get into the class, take it seriously because it is certainly a once in a lifetime opportunity. ",
            "\u00a0This course connects students to their bodies for about 4 hours each week. It is a wonderfully de-stressing class. The movement can be exerting and challenging, and focusing on just your body for 4 hours a week is a great lesson in centering and mindfulness. I would come into the class feeling tired and grumpy and leave feeling uplifted and ready to continue the day. There is a wide variety of academic and dance backgrounds in the class, with each student pushing themself and being appreciated for it, whatever the level. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Make sure to come in with an open mind and body! Be ready to move and be moved!! ",
            "\u00a0Yes "
