For an introductory course, there were too many specifics, but nothing was specific enough for a specialized course. \r\n\r\nSome work on the syllabus, and a deeper questioning about the purpose of this course should happen in the near future.

            "\u00a0I was unclear on the specific requirements for all assignments. I did them to the best of my ability, but I was never sure if I was doing what was expected. The first two assignments need more specificity - they use language that may be familiar to the professor, but not nessecarily to the students. \r\n\r\nThe last assignment, at the end of the day, is a drafting assignment. I would hope for something more. "

            "\u00a0The instructor did not seem to do any due diligence in preparing for class outside of creating the powerpoint presentation.  Such as having the right connectors for the projector, having enough seats in the room. The instructor also was lacking in notifying students when perpetually late to class.  Classes either started late, or ran over time, thus making it harder on students to plan and navigate their days. ",
            "\u00a0I know he's busy, but it seems like sometimes he put together the lecture that day ",
            "\u00a0Some class sessions were more dynamic than others, and it's hard to say why exactly. Most likely, it was due to the nature of the material covered: generalized topics were less interesting than overviews of very specific code requirements. ",
            "\u00a0We often wound up running out of time because Gene didn't have a good handle on how long a given subject would take. \r\n\r\nI appreciate that he loves what he does, but I could have done with a few less tangents. Especially tangents that are really only interesting to him. ",

Nevertheless I think the goals of the course were more tailored towards a focus on the 3rd and 4th assignments and wish we had spent a bit more time with the 3rd assignment or similar code analysis work. ",

I wish we had potentially had similar exposure to these experts throughout the design process, perhaps in one or two more consulting sessions. ",

The chance to tour Yale's theater spaces with experts and analyze particular design decisions within the spaces was incredible illuminating and fulfilling. "
