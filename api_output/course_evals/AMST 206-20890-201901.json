            "\u00a0A complete and total mindshift about the way I think about refugees. Instead of examining what refugee policies are, we ask why were these refugee policies established in the first place. This class has given me a paradigm shift as a scholar, confronting the ways that I as an individual and human being and artist in the world engage with refugee scholarship, media, and stories. We've taken a comprehensive view of refugees, from the question of human rights to citizenship to colonial roots to artistic representations. ",
            "\u00a0In this course I learned how to think/engage critically with refugee studies as a field. To reflect deeply on scholarly work about refugees. To place a very relevant and important issue in academic context as well as in a historical, global, and political context. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the field of Critical Refugee Studies, and how that differs from Refugee Studies. I learned about the harmful consequences of unfair refugee portrayals, and the importance of refugee agency. ",
            "\u00a0I learned SO MUCH THIS SEMESTER. Take this class. Learned about refugee temporality, complex personhood, how humanitarian organizations actually hurt refugees and migrants because they try to remain nonpartisan (which is impossible). Learned about how kinda everything is corrupt but that's okay because we are fighting against it. For example, media and news can only give us so much information before \"compassion fatigue\" sets inwe only like hearing about sad things to a certain extent, and then we get bored and turn off the TV. Because news outlets want us to keep watching TV and advertisements, they only tell us some of the sad stuff so we don't get overwhelmed. So like half of the news we want to get, we don't even get. That's crazy. \r\nBut seriously, learned so much, great class. ",
            "\u00a0this was an *introduction* to the field of critical refugee studies. it introduced me to a field i had no previous exposure to and the idea of a critical framework. i learned about the US perpetuation of the \"refugee crisis,\" the conceptualization of refugeehood and the bounds and fluidity of that definition, the american/international asylum process and its limits, the UNHCR's limits, so much more. this class has enabled me to interrogate everything related to refugee studies by equipping  me with the critical framework. it also changed the way i understand victimhood more broadly. a gem of a class. ",
            "\u00a0Radically changed the way I think about refugees and the nation state more generally. \r\nThough I personally didn't do a creative project (I just did a paper), other students in the class had amazing projects, such as short stories, plays, dance choreography, poetry, etc. that really gives you an opportunity to flesh out other skills in academic contexts. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about how to view refugees from a critical lens. I learned about how often refugees are stripped of agency, of voice, of a say in what happens to them and what their needs are. I learned about the importance in listening to these needs in order to tackle systems to oppression. I learned about categorical fetishism, and the falseness of refugee temporality, and the limited nature of the official refugee definitionand so much more. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about the shortcomings of how we discuss and present refugees and the misconceptions that arise as a consequence. Themes of the course included refugee temporalities, the relationships refugees have to the nation-state, the re-creation of refugee landscapes and identity and the use of art and other media in presenting refugee narratives. ",
            "\u00a01. How to evaluate media portrayals of refugees\r\n2. What the difference between refugees and migrants are\r\n3. Where our modern understanding of states and refugee rights originates\r\n4. What it is like to be a refugee\r\n5. That I want to continue this work post-college "

            "\u00a0Strengths: a very well-rounded look at various aspects of refugeeness that challenged our previous notions. I love the freedom we were given in our final projects, and the presentations we did on the last day of class. Weaknesses: Sometimes there was just so much reading in one week it would be hard to complete it all, especially when it was midterm season. ",
            "\u00a0I think the readings are curated well on the syllabus and class discussions are great. I liked the in class visits from refugee/individuals working with refugees because I think that put what we are learning in class into a real life perspective. ",
            "\u00a0This course has unique readings and discussion topics compared to other classes I've taken at Yale. This class also has more than just readings. We had multiple guest speakers and visits to art exhibits, which just enhanced the course material. Sometimes the class material can lead one to be pessimistic, but as the semester continues, there are positive and optimistic readings that offer hope. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: amazing professor, amazing topic, cool people because only people who are concerned about the state of the world are interested in taking this kind of class, you learn so much from your peers, you do weekly reading responses that actually get you into the material and make sure you learn stuff.\r\nWeaknesses: too much reading ",
            "\u00a0strengths: organization was perfect. the readings were engaging and honestly i've never wanted to read for a class more than this one. professor tran is an encyclopedia of knowledge about this subject and cares for her students so profoundly. she recognizes the value of intersectionality as you study refugees and she reaches far and wide to approach the field from all possible angles while also not skimming over things. the class discussions were always insightful and the student-led discussions were more productive than any i've ever participated in at yale because prof. tran goes over plans with each student beforehand. \r\nweaknesses: this class is an introduction, i wish there were an intermediate version offered or somewhere natural to go after here. will yale make this a priority? ",
            "\u00a0The course was great! The syllabus is designed really well, and as mentioned in the skills learned section, you really have the flexibility to make a final project designed to what you want to explore, whether it be poetry, dance, a teach in, or something else! Though it of course varies year to year, we had the chance to meet and talk to artist Mohamed Hafez and see his exhibition, which was it incredible! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- great Professor\r\n- great course material\r\n- well organized, well taught\r\n- thoughtful and thought-provoking discussions during class time ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Great and engaging readings, fantastic professor, engaged classmates, fascinating opportunity to do projects. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Only meets once a week. "

            "\u00a0Yes. This has really challenged the way I view my position in the world. I think everyone should take this to have a better understanding of current on-going \"crises.\" It has made me into a more critical, engaged human being and artist. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This course will teach you so much about refugee studies, history, policies, current debates and refugee representation/how to engage with these topics through a critical lens. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. It offered a completely different perspective on topics that I had studied in a strictly political science lens. It is intellectually challenging but not overly difficult. Each class is engaging and unique, and this has been one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0YES. Definitely. You learn so much and you want to change things in the world!!!!!! You are INSPIRED. It's truly great and Professor Tran knows what she's talking about and can really get you deeply invested in the intellectual material of the class. ",
            "\u00a0This is an absolutely fantastic course and I am so glad I got to take it before graduating this year. Professor Tran is incredible! She is kind and an excellent teacher who poses really interesting questions and helps you figure things out. This class really made me think about how the world is set up and it was just so interesting and different from anything I've ever taken before. It is also incredibly important and a timely topic. Definitely try getting into this class! ",
            "\u00a0if you're reading this and on the fence, let this review be the sign you need to add this course to your OCS worksheet and get to class this week. it's early, sure. it's selective, sure. but you will not, i repeat, WILL NOT regret taking this gem of a course. honestly one of the highlights of my four years at yale and was the cherry on top of my senior spring. prof tran is so knowledgeable about this subject but she leaves space for her students to interrogate the issues for themselves. the readings are all super interesting and you'll want to read them, even if they're long, i assure you. the projects leave room for creativity and exploration and intersectionality. prof tran is approachable and cares about her students so much. this class has genuinely altered the way i conceptualize the world and view my place in it. don't miss it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely!! This is a great opportunity to do a project-based final, or become more involved in New Haven with volunteer options for the final project, or just focus on your writing. Professor Tran is also just amazing to take a class with. The syllabus is great, and it's really helped me to think through ideas of statism, refugeeness, media representation, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Please please please take this course if you can. Professor Tran is wonderful and you really get to bond with your classmates while you learn about refugees in a way that is more multifaceted and complex than you ever have before. You leave class with a better understanding about the issues in our existing system today but also how to tackle these issues. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This is a foundational class within the ER&M major that everyone should take. ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely. Prof Tran is an amazing seminar leader and obviously a bonafide expert in the field. She is an incredible resource and is incredibly kind and willing to guide students, and she works incredibly hard to put together a coherent syllabus and organize the lessons by themes. I think this will go down as one of my favorite classes ever taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0One of the most influential classes I have taken at Yale, doing work for this class did not even feel like work because of how invested I felt in the course material. Professor Tran leads discussions that bring you through different perspectives and consider refugeeness completely differently. The course material is exceptional, the guests that come to speak to our class are genuine and resilient individuals, and this seminar is just one of the most real classes Yale has to offer. Absolutely, definitely, take this course. "
