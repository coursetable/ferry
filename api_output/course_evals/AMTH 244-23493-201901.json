In counting we learned different ways of approaching counting, such as inclusion exclusion vs normal combinatorics, etc..

            "\u00a0strengths: pretty good textbook, problem sets are a reasonable difficulty if not a bit hard\r\nweaknesses: teaching could be improved particularly towards the end of the class eg making a mistake midway through lecture and going back to correct it at the end is distracting and makes it more difficult to understand concepts, exams are difficult and worth a really high percentage of the grade ",
            "\u00a0Most importantly, the course should be taught by a more engaged professor. Also, the course did not require any background in writing mathematical proofs, yet these were approximately half of the work, despite never being taught in any formal sense. This caused a great deal of distress, and made many of the tests quite difficult.  There was a fairly big discrepancy between the difficulty level of the lectures/PSETs and the tests as well. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Ross' teaching, Diana's office hours\r\nWeaknesses: more review sessions before the exams would have helped. The exams in 244 were very challenging, so holding a few review sessions would help immensely without having to make them easier. ",
            "\u00a0Homework is probably the biggest flaw (it is almost never returned on time). The material itself is useful and interesting ",

            "\u00a0Class was taught pretty well and the problem sets complemented the material well. Sometimes the in class derivations were a little long though, and perhaps the small details could have been skipped at times. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were excellent.  I think there could be more office hours and TAs/TFs.  Homework took a very long time to come back, so feedback was very rare ",
            "\u00a0Really good course. Not too hard, but you did have to know the material.\r\n\r\nThe only issue, but it was fairly substantial, was how dry the lectures were. It isn't a deal breaker cause you can catch up since the lectures are very close to the book. That in and of itself isn't bad, as Ross really did clarify things relative to the book, but it became so dry that just maintaining attention was the largest issue.\r\nAlso, we spent a long time on derivations which we didn't really have to end up knowing, so that decreased motivation to attend to the details of lectures sometimes. ",
            "\u00a0This is a hard math class because if you don't understand the concept really well, it is difficult to succeed, but that's not the course's fault. This is a difficult subject to learn and the way the course is organized was, in my opinion, the best way to approach the material. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Lots of cool new concepts\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: While the lectures were very engaging in that they covered some of the most enlightening proofs of theorems in the material, I feel like some of those proofs could have been set as assigned reading and in class we could have spent a little more time doing exam style questions. ",
            "\u00a0It felt a bit disorganized: a lot of interesting topics thrown together to make a course, without going too in depth into any of them. It was interesting, though, and I was intrigued enough to look stuff up further outside of class. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were boring, fast paced, and definitely hard to listen to. The book is not readable hence there are not many ways to get ready for a lecture that covers a lot of material on the spot. The instructor should consider providing hand outs or readings for students about the material that is to be covered in the following lecture so that the students can better ready themselves to digest intellectually challenging material during the lecture. ",
            "\u00a0The course material was extremely interesting and I greatly enjoyed it. The problem sets were fair, a great length, and challenging enough so that they were doable but also reinforced the material. Lecture was interesting and Ross is good. The TA hours help hours were good too. No real complaints except problem sets being returned verrrry late/never. ",

It is unclear to me how generating functions relate to graphs, and why they are useful in the same class. It sometimes felt like the different topics we learned were themselves discrete. "

There's a low workload (~2.5 hours a week), the professor is super nice, enthusiastic and high-quality, and the material is interesting with cool applications. The material is the sweet spot in that it's interesting, new and nontrivial, but not hard if you go to class and do the problem sets. The assessments are extremely reasonable. The problem sets are short and there aren't that many. ",

",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you are interested in math and have some experience with math. I took this as my first math class in college and I struggled at first, which I think wouldn't have happened if I had any experience with proofs and proof writing. It is a very challenging course but the material is fairly interesting and Ross is an amazing professor who is always open to answering any questions. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely take it. If you are deciding between 202 or 244, 244 is almost always the choice. ",
            "\u00a0If you are really interested in math in general and are looking for an easier class, this course is worth it. But I wouldn't recommend this class to someone who doesn't already know they enjoy math. ",
            "\u00a0It is a good course and teaches you great many applicable skills. But you need to put a lot of effort in to compensate for the shortcomings of the textbook. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, would recommend. This course is intellectually challenging which makes it exciting, and from what I could gauge it is not much more work than CS 202 at all, just more in-depth and interesting content. Ross is solid too, and the problem sets are very manageable. Tests are not easy but enjoyable challenging and fair. Problem sets were very slow to be returned though. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to any student interested in graphs or probability. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class. It was an interesting introduction to several topic areas that I had not previously had much experience with, and it effectively conveyed new concepts. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Provided you're interested of course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I really enjoyed the subject material. I think it is a great QR course and very relevant to both Math and Computer Science. I learned how to solve a lot of fun problems that I've wondered about for a while (i.e. 7 bridges of Konigsburg). ",
            "\u00a0If you need it for your major, definitely. ",
            "\u00a0Good course if you're looking for some math or doing CS (although not much focus on CS concepts specifically; the book does go into some algorithms) ",
