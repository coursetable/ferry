            "\u00a0Overview knoledge of Plant Ecophys. ",
            "\u00a0The course provided me with a thorough soil-to-canopy understanding of how trees (and plants generally) live and grow. I learned a significant amount about the cell interactions and differences between plant species. The course, through the lab component, also provided a practical opportunity to consider data compilation and analysis. ",
            "\u00a0Through this course, I learned how plants interact with the biotic and abiotic world at different scales, from a leaf to an entire plant to a stand. Emphasis is placed on reactions and adaptations to light intensity, water availability, and temperature. Examples are drawn from forestry, agriculture, and evolutionary history. ",
            "\u00a0The world around me began to look different after some time in this class. I learned to look at physical traits of plants in conjunction with the environment, and make educated guesses as to why a plant may have that morphology. \r\n\r\nPlant ecophysiology also enriched what I took away from my soil science and forest stand dynamics class. In fact, I would say I understood the content of those two classes better for taking plant ecophysiology.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I learned quite a lot about lab methods and procedures in plant science through the group project and lab component. ",
            "\u00a0Since we had to collect data for the problem sets, there were always errors and missing figures in the process. I learned to work on a set of imperfect data and analyze it while being conscious of the potential errors. "

            "\u00a0Pretty much the same. ",
            "\u00a0Well ",
            "\u00a0The class covered more than I expected, but made the material accessible. My expectation was to develop an understanding of tree growth. The class went far beyond this baseline objective. It provided a conceptual review of different plant survival strategies and growth mechanisms. It furthermore knit different concepts together, allowing us to consider discrete pieces of the plant-life puzzle while not losing site of the whole organism. ",
            "\u00a0This course exceeded my expectations. When I enrolled, I had no background in plant biology or physiology. Now I can critically read primary literature and explain concepts to others, such as why leaves change color at different times and how sap flows through trees. ",
            "\u00a0I expected to feel overwhelmed and behind during the entire course, but to come away with a better-than-superficial, but still pretty basic, understanding of how plants work. Professor Broderson and Kyra were so obliging and helpful that I feel I have come away with more knowledge, skills, and insights than anticipated. ",
            "\u00a0The skills and insights I gained were better than I expected. I first didn't expect to learn data analysis before I took the class. Then I realized that I learned to connect the knowledge from class to what I observe in my everyday life. The class also helps me answer some questions I always had about nature. "

            "\u00a0The last few week schedule is a bit rush. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Phenomenal discussion classes ",
            "\u00a0The class was great. Hard to identify a weakness! ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are engaging and cover material thoroughly and in an appropriate sequence. The primary literature readings are interesting and class discussion of them is well-structured and thought-provoking. I also enjoyed the assignments because they helped me tie together concepts and explore the material in new ways. My only suggestion would be to review basic plant morphology and development (especially reproductive anatomy) in the beginning of the course. ",
            "\u00a0One of the great strengths of this course is Professor Broderson's down-to-earth attitude and willingness to admit that there are still things that we don't know. He also encourages questions of any kind or level, and even entertained questions that came from other courses. He and Kyra were always very approachable.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I appreciated Professor Broderson's flexibility in changing the schedule as listed in the syllabus to better fit student needs.\r\n\r\nOne potential weakness of the class was a lack of flow in class lectures towards the end of the semester. After Thanksgiving break, the connections between lectures seemed to sort of disintegrate. I would recommend identifying units to help group these lectures, like: morphology; water; energy balance; adaptions to extreme environments, etc. ",
            "\u00a0The class covers some very interesting and important topics of plant physiology. It is very informative yet not overwhelming. The amount of the problem sets are reasonable, and each of them is interesting to answer. \r\n\r\nOne weakness is that the readings and the lectures were a bit disconnected. Although the lectures were very informative, the textbooks were a bit hard to understand. "

            "\u00a0It's a great introduction course for people interesting in tree ecophysiology. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take it! Craig is fantastic, the course material is super, and you will come out of the class inspired and in awe of plants! ",
            "\u00a0Plants are the building blocks of terrestrial ecosystems, so understanding them is essential to anyone interested in a career in conservation, forestry, or agriculture. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to anyone with a forestry focus. I would reassure a student who did not have a rigorous scientific background that the course is challenging but fun, and worth the effort. ",
            "\u00a0It's okay if you don't have any background with plants. You will learn a lot from this class. "
