            "\u00a0I learnt new grammar concepts and vocabulary, and developed my writing and speaking skills. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a great introduction to Arabic. Our assignments creatively employed the vocabulary and grammar we learned. I feel I can now hold a basic conversation with a native speaker. "

            "\u00a0Professor Al Ani makes an effort to engage everybody in class. She encouraged everyone to speak in class, which definitely helped my oral understanding of the language. I thought the final project was not the most instructive, but it was fun to do. Overall, I have no complaints with the course. ",
            "\u00a0This course is really well organized. There is plenty of individual attention and the lessons seem to build on each other from week to week. I think smaller classes or individual mandatory office hours would help to facilitate more speaking practice and conversation, in addition to the in class speaking that I found to be very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I think overall this is a very well balanced class and I was grateful to be able to take the class with Prof Sarab. ",
            "\u00a0This course is an adequate level of rigor for the subject matter. Having homework every day helped to exercise the learned grammar and vocabulary. We learned to apply the vocabulary to everyday conversation. "

            "\u00a0I would! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. It was very well-structured and helped improve my Arabic. ",
            "\u00a0I recommend this course to those hoping to continue the Arabic sequence in a low-pressure yet rigorous environment. Sarab is an excellent professor who cares about the growth of her students and creates a positive learning environment while providing honest feedback on their progress. "
