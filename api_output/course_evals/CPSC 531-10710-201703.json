Access to the studio was also great.\r\n\r\nIt's tricky because of the department, but I sometimes wished the instructor had brought more of his composer background to the lectures. I wanted to listen to more music in class and have it explained by an expert.\r\n\r\nThe algorithms were interesting, of course, but it wasn't an algorithms course and we didn't write any mathematics, so at times it just felt like a Wikipedia level introduction to, say, CFGs.
