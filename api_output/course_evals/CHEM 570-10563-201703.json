            "\u00a0I learned how to do many critical quantum chemistry derivations and how to apply their results. ",

            "\u00a0Very well taught, notes well organised ",
            "\u00a0Studied a lot of very useful knowledge of Quantum. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave a good introduction to quantum mechanics and provided the tools needed to tackle larger problems. In particular, the computational assignments were informative and useful. ",

            "\u00a0The notes are a bit too sparse. I appreciate that they try to cut back on the reading, but I think the brevity does not convey the information with the same conceptual framework. Also sometimes the mathematics is not fully explained which is challenging.\r\n\r\nIt could be improved by asking students to rework the notes so they are more helpful for future students. ",
            "\u00a0I liked how the class topics were largely directed by what the students were interested in. ",
            "\u00a0It could be improved with more overviews of topics covered, and more problem sets to get a better idea of the subject. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, the course was very interesting and useful. It was helpful that course notes were provided online. The computational assignments were interesting and useful. One suggestion for improvement is to provide more/longer exams. In comparison to Molrad which had 4 two-hour exams, this course had only 2 one-hour exams and a final which meant that each question was worth much more to the final grade. ",
            "\u00a0The course went at a great pace. Often long derivations cause people to get lost but there was always a feeling that students could stop and ask to go back if they got lost. \r\n\r\nThe course book was very helpful in the beginning but could use a little expansion after the first month's material to match with the detail given in lecture.Greater feedback on the exercises would be useful after turning them in.

            "\u00a0Yes ",
