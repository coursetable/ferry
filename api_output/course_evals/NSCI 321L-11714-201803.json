            "\u00a0The course was designed to develop electrophysiology skills, but I definitely came out still shaky on how to use the equipment and interpret the readings. The experiments only loosely reinforced course material. ",

        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The major weakness of this course was that the experiments were not attainable; often, no lab group was able to get valid data and the professor had to do the procedures for us. This made it so that we rarely completed a lab in its entirety, and when we did, it was only with copious amounts of help from supervisors.\r\n\r\nAside from this, we did not receive clear feedback on our assignments (no quizzes were ever returned, and we only submitted lab reports in groupings of 4, so a third of the semester had gone by before we even handed any of our work in). ",
            "\u00a0Great physical application and hands-on approach. Can sometimes get bogged down in time constraints and hard set-ups but this is understandable for a lab based on interacting with finicky set-ups and living organisms. ",
            "\u00a0The pacing of the class is sometimes strange - fast for a while, then very loose and slow for a couple hours, etc. But overall its a good class. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the lab and how much we were able to learn. My only minor concern is that we didnt receive many grades throughout the semester, but did receive clear feedback on lab notebooks. "

        [
            "\u00a0This course was not necessarily helpful in advancing my knowledge of neurobiology and was often frustrating in that the labs were next to impossible to obtain results from, but it was interesting conceptually. I would recommend it to neuroscience majors looking for a lab for the requirements, but it certainly would not appeal to anyone not already interested in examining an action potential every week. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are genuinely interested in neurobiology, especially animal models and electrophysiology "
