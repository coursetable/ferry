            "\u00a0I learned even more about life in South Africa as well as the language of isiZulu. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the grammar and vocabulary to talk about professions, locations, weather, clothing, colors, injuries/medicine, and so much more in a series of past, present, and future tenses. I also learned tons about South African culture/history. We listened to a lot of important South African music (e.g., Miriam Makeba or Hugh Masekela), read important articles about culture (e.g., \"Being Gay and Zulu\"), kept up to date with the news (e.g., Winnie Mandela and Jacob Zuma), gave presentations (e.g., one about leisure time in South Africa and another about the life of a South African student at Yale), rehearsed/performed a skit to a large audience (about professions/locations/jobs in South Africa), watched historically essential movies (e.g., \"In a Time of Violence\" and \"Shaka Zulu\"), and even had the privilege to attend an unforgettable Ladysmith Black Mambazo concert, in which we really got to engage with South African culture in person. Beyond all of that, Thisha allowed us to replace one of our classes with seeing a lecture by Dr. Simon Adams, the Executive Director of the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect (who's worked extensively in South Africa) another unforgettable experience.

            "\u00a0I liked how we really incorporated the current news and politics of South Africa in this class. We got the ability to learn a great deal about what its like to be a Soutj African. ",
            "\u00a0I truly think the strength of the course is Thisha herself (Professor Sanneh). She brings an unparalleled passion for teaching/learning to class every single day. She writes textbooks on learning Zulu, so her organization of different topics and how to sequence them for optimal learning is really unbelievable. I think the curriculum she's designed perfectly balances how much time we spend learning the essentials of writing/speaking Zulu and also understanding the culture/history of South Africa, which is equally if not more important in the modern day.

            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend this class to another person because it is insightful and you get to experience another culture to an extent. ",
            "\u00a0I would 300% recommend this course to another student. I can't imagine a better way to engage with such an important language and culture in such a small group with the potential for so much valuable and personal feedback. Zulu class was truly an amazing experience. "
