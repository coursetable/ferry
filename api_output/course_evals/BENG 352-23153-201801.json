            "\u00a0Great course overall! Learned quite a bit.\r\n\r\nSome of the homework questions are outdated and need to be fixed. Other than that, no real improvements. ",
            "\u00a0I think the material isn't hard, but it is pretty conceptually dense, so it requires clear and straightforward instruction. The lectures would give derivations of concepts and the problem sets would have us actually do the math, but most of the time it wasn't clear how to do the problems right off the bat because we didn't have enough information from our notes. I would have appreciated straightforward examples and an explanation of the thought process of approaching each kind of problem. ",
            "\u00a0Content is dry. Professors were unengaging. Overall, the class was uninteresting and the professors were poor. I think different professors would make it a lot better. If not that, then more examples of applications would be good or trying to make it more interesting in some way. ",
            "\u00a0strengths - interesting subject\r\nweaknesses - dry, Duncan and Staib have different teaching styles, homework is too easy compared to exams ",
            "\u00a0The material was taught by knowledgeable professors. the exams were fair and based upon the homework we completed throughout the semester. Notes were all posted online. So all the resources were set up to do well. ",
            "\u00a0I think having two professors was good in engaging with all of the information in depth. The TAs and their sections were also super important in understanding the material. I think a weakness in the class is that the depth to which topics are covered varies widely--some topics are skimmed over quickly, while others are taken in huge detail, without much meaning assigned to it or rhyme/reason to why some topics were emphasized more than others, beyond that they could be easily tested. ",
            "\u00a0This class was pretty badly run. Both professors were extremely kind but not very good at teaching. It was hard to stay engaged in lecture. Strengths were Prof. Staib's lecture slides and Prof. Duncan's sense of humor.  They were both very understanding, helpful, and approachable. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were availability of the TAs, clarity of materials presented and accessibility of resources to learn the material. It should be emphasized to students that it is really easy to fall behind though! ",
            "\u00a0I think the problem sets were very helpful to learning the material. I also appreciated that the midterm and final were open notes, so we didn't have to memorize any methods or equations. This made it easier to focus on how to apply the material from lecture to problems. ",
            "\u00a0The class was clear, and the course content was not too difficult. It would have been helpful to have a set of notes or book references compiled for Dr. Staib's lectures. Else, both instructors were great! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I appreciated the straightforwardness of the course. The lectures were relevant to the problem sets, and the professors clearly outlined their expectations for the exams (which are open note!) during their review sessions. It was also pretty cool to actually see the quantitative basis for many of the qualitative aspects of signals and images. Weaknesses: the material is somewhat dry, so I wish there had been more of an effort made to show the relevance to real-life applications beyond the simple examples worked out in class. "

            "\u00a0Yes. The exams are open note and fair (not necessarily easy) they ask you to apply the concepts that you learned in class but all the material on the exams has been gone over in class. Homework is also fair, but you need to know some matlab to do them. ",
            "\u00a0In all likelihood, all of those students reading this review have to take the course. It's definitely a manageable course, but some of the grading and communication regarding grades leaves a lot to be wanted. The material itself isn't too crazy difficult, if not always clear why it might be applicable to anyone who's not planning on going into bioimaging. Overall, it's a pretty good class in the major, although you might just have to swallow that it might not have huge bearing on what you want to do in the future. ",

            "\u00a0I would! After seeing that it was easy to fall behind, I began to engage with the material each day in class and it was actually very interesting. Make use of the TA sessions though! ",
            "\u00a0Most students taking this class are probably taking it because they have to. It's not too bad of a class, you start to have a better understanding of how signals can be convolved and manipulated. The problem sets are not too bad, there's about 9. The midterm and final are about 3-4 problems and they are open note exams. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would! it's a fun class, and allows you to learn some more of the \"engineering\" side of biomedical engineering. Glad to have learned a variety of topics from both professors, though the class would benefit from a little more structure. ",
            "\u00a0The class is fine I guess. If you're taking it, it's probably because you have to. The lectures can be pretty dull, and it can be frustrating because the lectures seem kind of disconnected from the homework and exam problems sometimes. ",

            "\u00a0You are probably taking as a requirement, it is a good course, although sometimes dry. Professors are really open to questions, make sure to approach them if needed! "
