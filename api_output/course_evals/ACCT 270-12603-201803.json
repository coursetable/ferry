            "\u00a0For an intro accounting course, the class was actually pretty difficult. Its probably not helpful since I can't exactly describe what it was, but I found the professor's method of teaching difficult to understand and it was very difficult to learn the concepts in class. I spent a lot of time outside of class trying to learn the material on my own (the book was much more helpful) through online sources and I spent a lot of time with other students working on the second problem set together. The second problem set took a significant amount of time to complete. ",
            "\u00a0The course requires that students spend a lot of time practicing outside of class and correcting their assignments to ensure that they are correctly learning the material. While I think this is a good way to gain understanding of the material, I think the class would have been helped in understanding the material a little better if the Professor dedicated one day of class to going through an problem from beginning to end. The video that was produced in the middle of the semester was so helpful because it slowly went  through each step. There were a few steps that I had been over looking that-had I had the video or class review earlier, I wouldn't have overlooked them. ",
            "\u00a0Rick did a great job of explaining the material. ",
            "\u00a0Strength:  Professor Antle provided us with a super-advanced and very helpful version of an excel worksheet we could use on our assignments that I will be sure to pull out if I ever have to do accounting again.  He was flexible with homework and provided us with every opportunity to do our best work and produce the best results we could! ",
            "\u00a0It's unfortunate that it meets on 8:45 at the SOM MW. If timing were any better, I'm sure class engagement would drastically improve, as the lectures are fine and Prof. Antle is engaging with his stories and passion. ",
            "\u00a0It's pretty solid. You can't get worse than a B+ so that's a great way of making this somewhat pre-professional class be less intimidating. Lectures were somewhat hit or miss, but toward the end it got really interesting. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are rather dry and the assignments are due before they are introduced in class. They can be redone on later dates, but it makes it difficult for the first time around when it's all new material. The skills this course gives are so practical, though, that makes it worthwhile. ",
            "\u00a0The existence of this class is a great strength - I am so happy Yale offers a class that teaches students a practical skill set that will be useful for whatever they do after graduation. I think Yale students have a hunger for more of these types of classes. Professor Antle is a FANTASTIC teacher - he makes this class accessible to anyone (no matter math or econ background) and is very accommodating/understanding of different students' learning needs. He cares a lot about this class and does his utmost to help students learn the material - even making custom videos for viewing online. I especially appreciate his willingness to help me access an individual QR tutor through the CTL, which made all the difference for me this semester. Also THANK GOODNESS for the option to have no in-class exams! \r\n\r\nIn terms of weaknesses, it was often hard for me to complete the homework because, in some cases, I really had no idea where to start. If there were more videos online to go along with these problems, to walk a student through doing the problem, I think that would be really helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Fantastic course for accounting. It was very well organized and the professor was great, extremely approachable, and had the sole goal of making sure everything we did and learned was for a purpose. Deadlines were very flexible. No weaknesses I can think of ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were super engaging but sometimes got off track. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are the online teaching material that Professor Antle presents to accompany his teaching. The major weakness is that it's taught so early at the School of Management. This is only compounded by the fact that Professor Antle is not the most engaging lecturer and accounting isn't the most engaging subject. ",

            "\u00a0I thought the course was taught in a way that allowed beginners to get up to speed with everyone who had had some experience with accounting before. The first few weeks we focused on time value of money which could probably have been condensed into fewer classes. I liked the way the class was graded, based on completion and effort. ",
            "\u00a0I think the class was very well run. More videos would be very helpful to be able to able to work through things on our own time. Also a video of the final. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very tailored to helping a liberal arts student learn practical accounting skills. The weakness is that there wasn't strong feedback from TAs with the grading which made it difficult to ensure that the material was being learned correctly. ",
            "\u00a0Great course, however, I wish there were a midterm or some other graded activity earlier in the course so that the final grade was not completely dependent on the final exam. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are its daily online problems, which helped to keep me on top of the material, its problem sets/exams, which were fair and never too burdensome, and its professor, who is very sensitive to the needs of his students.  The only weakness of the course is that it spends too little time covering the difficult topics presented in the last few weeks (accounting for accounts receivable, accounting for marketable securities, etc.). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: professor teaches well and covers nuances, goal of the class is very learning oriented which is nice\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: holy shit please don't make this a 8:45AM at SOM again, this really gets in the way of people enjoying this class. this class would be VASTLY improved and ratings would increase by not changing anything and moving it to a noon or afternoon time slot "

That being said, be prepared to spend a lot of time outside of class reading the book as well as other online material and videos to make sure you understand the material. Accounting itself is straightforward, but for some reason it never clicked in class. ",

            "\u00a0I learned the fundamentals of accounting. Specifically how to get in balance on excel.  Professor Antle provided us with a super-advanced and very helpful version of an excel worksheet we could use on our assignments that I will be sure to pull out if I ever have to do accounting again. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, if you're a future finance bro(/bra) or entrepreneur, you should know accounting basics. Since you literally cannot do worse than a B+ if you submit everything, it's quite a low risk, high reward class. (I've been told by a friend in the class that) You can full grades on the regular \"quizzes,\" which are online and open-book, even with partial and very incorrect completion. \r\n\r\nProfessor Antle is so knowledgeable about the area, and he works you through the process quite thoughtfully. By the end, I was able to go between the balance sheet, income statement, and statements of cash flows easily. \r\n\r\nBest of all, I successfully petitioned this class to count for Econ major credit. That, combined with the minimum grade of B+, lends it to be a particularly great class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you at all interested in things related to accounting--financial statements, valuation, time basis of accounting--then take it. It's one of the few courses that gave really practical skills, as opposed to majority being theoretical work. Keep in mind it does require you keep up the material (which can be difficult to do). ",
            "\u00a0If you're going to take an accounting class, THIS is the one to take. Professor Antle is awesome. He really cares about the learning of all his students and is quite accommodating. He makes the early class time well worth it. As a non-business/math/econ person, I found this class accessible and valuable. It feels good to learn a hard skill that will be useful for whatever you do after Yale. There are no in-class exams (unless you take the option in-class final to get above a B+) - just 2 psets, daily homework, and a take-home final. The way the grading is set up, it's a good option for Cr/D/F if you're averse to getting below an A. I'd highly recommend it to anyone - you will learn the basics of accounting! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, Rick was the bomb. Literally the worst grade you can get is a B+ which is huge. Well taught and I feel like I gained a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would- accounting basics are helpful for all to know. ",
            "\u00a0The course starts off with some basic Math and quickly accelerates to the small details of the GAAP- Generally Accepted Accounting Principle towards the end. I think being able to read financial statements is a good skill to have, though the course seems to have a much stronger focus on constructing the financial statement. For a majority of the students, this is a little overkilling unless you want to start a career of an accountant or auditor. ",
            "\u00a0Don't kid yourself, you will NOT wake up at 8:30am to go to an accounting class at the School of Management 2 times a week. You'll go strong for the first month, realize that you can succeed in class by just reading the posted lecture slides, and then stop going completely. But Professor Antle realizes this and structures the course around it! If you put in even a quarter of the effort of a regular Yale class, you'll do incredibly well in this class. The problem is that it's just sooooo hard to get yourself to put effort into this class because everything except the optional in-class final is graded for completion. If you do all the assignments and don't do the in-class final, you'll get a B+. If you do the in-class final, you can get higher than a B+. This is how easy the class is. There is no reason to not take it. ",
