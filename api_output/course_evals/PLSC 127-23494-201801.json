            "\u00a0I gained a very solid understanding of Russian Foreign Policy and common Russian themes/interests over time. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a great introduction to the history of Russian foreign policy and to contemporary Russian foreign policy, as well! Professor Graham is very knowledgeable about Russia, and he is very good a combining the historical issues with policy issues. ",
            "\u00a0The history of the foreign policy of Russia and its historical motivators. We considered historical outcomes from the Russian perspective and was able to analyze what made an event a success or failure. ",
            "\u00a0A comprehensive understanding of how Russian Foreign Policy has evolved over the past 300 years and how Moscow's modern policy decisions can be traced back to past decisions. ",
            "\u00a0A better understanding of historical Russian foreign policy and its driving forces. ",

            "\u00a0It's a great class with a lot of opportunities for debate. The readings sometimes aren't very interesting but the class is very good. ",
            "\u00a0At first, I was a bit skeptical about only focusing on cases rather than on the major, long-term developments in Russia. Graham, however, is an expert at integrating these long-term effects into each case, which I thought worked very well. I like that I was able to write memos instead of academic papers. It was a new challenge, and it helped me prepare for a career in policy. My only critique is that I wish I had received more feedback on my papers. ",
            "\u00a0Strength is that the class discussions are always exciting and vibrant. However, it would be great if we can get some guiding questions before discussion while we are reading the materials. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Graham struck a perfect balance between lecture and seminar discussion. He shared the perfect amount of his expertise and allowed students to contribute their own opinions. The weekly student \"briefing\" component was valuable as well. ",
            "\u00a0The course can become very repetitive and get bogged down in details without providing the big picture or connecting various lessons. ",
            "\u00a0Well-structured syllabus that really ties the course together, every lesson makes sense within the greater scheme ",
            "\u00a0Course delivers exactly what it promises in the description. I can only suggest two things that might be better balanced:\r\n\r\n-More focus on details from the readings rather than exercises of naming and ranking factors behind Russian thinking for actions. Those exercises are definitely useful and generate good debates, but sometimes I felt that we spent more time on them than was necessary, and missed out on some more detailed content.\r\n\r\n-More direct input from Professor Graham. Hearing from fellow students is great, but I often found myself wishing we could hear more from such an experienced expert in the field, even if that means we students got less time to discuss. The times Professor Graham did talk about his own personal knowledge of Russian thinking gave me some of the best insights of the class. "

            "\u00a0Yes. If you're interested in working in Russian-U.S. relations, this is the course for you. ",
            "\u00a0Take it! If you are a history major interested in policy, a plsc/glbl major interested in history, or just interested in Russia, this is the perfect course for you. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The class is a bit challenging but the material and content are worth the investment! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in the learning the history underpinning current Russian decision-making or Russia more broadly. Professor Graham is a true expert on the subject. ",
            "\u00a0Anyone who interested in studying Russia or foreign policy can get a lot out of this class, but those with just a general interest in taking the course as en elective would be better off in a course that focuses on broader history rather than case studies. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. ",
            "\u00a0This class is exactly what the description promises: a survey of historical Russian foreign policy cases. Discussions don't tend to go too far into the weeds (I wish they did more), so you can usually get away with a decent skim of the readings or even just a background knowledge of the cases if you've spent time looking at Russian history. As a result, it's not a very heavy workload. Paper assignments are pretty flexible and not too long. I don't think I walked away with a ton of incredibly profound insights into the subject matter, but that might be because Professor Graham tilts the class towards student discussion rather than sharing his own extensive experience. At the very least, I did get a much better understanding of the Russian point of view in these cases and I enjoyed class discussions. "
