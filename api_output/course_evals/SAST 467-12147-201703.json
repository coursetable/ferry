            "\u00a0This course enabled me to work extremely closely and thoroughly with materials including images and texts. I was then challenged to express my understandings through written work, class discussions, and presentations. The course material, presented through the lens of Buddhist religious studies, is applicable to many realms of my life. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing course ",
            "\u00a0This course exposed me to the study of the practice of seeing. It made me think more about how the things that we view are more than just stationary objects--they interact with the viewer, and they have agency in their own right. Himalayan Buddhist art and ritual practices provide a great lens through which to examine these aspects of visual culture, and I think I developed my analysis and \"seeing\" skills during the semester. "

            "\u00a0The course was very well structured in terms of its weekly plan. Each topic, supported by readings and classroom discussions and lectures, contributed to a broader understanding of visual culture and Himalayan Buddhism. I enjoyed classroom activities that required different levels of participation, from lectures to guided discussions. I also thought the courseload was sufficient to require active engagement and depth of inquiry. ",
            "\u00a0The course's greatest strength was the materials we examined and discussed--especially the Life of the Buddha murals that formed the basis for our final project. With the knowledgeable Prof. Quintman at the head, we looked deep into a set of murals from the Jonang Phuntsokling Monastery in Tibet, comparing side-by-side textual narrative to visual representations on an innovative computer program. Prof. Quintman let us do new and exciting work trusting that we would produce something of value. Our trip to the Beineke also coupled well with the rest of the course. \r\n\r\nI personally struggled to understand a lot of the theory presented around visual culture, so class presentations from other students about the readings were a great way to make the material more accessible for everyone (although some of the grad students' \"simplified\" explanations were still heavily jargonistic). "

            "\u00a0Absolutely incredible course. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend this course to students interested in religion, history, art, and world culture  which require deep inquiry. The course diverges from other classes at Yale in that the focus is on direct source materials such as images and religious objects, instead of secondary sources such as readings. Although readings constitute a large part of the coursework, in addition to projects and presentations, the emphasis is on direct perception of materials that represent a different worldview. The class was very engaging throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. To put it plainly, this is a cool area of study that looks at beautiful works and is taught by a knowledgeable and kind professor. Take it if you want to learn more about Buddhist art and ritual practice, even if you have no background! "
