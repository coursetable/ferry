            "\u00a0A lot of history about empires, how to think more critically about the world and history, and how to live a more aware life. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to improve my writing skills and how to write college-level analytical essays. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a great amount of writing skills from this course. I have always thought that my argumentative writing skills had needed improvement, and I truly believe that this course allowed me to better myself as a writer. ",
            "\u00a0My writing skills along with my time management improved significantly in my opinion. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the power dynamics associated with consumption, both metaphoric and literal. It helped me to make connections between past imperialism and the police brutality and race relations of today. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to be more open-minded and to question things in life that we often believe are set up to be a certain way. This class was very empowering and through the discussions, I learned so much from my peers' experiences and thoughts. ",
            "\u00a0I expected to improve my writing skills in this English 114 course, and I did feel improvement from the extensive and nuanced feedback the instructor, Anusha, gave and how accessible she was. What I didn't expect was how compelling all the readings and discussions were, and the sheer diversity of issues we covered in this class that was focused on empires' myriad ways of consumption over multiple facets of human lives. It is one of the more meaningful classes I have ever taken. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: This course is very engaging, and you walk away knowing more regardless of your knowledge base going in.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Could be slightly clearer about what you're learning from the title of the course? ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course is the seminar-style in which it was taught, which encouraged thoughtful discussions. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that the readings and essay prompts were very interesting and not only kept the class engaged, but also sparked great discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: will definitely help with your writing, regardless of year or level in writing ",
            "\u00a0The small class size was a huge strength of the course. It required everyone to be engaged with the material and come up with their own opinions and connections. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very helpful to students who are seeking to become better writers. This class allowed me to articulate my claims and arguments better as well as expand my views and be logical throughout my writing. ",
            "\u00a0I loved how what we learned in this class mattered in the real world and that we could carry the lessons with us outside of class. All the readings were thoroughly thought-provoking and impactful. The units logically connected together thematically, and it was great that we contextualized individual readings within the larger framework of \"Eating the Empire.\" One thing that could be improved, however, is how we did the peer revisions in class. The handout's, while useful as a guide, ended up impeding useful student feedback because it was so long and had so many components. "

            "\u00a0This course is more than just a writing course. The readings and the discussions in class will expand your perspective, and the professor is very open to new ideas. "
