            "\u00a0Basic geology knowledge. At best, this course was a higher level, more in depth version of your earth science class from middle school. Most important, I learned that taking a class because you think it will be a gut isn't worth it if you have no interest in the material whatsoever. ",
            "\u00a0I gained sort-of an overview of Earth's geologic history. I primarily learned that sometimes you take a bad course, and you need to stick with it until the end of the semester because you've missed the course drop deadline. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a very good overview of so many of Earth's processes and why things are like they are today on Earth. ",
            "\u00a0Literally everything about the earth. This course gives an overview of literally every earth system it possibly can and it is awesome. You will be able to talk about any earth system or debunk any family members claim that global warming doesnt exist at your next family party. ",

            "\u00a0I learned about all kinds of Earth systems, focusing on the rock cycle including tectonic plates and the three kinds of rocks, but extending to systems operating on the Earth's surface like water and air. There was also a section at the end about Earth history including anthropogenic changes and current trends. Overall I learned a LOT of information about the way the Earth works, everything from details like specifics of chemistry to broader concepts. ",
            "\u00a0This course did help me grasp basic facts about the earth that I didnt know previously. Its good to understand how the earth we live on works - also enlightening about climate change ",
            "\u00a0Even if I won't be able to recall many of the specific facts we learned (and I still couldn't tell you the difference between olivine and pyroxene), this class did give me a much more thorough understanding of how humans have affected the earth, which I think is essential for every member of society to have if we're to have any hope of saving our species or our planet.

            "\u00a0Weakness: The homework assignments were not very related to the tests and what we talked about in class, or the textbook. It would've been much better if we were assigned questions from the textbook, because that would help up prepare for the exams. Also, it was hard to be precise using Google Earth. I think the homework assignments should rely less on Google Earth, especially since we never ever talked about or used Google Earth in class.\r\nWeakness: Students should be allowed to see their quiz scores throughout the semester.\r\nWeakness: Too much class time was spent on quizzes.\r\nWeakness: I agree with the general consensus, that there is much to be improved with the quizzes.\r\nWeakness: Students should be able to see the current Dyne Cup standings throughout the semester.\r\nStrength: I liked the Dyne cup, but you should award points more often in class, because that is the most fun part. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Great, laid-back professor that makes lectures interesting\r\nWeaknesses: Pop quizzes force you to do the reading. The questions on the quizzes are very specific and focus on small details. Exams are graded harshly: it's hard to know how much stuff you have to write to earn full credit, and the graders may take credit away for nit-picky errors. ",
            "\u00a0Extremely thorough and comprehensive overview of geology. Thought it was great. But be warned it is not a gut. Daily quizzes - you need to do the readings - and high standards for the tests. Nevertheless I took it CreditDF and found it very enjoyable. Prof Evans is a gem and really funny. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were the lecturing and the course flow. It was the best lecturing I had at Yale and it was very entertaining. The Psets were at best tangentially related to the class and at worst impossible to figure out and played a large role in the grades. The quizzes did help ensure I did the reading some, but it felt like a cheap way to ding students grades because its hard to answer 8 specific questions right out of a 20+ page dense reading. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is probably realizing how much you learned afterwards. It puts humanity in the scope of things. and Like wow the earth is pretty cool. I learned about a lot of places/stuff Ive seen before. The weaknesses are the piece sets. Measuring things on google earth seems like busy work. The quizzes were annoying but were necessary to make sure you read I guess. Strengths are the professor and the engaging sort of class. I like being in the dyne groups too. Made geology friends that way. Also biggest weakness is how memorization based it is. It is total memorization. And it's A LOT to memorize. like wow. ",
            "\u00a0This course can be improved by better lectures and slides that help explain concepts in more detail as opposed to just copying what's in the textbook. ",
            "\u00a0I think the quizzes, which were very short and did not allow for mistakes (if you miss 2 on a 5 question quiz its an automatic 60), were not good indicators of who read and who didnt. ",
            "\u00a0There was too much unnecessary reading. There were too many pop quizzes. The exams were brutally unfair. David Evans didn't effectively teach the information during lecture. The TAs were not engaged in the material and were ineffective during office hours. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the earth is pretty cool so lectures were interesting.\r\nWeaknesses: the pop quizzes, textbook readings, and psets. The pop quizzes got increasingly harder and more nitpicking, and the psets felt useless - they took a long time but only because you just had click around on google earth forever. ",
            "\u00a0One of the biggest weaknesses were the \"hidden questions\" on exams. It wasn't enough to just answer the question on the page. You had to remember the \"hidden question\" written on the study guide. Usually these questions barely related to the information the exam asked for. The idea was that you were supposed to present extra information. However, he was very specific about the type of extra information. If you supplied extra information, but it didn't answer the stupid \"hidden question,\" you didn't get the points. It's a terrible system.\r\n\r\nAlso, there are many pop quizzes. The class starts off and the pop quizzes are fairly easy. As the semester continues, they get significantly harder (especially picking up in difficulty post-drop period). This was annoying. You also have no idea how you're doing on them, since he never posts the grades.\r\n\r\nThe strengths of this class were that it bound together the poor students taking it. I can't say I've never been closer to a group of people that I meet up with solely to gripe about a course. ",
            "\u00a0The TEAL classroom is a bit of an odd setting, but Professor Evans uses the classroom well in the sense that he uses all the TVs to project PPTs and the round tables we're divided at make for a more cohesive experience. The team set up was a fun way to get to know people, but I didn't feel as if readings always followed lecture since we'd only learn about one section of the larger chapter. Also the expectations for the exams are weird: either open-ended memorization or a scramble to draw everything relevant you know about a topic because the grading is very unclear as to what they are looking for for full points and they're often looking for something particular. My biggest issue with this is that I often felt as if I'd study the most important and emphasized concepts and they wouldn't be on the exam, since it's a random mix of questions. Many students also felt as if lecture didn't prepare us for the problem sets that took us forever, toying around with Google Earth. While the reading quizzes did force me to read more, I didn't feel as if they were very fair. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is by far Professor Evans. He is a fantastic and really brings the material to life. ",
            "\u00a0Readings for the final were way too much. Otherwise great! ",
            "\u00a0While I found this class engaging and the lectures were always well-taught and clear, I think we covered a bit too much information and moved at a rather fast pace for an intro level class. Coming in with no prior geology knowledge, I sometimes found it hard to keep up with the material and fully synthesize what I was learning. Furthermore, I think the quizzes were a bit unfairly hard and unnecessary -- despite completing all the readings and attempting to take detailed notes, I still found myself struggling to do well on the quizzes. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course were the depth and breadth of material covered, the teachers, and the general setup of the class. I felt that the structure was set up to make the vast amounts of information manageable. The pop quizzes were effective, I just wish I had realized the pattern earlier in the semester (I don't like that they're \"pop\" quizzes -- they should just be book chapter quizzes so there's no surprise element). I liked the Dyne Cup system also and I appreciated that it was extended to others when the team couldn't pull through. I think that made it easier for people to speak up in class which I liked. I also liked the balance of exams to homework to other work. The main weakness was that we never got feedback on the homework so I felt very in the dark about that. ",
            "\u00a0Tons of blind memorization is a weakness. You end up remembering a lot is a strength. ",
            "\u00a0Any competent instructor, at any level of education, would tell you that rote memorization is an ineffective way to master complex concepts. Based on the way he writes his tests, Professor Evans would likely argue against that until he was blue in the face. None of his tests actually evaluate whether students know and can apply the material, just how well they can memorize and regurgitate every piece of information that was mentioned about certain topics in lecture. The content we learned was, for the most part, very interesting, but that's where the enjoyable parts of this class ended. I thought I liked geology before taking this course, but now, I'm not so sure. "

            "\u00a0The course material is very interesting and doesn't get too deep into the specifics of geology, making it a good class for non-STEM majors. Be warned, this is not a gut, you will have to do the reading and study hard for exams. ",

            "\u00a0If you want to learn about geology, take this course. If you want a good science credit and are willing to work for it, take this course. If you are looking for a gut, do not take this course. The day to day workload in this course is incredibly high, and the midterms and finals require each student to learn a lot of information. Do not go in thinking this course will be easy. ",
            "\u00a0I actually would recommend this course! During it I'm like I wouldn't this is so much to memorize, but after, realizing how much it's like changed my perspective, I totally would take it. It is not a gut course contrary to popular belief. Especially if you read the textbook. You don't need to know any science prior to taking it but a slight knowledge of chemistry helps. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Evans is great! The class is great! Theres a fair amount of work but if you do it, its not hard to do well ",
            "\u00a0No.  If you're just doing it for a Science credit it's harder than it seems and there's a lot of reading. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely not. This is the worst course I've taken so far at Yale. Dr. Evans assigned far too much reading from a textbook that was anything but palatable. There was upwards of 100 pages a week of dense, dry geology textbook. As well, he expects you to internalize every single sentence of the book and gives \"pop quizzes\" EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. They do not test general understanding of the material. They ask niche questions (that aren't discussed in the reading at times) that require the level of analysis of the reading that a professional geologist could accomplish. The exams that he gives are equally, if not more so, unfair. He is kind enough to give you a study guide of all possible essay questions with his own responses, but appended to each response is a separate questions (only mildly related to the original question) that you must research on your own. These extra questions are nowhere in the reading or in his lectures and you need to research them on your own. Without responding to the extra question you will only get a 50% on the exam. Further, these extra questions are not explicitly asked on the exam. You need to memorize which extra question is associated with which essay question that he provides in addition to memorizing their answers nearly verbatim.\r\n\r\nAll of this is not to mention the fact that Dr. Evans doesn't care about his students. One week, we were given a midterm on Monday morning, had a pset due Monday night, and then were expected to read 40 pages for quiz on Wednesday morning. Even more, some of his quizzes have ambiguous answers, and Dr. Evans realizes that, but he picks the answer he likes best and refuses to give credit for anything else, even when proven wrong by the reading in the textbook. ",
            "\u00a0This class started off good, lectures were interesting and there wasnt a full chapter to read each night in the textbook. However, once the popquizes started to get harder and everyone started to get 2 out of 8s in them, it was much harder to enjoy the class. Also, sometimes wed have a pop quiz instead of learning the material for that day - I think it would have been more useful to start the lesson than to have a quiz. (Also these quizzes happened anytime we had reading so I wouldnt call them pop). The psets truly made me want to throw my computer against the wall - they were just hours of trying to find different measurements of formations on google earth. \r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, I did come into this class thinking it would be easier so that is probably most of my problem. The lectures and professor Evans are interesting, but if youre looking to easily fulfill your science credit, Id recommend something else. ",
            "\u00a0Never. This class was a nightmare. I've never been so close to dropping a class after the drop period has ended.\r\n\r\nOne of the things most of the class hated were the \"hidden questions\" on exams. It wasn't enough to just answer the question on the page. You had to remember the \"hidden question\" written on the study guide. Usually these questions barely related to the information the exam asked for. The idea was that you were supposed to present extra information. However, he was very specific about the type of extra information. If you supplied extra information, but it didn't answer the stupid \"hidden question,\" you didn't get the points. It's a terrible system.\r\n\r\nAlso, there are many insanely hard pop quizzes--a fact poorly advertised during shopping period. The class starts off and the pop quizzes are fairly easy. As the semester continues, they get significantly harder (especially picking up in difficulty post-drop period). This was annoying. You also have no idea how you're doing on them, since he never posts the grades. They also related very loosely to the actual material. Even if you read the chapter, it's not an indicator that you'll do well on the quiz.\r\n\r\nThe professor even acknowledged all of our concerns in a Canvas post after anonymous feedback was filed. Yes, he acknowledged them, and then told us why our feelings about how the class was being taught were wrong. It was unbelievable.\r\n\r\nI've never disliked a class more. ",
            "\u00a0If you're really interested in learning about the Earth or need a solid intro G&G course, yes! Otherwise, there are other sc credits I'd recommend. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! This is a phenomenal course and a great way to get a science credit if you are looking for one. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly a great class! Take it. I previously found earth history boring but after this class I found it very fascinating. You will have to learn a lot of terms (so memorization) but thats not too bad.\r\nA few tips for the student:\r\n-Do the readings on time. I can not emphasize this enough. Not just for the sake of acing the quizzes, but for the sake of exam prep. It makes exam prep so much easier if you do the readings. Maybe summarize the notes as you go (or buy a pdf version of the book so you can easily highlight) so you don't have to read through the chapters all over again when prepping for exams.\r\n-Get homework help from the TAs. They are super helpful.\r\n-dont save exam prep for the day before.\r\n-dont play yourself: this is not a gut class. You need to put in the work\r\n-win the Dyne Cup (Dr Evans will explain in class). ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to a student who is very interested in geology and looking for a relatively fast-paced, work intensive class. I would NOT recommend this class to anyone who is looking for a low-stakes, low-workload, easy way to fill their science requirement. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class. I have never learned so much in one class, and it was all interesting and useful. It covers a huge range of information, which can be challenging, because the expectations include broad concepts as well as specific details on basically all the topics, which is a lot. The trick with the pop quizzes is just to read every time there's a chapter assigned. Some of them will be hard even if you read, but most of them will be fine. They're not worth complaining about and the book is actually super helpful. Studying takes a long time because there are so many topics to cover, but if you carve out the time you can do it. The trick with studying is that a lot of the questions involve overlapping information, even if it doesn't seem like that right away. This is an incredible class. Professor Evans is passionate and knowledgeable, and please laugh at his dad jokes because they are great. I didn't take the lab but kind of wish I had. If I remember any of my classes at Yale, I want this to be it. Even though I majored in something else. It was so useful and helpful and even if I forget some details, it was so fascinating to learn about the planet we live on. ",
            "\u00a0Although there was not a lot of work for this, before the tests we were completely forced to blindly memorize the responses that Prof Evans wrote for us. It felt like even if concepts were explained correctly we would not receive full marks unless it was just regurgitating prof Evans answers. This is a poor way to take tests and actually learn so I would not recommend this class ",
            "\u00a0I might recommend this course to someone who is already completely confident that they were born to study geology, but for anyone with less of an interest in the subject than that, I'm not sure this class would be very enjoyable. "
