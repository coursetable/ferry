            "\u00a0This course was not what I expected. I expected it to give me hands on skills of how to actually define, create, and implement CR plans in businesses, but I did not get any of that from this course. Most of the lessons were just confusing scrawls on the whiteboard or disorganized slide presentations, full of acronyms, and very unclear. The assignments were all incredibly vague, and left us interpreting the assignment for 1.5 hours before beginning work on it. ",

            "\u00a0I learned about the various metrics and tools used by corporations to document ESG progress. ",
            "\u00a0I think what I took away most was how conducting materiality assessments (and the boundaries with which we draw them) is incredibly wishy-washy and stakeholder informed - which means that reporting that caters to stakeholers on material issues varies greatly from company to company. ",
            "\u00a0A solid introduction to corporate responsibility work. Very practical if you plan to work in this field. ",
            "\u00a0great overview of metrics needed in a CSR career ",
            "\u00a0Great overview of the metrics approaches and methods. I feel more confident about talking on multiple topics related to CSR metrics. ",
            "\u00a0I took home a big-picture understanding of: 1) Why a company chooses to evaluate certain metrics 2) Who it evaluates for 3) The process of declaring something material to a company 4) External standards for quality of evaluation 5) External standards for quality of progress in a given company. \r\n\r\nI also appreciated the case studies Todd offered to further our learning--reading real-life sustainability, ESG, and annual reports provided a level of comparison and understanding between companies.\r\n\r\nI left understanding what Todd means when he describes reporting as both an \"art\" and a \"science\"--there is a certain amount of subjectivity that goes into a company's choices on a given topic.

            "\u00a0I thought it would be a more hands-on class. For example, we discussed the materiality graph but none of the assignments were related to this. The same thing happened with the \"tornado chart\": we discussed it in class, but we did not have to do one by ourselves. Therefore, at this point, although I kind of know how these tools are created I do not believe that I could create it by myself because I never had the chance to practice it. "

            "\u00a0This course could benefit from much more organization during each lecture. In particular, lecture slides could be used to guide todd in his thinking and help us understand where he is going with his thoughts. It was very unclear what he wanted us to get out of each lecture. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting case studies, enjoyed the group work. \r\nWeaknesses: could have presented more in-class cases rather than dealing in theory. Wish the expectation/norm that readings were optional had not been set - lowered engagement with the class right from the start. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Cort is an engaging and organized lecturer and systematically breaks down corporate sustainability into distinct, cogent units. I also really appreciated him leveraging his professional connections to bring in practicioners to discuss how they are viewing sustainability today. The group assignments were well designed and Professor Cort always provided useful feedback on our deliverables. ",

            "\u00a0I believe it could be improved with A) aligning the Van Oord project with the client visit, and having some sort of toolkit that we build on and are forced to recall for assignments in a more structured way.  Todd also gives the most straightforward and timely feedback of any professor I've had. ",
            "\u00a0I found the projects to be quite interesting, loved the teamwork component.\r\nWished we could also review some of the case studies of corporate sustainability. The speaker from GE was amazing! ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated the hands-on evaluation of real companies. I also liked the day we played the board game--I thought that (quickly) showed how execs interact in the process of materiality assessments.\r\n\r\nIt would have been ideal for the Van Oord presenters to come later in the semester when we had more context, but I understand that their schedule was likely very busy. \r\n\r\nI would have liked Todd's honest opinion on companies to shine through more given his extensive experience (i.e. \"these are the companies that do it really well, and here are qualities of their reporting that are especially great, versus the companies that lack transparency or wash over details\"). Todd is funny and likeable and the best days were those when he had most fun as a professor and shared stories from hi s work. ",
