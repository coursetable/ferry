            "\u00a0This course created within me an understanding of Early Modern Europe History with connection to the Renaissance Art Movements, and the contemporary philosophies of the age. Additionally, a recurring theme was that of gender roles and gender fluidity in the era, in regards to what is typically seen as a heteronormative canon. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about the history of love poetry, from Petrarch on, and had practice writing sonnets, which I have never done before (especially paying attention to rhyme and form). I now have read many love poems from different poets and contexts, which has been interesting to learn about. ",
            "\u00a0I cannot extol this course enough. This seminar was consistently one of the best parts of my week throughout the entire semester. We read a broad range of Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and English love poetry. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a familiarity with Renaissance love poetry and improved my close reading skills. "

        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: WONDERFUL Conversation and reversal of commonly held beliefs of Renaissance and Early Modern European Poetics. Unlike other European Studies classes, this class felt like a balanced blend of many national traditions (Spain, Portugal, England, France, Italian City-States), rather then focusing heavily on only \"Italy and England.\"\r\nWeakness: Due to time constraints and the breadth of the material, some poems/poets received significantly less attention/discussion than the others. ",
            "\u00a0There are many strengths to this course - it is interactive as Professor Ramachandran includes students in discussions and is very receptive to students' thoughts. Professor Ramachandran also brought us to different places such as the YUAG and the Beinecke. I do think that having the course only once a week for 2 hours may not be the best set up for the class as we didn't get through much of the material and were pressed for time such that we had a lot of reading to do with very little time to do it - perhaps smaller chunks of reading over more classes would be a better structure for this class. ",
            "\u00a0This course literally has zero weaknesses. Also, I LOVED THE CREATIVE ASSIGNMENTS SO MUCH. Writing poems was surprisingly SO FUN. Also the final project was COMPLETELY AMAZING. We got to write our own 20 poems and compile them into an anthology organized around a central theme. SO COOL. "

            "\u00a0YES!!! Absolutely, this course was a wonderful starting point into both Rhetorical style of various languages and poetic nationalist traditions, but also a wonderful introduction to Comparative Literature as well. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student as I felt it was fun, interesting, and I had learned something new. ",
            "\u00a0Without a single reservation, I would recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0I LOVED this class!! The reading load was very reasonable and allowed time to read the poems closely, the creative assignments were really fun and helpful, and it's a testament to how engaging seminar was that the long, once-a-week seminar didn't feel too long. "
