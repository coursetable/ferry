            "\u00a0In the first 8 weeks, I gained a strong understanding of basic statistics. I learned how to apply different statistical tests to different types of data sets and evaluate statistical significance.

            "\u00a0Nothing needs to be changed - I thought the class was great. Lecture was very engaging, office hours were useful and the professor was willing to help with any queries. ",
            "\u00a0The first part of this course was very engaging and easy to understand, while the second part went into great depth and felt incredibly interesting and useful. In particular, I really liked reading actual literature in the second half of the course and thus applying what we had learned to real statistical analyses. Interestingly, the two halves of this course had very different levels of difficulty, which may make the adjustment hard for some students. ",
            "\u00a0This is a pretty good course, especially the first half. I think that all the second modules should be vetted to make sure that they represent an intellectually-consistent continuation of the first module. When I began to feel that the first module was almost irrelevant to the work we were doing in the 105 module, it felt sort of disjointed. ",
            "\u00a0For the first half of the semester, the course was well-taught, expectations were made clear, and many resources were provided to enhance student learning. There was little continuity between the two halves of the course, and the second half of the semester was very poorly-taught. ",
            "\u00a0The course does teach you a lot, and I think what we learned is very valuable for an aspiring doctor. In the first 8 weeks with JRS, the course moved very fast, and we covered all the basics quite efficiently. In the next 5 weeks, the course seemed somewhat disorganized, but it did move at a much more reasonable pace. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the first 8 weeks of lecture moved very quickly, but both the professor and the TAs were very helpful and accessible. Also, the homeworks and the sample exams were very indicative of the exams. \r\nWeaknesses:  this course covered a lot of content in a very short time span, so it felt like some topics were not really discussed in depth. For the S&DS 105 section, students were often unsure about which direction the class was headed or how they had been doing on homeworks since we did not get feedback until the end. ",
            "\u00a0I think overall, the course was very structured and easy to follow. I enjoyed the flexibility of the first half of the course, with lectures being recorded online. The powerpoints from the lecture in the second half were very comprehensive. In terms of weaknesses, I was hoping to get more timely feedback on homework from the second half of the course; before the final, I was not able to receive feedback on all reading assignments and concepts learned. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include the lectures by Professor Reuning-Scherer, who was clear and concise and entertaining. The exams and problem sets facilitated learning basic concepts well. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the class lacked structure in some ways. Because it was Skip's first year teaching the course it seemed as though he was creating it as it went, which sometime seemed unorganized, but towards the end started shaping up. I learned a lot and truly feel like I have a great understanding of RCTs thanks to this class!\r\n\r\nI did not receive any grades until after the final was due, which didn't allow me to correct mistakes and learn from them, which detracted from my experience in this class. I would have liked to know where I stood before after the final in terms of study questions. ",
            "\u00a0The first weeks with Johnathan are great. I think the medecine part needs some work (i.e be more dynamic). However, I did like learning about what makes  and breaks an RCT. ",
            "\u00a0Jonathan was the greatest strength of the class. The first part was a good foundation, and allowed better understanding during the second part. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated the organization of the course in which all students attended the large lecture for the beginning of the semester and then broke off into sections for the final five weeks, because both portions of the course were valuable to me in different ways. Through the lectures and problem sets, I quickly learned a lot about basic, useful statistical principles and practices. Then, in the portion of the semester taught by Professor Barbour, I learned a lot about the imperfect application of these principles and methods to real-life studies, especially within the realm of medicine. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot in this course and I found the medical aspect to be very interesting. I think the material I learned in this course will be useful in the future. I think sometimes lectures were a bit dry, but they were very informative and the topics were interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: JDRS is a fantastic professor and the first 8 weeks of this course was extremely well-organized. Good introduction, JDRS makes the class fun and interesting, and also live streams and records all of his lectures. Weakness: the latter 5 weeks of the course with Professor Russell-Barbour. Granted he admitted this was his first time teaching, but the 105 section was extremely disorganized. It took him a while to figure out what he wanted to do with the course, and even the TAs didn't know what was going on. Additionally, the material covered in the latter half was well beyond the intro-stats level. He sometimes assigned clinical papers that were 60 pages long and involved differential equations, and even tried to teach R (the programming language). Most of all, Barbour's lectures were dry and basically consisted of reading off blocks of text pasted onto ppt slides. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. R-S runs a very tight, clear course; you learn basic statistics and some of the underlying principles, and some understanding of how to use MINITAB. All of this is very helpful in stat literacy, and plus the classes are recorded which makes the occasionally fast pace of the class very digestible. However, I found that when the lecture course split into sections you can get landed with a prof who doesn't understand what level students are at or what he is really responsible for teaching them, which can waste 4 weeks of your time. ",
            "\u00a0Although the prof warned us that this class moves very quickly, I think it's a weakness of the course since it was difficult (for me, personally) to full absorb and understand all of the material immediately. The amount of topics and slides that we would go through in class in one sitting was crazy, but the professor let us out like 10-15 minutes early almost every time so that was very nice. The professor (RS) was very funny and was very engaging and tried to mix in some anecdotes, which made focusing better, but sometimes it seemed like he rushed over some topics. \r\n\r\nAnother weakness I would say would be that getting back exams and knowing where you stand in the class is difficult sometimes because sometimes I didn't get back my exam from my specific TA/grader until 2-3 classes after everyone else got back their exam. But in general, the TAs were very good and very helpful in understanding (Sara and Stephen for the second half, Gena for the first half). Another strength for the second half was the assignments which was like reading responses/study questions/analysis, which helped formulate thoughts and clear up any murkiness about the papers that we were assigned to read. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths I really liked the two-part course; first starting with general statistical analysis and then focusing more on a specific field of interest. Big strength was the Professor, JDRS, who really knows how to tackle teaching a big lecture. The assignments are fair and actually ensure that you understand the material. The strength of the 105 section was that the professor was very knowledgeable about clinical trials and had a lot of papers he wanted us to read. The homework assignments were very straightforward. Professor Barbour was very kind and accommodating to students, and I found him very understanding when it came to deadlines. Weaknesses  Professor Barbour's teaching style was a bit dry and a lot of students didn't pay much attention during class because the material just didn't keep their attention well. Additionally, the TAs didnt seem too engaged with the class and they said they got assigned to sections at random. ",
            "\u00a0The class with JRS was amazing. I loved his enthusiasm and style of teaching a lot. Absolutely no problems with it. When we broke into stat 105, it was a lot different and not as well run. We didnt get great feedback and the problem sets never really challenged us. ",
            "\u00a0The main weakness of the course was the lack of communication between the professor teaching the first half and the professors teaching the second half. Overall a great course but it could benefit from continuity. ",
            "\u00a0First half of the course was great, second half was interesting but information was presented poorly, lecturer basically just read off slides and it wasn't clear which information was relevant ",
            "\u00a0The first half of the course was really well organized, all the lectures were very engaging and organized. I also really enjoyed having the lectures live broadcast and recorded, so that I could keep up with the course at my own pace. However, I wish the second half sections were a little more uniform. I felt like I didn't end up learning as much (and as widely applicable knowledge, since RCT design is a very specific topic) in my section as peers in other sections did. "

            "\u00a0Pre-meds looking for a joke version of stats class, you'll get there if you get through the actually interesting and somewhat challenging first half of the course. The last five weeks are nothing, which is nice for your schedule but I think actually causes you to lose brain cells. You'll learn the basics of statistics, then subject yourself to a confused mess of a class which I assume has basically no curve, because, well, pre-meds. Never thought I'd say this, but I wish the second half would have been... harder? GAH that's painful to type, and yet it would have been much less a colossal waste of everyone's time if we'd, ya know, actually learned anything. Or gotten feedback before a month had passed. Or had assignments posted on time. Or had a professor who didn't interrupt himself every five seconds to brag about the things he's done or the places he's been. Idk. This class could have been much better. ",
            "\u00a0I would encourage STAT 100, the intro statistics beginnign half of hte course that is given to all sections because it teaches necessary statistics concepts in a clear way. I would not recommend STAT 105, because it felt more like regurgitation becuase of hte lecture setting. This sort of class would benefit students more as a small class of 10 or 12 students who can close-read journal articles together. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely - especially good for a QR credit! Just be willing to try and really get the hang of the first 8 weeks of class as it is important for when you break off into sections. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course series (S&DS 10X) to any student for whom an understanding of introductory statistics will be useful. I would further recommend S&DS 105 to those who are interested in medical research even beyond statistics, as we covered a lot of very interesting and useful information. ",
            "\u00a0I think this is a great way to learn statistics! If you have already taken AP Stats, then regardless of your score, I probably would say it's not worth your time. But if you're like me, a student who wants to know basic statistical theory as well as see how it's applied in a given field of interest, I highly recommend it. A good fourth or fifth class because the regularity of the assignments and the flexibility of the lecture style makes it easy to fit into a schedule of a few other classes. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Reuning-Scherer is great: as long as you can tolerate dad jokes, lecture is engaging and the material is explained clearly. Lectures are filmed, so it is easy to catch up if you have to miss a class. There are also a lot of resources (TAs, online textbooks) if you need extra help. HOWEVER, do NOT take medical statistics. If you are a pre-med, take the biology option. The medical section, at least this year, is badly taught and you get very little feedback. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to any premed. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this class is definitely a good introductory statistics class. We covered a lot of content very quickly, and the workload was not too bad. If you needed help on homeworks, the TAs were open to questions. Looking back, I do feel like I learned quite a bit in this class, but often I felt that we covered material so quickly that I did not retain it all. You might have to put in some extra effort to prepare for exams, but overall the course was low-stress. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in seeing how statistics are generally applied to randomized control trials in literature, I would recommend this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning basic statistics which is very useful. The first part of the course was more useful to me even for things like how to use statistics in lab reports for other classes. The second part (medicine section) was good in that it focused on recent published papers that are pertinent but the lectures were a bit monotonous and unclear/not concise. I had a hard time learning from the information presented. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that the material was incredibly interesting, so I would recommend this class to anyone considering medicine. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Definitely take this class! You learn a lot but its not information overload a really manageable. ",
            "\u00a0Decent intro course. Jonathan makes intro stat bearable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone interesting in learning about statistics! I think it is very useful knowledge to have and that this course does a very good job of teaching it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you are interested in statistics and learning more about medical studies. ",
            "\u00a0If Russell-Barbour is teaching the 105 sectionDO NOT take!!! Take 103 with professor JDRS insteador even 101! The 105 section with Barbour is poorly organized, and Barbour is also a poor lecturer. He assigns his own papers or other random papers he pulled off NEJM as reading material, and sometimes they are over 60 pages long and involve knowledge of graduate level statistics. It took him 2 weeks to figure what he wanted to do with the course and would often assign questions for the readings and then forget to send them. Lectures simply consisted of Barbour reading off the ppt that he copy and pasted chunks of text onto. ",
            "\u00a0Don't take S&DS105 with Barbour. In addition to being rambly and at times incoherent, he did not organize the course well, and seemed continually surprised that we didn't know advanced statistics, in spite of the fact that he was teaching INTRODUCTORY statistics. He spent most of the time talking about papers he had written and discussing their shortfalls or strengths, holding court in a way that did not seem relevant and was usually above our heads. I learned nothing from him, and I received feedback on psets only after I had submitted my final. ",
            "\u00a0i would recommend the class to another student but only if they're wiling to keep up and pay attention to the material or diligently watch the lectures online for the first half. In terms of the second (medicine) half, I would also recommend taking it only if Prof. Barbour tweaks the curriculum because it was his first time teaching so he only focused on RCTs for some reason, but I was looking forward to learning much more than that. He's a very nice, very chill person, and in general for both segments, there is one study question set/p-set a week, which is not difficult if you are able to go see a TA (they're all amazing). The exams are fair as well. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you dont know anything about statistics then this is a great, fast paced but also engaging statistics course. I took AP statistics and found this course to be not at all challenging with very generous grading. Theres no textbook required and its pretty low stress. The p sets arent too hard but they do take a good chunk of time, so its great to talk through the questions with friends in the class (theres no work or projects outside of the p sets). Class frequently ended 10 minutes early! ",
            "\u00a0Would highly recommend this class. It is super manageable and quite interesting. I would be careful which section you decide on though because 105 was run a bit poorly. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student especially if this person is interested in any kind of research. ",
            "\u00a0first half of the course was great, second half was interesting but information was presented poorly, lecturer basically just read off slides and it wasn't clear which information was relevant ",
            "\u00a0It is a great and easy to manage introduction to Statistics, and teaches you many of the important methods. If you want to really learn how to use SPSS you should be willing to put in the time yourself though. Also ask others who have taken the course before choosing a section since each section teaches something else and you should be choosing a section knowing what to expect. "
