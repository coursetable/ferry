            "\u00a0Learned how to identify about 100 tree/shrub species from around Connecticut. Learned the different environments in which the trees live. Learned what to look for while identifying trees. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n\r\nAlmost completely field based\r\nPick up very practical skills for field ID\r\nLots of fun facts\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n\r\nClass was probably a little bit too big\r\nThere were a bunch of readings that mostly didn't seem relevant or were covered in class--would've been helpful if that reading was cut down to the important stuff ",
            "\u00a0Such a strong course! Only suggestion for improvement would be that it would be great to be able to cover phylogenetics, taxonomics, and natural history a little more in some kind of interactive component other than the readings...not during field lectures, but maybe in some kind of short once-a-week or every-other-week mini-lecture/discussion group? Hmm. Anyway, every other element of this course is fantastic. Weekly trips, field trips, review sessions and walks were all info-packed and well-organized and beautiful. Weekly quizzes were really useful for drilling plant ID, and feedback was always quick, clear, and really helpful. Final project really allowed students to explore an element of dendrology/natural history that was interesting to them. "

            "\u00a0I'd recommend this course for anyone who wants the practical skill of tree identification in New England, and another way to enjoy / be in tune with nature. It's pretty much just memorization, so if you go to class and study for the weekly quizzes it's not difficult--it's always clear what you're supposed to know. ",
            "\u00a0Phenomenal course, would absolutely recommend. Marlyse is an incredible professor who knows her shit and is so passionate about it, and if you put in the work, she will put in the work too to help you. You will come away from this class with a better understanding of New England natural history, and be able to identify ~130 trees and shrubs to genus, family, and species in any season. "
