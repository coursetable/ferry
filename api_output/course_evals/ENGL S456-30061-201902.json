            "\u00a0I was taught various ways to interview people and get information from different sources. I learnt a lot about upholding the moral integrity of journalism as well. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about the processes of investigative journalism, gained experience conducting interviews, and using interviews to access information about people and organizations that is otherwise difficult to find. This course taught me a lot of journalism ethics, alternative ways of doing research, and how journalists work on their craft. "

            "\u00a0There could be more of a focus on the different styles of writing in investigative journalism and how to achieve them, as well as the appropriate context for each type. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of the course were interactive lectures, the types of assignments and the content of lectures. This course could be improved with more regular feedback, and by incorporating more smaller assignments, focused on a particular skill. Greater focus on writing style would have been helpful. "

            "\u00a0Yes. I think that this is a very interesting starter course to journalism. However, 5 weeks is still too short to really cover sufficient grounds of journalism. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The level of instruction in this course was high quality, the content was very interesting, and provided tremendous insight into the world of journalism. "
