            "\u00a0The labs are really interesting. ",
            "\u00a0The course is pretty boring. The lectures ramble on without saying much about each of the cultures. If the course needs to cover each civilization in one or two class periods, it should focus in on one aspect of the culture instead of trying to give a brief overview of everything we know about it. Use each culture as a case study on a specific topic instead of just summarizing them. \r\nI really enjoyed the labs, although I think more class time should be spent on learning the techniques necessary to complete them. For example, some background on bones (more than the short video of an expert classifying animals assigned) would have been helpful when completing the bone lab, which I felt vastly underprepared for. ",
            "\u00a0The courses were interesting but at times could have been more engaging. The information as a whole is pretty interesting anyways, though. Jargal is a great professor, and Kefs (the TA) was also helpful. ",

            "\u00a0I thought one strength of this course was the labs done in conjunction with the Peabody Museum.  It really helped to be able to see artifacts up close and personal, and it was very nice to work with them.  No major weaknesses of this course in my opinion! ",
            "\u00a0Easy class with interesting info. ",
            "\u00a0The course was fairly engaging, but the lecture slides can be sometimes confusing. The readings are informative but can be a little dense. Class needs a better way of enforcing attendance or at least grading attendance. ",
            "\u00a0This class was pretty engaging and pretty interesting subject matter. Its a very low workload, so its a great fifth class. Interesting, not stressful, and the Professor is very empassioned about what he does, which makes it more exciting for students. The labs are also pretty cool because you get to handle real artifacts. Everyone should keep in mind though that its an overview of thousands of years worth of history so you dont go very much in depth. ",

The labs are a good idea, but need to be integrated with the course better. Most of the students were not engaged at all, making class time boring. The readings were basically the same as the lectures, so there was no need to both read and go to class. ",

For someone who is interested in anthropology or archaeology, I would not recommend this course because, while interesting, it does not develop skills or knowledge necessary for these majors. If you are not considering these majors but are interested in the subject matter, it is great. ",
