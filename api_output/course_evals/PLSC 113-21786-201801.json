I realized that there was much more than on the surface and that there is truly a balance in our government. I respect our political system more and definitely got a good introduction about basic political theory from reading Downs, etc. and a few major political science papers.

Professor Huber does a very good job of making sure that American history is focused primarily on understanding the political environment of today. Throughout the course, you will learn how about the evolution and development of political institutions (why they changed, should they have changed, how change relates to the constitution, etc). ",

            "\u00a0The course is quite comprehensive in reviewing the role of many government and non-government actors in the development of policy. Due to all the material covered, it can be superficial in some portions. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course are that Professor Huber is an incredibly interesting lecturer, the material provided is interesting and informative, and the course doesn't feel too much like an intro course--we dived deep into topics which I really appreciated. The readings are sometimes a little dry, though, (especially towards the beginning of the course) so maybe switching them up or mixing them with some more engaging pieces would be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that the lectures were very engaging, but it was a lot of information in a short amount of time. Concepts could have been explained more clearly. ",
            "\u00a0Wish the Professor would be able to post lectures on slides; had to miss class a few times. Overall interesting topic. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were very engaging and the material was very interesting. The course was a bit heavy on reading, but had relatively little work outside of reading. One paper, one midterm, and one final. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the material was well-taught and the reading load was manageable. Grading was extremely fair and made me want to do work/succeed in this class. Some of the readings were a little too technical; I can't remember exact examples right now, but the TA's definitely know which readings. They didn't detract from this course at all though. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures are very interesting- Prof Huber is interesting, intelligent, and a great lecturer. It is interesting and though provoking. There can be a lot of reading but overall it supplements learning. ",
            "\u00a0The topics were cool, the readings were interesting, but for some reason things seemed too abstract. Things didn't stick. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Huber promised in the first week that the class would not be like a high school american government class and he would try to focus on the political science part of it, and he delivered. It was interesting learning about theoretical models and reading real political science studies. However, I do feel that the class spent a lot of time on the founding of the Constitution and that rather than being covered in 4 weeks, it couldve been done in 1 or 2. ",
            "\u00a0The readings where at times very difficult to understand and there is little no help in understanding them. The weekly quizzes are designed to be very easy, but, in reality, they are often very difficult even if you did the readings for class. ",
            "\u00a0really reaaly good ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were always very engaging and the readings were interesting and thorough. I thought the course covered a wide variety of topics, but didn't always cover them as deeply as I would have liked. I was hoping to learn more specific information, and the course was often very general. ",
            "\u00a0This course was strong in that the professor related ideas in the class to current news. This helped me better understand how to interpret the chaos in today's political world. It could be improved by allowing students to discuss their papers with each other in section. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: lectures were incredible. Prof. Huber does a stellar job conveying information succinctly and keeping it engaging.\r\nWeaknesses: sections tended to feel superfluous. Quizzes were sometimes unreasonably hard, and felt like they didn't assess whether I did the reading accurately. The quiz system also rewards procrastinating, because they tended to favor recall of relatively arbitrary information rather than the general purpose of the reading as a whole. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: gut. Midterm and final are both open note, open book\r\nWeaknesses: boring bc its a gut. Also too much work, felt like a high school course. Readings are boring but there are pop quizzes so you have to do them ",
            "\u00a0Weakness was that there was too much reading and sometimes the quizzes were not even fully reflective of the reading. Strength was that the quizzes were expected to be every Thursday which provided some consistency. ",
            "\u00a0The course is split up into different topics per lecture: for example, Media for one, Congress and committees for another two lectures, and the judicial system for another lecture. This is good because it allows students to take in the lecture information and then engage with it further in discussion section once a week. \r\nA weakness is it doesn't allow for much depth in the lectures, however this is a given since it is a introductory lecture course. In fact, I'd rather have breadth than depth in a course like this. ",
            "\u00a0Quizzes at begin of each class is a great way to keep the students engaged, doing the readings, and coming to class. Not too much impact on your grade, but enough for you to care, and not very hard to get 100% on every one as long as you pay attention. Also, the exams and papers are very fair and quite interesting. ",
            "\u00a0It felt like the class was meant to teach the TFs how to teach instead of teaching us the information. Overall very good though ",
            "\u00a0The course I dont think was a great in its evaluations of grading student papers or the midterm. It was claimed by my TF that the course wasnt meant to bring down your grade or make it hard for you to get a good grade, yet the rubrics for grading in my opinion were intense and asked for more than you would think it would according to that claim. I was even told that if my TF took the exam, they wouldnt have done well. Because of that, it was hard to enjoy or really learn from the class because I was instead focusing on the letter grade. Also I feel like the course, although it was an introductory course, did not focus on a lot of important issues of American politics. For example, slavery was swiftly discussed and other issues like minorities, race, etc werent very much mentioned. Additionally, it was hard to focus on the material when there were at times many readings assigned for one day or even week because I found myself trying to focus on what they said for he quizzes instead of actually reading it for my interest and understanding. A strength was that the class was clearly divided so you knew where it was going and it almost had a circular track. ",
            "\u00a0Very much a bona fide political science course. Logical and empirical in nature without being grounded in mathematical manipulations. ",
            "\u00a0Lecture notes could be a little more clear, sometimes the notes we would write down I would not remember any context to which Professor Huber was speaking about ",
            "\u00a0I think that the professor should give quizzes on Tuesdays, rather than Thursdays. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course is overall well-taught, but I think the lectures could be made slightly more interesting or engaging. I think part of the problem is there is almost too much time spent on explaining things that seem kind of intuitive. I also think perhaps there could be even more application to current events. ",
            "\u00a0Good readings ",
            "\u00a0Not an introductory course. ",
            "\u00a0The readings were well connected to lecture, the quizzes and section discussion helped extract important elements. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Huber is a pretty engaging lecturer and is definitely receptive to suggestions for improvement and any student remarks. However, section could have been more engaging or thought-provoking--there were a lot of awkward silences. The class was organized as a whole, but I wish the TAs could have emphasized the main concepts and ideas a little more--sometimes the lectures covered so much detail and extraneous information that the most significant theories were diluted in importance. ",
            "\u00a0This course is definitely not worth taking. It is a class that brings unnecessary stress. The quizzes on the readings were  meant to be easy and not stressful but many times they were about picky things in the readings so even if you read, you might miss a few. The TAs were harsh graders (I had professors who were better graders) and definitely not very good at their jobs. ",

            "\u00a0Good basic intro to key themes. A little too much reading. ",
            "\u00a0One strength of the class involved the Professor Huber's lectures and the obvious expertise he has in this field. The lectures were super interesting and they would always spark revelations in the minds of the students. Another strength of the class was the research papers we were required to read for the class. It was nice to see the research that had been conducted in the field and its effect on how we view the government and its processes. I also really liked the choice between writing a final paper or taking the final exam. ",
            "\u00a0reading was often a little dense, opinion articles may have brought a new interesting angle to our discussions (this was great the few times we did ti in section) ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this course. ",
