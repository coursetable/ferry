            "\u00a0I learned about the different theories behind art history and ways to apply them to my own writing. However, the best thing about this class was learning to challenge these ideas with new concepts that better apply to art today. I think that it taught me the different sides to art history that I didn't know about before. ",
            "\u00a0This class is an absolute waste of time and should not be a requirement for the History of Art major. ",
            "\u00a0You learn the different schools and movements within art history and how they connect to and inform each other. The writing assignments are nice because you can develop short pieces within each area of art history and see how each informs your writing. ",
            "\u00a0The course greatly broadens the scope of the art historical field, and its permeation of much of society, culture, and politics. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a much deeper knowledge about the history of art history, its methods, implications, and various sociopolitical challenges to the discipline. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the history of art history, the different theories and methodologies, and all of the famous art historians. It was incredibly educational and a formative experience. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the different schools of thought within the discipline of art history and how these have evolved over time. Moreover, the seminar format of the course allowed me to gain confidence in speaking in class - a skill I found hard to cultivate in other courses. ",
            "\u00a0The fundamentals of the History of History of Art. Very useful body of information. "

            "\u00a0I think it was important for all of us to do a presentation and lead the discussion. It felt like that was an important way for us to think about the material. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Good overview of art historical theory and practice \r\nWeaknesses: More scholars of color on the syllabus! Especially from Indigenous voices. Also could benefit from some readings on material culture. ",
            "\u00a0The course is a kind-of cookie cutter, but I guess it should be for its use in the major. ",
            "\u00a0The course was great the way it was. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: topics covered, critical eye to tradition and canons, intersectionality of said critical perspective.  Weaknesses: writing a short paper every week discouraged me from really engaging with the subjects--I felt proud of very few of those writing exercises.  That being said, it was a more manageable workload to just have to write two pages per week instead of four pages every other week. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course  are definitely the varied syllabus and structure of assignments that stress the application of the readings to observed artworks. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the class is shaped significantly by the teacher and other students in the class- which is probably its biggest weakness if you do not enjoy that specific teachers style. "

            "\u00a0You have to take this course if you are an art history major but take it with Kishwar who knows how to make it challenging in the right way! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely not, don't take it unless you have to. ",
            "\u00a0For non art history majors I would recommend this course to people who are interested in understanding how images have functioned throughout history and informed cultural development. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course.  There is a good amount of reading to be done for the class, but each will enrich your experience. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend taking this course with Prof. Rizvi.  It's required for art history majors, so everyone in the class is already quite knowledgeable about art and comfortable writing.  We wrote a short two page paper every week (graded fairly, even generously), and class discussion was always fruitful.  It's a great overview of the history of art history as a discipline, and is invaluable for majors.  Placing your scholarly work in a deeper context of your discipline is surprisingly helpful, and the scope of authors we read was also great for broad exposure to the myriad areas of the discipline. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! I dont think Ive heard of anyone taking it outside the major. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to any other history of art major because it truly puts the academic discipline into perspective. ",
            "\u00a0It is a required course so take it for that reason- otherwise I would read the main book (Hatt and Klonk) but do another course. "
