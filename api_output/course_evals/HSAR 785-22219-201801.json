            "\u00a0I gained a greater understanding of theories of cross-cultural exchange, the history of biennial exhibitions, and debates surrounding the 'contemporary' in contemporary art. ",
            "\u00a0I liked that the course was organized with particular exhibitions in mind because it asked me to think critically about museum exhibition practice, with an emphasis on thinking about groups of works, and the various ways (cultural, geopolitical) to write institutional histories. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave a rich overview of interactions between European modernism and art of Africa and the African diaspora in the 20th century, in terms of exhibitions, theory, and art objects. It provided fascinating and invaluable alternatives to the dominant narratives of Western modernism. "
