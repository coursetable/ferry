            "\u00a0A thorough knowledge of later Roman history, and particularly its relationship to religious history. ",
            "\u00a0I learned an incredible amount about the political, cultural and social history of the Late Antique World, as well as how to engage with primary sources. ",
            "\u00a0Great summary history class of the period from Constantine to Muhammad ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about a period of history that was previously very obscure to me. The class helped me understand trends in the Late Antique World and understand aspects of that period of history through examination of precedent from the rest of the Classical world. It helped me understand the origins of many institutions that have come to define Europe and the rest of the world even today. ",
            "\u00a0This was the first history course that I've taken at Yale and if truly improved my writing skills. Chewy' feedback to my papers was very helpful and I learned so much about this time period in history. ",
            "\u00a0I certainly learned to develop my arguments more clearly. I think I also learned how to think analytically about a period of time that I dont have an expertise in. My writing also certainly improved ",
            "\u00a0This class was great because I feel like I really got a comprehensive view of the time period we focused on. many different historical aspects of the period were covered in the class, and I feel like I know much more about the general trends and specific events of the time period. In addition, I learned useful approaches for reading and analyzing primary sources. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a ton about the political, cultural, military, economic, and religious history of the late antique period from early fourth century all the way to the seventh century. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about an interesting period of history and developed my ability to use primary sources. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about late antiquity and the fate of the Roman/Byzantine Empire from the 3rd century onwards. I'd known nothing about the topic before, and I'm really glad I do now, because it's a really fascinating period of time. Further, I learned how to develop a clear historical thesis and to make a concise argument for it using primary and secondary sources, which will definitely be a useful skill in the future. ",
            "\u00a0Learned everything about Roman history from 300-650 ad. ",
            "\u00a0Although I came into this course with significant exposure to the early history of Christianity and to the end of the Western Roman Empire, I learned a lot in this course both about some of the characters involved in those processes and about the different perspectives from which to analyze the phenomena. For example, the ethnic identity element of eastern Christian schisms was not something I had every been taught about in class. Additionally, I knew almost nothing about the transition from Byzantine to Muslim rule or about the relationships between Rome and Sassanid Persia, and I feel much better informed about those topics having taken this course. ",
            "\u00a0Remarkable class that covers not only the Late Roman Empire but also topics such as the emergence of religions, plagues, architecture and art, legal systems, sexuality, philosophy and education. The class effectively gives a full picture of the time from the first century until the Muslim expansions in the 7th century. "

            "\u00a0Professor Lenski is great. The course is really structured, which helps facilitate learning especially at the beginning of the course. Sometimes the structure can stifle opportunities for really in-depth discussion sections. ",
            "\u00a0Primary source readings with specific pages to readI felt some of the primary source readings were unnecessarily long, and this prevented us from engaging with the texts on a deeper level ",
            "\u00a0The course was excellent in describing patterns of decline and development in the Late Antique World, and contained a substantial amount of specific information on events and occurrences throughout the historical period. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very well organized and both Chewy and Dr. Lenski have clearly put in a lot of work into it and it shows. The material is inherently very interesting and was very well taught. ",
            "\u00a0This course is really well organized and I think the course work load is a lot but manageable. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course include good organization and availability of lecture material, interesting lectures, and good course reading material. Weaknesses were that primary source readings could occasionally be too long and confusing (when we were only really focusing on short sections of the sources), but overall the course was great. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoy how the course is structured. The first half is organized chronologically; the second half is grouped under themes. in this way, my previous knowledge got strengthened repeatedly, with new information supplementing the old information. ",
            "\u00a0This course was excellently taught. ",
            "\u00a0I thought it was an incredibly strong course already. Keep it up! ",
            "\u00a0Very in-depth and interesting. I cannot think of any weaknesses ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were, especially, first the organization of the course: having the historical trajectory mapped out at the beginning made the topical focuses of later on much easier to follow. Secondly, I think the discussion sections (although I understand that TF evaluations are for below) were well conceived and organized; the contrasts and primary sources that we read for some of the sections were not topics or authors to which I would be exposed elsewhere and they helped make historical developments more memorable and clear. It's hard to tell at this point without going back through all of the slides, but at a few points in the course I got the sense that information was being repeated, especially about religious figures and religions. Perhaps this was intentional in order to highlight certain points, or it may just be a result of certain figures' being relevant in multiple contexts. ",
            "\u00a0The class is extremely interesting as it covers a wide range of topics which helps give a complete picture of the period. I honestly can't think about a weakness of this course that is worth mentioning. "

            "\u00a0Definitely. Professor Lenski was great, the material is very interesting, and TF Chewy was also great. ",
            "\u00a0Course is a wonderful example of how great Yale's history department is. If you are interested in studying history, this course would be a great one with which to start or end. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this class! It's such original subject matter and Professor Lenski was incredible. You will get out what you put in in terms of the primary source readings for section - some of which I found hard to read -- but lecture was always engaging and fun to attend! ",
            "\u00a0YES! Professor Lenski is a fantastic lecturer who cares deeply about the subject matter. ",
            "\u00a0i would certainly recommend this course to any Yale student. I began it not knowing what to expect, but it quickly became one of my favorite courses taken during my time here. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This was a great course! ",

            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to others. However, be prepared for above average amounts of readings per week. Even though there is a greater amount of it, the course material is very interesting for the most part, and lectures are clear and easily accessible online. Professor Lenski is very knowledgeable and helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I would recommend it to anyone, regardless of the major. This is a fascinating period. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Take it. ",
            "\u00a0TAKE THIS CLASS! This was my first classics class - I shopped it on a whim, and I'm so glad I did. You'll learn so much about the later stages of the Roman Empire and the political, economic, religious, and social forces of the time. You'll also get to visit the numismatics room at the YUAG and look at really old coins, which is incredibly cool. The workload is super doable, and spaced out well enough so that it's okay if you mess up on any one piece of it - two papers, a one-page museum writeup, a map quiz, and a midterm + final. Professor Lenski is an incredibly invested teacher who cares about each of his students, and there's so much you can learn from him. ",

            "\u00a0Absolutely ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course as an excellent history lecture. The scope of the course is unique and the workload manageable and organized. Although there was a lot of reading at times, the main texts for the class were enjoyable and very well tailored to the subject of the week. It was not terribly demanding in terms of writing, and the examinations were relatively easy to prepare for. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class, professor Lenski is phenomenal and the way he organized the class is fantastic. Must take history class! "
