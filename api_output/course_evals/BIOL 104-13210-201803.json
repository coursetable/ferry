In all frankness (which even Professor Near himself admits), intro evolutionary biology is all about big picture ideas and history, so it is difficult to walk out of class feeling like I learned skills of substance. But, I found through reading papers for section that in fact, these themes carry a lot of weight when I am thinking about clades of species. If you are a bio major or premed you are likely taking this class out of necessity because you already took BIOL 101-103 and it's way too late to skip out; if you're pure EEB grad school don't take this class / take the legit intro EEB course, but if you're going to be in BIOL 104 because you have to, this may feel useless at first, but it's still important to understanding how extant species came to be (and at least this module is the least painful out of the four intro modules, unlike BIOL 103).

I wish that we had more time to think about evolution and postulate hypotheses like BIOL 103 was set up to do, since exams feel like we're just spitting out what we heard Professor Near say during lecture onto a piece of paper.

No weekly quizzes, but rather a midterm and a final that is non-cumulative. \r\nWeaknesses: A lot of details from phylogenetic history have to be studied and learned for the exams; the papers selected for the class were relevant but not as interesting/engaging as some other papers we have read in the BIOL sequence.

I often found the content pretty interesting even though I am not super interested in ecological science. However, studying for the course always feels like a slog because of its memorization heavy nature. The tests contain little critical thinking when compared to other sections of the biology modules and especially when compared to classes like biochemistry, where there is an equal amount of memorization but more critical thinking involved. As a result, I don't feel like I got much out of this class. Of course, this is likely due to the nature of learning ecological science, but I wish more critical thinking could be injected into the course somehow. ",

While it was cool to memorize the phylogenetic relationships between major groups of animals, I don't really see the purpose of phylogeny and evolutionary biology in the way that it was taught in the class. Like okay we argue that sponges or ctenophores are the sister lineage to animals... and so. literally okay, and now what... Maybe the class should have more emphasis on the significance of the material. I think the lecture slides were actually pretty good. They contained all the information that we needed to know for the final. I think a strength is that this course is highly memorization based. Another strength is that the class is not curved, so there is no competition! That's awesome. Very rare to see a bio class that is not curved. The writing assignments were a good grade boost I think. And it was fun. Otherwise, this class was unfortunately something I just tuned out of and didn't really care about. Just another thing to get through, to be honest. ",

The only thing is that many of the topics covered in this course didn't seem extremely relevant or connect to the other modules. The lecture slides were often long and little disorganized which made it difficult to study from, but I liked that there were posted on Canvas before then so students can download/print them before class.

It was a lot more interesting and required less memorizing of tiny molecules and pathways and lab tests. Professor Near was a good lecturer, and the homework assignments felt much more relevant to the course material. There was a lot of info thrown at us, and I stand by my belief that the weekly quizzes of 101 an 103 are better than the 102 and 104 midterms for retaining material and not needing to cram way at the end. But overall it was a good course, and even the section papers were interesting. ",

One of the weaknesses is the amount of material packed in each lecture which makes it hard to absorb everything being taught. ",

I think the foundational work of the first half of the course  eg teaching us how to build phylogenies and understand contributing factors of evolution  was particularly strong. I also loved the field trips to the Peabody; getting to see this type of work in action was cool and inspiring.\r\nWeaknesses  Itd be nice to see an example of the writing assignment; I feel like I caused myself a lot of stress over things that werent ultimately that important. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are that it is organized well for student learning; the midterm and final helped students to consolidate information (as opposed to having weekly quizzes). Discussion sections were also very helpful. It could be improved with study guides / outlines for students to follow through each lecture. ",

            "\u00a0I think the strength of the course is the lecture and how slides and notes were organized.\r\n\r\nI think the weakness of the course was how discussion sections are organized. I think it's great for discussion sections to be journal clubs that focus on new papers and concepts, but it's also very useful if they focus on reinforcing concepts covered in lecture. I also think more regular assessments (weekly ungraded questions?) would have helped students get a sense of what they do and don't know. ",
            "\u00a0The course material was very fact-oriented. Not much application of concepts, more memorization. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of the course were certainly the engaging and intriguing lectures presented by Professor Near. The course does a good job covering highlights within the rich history of animal evolution. Each lecture provided cutting, insightful new information that sometimes challenged ideas you had about the living world around us. The only weaknesses are slight: the course moves at a fast pace and the material is sometimes challenging because it is purely memorization-based. ",
            "\u00a0This course could be improved if it were more focused on concepts rather than details. ",
            "\u00a0slides could be more clear ",
            "\u00a0The homework for this class focuses exclusively on evolution. I think it would be cool if for the final paper students get the option to write about a topic in either evolution OR ecology. ",
            "\u00a0The professor was very engaging and the material was easy to follow. There were no weaknesses of this course. ",
            "\u00a0This course has very interesting material. However, it has the same flaws of all the introductory biology courses: it is too short and thus assessment tends to be simply about memorizing complex examples that are not that useful. As with all the introductory biology courses, these problems would be solved by having this course be a whole semester. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The lecture itself was engaging and Professor Near was a great lecturer\r\nWeakness: Sometimes there were a lot of topics covered in one lecture and not enough time to go over every concept thoroughly. ",
            "\u00a0The teacher is very passionate about the subject, but it lies on you to memorize the information for the tests. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are engaging and the slides are fun. I think that grading across sections could probably be more standardized, and I wish that Professor Near was on time to his own review sessions, and that he wouldn't make off-color jokes during class. (The whole \"hold-my-beer\" joke to illustrate dangerous behavioral choices among human men was super weird, and perpetuates tropes about masculinity that are simply unnecessary for this class). Otherwise, he is very friendly, and very obviously passionate about the content- which is great! ",
            "\u00a0The course was taught well and the TAs and peer tutors were excellent help as well as Samantha Lin, as always. ",
            "\u00a0There should be practice questions for the midterm and final, since it was difficult to prepare with limited idea of how the test is going to be like. It will also be good if slides for each discussion section can be posted online after the session, so that students don't have to frantically copy down the answers from the slides every class. The grading can also be more clear. Even as there are detailed rubrics provided for the writing assignments, it seems that some TAs don't really follow it closely or grade it based on their own interpretations. ",
            "\u00a0Would've been helpful to have some kind of practice questions for midterm and final. Kind of hard to study with no direction.  Also for the paper reduce the number of questions; couldn't answer in the page limit given but also extremely difficult to find answers to many of them. It felt like it was just a literature review and I didn't feel like I learned anything as a result because I was just scraping articles for anything that might be relevant to the questions. ",
            "\u00a0This class was fun and was very different from the other biology classes I have taken. I also enjoyed the final paper.\r\nThe main issue that my colleagues and I had with the class was that there was far too much wrought memorization involved - we sometimes had to memorize facts and numbers that seem useless and easily available online. I have probably already forgotten half of what I had to learn for the final exam. ",
            "\u00a0One strength of the course was the organization of concepts we learned. Samantha Lin really excels in making sure that everything runs smoothly and orderly. Another strength of the course was its ability to tie in primary research papers with what we were learning in the lecture that week. It was interesting to see the research involved with evolution. One improvement could be tying the activities in section back to what we learned in the lectures because I feel like the sections are just borderline busy work. ",

            "\u00a0A weakness of the course was that it was difficult to understand the level of detail that was supposed to be understood in order to excel in the course. A strength was that the sections were engaging and helpful for learning. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the class was pretty strong. Lectures were organized and homework was relevant and worthwhile. I thought the lecture slides could have more bullet points instead of images. Since there were no study guides, it would have been nice if the lecture slides were more informative and organized. ",
            "\u00a0The weakness of the course is that its memorization dependent. This becomes really annoying because you end up forgetting things after tests rather than actually learning the material. The strengths were that Professor Near was very engaging and entertaining, but only so many facts can be memorized. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- I enjoyed visiting the Peabody exhibits\r\n- It was very structured\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- It felt quite regurgitation-based at times ",
            "\u00a0Professor Near was an awesome, engaging lecturer, and Professor Lin did a great job organizing the course! The lectures are super helpful in referencing to learn the material outside of class in addition to lecture. Main weakness of the course is not the fault of the instructor or the organizer, but just by the nature of it being a big STEM lecture it's hard to always engage all the students. ",
            "\u00a0The teacher was incredible, I loved this course. I also loved the field trip. I think section could have been a bit more useful by talking more about what we were doing in class as opposed to just papers. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this class was only okay. There was a lot of memorization and not a lot of thinking, a setup I did not enjoy. That being said, the material was interesting, and I did enjoy the problem sets and writing assignment; I found the writing assignment very helpful in teaching engagement with scientific literature. I found the tests usually fair, with a few notable exceptions. There were few problems similar to those given on the problem sets, and the readings were never tested (despite telling us that they would); instead, one question on the final asked us to match the reading to the author, which I found irrelevant and unfair. ",
            "\u00a0Almost by nature of the subject, the course required lots of memorization and tests depended on that which is unfortunate because it meant that student who may have understood the material but were unable to memorize every detail were at a disadvantage. However the lectures were always fun and the readings were interesting. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course is the organization of lectures it felt as though everything came in perfect order and all were summing to the course topic. Another strength was the organization and type of assignments, with the other bio sequence courses it was difficult to adjust to a different grading method and assignment style but his assignments were very straight to the point, clear, and overall were what I was expecting of a biology course. I liked how there was a balance between the quantitative and qualitative concepts of the subjects such that you can target all aspects of biology and all felt as though they served a greater purpose and weren't just filler useless assignments. Another strength was the amount of support and resources the class had. A weakness of the course was section, as with all other bio sequence sections I felt they were useless and just added more stress and information on us that felt completely useless. "
