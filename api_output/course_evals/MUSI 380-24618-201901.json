            "\u00a0I learned so much about jazz history! Not only the bigger movements that happened from 1900-1960 but the important figures and how each movement fit into the social context of America. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Kane takes you on a journey through jazz in this class. He not only teaches you how to listen to jazz music, but also shows you the right questions to ask about it and the stories behind it. It's an incredibly interesting study of the turbulent past of jazz. ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge about jazz history, better understandings of what ethnomusicology means and how its implicated, and I was just exposed to amazing new music! ",
            "\u00a0Learned a good deal about the intersection of jazz and social, cultural, and political trends in America ",
            "\u00a0Understand historical and revisionist viewpoints. How to listen to jazz and music. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a tremendous amount about the history and development of jazz, particularly from a racial and socioeconomic perspective. ",
            "\u00a0As a nonmusic major, I learned a lot of music theory stuff without even trying to, it just came with analyzing songs and such. \r\nI learned a ton of history, great nuggets of little stories tied up in every artist's history and each little tune. \r\nI learned how all these moving pieces connect to greater historical trends and how they are relevant to the world at large. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Weakness: there was literally no information about grades throughout the semester. I had no idea what my grades were on any assignments except one assignment that we got back in the last week of the semester. Strength: Brian is such a great lecturer and so knowledgable! ",
            "\u00a0The class overall was really well organized. Some days it just felt like we didn't have enough time to get through all the material because there was simply so much to get through. Class time would always fly by because Professor Kane is such a good story teller and makes every issue in jazz feel vital. That said, I would have loved to receive my grades on papers before the last week of class. ",
            "\u00a0The course had almost all strengths! I know I personally sometimes put the course on the backburner and skipped class occasionally or didn't do the readings (not because I didn't want to, but because I was stressed by other classes), and think that I would know the information better or engage with the course more if there some form of accountability (maybe a short reading response?). ",
            "\u00a0Section for this course might be nice ",
            "\u00a0Strength: so much good reading - Walser and selections, amazing point-driven lectures\r\nWeakness: Shipton textbook wasnt very helpful, didnt really utilize TA, could have used more background in minstrelsy ",
            "\u00a0I like to always find things to improve upon but I'm having trouble here because this course was so awesome. I had a spring in my step on my way to class and I'm sad to have finished. \r\nIt covers the material incredibly well in an engaging and extremely fun way (although, how can you really go wrong with jazz history 1900-1960).. such a great course! "

            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Yale has so few courses about jazz! If you are a music major or someone interested in music but have only taken Western Classical History courses (i.e. the canon), this course is for you. It is SO important that this course even exists! The readings aren't super necessary--I don't think Brian really expects people to do them--but they are super interesting if you do manage to make time! Brian is truly amazing--he knows everything about everything, basically, and just provides a wealth of knowledge. It's worth it just to go and hear him theorize! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student with even the slightest interest in learning about jazz. While the class is filled with many kids who've played jazz their entire lives, Professor Kane does a great job of teaching so that even someone with  no background can get something out of the class. I feel like jazz is a widely misunderstood and under-appreciated genre of music. Learning about it in this class has been an amazing experience. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Especially if you have previous exposure to jazz, this course is a great way to challenge some of your previous notions about what it means, understanding the trajectories of the genre, what it means, as well as just get exposed to great music! ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! Take this class, even if you have limited music knowledge - it has been my favorite class at Yale. Professor Kane is extremely knowledgeable and enthusiastic which makes the class incredible. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Its a good 5th class and you also gain a better understanding of the foundations of the modern jazz world. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, its ear-opening. It is a great introduction to jazz for the rookie and an amazing appraisal for those familiar with the music. Jazz is a view on history. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. The lectures were meaningful, insightful and relevant, and the workload was quite light but interesting ",
            "\u00a01,000% yes everyone interested in jazz or early 1900s history should DEFINITELY take this course!! If you love the history, it's wonderful because understanding jazz will flesh out your understanding of the entire time period. Jazz is so culturally mixed up and entails so many different elements that even if you are only interested in a few of them, it becomes relevant. "
