            "\u00a0Not a whole lot, the lectures were incredibly generic, the feedback from the advisors was very high level and not helpful, and I have had similiar client projects each semester so far. ",
            "\u00a0My project was fantastic and completely out of my comfort zone which was great. I have a really strong understanding of some little known areas of administrative law that I would have never got had it not been for this course. ",
            "\u00a0By taking this course, I further developed my professional, research and analysis, and writing skills while working for my client. I worked for a client at the state government level and walked away with a deeper understanding of state agency and legislative processes. ",

            "\u00a0It was what I was looking for. ",
            "\u00a0Since it is really a client-based course, the skills and knowledge I gained largely came from the work on our project. Over the course of the semester I really learned a lot about the work currently underway from the legal community in response to the Trump Administration. ",
            "\u00a0The course lectures were not entirely helpful to my client work because my work was focused in policy analysis. However, my client did share with me valuable resources and tools applied to the project and helpful for future endeavors. ",
            "\u00a0A fair amount! You definitely get a lot of work from the client. ",
            "\u00a0Very well ",

            "\u00a0I found the actual classes to be really unnecessary unfortunately. I'm sure Josh et al put in a lot of effort to invite and bring in speakers but I think the topics were areas that most of the class was already familiar with. And the lectures tended to really stay on the surface and were not rigorous or in depth enough for us to really learn anything. The class time is a good opportunity to learn but seemed to be a wasted opportunity this semester. Also it may not be necessary to have so many classes since the project hours requirement is already so hefty for this class. ",
            "\u00a0It felt like this course was over managed in some places and under managed in others. The lectures were extremely high level with topics such as \"what is environmental law?\" and \"how does Congress work\" which was not helpful with a background in these areas. They should have allowed students to skip lectures if they intended to make them so irrelevant and introductory to the individual client projects.\r\n\r\nThe \"workshop\" lectures were also useless. It was obvious that the advisors who led them did not prepare at all, and it just entailed students giving high level information on their projects. ",
            "\u00a0The weekly course discussions were a week point for me. I know this may not be in the spirit of the course, but as an FES student, I really do think it would be beneficial to have a law requirement for enrollment. I know some projects don't carry such a strong legal focus as my project, but I still think that the one day class on environmental law 101 doesn't provide enough foundation for even how to best approach some of these projects. Had I not taken law courses in the past and worked in environmental policy previously, I would have been unprepared for the workload. At the same time, I think attendance at some of the lecture classes really should be optional. For instance, there were classes devoted to the Flint Water Crisis, and yet some students (myself included) had already taken a semesters-long course devoted to that work. I understand the importance of a weekly check-in, but I'm not sure every lecture was as helpful as they needed to be, and often times just infringed on the time we could have been working on our client project. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course lie in the practical experience aspect of the course. Students are able to work on real-world, practical projects with professional clients. The projects encapsulate learning from many courses at FES and provide students the opportunity to utilize the technical skills gained at FES. The weaknesses of the class include the lectures. Often times, lecturers would revisit the same topics in administrative law and perhaps the course could be improved by providing guest lecturers with the syllabus of course topics covered prior to the weekly lecture to eliminate content overlap. ",
            "\u00a0You can cut out the mandatory meetings and lectures down by 75%.  Not everyone needs an environmental law bootcamp, or what not. You'd be better served taking that time and meeting with a group one on one to troubleshoot. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Josh is great\r\nWeaknesses: Josh is leaving :( ",
            "\u00a0I believe that they should reconsider the format of the lecture-based classes which typically felt like a waste of time. They were often far too general and redundant for environmental masters students. I had a good experience with the clinic because of our client, not because of the clinic's overall organization. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great class! Although the experience is completely dependent on your project and advisor. ",
            "\u00a0Some of the lecture time was unnecessary. I think it could have been improved by giving students more flexibility to get in their hourly work during this time. "

            "\u00a0This clinic is great and gives students a chance to apply what they learn in class. ",
            "\u00a0What client project you choose really does dictate how the course will go for you. Take your time and consider all the options and what you'd like to get out of the class. ",
            "\u00a0My advice to students considering this could would be to attend the first class, sign-up to review the available projects for the semester, and enroll if a project or two speak to your interest and career goals. The client-based projects are an invaluable opportunity for students to showcase their knowledge and growth as professionals in the environmental field while networking and working as part of a team. The course is demanding, so you must ensure the project is of interest to you, that way you are committed to meeting the course and client objectives. ",
            "\u00a0Depends on the client, but my client was fantastic and I loved doing the work! ",
            "\u00a0Very much depends what project and group you get ",
            "\u00a0Start on your project early and use the resources you have within the clinic, especially your project advisor! "
