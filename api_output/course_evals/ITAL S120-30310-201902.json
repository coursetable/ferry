            "\u00a0Learned a lot about Italian and Italian culture in an immersive environment over a surprisingly short period of time. ",
            "\u00a0Please see my response to Italian S120 Elementary I (since the course was combined I and II my answer is the same for both) ",
            "\u00a0Learned basic Italian skills, grammar, and vocabulary. Gained some insight into Italian culture as well through readings. ",
            "\u00a0Better, more in-depth grammar and more comprehensive Italian. ",
            "\u00a0More difficult grammar structures in Italian, more vocabulary, conversation "

            "\u00a0Everything was great! A great combination of fun and structured knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0As the course continued, the speed revved up, which though likely necessary made learning so much grammar hard. More spacing of learning verb tenses might have helped. Overall however I loved the course and found it very strong! ",
            "\u00a0Course was very well structured where the two professors balanced each other out perfectly! One pushed us to converse and use Italian and the other hammered in the grammar really well! The only weakness isn't really in control of the professors, and that's simply that we don't have enough time to learn all the vocab and get used to grammar at a more comfortable pace. The only room for improvement I see is maybe speeding up the pace of the L1 portion of the class to ensure that the L2 portion doesn't feel as rushed as it did. ",
            "\u00a0The class moves at an incredibly fast pace, and the professors did an incredible job at helping us do that while still enjoying ourselves. ",
            "\u00a0It was well-organized and structured, although I wish we had more time to practice speaking. "

            "\u00a0Definitely! It's absolutely awesome to learn a language where it's spoken. I feel truly exposed to a fascinating culture. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend it to someone excited about learning Italian! It was intense but manageable and fun. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Learning Italian in Italy motivates you in a way you cannot be on campus. Also, since you're mostly only focused on Italian the entire program, it's easier to stay focused on the material and not get bogged down by other classes or activities. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, not just because one would benefit from just going into L2 after L1, but also that it is very rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. The Italian department is amazing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes if you're interested in learning a language from amazing professors! "
