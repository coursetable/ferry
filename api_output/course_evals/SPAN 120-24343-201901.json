The course covers consider vocabulary, but more importantly it emphasis proper grammar to speak in different tenses, which expands the types of sentence constructions you can use to speak or write with.

The instructors provide plenty of practice, though this comes at the cost of having class five days a week. Overall, I think that, if you are even mildly interested in studying Spanish, you will find the course to be instructive and helpful. "
