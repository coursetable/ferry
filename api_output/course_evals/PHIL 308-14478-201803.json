            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about thinking philosophically and about the respective philosophers views. I also learned how to write a philosophy paper! ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to re-evaluate my life and think critically about old and relatively recent works of philosophy, as a student who had little background in the subject. ",
            "\u00a0I gained appreciation for and knowledge of many philosophical concepts which were unfamiliar to me. I learned to discuss abstract concepts in terms of their philosophical and historical backgrounds. ",
            "\u00a0how to read philosophy critically, to analyze it without overstepping, to write in a way that departs from literary analysis and steers more toward proof-like writing ",
            "\u00a0Developed knowledge about the intellectual history of the Western tradition in regards to Love, sexuality, sex, power, and their interrelationships philosophically and politically. Developed critical thinking skills in the context of discussions, reading, writing and presentations. "

            "\u00a0This course was very well structured! I loved the writers included on the syllabus and I felt that the dialogue within class was very engaging. I perhaps it might be beneficial to assign a bit more reading from the writers so that students can get a better sense of their perspectives more broadly.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, I loved that this course focused on love in the political space. The syllabus led up to womanist and intersectional feminist philosophers such as Audre Lorde and bell hooks - a tremendously important telos for a Phil. Of Love course! Asaf made it clear that these writers were of greatest significance to the courses broader implications. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Well chosen and interesting readings, great engaging kind professor, great discussions, laid-back and not very intense workload\r\nWeaknesses: As much as I enjoyed our class discussions, I wish Dr. Angermann would lecture us a little about his interpretations of the pieces sometimes ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Interesting, diverse readings, great discussions during class.\r\nWeaknesses: Some readings were difficult to follow. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: well-structured and organized, balance of writing and readings, well-moderated discussions\r\nweaknesses: could have a couple small evaluations, so students can predict how work might be graded ",
            "\u00a0Small seminar size is a huge stregth for really deeply and intimately engaging the philosophical questions at hand. Asaf is very open about the class being a collaborative venture: not to lecture or learn what was said, but to deeply and personally critique the philosophies in question. This deep level of personal engagement really makes the classroom enjoyable to be in. "

            "\u00a0Yes! I have already recommended this course to other students who are interested in womanist theology. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It was a wonderful class that forced me to rethink a lot of idea about the way I live my life.\r\nWord of warning though: the class doesn't really focus on romantic love, so if you're looking for relationship advice, this is not really the place to go.\r\nOther than that, if you're think about love in a sociopolitical setting, a metaphysical perspective, an ethical perspective, this is the class for you! ",
            "\u00a0Yes- It's an interesting and engaging course in a field that many students may not initially think of investigating. Definitely a good humanities course for STEM majors looking to find interesting classes outside of their majors. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutelythe semester is organized meticulously yet leaves room to compare each section to others, provokes personal investment in discussions ",
            "\u00a0Would recommend this to students looking to critically engage with philosophical topics related to love and its political, ethical and social implications. Thinkers from Plato to Foucault to De Beauvoir to bell hooks truly present a diversity of thought which is engaging and eye-opening in many ways. The class itself was always enjoyable and insightful, and the topics in question were never dry and always personally engaging. "
