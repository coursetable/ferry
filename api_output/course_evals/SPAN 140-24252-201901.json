            "\u00a0Spanish grammar and speaking ",
            "\u00a0I finished learning the necessary grammar structure to speak, read, and write at a reasonable level in Spanish. My oral skills were polished and my level of comfort in speaking rose greatly. I also learned about a lot of culture and history through the texts and oral presentation projects throughout the year. ",
            "\u00a0I learned some Spanish grammar and learned that Spanish takes an insane amount of time to practice and work towards being fluent. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of different tenses and advanced Spanish grammar. How to read (and actually understand) a book in Spanish. How to give a long oral presentation. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my communication skills in Spanish, as the class is mostly based on participation in class. Sharing opinions in class, participating in debates and trials, and doing many oral presentations has improved my pronunciation and fluidity in the language. Also, the movies and readings done in class this year helped me learn more about Latino culture and history. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my speaking ability and my writing and grammar. ",
            "\u00a0I continued to develop my knowledge of Spanish and Spanish culture. I reviewed the finer points of the past subjunctive, learned some more triggering phrases for various tenses, did readings covering the culture, both contemporary and historical, of the Spanish-speaking world, and tried to speak as much as possible.

            "\u00a0The whole grammar portion could have been better structured ",
            "\u00a0Improved my grammar, not my listening. ",
            "\u00a0Didnt follow schedule and was confusing most of he time ",
            "\u00a0The course does a great job on covering grammar necessary to become fluent in the language. If the course spent a little more time on learning diverse and useful vocabulary, I think that would be beneficial. I thought the texts chosen for the course were phenomenal and shared a lot of culture and insight outside of just reading in a foreign language. ",
            "\u00a0The professor would always make us do the same textbook homework that we'd done online on VHL Central in class using the physical textbook, as if she didn't know that we had already done it. Doing these exercises twice made the VHL homework seem pointless, which is frustrating because it is so tedious and the online code is so expensive. I don't think I've gotten much out of the online homework for my language classes, and I don't think that buying the VHL code should be a requirement. It is a needless financial burden, and the exercises can just as easily be done in the physical textbook and checked by the professor. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: lots of in class speaking\r\nweaknesses: too much busy work and out of class work ",
            "\u00a0Spanish 140 entirely builds upon Spanish 130. Ive learned a lot of more advanced grammar, can read much more advanced texts, and communicate at a level thought Id never be capable of. At the end of the class, I was starting to feel like a native speaker  I was filling in the correct verb tenses on tests without consciously thinking but instead doing what sounded right. The workload of this course only picks up as the semester goes on, though. A lot is crammed into the last few weeks, with 2 tests, many presentations, and a full book to read. Everything is very structured for success  the book comes with background context and vocabulary lists, which was missing when we struggled through reading a book in L3. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is that it is clearly structured and outlined in a syllabus, so that we know what to expect in terms of workload for the coming week or how to work ahead if we wanted to. A weakness of the course is that it tries to incorporate visits to the art gallery, but the activities there do not make much use of the visit being made. ",
            "\u00a0It is a great course. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the readings and found almost all of the grammar covered useful. The assignments seemed fair and in-line with the goals of the course. I enjoyed the gallery visits and associated activities.\r\n\r\nI would say that one of the courses only weaknesses relates to seating  in other words, it would be great to have the instructor prompt people to at least try switching who theyre sitting next at a few points through the semester. Otherwise, it can be a bit frustrating for students who are motivated to speak only in Spanish yet wind feeling locked next to people mainly want to speak in English. "

            "\u00a0Yes. It is not too challenging and your Spanish will improve. ",
            "\u00a0No ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think it did a sufficient job of completing the learning of a foreign language and tied a lot of concepts together. It focused on all the major points necessary to be confident in another language. ",
            "\u00a0As far as fulfilling a language requirement goes, I think this course is fine for it. ",
            "\u00a0I would not because you have to spend a lot of time outside of class on the material. It takes away from my studying for other classes. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to study Spanish grammar at a higher level, L4 is absolutely necessary after L3. It reinforces a lot of the concepts learned and is an enjoyable class because of the diversity of assignments given. I especially loved my section with Professor Santos, who made the class engaging, prepared us thoroughly for exams, and encouraged us all to participate. Even though I wasnt confident in my Spanish ability at the beginning of the class, Professor Santos helped me improve and feel more confident every step of the way. She compared herself to a gym trainer at the beginning of the course, and thats absolutely true. She pushes you, cheers you on, and helps you do more than youd think youd be possible of. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student who is looking to improve their Spanish. The workload is not that high, and good grades can be achieved if one puts effort into practicing their Spanish daily. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I loved the professor and it is always good to know spanish. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to improve your Spanish and took L3, yes  you should take it.\r\nOne tip, however: If you feel at all like you want a tutor, sign up for one. Dont wait until October or November.\r\nI went into this course hoping to significantly improve my spoken Spanish, and signed up for a tutor at the beginning of the course. They were quite useful for catching verbal errors. (Having the professor correct spoken grammar is possible in class but doesnt happen quite as frequently). "
