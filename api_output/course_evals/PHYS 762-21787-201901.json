You get to spend 4 hours a week in the beautiful wright lab shop with Dave who is a funny, fantastic professor with a ton of good stories to tell. He makes sure that everyone makes a steam engine that you get to take home. The walk to wright lab and the fact that this class isn't for credit aren't great, but so worth it for this class. ",
            "\u00a0The class is instructive by nature and Prof. Johnson is great at what he does.  I really can't say the class has any weaknesses because I learned all I expected to learn ",

            "\u00a0Yes. It was fun to work with your hands. It was a nice 4 hour break each week from the difficult course work. ",
