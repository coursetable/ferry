            "\u00a0What I appreciated most about this course is that it wasn't US-centric like many other China courses here at Yale. Professor Mattingly was very conscious in pushing back against American stereotypes of China, and we didn't learn about China through the lens of what would benefit the United States. Half of the course is focused on a recap of Chinese history from literally the Xia dynasty (first) to Xi Jinping and the modern-day. I learned a lot of in-depth material about Chinese history that I didn't even know as someone who is Chinese, and found that really crucial to understanding Chinese policy in the present-day. I also learned a lot about the strategy of China moving forward, from Xi Jinping's intentions as a leader, to what the CCP's legitimacy rests on, to the Made in China 2025 plan. ",

I learned how to examine more deeply author's arguments and find areas where author's arguments were strong or weak. I learned how to extend author's arguments and add my own perspective. In regards to China, there was so much I did not realize I just did not know. I learned about early Chinese history, to China's domestic politics, and China's unique position in international politics. ",

            "\u00a0I learned about the history of China, with the first half of the course focusing on the Qing Empire through the Mao Era into Xi Jinping's presidency. For the second half, I learned about the domestic politics and institutions of CCP's China and China's international politics, today, through the framework of contemporary debates on China's rise which speculate on whether it will be peaceful or include war. I'm very grateful that I learned enough to form my own opinion on China's rise as well as the strengths and weaknesses of various leaders and initiatives. This has sparked my interest in China, and how it'll continue to navigate domestic pressures in an international stage, as well as really interesting facts about protest in China and China's investment in Africa. ",
            "\u00a0This course was one of my favorite courses that I have taken at Yale. China is a country that is often in the news and this class helped me understand the history of China and the domestic politics that the government is dealing with.  I feel much more knowledgeable about China and can speak more on its relationship with the U.S. ",

            "\u00a0The class provides a very well-rounded introduction to China's rise, with a thoughtful inclusion of Chinese history at the beginning of the class to ease everyone into modern Chinese politics. The lectures also follow either a chronological or thematic order which is conducive to students understanding the course materials. Professor Mattingly also places an emphasis on analyzing the research papers we read in class, which asked us to critically examine the conclusions we are given. ",

We then learned first the domestic and then international politics of China and covered a variety of topics from the environment and climate change to nationalism and the political system. This course teaches how to think critically about others' research and hypotheses and how to interpret the policy decisions of a country through a historical lens and while also taking into account the domestic politics of the country. ",

These both helped me better understand China today. The course is taught from a strongly pro-China viewpoint, as the professor acknowledges, but of course he encourages students to form their own opinions based on the material and is not on a campaign to get you to think his way.

Lectures can do much more if the videos were cut (took up around 15 mins every lecture) and the review/summary portions were cut (took up around 10 mins). If necessary, videos can be added to the syllabus for students to watch on their own, or even during section. ",
            "\u00a0A great, balanced, and informative introduction to contemporary China and what the future holds for it and the United States. ",
            "\u00a0This course was well-organized, engaging, and covers a lot of material without being overwhelming. As long as you go to lecture, you will learn a lot no matter your level engagement with the readings. Readings served to extend what we discussed in lecture to practical examples and were all worth it. I don't know of any weaknesses besides when Prof. Mattingly started incorporating time for questions in his lectures. That is what sections are for, and the same person asked something every time. I would have rather just hear more lecture! ",
            "\u00a0Lectures usually try to fit too much into one lecture, causing us to rush and not give topics as much analysis as one would like. Interesting and relevant readings, great lectures. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Very clearly outlined in terms of structure. The readings were interesting and well-chosen ",
            "\u00a0It wasn't the most exciting. ",
            "\u00a0Mattingly is great, but tries to fit a little too much into lecture sometimes. His slides are mostly pictures, which works in class but makes it hard to study later on if your notes have gaps. There was too much reading most of the weeks which was impossible to complete with other coursework. I liked that we wrote two response papers on differing weeks throughout - nice way to synthesize the material. I'm not a fan of take-home finals, so I would have preferred a normal final. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n- Professor Mattingly is very conscious in pushing back against American stereotypes of China, and we didn't learn about China through the lens of what would benefit the United States. I wish more China classes at Yale were taught by him/professors like him!\r\n- The focus on Chinese history really helps in understanding Chinese culture and modern-day China. \r\n- The lecture material is really concrete and fact-based, which left me with a lot of solid knowledge about China leaving the class.\r\n- Professor Mattingly is an engaging lecturer, and the readings were very interesting. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- The last couple of classes were taught by TAs and included a roundtable, but I think that may have been because Professor Mattingly had a family emergency -- I am unsure as to whether it was the original plan. Those classes were a lot less engaging.\r\n- I would appreciate more Chinese TFs who can speak to the country's situation on the ground/their personal experiences. ",
            "\u00a0I love how engaging and insightful all the readings Professor Mattingly assigned were. Never once when I was completing a reading, I questioned why did Mattingly assign this. I really appreciated how the readings included various perspectives, for example, whether or not the Thucydides Trap exists. The readings truly provided me an opportunity to reflect and consider exactly what I think about China's rise and its influence on the globe stage.\r\nI also found the lectures to be very engaging and insightful. Sometimes Mattingly would use funny photos or engaging videos, and I think these efforts, along with clear lesson objectives and takeaways, kept me engaged. \r\nI found the TAs to be incredibly helpful during section, as well as giving feedback on response papers. I think from the very beginning, Professor Mattingly clearly outlined his expectations for the course, and because of that, I felt more confident in my ability to perform well and learn without the added stress of any confusion of expectations ",
            "\u00a0TFs were very helpful. Lectures could have been more interesting ",
            "\u00a0The review session for the midterm was a joke. Professor Mattingly wouldn't answer a single question on actual material. He would respond to any legitimate questions by saying he would not answer that question and asking if anyone had any questions on formatting. If you're going to have a review session and refuse to answer any meaningful questions beyond whether you should use blue or black ink on the bluebooks, just don't have one. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was great. Professor Mattingly began to take more questions from students towards the second half of the course which was a welcome change. ",

            "\u00a0This is a great course. ",
            "\u00a0In this course, I learned about the important events in Chinese history and how China became the nation it is today. While also understanding the political, economical, and cultural aspects of the country and government. I became aware of how powerful China is and it gave me a better rounded understanding of global politics. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- Prof Mattingly is the GOAT! Content could not be any organized and taught any better.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- take home final was annoying ",
            "\u00a0The course material was very interesting and I enjoyed the flexibility that it offered. It was also great to learn about events that were currently happening ",
            "\u00a0This was a great course with a good balance of lecture, documentaries, discussion, and response papers. ",
            "\u00a0Its a super interesting topic and very relevant today. It has a variety of knowledgeable TFs, and Professor Mattingly is another reason to take the course. It was twice a week for 50 min which was ideal, so there was really no weakness to this great class. ",
            "\u00a0I felt that some of the studies assigned in the syllabus were superfluous. Despite being very long and sometimes difficult to understand, there were many readings that were neither discussed in lecture nor in section as they weren't especially pertinent to the key themes we covered in class. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Mattingly is a great professor and lecturer! The lectures were usually interesting and fun with many videos interspersed. The course expectations were very clear and the assignments were fairly given and graded. We covered a broad array of topics that were very interesting and i liked how I learned so many different things and aspects about China. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The expectations for the paper were a bit unclear in the beginning but I understood after the first one. ",
            "\u00a0Good review of Chinese history and looking at US-China relations. Strength is Prof. Mattingly's breadth of knowledge and the organizational structure of the course (the course is divided into 1. Chinese history, and  2. Chinese Domestic Politics and International Politics) ",
            "\u00a0The professor is a great lecturer, nice guy, and quite knowledgeable about China. He posts detailed slides in case you need to miss lecture, but I always went to lecture anyway because it was really interesting. The ratio of learning to work put in was very high, which is always good. As with most classes like this at Yale, section is a major weakness (super boring discussion of readings nobody possibly had the time to read), but that's a Yale-wide problem more than a TF problem. ",
            "\u00a0This was a very good course and I don't have many comments. The readings and lectures were engaging. I would have liked more direction on the response papers because it was difficult to pull a strong argument from some of the readings. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures and section were very informative and well-organized. I very much enjoyed the content and teaching. One area for improvement would be a more clear grading rubric for response papers. I felt the grading might have been somewhat arbitrary. ",
            "\u00a0Very informative. Loss narrative a bit at the end. ",
            "\u00a0Course was very broad and gave a very big picture overview. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: this is the most well-organized course I have EVER taken at Yale. From the unit breakdown to the lecture themselves, this class was meticulously curated and the readings were STELLAR. Dan is such an amazing lecturer! He get's the material and makes it fun and interesting and doesn't read off of any notes or slides. He's legit. The TA's were also wonderful!! If you get the chance, go for Christina-- she breaks down the readings super well and her section always felt really inclusive. \r\nWeaknesses: not enough interaction with Dan. He's literally a genius when it comes to this stuff, and I really wish we had more time for questions or office hours. ",

            "\u00a0Excellent course that offers a good level of knowledge. But I am still not clear on the contributions and politics of 'transition' leaders like Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao - we technically covered them, but not as incisively as the big leaders. Same with Sino-Soviet relations. "

The first half of the class goes into Ancient China, but you quickly move into the 20th and 21st centuries, which makes the class topical and very relevant. It's very important to know about Chinese politics right now, and Professor Mattingly makes it really easy to understand ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course! I knew nothing about China before starting, and beginning with an overview of the history of the country established the foundation to succeed in the rest of the course as we moved into domestic politics and international relations. The amount of information in relation to the depth of what we were learning was perfectly balanced. This is a great class for someone from any major to learn a lot, but also get out what you put into it. It isn't super challenging persay, but is very exciting so you will naturally want to learn more. Great course overall! ",

Map quiz, midterm, two papers, and a take-home final. workload is pretty manageable, but sitting through class was hard because of how dry the material was. It is interesting for sure, but we talked a ton about the history of china, which can be pretty boring. It was an OK class. Not bad not great ",

The course is organized extremely well, and the workload is flexible and manageable. Professor Mattingly is a very welcoming and kind professor, and he is truly passionate about this course and his students. I did not know what to expect before taking this class, but I am so glad that I did, because I have experienced the most growth with this course. This course provided me with a strong foundation on how to approach my future courses at Yale, and ignited my passion for studying more about China and international politics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the lectures are very interesting, Daniel Mattingly teaches well and introduces interesting political frameworks, thoughtful readings, and interesting documentary clips/news articles/China opportunities, section can be fantastic. However, it can be tempting to skip lecture, esp toward the latter half of the semester, in which case you miss out on a lot because lecture slides don't include all the details and you miss out on Mattingly's anecdotes. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this class to anyone. Despite it being a super interesting topic, the class was remarkably boring and disengaging. Almost half of the overall lecture time was spent watching documentary clips. Total waste of time. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend taking this course to another student. I took this course without any previous knowledge about China and this class serves as a great introduction to the country. Also, Professor Mattingly is extremely engaging and knowledgeable. At the end of each lecture I walked away learning something new. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, you'd get a better understanding about China's rise, a topic that may not be common knowledge ",
            "\u00a0Yes, really interesting and relevant info. ",
            "\u00a0Take it if you are at all interested in China. This will be great for you to jump into conversation as well. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This is a great course that blends Chinas rich history with their complex current state of affairs. I thoroughly enjoyed the discussions about todays challenges, like the Trade War, and learnt a great deal about China today. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone. I think anyone interested in politics should take this course, but also anyone who wants to have a better understanding of todays world. It was a really engaging course and the TAs were also really helpful with the readings and big concepts. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Absolutely necessary for any poli sci/global affairs/history/econ majors but also a great course for anyone to be a better informed citizen in contemporary affairs. ",
            "\u00a0I strong recommend this class to others. Just as Professor Mattingly said in his opening lecture, everyone should take a class on China at some point in their Yale career, and this is a great place to start. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, it's a decent course, but nothing lifechanging. Could probably have gotten the main takeaway of the course just by following the New York Times for a few weeks, but that said taking this course is also useful because 1/3 of it is dedicated to Chinese history and it's a good way to learn about Chinese history without having to take a full-semester course on it ",
            "\u00a0Yes, It was very interesting and I believe the material is important for everyone to know because China is such a large part of global politics and economics ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to everyone, especially as China plays a greater role in the the global community. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! It was so interesting, you learned a lot without much effort, and its important to be aware. Your entire experience depends on your TF, though, so choose wisely. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student interested in understanding the political implications of China's rise on the global stage regardless of their previous knowledge of the region. Much of the history in this course is essential to understanding China in a global context and I believe everyone would benefit from studying it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, would definitely recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, very interesting topic. ",
            "\u00a0I would to those who want a broad sweep of Chinese history and politics and simply want to know a bit deeper the political climate of China. It is an interesting class and Professor Mattingly is an engaging lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I'm an American, and I tend to only view China as it relates to US interests. This course taught me to view China on its own terms, with its own unique history and issues, systems of governance, and desires for the future. In addition, Mattingly is an excellent professor. Will not be surprised if I see him or his work involved and included in US-China policy in the next 20 years. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The course is interesting, and is a great example of how you can learn a lot (if you go to class) without doing much work. The professor is a talented lecturer, and lecture is great. The map quiz, two response papers, and final are not bad at all. The midterm is a little tricky, but not too bad either. Section was terrible just like in all similar classes at Yale, but that's the price you pay. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It can serve both as an introductory course for someone who wants to study China longterm or a good survey class for someone with a passing interest. ",
            "\u00a0I completely would. This was a great course! Very interesting, not terribly difficult, and relevant for contemporary global politics. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! ",
            "\u00a0If you're looking to get a good understanding of how China came to be and where China is now then for sure ",
            "\u00a0YES. TAKE THIS COURSE. This is the most well-organized course I have EVER taken at Yale. From the unit breakdown to the lecture themselves, this class was meticulously curated and the readings were STELLAR. Dan is such an amazing lecturer! He get's the material and makes it fun and interesting and doesn't read off of any notes or slides. He's legit. The TA's were also wonderful!! If you get the chance, go for Christina-- she breaks down the readings super well and her section always felt really inclusive. Exams are fair, and the essays are super easy to knock out, especially if you talk to your TA about the reading you've chosen to write about beforehand. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was a rich and illuminating overview of Chinese politics and economics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!!! ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! ",
            "\u00a0If you are a poli sci major or interested in China, yes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I definitely would. I would recommend this course to any other student, even if only remotely interested in Chinese politics and culture. It is essential to know about one of the most important countries today. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course was incredible! I went from essentially zero knowledge about China to having a level of understanding that would qualify me to deeply engage in most intellectual/political debates regarding Chinese issues. The lectures were constantly engaging and detail-packed. If you would like to gain any knowledge about China's Rise, this is the course for you. ",
            "\u00a0Yes it was interesting and I learned a lot about the potential future of the US and China. ",
            "\u00a0Take this! "
