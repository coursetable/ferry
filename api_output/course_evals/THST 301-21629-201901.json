            "\u00a0I learned so much about new, experimental theater and other modern theater movements from across Europe. This course was absolutely fantastic and I learned strategies as a director which will help me both within the THST major and in my artistic life. ",
            "\u00a0My mind was blown wide open by the ways people can make theatre and how we can conceive of theater in a new way. ",
            "\u00a0Avante Garde directors who took a risk to do something new and their rehearsal processes ",
            "\u00a0I learned about many different styles of directing and was able to broaden my knowledge to include much more of the avant-garde scene. ",

            "\u00a0It is the most interesting and engaging classes I have taken at Yale. It was on a Friday afternoon (which I guess is a weakness), but I still looked forward to going every week. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: A theatremaker a week. An emphasis on practice and rehearsal techniques. Strong discussions and personal development. Extensive presentations on the theatremakers. Assignments were well pitched, timed and manageable\r\n\r\nWeakness: Too Western and European-centric, implying that the future of theatre lies here. Would love to challenge ourselves, as we did with the African-American playwrights we studied, to look beyond this framework. ",
            "\u00a0Love the student presentations. Love that the professor has so much experiential knowledge. Love that the class had breaks and portions where we got to do things from the directors we were learning about. ",
            "\u00a0It wasn't really what I expected based on how it was advertised. Also having everything be based on like two big assignments was a bit much. I wish we had more time on the floor to experiment with what we learned; we did both discussion and demonstrations/practice but it ended up skewed towards the former. "

            "\u00a0Yes - more than any other course at Yale. I did take this class as a THST major, but it was so engaging and interesting that it truly was a pleasure. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I would recommend this to any theatremaker or artist who wants to expand on their conception of art. I would recommend this to any aspiring director who wants a toolkit of works, rehearsal techniques and philosophies to help find their own voice. ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend this course to any Theater Studies majorthe course in this year's iteration focused on the techniques and innovations of the avant-garde \"post-dramatic\" theater. It's material that is great to know and can completely change your way of thinking about theater. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It really opens your mind to avant-garde and experimental theatre and see the intent behind it. ",
