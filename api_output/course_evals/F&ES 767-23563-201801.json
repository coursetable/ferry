I have also talked about this class in many job applications/interviews so this class has helped me substantially (I hope to go into project management)! ",

            "\u00a0The content of this class was great, but I felt like it was stretched into a full 3 credit class when it would be better as a 2 credit class. Some of the lectures felt a little drawn out to fill the time. \r\n\r\nI would shorten the class to 2 credits and take out the final paper. The final paper was not very meaningful to me because there was so many hypothetical aspects of the project.\r\n\r\nI would recommend having the class earlier in the day- 3 hours at night is hard. ",
            "\u00a0If nonprofit conservation is your career path, this class offers a deep dive in theory and real-world examples. I often thought the class was too focused on unimportant details that we all will learn on the job (i.e. budgeting). The biggest critique is having class for three hours on a Wednesday night. This is just not conducive to any human's learning ability. Split the class into two weekly classes and have it in the morning. Everyone will get much more out of it. ",
            "\u00a0I thought it was a well designed and organized class. I would have loved some more ideas on how to apply some of these tools, or how they have been applied historically. ",
            "\u00a0Less in class discussion of individual projects with whole class , more time to work in small student groups and get help from professors or TA.\r\n\r\nDo monitoring and evaluation earlier in semester, would have loved to learn this earlier and a week longer ",
            "\u00a0It is practical and engaging through group discussion but, for someone who has not done monitoring and evaluation before more practical examples will create more understanding. Maybe group projects will facilitate more understanding than individual work for 1st time learners. ",
            "\u00a0This strong is a great introduction to project design and management and very relevant to anyone who will work with a nonprofit internationally or domestically. The course is pretty basic in many ways, and not very intellectually or practically challenging. The course could be improved by diving deeper into subject material and spending less time talking broadly. ",
            "\u00a0Great level of experience. Perhaps too many tools presented. It would be great to have it be client based final projects! ",
            "\u00a0Amy and Bill have great practical experience that they bring to the table, and bring their personal experience into the course -- I enjoyed this!\r\n\r\nMuch of the course is based around a single final project (essentially to design a conservation project of your own). While this was a helpful endeavor, I think more time should have gone into research upfront instead of diving right into planning. We were encouraged to fudge real details and move ahead with whatever information we felt like for the sake of the project, but I think it would have been helpful to ground these projects more in reality. This would have also meant more research and work went into the problem ID phase. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the focus of the course on one specific project was good and bad. Since the project was so made up it made it hard to come up with realistic answers at times but it was nice how you could focus on your interests. It would have been nice to hear more real-world examples of other projects and their successes and failures. "

            "\u00a0This class is great and teaches how to think critically about projects. However, it gets slow, especially in the middle and the late time frame of the class makes it difficult to be at your best for learning. ",

            "\u00a0If you are planning to work in project management for a conservation-based nonprofit, this class is a perfect fit. It gives you many technical, interesting skills relating to project management. However, it's  pretty surface level. ",
            "\u00a0Choose a final project that's centered on an individual client. ",
            "\u00a0If you've done other types of planning exercises in the past much of the course content will likely be repeat. \r\nI also found that this course doesn't do much questioning of \"why\" these tools make sense, it's more about how to use them -- just something to keep in mind. I'd recommend taking a class taught by Susan Clark before this one, because it will help you to individually question the \"why\" throughout. ",
