            "\u00a0I felt like I left the course with a much better understanding of how to write a historical journal article. I also feel like I will be able to incorporate various perspectives from labor, working-class, and business history into my own work. I think it gave me tools for thinking about contests for power that don't ignore structural factors while still recognizing the importance of individual agency. ",
            "\u00a0The first few weeks of this course featured readings that provided helpful models for thinking about how to write the history of American political economy. The remainder of the course was dedicated to writing a research paper of publishable quality and length. ",
            "\u00a0Different methods and strategies for writing about political economy. I learned about how the topic intersected with social history, race, gender and sexuality. "

            "\u00a0Overall, I really liked the course. The opportunity to write an article length piece with Professor Klein's supervision was incredibly valuable. Two small suggestions. First, I think we could have paid more attention to the articles we read as pieces of writing. I think this would have been helpful when it came time to write our own papers. Secondly, perhaps other students didn't need this, but I think I could have gotten my feet under me more quickly if there had been a brief disciplinary history in the first or second week. It felt very much like jumping into the middle of several subfields, each with their own history, and it was hard to get oriented. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n-Readings of manageable length and generally high quality\r\n-Very helpful feedback from Prof. Klein on proposals and drafts\r\n-Good practice for writing publishable academic articles\r\n-Lots of time allowed in the syllabus for research and writing\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-A bit disorganized\r\n-Deadlines and expectations not always clear ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: While I enjoyed the seminar readings, the fact that half of the course was dedicated to them was problematic because we could have used this time to do research. It felt that the research and writing period of the course was very brief, and most was dedicated to doing outside secondary source readings.\r\n\r\nStrenghts: Workshopping our papers was very useful because everyone in the class came from a different background and listening to their feedback helped everyone build a stronger argument.

            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. I found it challenging, but I think it made me grow a lot as a writer and historian. The most important reason to take the course is for the opportunity to write an article with guidance from Professor Klein . ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course for history PhD students who study topics in late 19th or 20th century U.S. history and are looking for a research seminar in which to explore any topic broadly related to American political economy. ",
            "\u00a0Yes because they will be able to have a broader understanding of how to write histories of political economy. "
