            "\u00a0Good class. Would recommend increasing the workload substantially. The papers were too short, and very few people did the reading. Perhaps add a weekly response? Also, felt sad to get so little feedback throughout the course on written assignments or my presentation. Content was awesome though and the readings were very topical, clear, and educational. Best part was Megan Smith's amazing teaching style, truly a blessing to learn from her. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: excellent class discussions. weaknesses: very broad overview ",
            "\u00a0Professor Smith is a phenomenal professor and researcher! Her lectures are always interesting and bring up complex issues public health professionals have to keep in mind in order to best help people at risk of or suffering from specific mental health burdens. The readings are interesting and open up productive conversations in class. It was an absolute pleasure learning from her and I feel much more equipped to create fourth-generation public health initiatives to address pressing mental health concerns in the general population. ",
            "\u00a0This was my favorite class this semester. It is a great discussion-style class, yet you don't have to participate if you don't have anything to add or if you are not comfortable. Megan creates a very safe space which often can be difficult with such sensitive topics. The readings were all useful and interesting; there was no busy work. ",
            "\u00a0course was very organized. enjoyed watching student presentations and engaging in discussion. hypothetical family project was fun! Loved having guest speakers come in to talk about these issues in their professional lives. ",
            "\u00a0A great course. I would recommend it to anyone who wishes to learn more about social and cultural components of mental health. Strengths: teaching style by the teacher was very engaging. Less focus on wrought memorization but rather engaging questions throughout each class asking us to explain what we've learned from our readings and how they impact the subject of the day. No weaknesses that I can think of. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, the course was extremely interesting and it was organized really well by the instructor. There was engagement on the part of the class, some of which was facilitated by the instructor, but I found this facilitation essential to getting people involved. ",
            "\u00a0Loved the class based discussion model! ",
            "\u00a0This was an excellent course. I learned so much and I appreciated the variety of assignments and in class activities. I would have liked to do even more small group discussions within our families because this allowed more people to share their opinions whereas the same small number of people shared over and over again in our large group discussions. \r\nI really liked the guest lecturers and I liked learning from my classmates' presentations too. \r\nThe only thing I would change would be to make the outline/proposal for the final paper a little bit more intensive, just to spread the workload out more. For example, give citations and a short paragraph explaining each mediator/moderator because it was this research that actually took the longest when I was writing my final paper and it would have been nice to have more of it done beforehand. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: In class we thoroughly discussed different aspects on mental health. Lectures were extremely engaging and informative. Enjoyed the student presentations and the discussions we had directly after them. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There were a lot of readings and they were all relatively long. Some of the readings were often summarized in one slide even though it took hours to complete the reading. ",
            "\u00a0This was one of my favorite courses this semester.  I feel as though I learned a lot of valuable concepts that I could apply outside of the classroom (including how my own language implicates mental health and perceptions of individuals living with mental health disorders).  While there was a lot to cover, the readings and lectures provided a very solid foundation that also inspired me to look further in depth at these topics after the course itself. ",
            "\u00a0This class covered a lot of material. Much of our classroom time was split between lecture, discussions, and presentations, which allowed students a lot of time to be a part of the class and conversations. It was very engaging and interesting material. ",
            "\u00a0The instructor was great ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I really enjoyed this course because it served a dual purpose in both covering different mental health issues while also stratifying this for populations that are at higher risk (and focusing on why this is). One major strength of this course was the dynamic which fostered a healthy dynamic that was low stress and encouraged students to participate without penalizing those who did not. In terms of weaknesses, I did not like the presentations because I felt that they created more stress for the students and a lot of times they interfered with the lecture time which could have been used to go more in depth in certain issues. I think that this issue could be mitigated by having group presentations which take off pressure from the individual. ",
            "\u00a0This course was AMAZING! Megan and Jeannia (the TF) organized the class into two main sections: lecture and individual student presentations that llasted 5 min each. The whole class was extremely discussion-based, and Megan/Jeannia created an environment that supported everyones thoughts, experiences, feelings, etc. that allowed introspection to support what we were learning. This class on mental illness contained some sensitive topics (such as the criminal justice system, sexual abuse, etc.) that were discussed with wisdom and caution. Im thankful that Megan covered these topics, and I am sad that its over! I would make no changes to the course. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this class. The readings were interesting and challenging and provoked great discussion during class. The speakers Megan invited were both incredible and I appreciated that she brought her powerful experience network to class.\r\n\r\nStrengths- Megan was always receptive to conversation throughout her lectures and she tested our knowledge of the readings effectively. I enjoyed the in-class assignments and the papers. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses- Sometimes I did not feel challenged in the course, but it is an introductory mental health class. The course was largely composed of very young students who did not have a wealth of experience in mental health so the discussions were sometimes unrealistic. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - This course has very interesting material and is taught in a very cohesive way.  The readings for the course also supplement lecture really well, and the seminar style class sparks very interesting discussions regarding the topics covered.  It is also a great opportunity to hear about other student's interested through their presentations. \r\nWeaknesses - none? ",
            "\u00a0I really appreciated the structure of the course in terms of the broad topics covered within the context of mental health. The assignments helped me explore mental health within my own academic interests, which was very useful in my endeavors outside of the classroom as well. The lecture, discussion, and presentation styles were all effective in conveying the information presented in the readings. ",
            "\u00a0This was one of the best courses I have had the pleasure to take while at Yale. The instructor was knowledgeable and structured the course in a way where there was practical engagement with the material and with each other. The assignments clearly related to the kinds of activities that we will be expected to undertake as professionals and were clearly described.\r\n\r\nI cannot think of any ways to improve this course. It was such a relief to be in a well-taught class given my experience elsewhere. ",
            "\u00a0It's very reading heavy, but there are no exams so you can learn to know which ones to skim and which to thoroughly read. The structure is lecture + discussion + presentations so it's very engaging and fun. "

She helped create a very engaging class where various opinions could be heard and contemplated with complex material. Covered the material in a great way through lecture and accurate readings. Papers were relevant and a great method to test us on what we learned. Overall, a great course. Can't think of any weaknesses to comment on. ",

            "\u00a0Dr. Smith is one of the best professors I have had. She is very knowledgeable about the class material yet is very open to hearing different perspectives which made it very easy to speak in class. Additionally, she was very encouraging and genuinely cared about her students. In terms of her weaknesses, I think that the lessons could use a little more structure. ",
            "\u00a0Megan has done incredibke research but is one of the most humble people Ive ever encountered. Her lecture style is conversational, and she did an amazing job of repeating and applying concepts (like social selection/causation, 4h generation interventions) that are highly prominent in the field of mental health. She fully supported everyone in the course, and I am so lucky to have taken this course my first semester!! I learned a lot, and I hope to stay in touch with her in the future! ",
            "\u00a0Megan Smith is an incredible instructor who encourages thought-provoking conversation on mental health issues and access to care. She was always receptive to feedback and I enjoyed attending her class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - Professor Smith is an expert in the field and it really shows through in the way she presents the material we cover as well as promotes discussions among students in the classroom.  I felt extremely comfortable voicing my thoughts and opinions in class, and enjoyed participating in class discussions a lot. \r\nWeaknesses - none! ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Smith is incredibly knowledgeable and yet treats all student contributions in class with deftness and respect. I was wary after reading the \"no laptops\" policy for class, but I never felt bored given the way in which she varied class between didactic lecture, group discussion, and small-group activities. The assignments were varied enough to keep me interested in them individually, and all related to the kinds of activities public health professionals are expected to engage in. I wish more of my professors brought her passion and expertise to their classes. ",
            "\u00a0She's great. She's very knowledgeable and is influential. She is also very good at presenting the information. The only weakness may be that she has her set of opinions and although acknowledges that there are others, she can sometimes be biased. ",
            "\u00a0So appreciated her lecture. Perhaps having students summarize the articles for each other could be a good start so everyone could be on the same page. Meghan's lecturing is great. A more structured form of sharing ideas (maybe a weekly small assignment on a discussion portion of canvas related to readings!) instead of hearing from the same people during class all the time. "

            "\u00a0Great class if you don't know much already about mental health. Megan Smith is AMAZING so the opportunity to learn from her is worth it. Not much work at all, but this does impede learning b/c you don't have much of an incentive to study. Other students in the class seemed very basic in their understanding, so you'll have to be okay with dealing with that. Overall though would recommend. ",

Megan is great, and Jeannia (if she TF's again) is super helpful. Mental health is definitely a core concept of public health and this gives a great introduction to mental health and the different directions and topics that mental health collides with. ",

It covers mental health across various societies and cultures with a particular focus on cultures around the United States. Week by week we learn about the impacts of social and cultural influences on mental health on a person from the beginning to end of life and how age itself is a vital component. No stone was left unturned in the material covered and the various impacts someone can experience on their mental health. ",

I would highly recommend it but advise to keep the course size small if possible to facilitate more discussion. ",

As someone without a lot of prior knowledge or experience in this field, I found the material challenging but still understandable. Megan is a wonderful professor and definitely made me look forward to the class every week. ",

I came to this program with a background in Psychology and Public Health, and this course did a great job of synthesizing both fields and prompting very interesting discussion around various topics.  Also, all of the reading assigned for this course was not only relevant but extremely interesting, and I would very much look forward to all of the material we would cover in the course. I 100% would recommend this class to another student, not only because Professor Smith is an amazing professor, but also because this course is designed to give a very well rounded but also in depth approach on mental health and how it ties into public health.
