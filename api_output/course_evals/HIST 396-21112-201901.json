            "\u00a0Having never taken a class on South Asia before, I gained an in-depth understanding of the India/Pakistan conflict, as well as the creation of states like Bangladesh. I was able to develop a historical approach to understanding modern issues, as well as the ability to trace the origins of contemporary films/literature through the knowledge I gained in the course. Professor De is one of the most brilliant professors I've ever had the privilege of taking a course with -- he challenges you to think critically and expects nothing but the best from his students, which in turn strengthened my own belief in my abilities ",
            "\u00a0This course explored the history of India and Pakistan since Partition, with a focus on political development and some very intriguing tangents into culture. I learned an incredible amount about why this area of the world is the way it is today, but also how societies generally change and develop in modernity. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a broad understanding of the history of South Asia and was challenged to engage with the course readings in a unique way. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about Partition, Indian and Pakistani history and politics, and film and media in the two countries. ",
            "\u00a0The course provides an overview of Indian and Pakistani history since independence. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a considerable amount on India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, on most all topics. This class offered a surprising amount on Indian constitutional law (not that surprising, I admit, when you consider Professor De's background), as well as other critical parts of the regions history like language, democracy and insurgency. You will learn a lot, is you are willing to put in the work. ",
            "\u00a0Detailed and nuanced knowledge about the politics, economics, and culture of India and Pakistan since 1947. ",
            "\u00a0the ability to contextualize current events in South Asian, historiography of 20th-century South Asian countries and pop culture ",
            "\u00a0I gained a good overview of modern/postcolonial Indian and Pakistani history, a sense of the historical themes and the socio/political/economic environment that led to their development, and an idea of what the place of India and Pakistan is in the current global environment. ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge of Indian and Pakistani state building processes, politics, culture, and economics after partition. Gained skills of analyzing media through historical lens. ",
            "\u00a0Familiarity with major themes and events in India and Pakistan after 1947 ",
            "\u00a0The course title says it all. I learned about the history of India and Pakistan since 1947, with a bit of pre-1947 background and a bit on the separation of Bangladesh from Pakistan in the early '70s. ",
            "\u00a0The course tracks the development of Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh through multiple different course themes / lenses (politics, the economy, feminism, globalization, etc.). I learned more than I could have ever anticipated, and am surprisingly confident in my ability to discuss and think critically about the decades following Partition. ",
            "\u00a0A contemporary history of India and Pakistan from 1947. We discuss themes ranging from state power and nation-building, protection of minorities, the law, the history of development, and so on. Towards the end of the course, we start talking about contemporary movements that are still going on today, such as the Hindutva movement in India or the Dalit BSP party. A fantastic course to learn more about the region and these themes! ",
            "\u00a0I learnt how to critically think about current events in the Indian subcontinent through the lens of the historical events that have shaped them. I learnt about how intricately different themes are often tied together and the peculiarity of the history and politics of the region. "

            "\u00a0One of the biggest strengths of this course is Professor De's teaching style -- specifically, how he incorporates culture into the texts of the class for a really comprehensive understanding of that time. The course involves two film reviews as well as a book review, both of which help the history of the more textbook-like readings come to life. I also really appreciate how Professor De engages the class by asking questions throughout his lectures and opening parts up for discussion. Even though it's a small lecture class, he makes an effort to get to know the names of each student and actually reads our Canvas discussion posts! Having not taken a seminar in a while simply because they're so hard to get into, I really appreciated the feeling of getting to know my professor and having my input actually cared for.\r\n\r\nProfessor De does speak really quickly, but I think that's simply a testament to how much sheer knowledge he has on the topic. It's a bit difficult if you take notes by hand like I do, but he never tests you on minute details of what he says in class, so it's really a non-issue. There are also a lot of readings, but I think they're crucial to the course being as fulfilling as it is. ",
            "\u00a0This course is interesting, the lectures are well-done, and the assignments are interesting and varied. However, the sheer number of assignments felt overwhelming for both students to do and Professor De to grade. ",
            "\u00a0This course is wonderful and provides an excellent and unique take on the history of South Asia. I do think Pakistan was treated as something of an afterthought as was Bangladesh (if it was mentioned at all). The class should have given Pakistani history the standing that it deserves. ",
            "\u00a0This is truly one of the best courses I have taken in my four years at Yale. The course was the perfect blend of engaging lecturing, interesting relevant videos and media, and assignments that were actually enjoyable to complete. Professor De has a remarkable grasp on the subject matter, is an excellent lecturer, and clearly cares about teaching this course well. I honestly have no complaints about the course as a whole and enjoyed every bit of it. ",
            "\u00a0This is a really interesting course-- the topic is really valuable to learn about and the professor is really knowledgable. However, the class is pretty disorganized lectures are too fast and the notes on the slides are not very helpful, so I often missed topics that would have been good to know. We also received our assignments back so late (we never got our first film review back before the final) that we couldnt improve for the next assignment. The readings are interesting, but I also think the workload is too high and it's difficult to engage fully/comprehensively with any one topic because there's just so much material. ",
            "\u00a0The course does a great job of picking out and examining key trends, like linguistic and ethnic conflicts, the role of the military in the state, women's rights, etc., in Indian and Pakistani history. I don't see any major weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0Overall this course was excellent. My one critique is that I felt that, at times, this course was a bit disjointed in the chronology of the topics that we were studying. The lectures were not always the most organized approach that I felt could have been taken to the subject. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are the greatest strength of the class. The degree and density of the reading is very intense, but you don't have to do them all to do well because his lectures have so much information. It is better to call it quits on the reading and be well-rested for class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\nEngaging professor and TA, \r\ndiverse and captivating topics, \r\nwell-thought out assignments\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\nThe final was not structured in a completely fair manner. I think it would have helped many students if it was done in person instead of online. \r\nAlso few grades along the way to see if one's work was up to par with what was expected.\r\nHigh reading load, which is pretty much necessary as the course relies heavily on it ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor De, lectures, syllabus, some readings\r\nWeaknesses: Too large of discussion sections, amount of readings ",
            "\u00a0strengths: the course is well-structured (both chronologically and organized by prominent themes); cover history of both India and Pakistan; an intersection of legal, cultural, political and economic history\r\n\r\nweakness: there is more Indian history than Pakistan history; reading is dense ",
            "\u00a0This course was truly one of the best-taught classes I've ever taken at Yale - South Asia holds the second-largest population in the world, and learning about its unique political formation is absolutely fascinating. Rohit De is incredibly passionate and inspiring to learn from, and I never felt bored in class. I only wish we got film review feedback, but that's the only complaint I have - my TA, Tyler, was wonderful and engaged us in fascinating discussions. There was a lot of reading, but the way it connected to lectures was very well-organized and I learned so much. ",
            "\u00a0Its a wonderful class but a bit disorganized and we didnt get our first graded work back until April, which was a bit of a bummer. I wish that there were a better and more consistent timeline for the work we were expected to turn in. ",
            "\u00a0Strength - lectures are phenomenal, well curated/planned, Rohit De is approachable, brilliant, and kind \r\nMajor weakness - zero feedback on any of your assignments ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: lot of information, very thorough, multimedia, brilliant professor, engaging, focus on different regions/many aspects incl. gender/caste/class dimensions, fair tests\r\nWeaknesses: a lot of reading (has to be treated judiciously), slides/grades often up late, possibly skipped some important events (ex. several Indo-Pak wars), confusing chronology in second half of the course ",
            "\u00a0Rohit De is a fantastic teacher. He is very articulate, makes the course material quite interesting, and is incredibly knowledgeable. I loved going to his class, and I learned so much about modern India and Pakistan. This is a great course to audit, though, because the other parts are not as great. Section was really boring and a waste of time -- I don't blame the TAs; section was just unnecessary and uninformative, so they had an impossible job. The assignments were more like literature assignments than history assignments, and feedback was essentially nonexistent: either very minimal comments delivered months later, or nothing at all. The readings were long, and you have to make a somewhat detailed forum post about them each week, which is not mentioned on the syllabus but should be. The midterm was reasonable and fair. To improve the course I would recommend eliminating section, making requirements and grading criteria for assignments much more clear, listing the forum post requirement on the syllabus, and giving substantive/meaningful feedback on assignments in a timely manner. All that said, the course was still great because the lecture was incredible. ",
            "\u00a0I really appreciated the structure of the class; the readings, lecture material, and discussion sections fit together almost seamlessly and worked together to enhance my understanding of course materials. Professor De in particular was a fantastic lecturer, and I am so grateful that I got to take one of his courses. \r\n\r\nMy main frustrations with the course were a) our assignments would not be graded for several weeks, which put unnecessary stress on the students. I was considering Credit/D/F-ing the class, but could not because I had 0 assignments graded by the deadline and b) I wish we had more time on the final; at least for me, three hours was not enough time to write 8 pages, and I felt like I didn't have enough time to express how much I had learned in the class ",
            "\u00a0I love how Prof. De integrates media, such as songs, advertisements, movies, video clips, and newscasts in the lecture. It makes the historical events we're talking about come alive! We also cover a lot of material within every single lecture--while fast, it actually keeps us on our toes and we always come away from class with tons of insights. ",
            "\u00a0The course material was highly highly engaging and almost everyone always had something to contribute, or at least something to think about deeply. Lectures were very interesting, with a mix of powerpoint presentations and videos, and the 1hour15minutes always flew by so quickly. Most of the readings were also great, except the course was definitely very reading heavy. The amount of readings would vary every week, but sometimes there would be 4 readings of ~20 pages each for one class. A lot of free rein was given to us for our assignments, which can be good but also lead to some confusion about what was expected of us, especially since we would get the grades back months later. "

        [
            "\u00a0100 percent -- I committed to becoming a History major because of this class! It's one of those classes where you're actually sad to see it end, largely because Professor De is the combination of both a great scholar and a great teacher. Class is engaging and includes multiple mediums, which really enriches your understanding of the material you're reading about. You also feel like you come out of the class with a skill in terms of approaching texts/media historically. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you're willing to work hard and engage deeply with the course material. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. It is a fascinating class with amazing lectures and very insighful interpretations of the history of India and Pakistan. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to any student at Yale, regardless of interest in South Asia or even history. I think that the course was one of the top five courses I have taken and was structured perfectly, making every lecture interesting and giving students an in-depth understanding of recent Indian and Pakistani history by the end of the semester. The course may have been easier for me since I had prior knowledge on the subject, but I think that Professor De made the material relatable and accessible for all students. Professor De is a brilliant scholar and lecturer and has an understanding of every nuance of this subject matter, so I think that taking a class with him is a must if you are a South Asian Studies major or are at all interested in this subject. Overall, a really excellent class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend auditing or credit/d-ing because the topic is really interesting, but the workload was really hard to manage. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student interested in the subcontinent or in the history of young states. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. While no background knowledge in the subject is required, I think that it is very useful to have to ensure that you can fully engage in the readings presented in the course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes; Professor De is a fantastic lecturer and you will learn a lot. The amount of reading though is a bit demoralizing for those of us who actually try to finish it all, and it's dense academic reading; if you're the type of person who will try to do all the reading, know that there will be a lot of work and prep for the class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This class demands a high level of engagement but is totally worth it. Professor De is an amazing professor who cares a lot about his students and is a great lecturer. This class taught me a lot, not just about India and Pakistan, but the way I want to study history going forward. ",
            "\u00a0yes, but only if they are willing to invest considerable time and effort into the course ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This was one of my favorite classes at Yale so far, and I recommend ti to everyone, even if you have hardly any background in the region. Just come with an interest and Professor De will do the rest! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only if it's credit/D/fail or if they can handle a lot of oftentimes dense readings ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely! Prof. De is truly a marvelous and passionate scholar on the material and he gives a particular emphasis on law and legal activism in South Asia. The material can be dense and a bit disorienting for someone with no background in this region (like myself), but at the end of the course I felt proud of how much I had learned over the semester. Now I can read any news articles on South Asia and have some idea of the context, thanks to a well-structured, theme-based syllabus of Prof. De. It definitely opens doors to me. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class - it was one of the best-taught classes that I've taken at Yale! It's so important for everyone to learn about South Asia, as it's home to so much of the world's population and is such an important economic player/an integral part of American history. As a non-history major, I thought this course was very accessible to anyone from any background, but it also seemed as though the majority of the class was in a history-related major. The students in the class were extremely engaged with the material; everyone seemed passionate about learning and reading. Our TAs led intriguing discussions in section, so make sure your TA is good. This class is very well-organized and grading is very fair. I loved this class and hope it gets taught again! ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course. This has been my favorite class at Yale. The material is incredibly relevant (modern history) and fascinating. Professor De is an engaging lecturer and does a great job at covering each topic with the nuance it deserves and from the perspective of all sides. He uses music and videos throughout class to illustrate particular points and asks  meaningful questions. Could not recommend this class enough. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend! Just know there's a lot of reading to keep up with, and that you shouldn't lose track after the midterm just because the final is take home ",
            "\u00a0Yes: learn a lot of information in a short amount of time. Built to be accessible to students from non-South Asian backgrounds/not majoring in South Asian Studies, but much of the class does form these demographics so can be intimidating ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The course is definitely geared toward students who have a personal connection to India and/or Pakistan, who make up about half the class, but I would recommend it to anyone, even if they just have an interest in South Asia. The lectures are extremely interesting, Professor De is fantastic, and India/Pakistan are very important to understand. For the written assignments (film reviews, book review, final exam, etc.), make sure to cite as many readings from the course as possible. You are graded on your ability to contextualize the film/book in the readings from the course more than on your understanding of the film/book itself, which isn't made as clear as it could be in the grading criteria. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This was probably the best class I have taken at Yale so far. Before I took this class, I basically knew nothing about the history of India and Pakistan. But now, my ability to discuss and critically think about the subcontinent's history is both surprising and empowering. It is a lot of work and a lot of reading (at least by my standards as a STEM major), but it was incredibly rewarding too. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course if you have any interest in South Asia, postcolonial states, or just want to learn something new. It's an amazing course! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this to any student looking to understand what makes India and Pakistan the countries they are today. While the course refrains from focusing too much on the conflicts between the two countries, it provides a very holistic picture of the themes and issues that have shaped the history and politics of the region. Professor De is also amazing! He knows the content really really well -- not just pedantic facts, but interesting anecdotes and opinions that help us understand the material well. He organises the lectures really well with a mix of videos to keep them as interesting as possible. He would begin each lecture with a short video clip that was usually an advertisement or a song -- to ensure we don't ignore those sources of information that are not history textbooks. He's lovely to talk to and puts in a lot of effort into reading everyone's blogposts. Every class he would mention 1-2 blogposts from that week that he really liked and even reply to them on Canvas, which was always super encouraging. Although the final exam was pretty demanding in its structure (3 essays in 3 hours), and we didn't even get back the grades for all our assignments before the semester was over, the class and the professor are all worth it.
