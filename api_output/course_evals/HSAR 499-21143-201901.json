            "\u00a0I learned how to work on a larger project and to write a longer paper. I learned how to do original research and to write my thoughts in a coherent way. The senior essay is much more than simply a long essay. It's a different kind of work that I appreciate having the opportunity to do. ",

            "\u00a0The senior essay is a great learning experience. It is mostly strengths. The two things I wish, though, were instead of class wide workshops, I wish we had one on one peer editing sessions instead. I also wish the timeline was structured differently. I wish we had less buildup and more check-ins with actual words on paper. ",

            "\u00a0You gotta do it. If you write a yearlong essay, please do yourself a favor and plan to write an essay that takes half a year. Trust me. Treat it like an extended seminar paper and play it safe. Do not, I repeat, do not (!!!) try to write an overly complex or experimental or creative paper. This, young grasshopper, is a recipe for disaster. Please benefit from my mistakes! ",
