            "\u00a0Great overview of the biotech field as well as different agents and approaches that scientists are using to develop the next generation therapies. I also got exposure to plant biology, IP law, and VC. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about a lot of the newest, cutting-edge treatments and technologies being used right now in biotech and biomedical research. We also learned a lot about the legal/financial side of the biotech industry. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about chemical biology techniques and current topics that I hadn't been exposed to before ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of useful things about the up-and-coming technologies that are available. I also learned how biotechs start up, and what it takes to get a product to market. I thought it was pretty useful. "

            "\u00a0I think overall, this class is great! Lots of information but well organized into different sections. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I really liked the course. The only improvement I'd suggest is that discussion sections should not only include a paper to expand upon our lecture, but a more substantial review/explanation of certain points in lecture and what major points we needed to know for exams. ",
            "\u00a0I thought sections were not super useful, but I liked he variety of topics we covered in class ",
            "\u00a0I think that the lecturer about DMD and alzheimer's had disorganized slides. I also think that the quizzes should be worth less and participation in the weekly sessions should be worth more. I usually view quizzes as an opportunity to check in and make sure you're learning, not as something that should be a significant part of your grade, just my personal opinion. "

        [
            "\u00a0Yes, like stated above, a great overview for the most cutting-edge therapy. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the class. Sometimes things felt a bit disjointed due to the fact that so many lecturers contributed to the course, but I honestly thought that was what made this course so special. I really enjoyed learning from the experts about different major areas of biotech, and I definitely think that if you're planning on pursuing any sort of career in biology or medicine, you should take this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It was a really interesting course, and I learned a lot ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it to undergrads, not sure sure about graduate students. "
