Great to understand the roots of probability, go very deep in details with measure theory, understand the main results. And also a beautiful history of the mathematics and the mathematicians who did the theory. I really enjoyed this course. ",

            "\u00a0The course could provide more rigorous proofs instead of merely giving the intuition for some of the results. ",
            "\u00a0This class was great, great lectures and helpful TAs as well.  This course is based on a book by Professor David Pollard. He has his own way to look at probability, so his notion is not be standard and it takes time to get used to it. Previous exposure to measure theory is helpful for the class, and is not considered as a requirement, but I think it is helpful. \r\nThe strengths of the class is that there is no exams. It is challenging weekly homework and a final project on a topic of interest, applying what we learned, which is a great way to make sure we understood the material. ",
            "\u00a0I wish characteristic function was covered in this class. Also the pace is a little bit fast as most of time I find it hard to follow the proof presented on the board, which is typical for a math heavy course. But I have no problem doing my homework. ",
            "\u00a0The professor is a great lecturer, but sometimes goes too fast. ",
            "\u00a0Homeworks were reasonable, with the right amount of questions that facilitated understanding of course material. We also got to do a paper report at the end to see if we could apply the knowledge to read research papers. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend student who have already had some formal exposure to measure  and probability theoryto buy a good textbook and work through it by themselves instead of taking this course. The course is well suited for students which lack a formal background. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to math majors, who are interested in learning the core results of probability, in a rigorous and proof-based approach, with measure theory. But this class is not for everyone, and students should be aware that it requires a lot of work. ",
