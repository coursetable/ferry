He introduces a concept, reads off the powerpoint (which frequently is just bulk chunks of text), and then expects you to apply that concept throughout the rest of the lecture, which leaves students lost and confused. I think simply a reduction of complicated vocabulary could go a long way. There's no need to use proper scientific jargon. This is an INTRO biology course. Please don't tell me that \"glycosyl groups can play a key role in protein folding in ERe.g. via membrane bound lectin calnexin. Calnexinbinds to N-linked oligosacch. on unfolded proteins that retain a terminal glucose. It releases when the glucose is removed.  If the protein is not folded a glucosyltransferase replaces the sugar, and calnexin rebinds. The cycle continues until the protein is properly folded.\" Rather, say \"a chaperone protein binds to the glucose on unfolded protein and tries to fold it. If it doesn't fold correctly, it is recognized by another enzyme that reattaches a glucose, and this goes on until the protein folds correctly.\" ",

As someone with limited exposure to the kind of thinking emphasized in this class, it was a real struggle and I often felt as if I would ultimately fail out of the class. The enrichment was probably the only reason I kept at it even though is class is a prerequisite for my major. ",
            "\u00a0The teaching fellows/Samatha Lin and peer tutors were the only good part about this course. First of all, the curriculum was ridiculous given I now know the way lysosomal hydrolase is tagged but have no idea how to label a cell's organelles. Honestly, biology 102 was the worst class I have ever taken. Lectures were messy and not linear, while slides ranged from incomprehensible (with various spelling mistakes) to irrelevant. Material introduced felt very disconnected, and there was no unifying theme of the course. Mooseker may have discovered all but one myosin, but he certainly did not take a class in how to teach. The whistles are a nice idea, but any time the mean score for an exam is a C- I think there should be serious consideration about whether a teacher should be teaching. I think this professor had a knowledge of the material that was so beyond an introductory course that he had to way to explain concepts in a coherent way for first year students to understand. Had Samantha Lin or any teaching fellow taught the course, I genuinely think everyone would have done well. What's more, the midterm and final were entirely disconnected from the important ideas of the course, and instead was basically Mooseker asking us if we could solve problems in research that we've never conducted. I do not think that an introductory biology course should have such a research heavy focus, given that many of the students enrolled are taking the course for premedical requirements, not because they want to get involved in research. I know very little about cell biology (aside from the very specific mechanisms of how lysosomal proteins are tagged for the lysosome), and I'm very disappointed in this course. I think perhaps biology should be tracked like chemistry is, and there should be an introductory course for people who did not take AP bio in high school. ",

The course itself has a lot of resources, between the course coordinator Professor Lin and the team of TFs and peer tutors. However, if you do not take advantage of these resources, you will not succeed. The course is hard, and its impossible to understand the material by merely going to lecture. The lectures are quite dense. If you put time in, you get a lot out about experimental design and thinking about science. However, the amount of time you have to put in is very different from Biol 102 to just go through the lectures and make sure you understand everything. The psets take a while but are worth putting time into  theyre interesting and similar to exam style. ",

This was a very engaging and intellectually stimulating approach to the subject. However, sometimes there was a degree of assumed knowledge (such as the names and locations of certain organelles) that some students did not have. I think that the instructors should either present these basic facts during lectures, or assign readings that present these facts to the students. Knowing relevant vocabulary going into lecture would enable students to better engage with the experiments and analyses of these experiments presented in the course. ",

I understand the course is just material-dense so the lectures had to be full of information, but it was stressful in lecture when there were so many slides with so much information. It made test-taking stressful because there was so much potential information to be tested, and I felt that I had to know everything. Professor Mooseker and Professor Lin were the two of the strengths of the course. They are both so involved and wanted to see use grow as students. There were always demonstrations and in-class activities that made learning fun. ",

The whistle system, in theory, was great for detecting anonymity during lecture when people are not following along, except, in practice, whoever blows a whistle gets a mic shoved up their face and then they HAVE to ask a question. But how do you ask a question when you don't even know what to ask? And 'I don't understand anything you just said\" sounds too stupid? I felt so inferior because of my classmates already coming in knowing about all of the content when I'm not even familiar with the terminology yet. For an intro bio course, this just assumed you had knowledge on the topic beforehand, and if you didn't, then you should read the textbook and understand all of the vocabularies within a day. I didn't like how it felt like I needed to attend Enrichment when the course is an INTRO course, but I guess I'll have to if I want to pass for the rest of the sequence. ",

However, the class is quite poorly organized, the problem sets are way too difficult and require an extremely well grasp of the concept, and the professor does not coherently explain the concepts. It could be improved by condensing the information on the slides to provide only the important information, providing more practice problems, and simplifying the questions on the problem sets as well as midterm and final.

Also, the first discussion paper on the rearward movement of cells was very foreign and difficult, given that there are some of us with little to no lab work background nor experience with academic scientific text  and yet we were expected to read them practically ourselves without any helpful annotations, and come into discussion section ready to discuss? The only papers that were really understandable were the ones where Mooseker actually went over in class, because they were actually relevant. The first paper was just strange. The difficulty of the PSETs and the inflexible grading scale is also frustrating because I still dont know what the balance of being wordy vs being thorough in my answer should be, since BIOL 101 was so focused on having sentence limits for our answers, but when I simplify my answer in a PSET question, I get points marked off for not using specific words/phrases describing a pathway. I dont know how were supposed to get any points on a PSET question without talking to someone who has been in a lab before and knows whats pratical and feasible when answering a question about lab. Again, this course assumes we know a lot of biological research for some reason, even though its literally an intro bio course. Id also like to point out that the students who know the answers to Moosekers questions in class are the exception/amount of students who have had the privilege/knowledge to find research opportunities and have had a headstart in thinking critically about biological research issues that the rest of the class does not.

The only strength was Sam Lin who coordinated this. She was so committed to ensuring our success. The presentations were so difficult to follow; there was no organization as there were pre and post lecture slides, which were always different.

The format of the tests reads like this is a lab course, with situations being given rather than questions asked about comprehension.

Nonetheless, the distribution and organization of lecture slides in the pre-lecture/post-lecture format was for me somewhat confusing, and created this ambiguity of which slides I should study from, the ones I had taken notes on or the ones that were updated and had answers to the questions posed during lecture. Moreover, I believed that it was not always clear what information should be retained from the papers, and many of the papers seemed disjointed from the topics in the course that we were going over. The course material was extremely specific at times, and deviated from explaining the overarching, fundamental concepts of biology that were of concern to us as students of an introductory biology course. I believe that although the toolkits provide me with information that is essential for me as a future biology major and as a prospective researcher, they are not an effective way of passing down this information to students. I believe that a lab course that would accompany the introductory biology sequence in the same way that a lab course accompanies the introductory chemistry sequence would be a far more effective way for students to be introduced to such toolkit and assay protocol concepts on a more empirical way. Working in a lab during the summer has made me realize that when one is empirically exposed to experimental protocols on a hands-on basis, they are far more able to understand the processes and retain the information that is necessary.
