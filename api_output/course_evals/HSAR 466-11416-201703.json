            "\u00a0I learned about differences in creative processes in the visual arts over time. I gained the ability to identify evidence various creative techniques in aged art as well as evidence of restoration. ",
            "\u00a0This course allowed for amazing use of the resources on West Campus, for the purpose of acquiring particular knowledge about art conservation and technical examination. It was a unique opportunity to work with art objects in the YUAG collection. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about conservation techniques, skills for art analysis, new ways of understanding an object through its processes of creation ",
            "\u00a0In this course, I developed an understanding of both the working processes of artists throughout history and the contemporary practice of conservation. Much of the course was concerned with close examination of a variety of objects in order to understand the process of creating these works. As a non-artist interested in art history, I learned much the physical construction of art objects in a variety of media and techniques. This course is unique among art history courses I have taken -- while we certainly considered art in its historical context, symbolic representations in art, and aesthetic philosophies, the entry into each of these areas was the technical concerns of the works rather than the other way around. The completion of an extended technical study in the second half of the class also offered a look at how conservators today prepare to treat works. Even without modifying the work in any way, I left the course with practice in how conservators approach the many and often competing concerns associated with art conservation. "

            "\u00a0I liked that most of the sessions were taught by a different member of the department of restoration, as we got to learn from the expert in each area of specialization. Most lecturers had a session which was about 1 hour of information and 1 hour of analyzing work within the gallery. It was interesting and useful to apply what we had learned in the lecture, and I was always surprised by how quickly the nearly 2-hour seminar flew by. I found the second half of the course, in which we each examined a work of art, to be a bit disorganized. There were never enough machines for us to use, and it was unclear what we were supposed to do when we didnt have access to one of them. I also didnt feel equipped to analyze the works adequately without the assistance of Professor McClure or one of the TAs. Maybe one semester is too short to learn how to interpret data from all of the tests, but I think we could have been better prepared. A more technical midterm exam in which were tested on whether we can identify certain features might be more useful for the final project and paper. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course should have been limited to art history students, which would have led to a more focused in class discussion. I enjoyed and learned a lot from the sessions with curators and conservators affiliated with the YUAG. ",
            "\u00a0Professor McClure is extremely knowledgeable and understanding, he made an effort to meet me outside of class. It was great to have guest lectures from other experts in the field and conservators. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated the expertise of the course's staff. Professor McClure is incredibly knowledgeable, as are the other conservators at the Gallery who either presented in the weekly class or helped with our technical studies. Sometimes, however, the staffing felt slightly fragmented, particularly when Professor McClure had to leave on a courier assignment for the Gallery. Early in the semester, it was difficult to keep track of all of the new faces, though not the material in their excellent presentations. Similarly, weekly assignments were occasionally unclear: details such as expected length, to whom to ask questions, and how to submit assignments were not always clear. I think this is a product of the rotating presenters, who created their own assignments for the class. Perhaps this course could benefit from a slightly more centralized structure, with expectations more clearly discussed in the syllabus. In any case, I was excited to learn from many members of the Gallery's conservation staff, and I would hope that future versions of this course preserve that opportunity. "

            "\u00a0This class is great, take it! It offers a unique perspective on the history of art as well as the opportunity to get a close looking (or even to touch) work that you could typically only see in a museum. My only complaint about the class is that the final project takes up a lot of class time and is a bit disorganized, so just be sure to be proactive about getting the help you need to do it right. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any art history student interested in working to understand the knowledge that can be acquired through technical examination. My perception of works was deepened by this approach. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student with an art history background. However, it is really in depth and I think all of the students that really enjoyed the class were particularly self motivated and had some background in art. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in art conservation or art history in a serious way, this course was enlightening and exciting. I can now approach art viewing and understanding art objects in a more nuanced way ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone interested in art history. Especially as a non-artist, this course helped me understand how to approach art from a technical perspective. I have always been more comfortable with the \"history\" part of \"history of art\" -- that is, putting art in context, analyzing it as one might literature, and discussing artists' aesthetic philosophies. This course has helped me sharpen my technical understanding of how art is made and how that process shapes the work of art historians. Plus, this course is just fun: you will be in the Gallery every week to look at art up close, and often on the table in front of you out of its frame. I don't think the excitement of that experience will be lost on anyone. "
