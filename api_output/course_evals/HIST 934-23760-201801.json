            "\u00a0This course was interesting because it combined many thingsreadings and discussion, frank discussions about the PhD process from people at all stages, and workshops of work at all stages of completion. I found all three of these aspects very useful. I learned a lot about how other people experience the PhD process and some of what to expect. I also found the readings and discussions really interesting, and helpful in highlighting for me several things that I find particularly fascinating and want to explore further, such as cybernetics.

            "\u00a0This research seminar was a fantastic opportunity to do archive work, workshop a research paper, and get feedback from peers. The course was thoughtfully structured, with time devoted to readings, workshops/practicums, and even to an archive visit.\r\n\r\nIt's important to have venues for graduate students still in coursework to begin producing independent research, which they can submit to conferences (an important step in the process of professionalization the earlier the better), and also to start thinking about their dissertation. I particularly appreciated this course given that there are few graduate research seminars typically offered within either HSHM or History. ",
            "\u00a0I think the openness we all developed was incredibly helpful not only for our discussions about the PhD process, but also for our workshops and class discussions. I was fascinated by a lot of what we read, but since that was only a third of the class, I sometimes felt that our engagement with the readings wasnt able to get very far. Similarly the overall arc of the course readings and the connections between them did not feel particularly clear. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. It is unconventional in a way that I found really productive, not only for my learning, but also for my sense of myself as a graduate student in this department. The supportiveness of this classroom is something I have not found many other places at Yale, and it was very helpful. "
