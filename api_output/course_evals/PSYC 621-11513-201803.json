            "\u00a0Knowledge of relatively comprehensive literature on the topic of pleasure in pain; skills to summarize readings, make connections among them, and develop my own argument within 400 words. ",
            "\u00a0This class helped develop an ability to write and speak clearly about ideas in psychology, philosophy and cognitive science. The knowledge that I gained was drawn largely from a broad set of readings related to the seminar's topic of human effort, pain, and suffering -- but also from the insightful comments of the professor and of the other students. By the end of the course, I had gained a better understanding of why we engage in so many varied activities that are unpleasant on some level, and also an appreciation of how suffering can transform our lives for the better.

            "\u00a0Strengths: the writing assignment is useful; highly-engaging classroom atmosphere\r\nWhat can be improved: 1. the structure of different topics and the internal flow of logic among these topics are still not very clear to me;\r\n  2. In class, students sometimes go too much into personal anecdotes that are not necessarily strong support for an argument, or students go into seemingly interesting but irrelevant discussion. During these instances, I prefer some interruption or redirection of topic on the instructor part, to make the discussion more effective and constructive given the limited class time. There's always opportunities of other brilliant ideas not got to be mentioned if these less meaningful discussion is allowed to go on and on.\r\n  3. It would be good to have a summary at the end to conclude what we have discussed and what theoretical improvements we have made in the class. It will provide an effective review and remind people of the purpose of discussion, thus preventing them from rambling or aimless talking next time.\r\n  4. The feedback to the writing assignment is not detailed. I would prefer more useful feedback on what is good about it, or negative feedback on what specifically is bad. ",
            "\u00a0The only real weakness of the course is the limited feedback that students receive on the weekly responses to the readings. However, there were office hours that we could schedule to talk through anything related to the class. On occasion, the class discussions would veer a bit from the readings on which the discussion was based. This is not really an issue in itself, but perhaps it could be made clearer at the start of the semester that the discussions are meant to be a bit digressive at times. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting topic, diverse mix of opinions and students, engaging faculty\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some discussions could have been more structured to facilitate insights and take aways ",
            "\u00a0I thought the flow of the course could have been better structured.  At some times, it felt a little bit like reading up on available literature on X topic.  This said, the topic of the course was very broad, which is why the unstructured-ness makes sense. "

For anyone interested and willing to do the work of close reading of psychology studies, perspectives from philosophy, and other texts, it's an amazing opportunity to think and speak thoughtfully about fascinating concepts and human behaviors.
