            "\u00a0I have never taken a gender studies class before this one. It left me wanting to take many more. I learned so much about the history of masculinity and was able to compare it to the current events I am so familiar with. I also learned how to more effectively write papers, with perfections on my theses, introductions, body paragraphs, and conclusions. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me develop my writing. I got great experience writing more comprehensive thesis statements and developed a stronger authorial voice. This course also helped me develop my thinking, and how to pose questions for myself and others in order to develop my ideas in new ways. Being a high school student, I have not encountered text nearly as challenging as I did in this course, but I am glad I encountered it. It allowed me to work with my mind in a way that no class has ever done for me before. "

            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were that the professor taught us directly how he wanted our papers to look like, and our discussion sessions were very intuitive and interactive. The weaknesses of the course were seen at the beginning, where the readings were a little too dense and it took quite a bit of figuring out in order to understand the text. This could be improved by taking a little more time to make sure the first readings are understood and contextualized. ",
            "\u00a0The Quick takes are really great to me. Engaging with ideas and texts in short papers apart from our main ones helped me to engage with the readings again later and understand them better in class. The small size of the class was also a blessing in one way and a curse in another. We had more time to speak and ask questions, but if something was confusing there were less people to talk about the readings with and offer insight about the topic for. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because you don't need a vast knowledge of gender studies in order to engage with the class. The only things that are necessary are an open mind and a want to learn. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The subject material is not easy for many people to grasp, but the writing and thinking that one will do in this class is magical. The rigor of the material paired with an excellent professor made this class a great experience, and has helped me in how I think about this subject and how I just think in general. I have a whole new way of approaching the world after this course. "
