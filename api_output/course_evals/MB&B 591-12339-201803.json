            "\u00a0a lot of homework at the beginning without a lot of support... onramp wasnt enough to be able to navigate the course easily. later, a lot of code was provided which helped a lot with data analysis, but then didnt learn as much about coding. tricky balance to strike, and it was really helpful to go through a lot of it with the TAs. also modules were generally interesting and it was cool learning about diverse areas of research from the people performing it and analyzing real data sets!! ",

            "\u00a0I thought that the ability to have a mix of new and also repeated (from years past) projects was nice and diverse but the new projects though engaging were difficult to follow instruction on. Having clearer communication of expectations (even if the project may be open ended) would be helpful. There was also significantly more work for this course than any of my others which made it very taxing and I didnt know if more work really meant more benefit. ",

I don't think it is necessarily a good idea to make projects into group projects given that each student should learn as much programming as possible from this course because for many it is the only avenue to it. ",
            "\u00a0strength: many new information. TAs are really helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\ngreat TAs! very useful in class and out of class sessions - these were by far the most helpful parts of the course!\r\nhands on modules - I often found that what confused me in the lectures were clarified by doing the assignment\r\nperfect amount of time for completing assignments\r\nskeleton code was useful for learning how to do useful things in matlab in a short amount of time, without starting from ground 0\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nWould have liked to learn to how use pymol in addition to first glance "
