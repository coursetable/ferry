            "\u00a0My writing skills improved more through this course than any other course I've taken. I also got much better at handling long reading assignments, research, and challenging scholarly articles with complicated language. ",
            "\u00a0While my writing did improve throughout the course, I would say my critical and \"generous\" reading skills grew the most.  I feel that my ability to process and appreciate more difficult readings was greatly improved. ",
            "\u00a0I've obviously gained quite a bit of knowledge about the different theories of empathy and their implications. I've also improved my writing skills through the semester. For instance, I feel that I am now better able to write about complex topics with concise language. ",
            "\u00a0I developed an understanding of college-level writing that has allowed me to improve my communication skills, not only within English class, but also in other disciplines like chemistry. I also refined my abilities to craft long arguments, conduct research, and also find my own argumentative stylistic. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read critical essays and respond to them. I learned that writing is a process that takes drafts and drafts and is not a 'sit down and write 8 pages.' I learned that it is okay to scrap whole paragraphs - even whole pages - because it leads to improvements in your thoughts and analysis. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me developed my understanding of what makes a strong essay. I feel like I now have a better idea of what arguments (and different methods of arguing) are superfluous and which have more academic merit. Before taking this course, I would consider an essay well-written so long as there were no logical fallacies. Now I can see where hedging and specifying a lack of authorial intent can strengthen my argument; I now make sure that my arguments feel plausible both in the language I use and in the way I structure my arguments. ",
            "\u00a0The ability to write concisely, and to learn about the topic of empathy from a wide range of disciplines. "

            "\u00a0This course was the perfect introduction to college level writing. There were no weaknesses that I noticed. ",
            "\u00a0The assignments and activities were always very engaging and interesting, and I think the workload was appropriate. \r\n\r\nI think that the few lectures we had were the least useful part of the course, as I have a hard time paying attention during lectures and tended to space out. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Park was very engaging and generally kept all our discussions interesting.  That being said, sometimes the in-class discussions strayed from the reading topics, and I would have preferred to maintain a more set talking topic.  I felt the writing assignments were well structured and Prof. Park was very willing to answer any questions we had. ",
            "\u00a0A strength was the flexibility of the curriculum and the amount of focus on specific topics based on what the class needed. Another strength is the discussion based format of the class. A weakness is the tendency of discussions to go back to the same two to three individuals, making the rest of the class spectators unless they feel they have something truly insightful rather than a thought they are still working through. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is definitely the subject matter. I did not have a nuanced view of empathy before this class, so everything we explored was new and fascinating to me. Most of the readings were really engaging, especially  \"The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down.\" I'm sure it depends on your classmates, but discussions were almost always very insightful. ",
            "\u00a0The course is an English writing course, but there is little in-class support when it comes to writing just because there isn't enough time to cover course content while also allowing for ample writing workshops for argument-making. The instructor, however, goes above and beyond to schedule office hour meetings outside of class, in his own time! ",
            "\u00a0Justin did an excellent job of selecting interesting and difficult essays/stories to read for class. However, some of them may have been too difficult! Also, some things we read we never addressed in class. For the most part though, I was very pleased with the text selections and was interested in the material we covered. ",
            "\u00a0This course did a very good job helping me figure out my writing process. Because we were always writing, I became much more comfortable grappling with ideas, and figured out the best ways to talk through my work with others. I feel like my understanding of essay writing was greatly improved upon. I would've liked to spend more time as a class digesting some of our readings. I think there was the potential to get a lot more out of several of the articles we read, but we didn't spend a lot of time delving into them. ",
            "\u00a0The course touched on a lot of different topics within the theme of empathy, and the required readings were in general really inspiring and interesting to learn from. The professor was enthusiastic in engaging us into discussions and was wiling to share his opinion as well. A weakness of the course may be the limited time given to each student in terms of how our writing could be improved. The course structure could also be modified slightly so that more time could be allocated to the final part of the course (e.g. AI and empathy). "

            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0Engl 114 with Justin was a very good class overall! The readings were fairly interesting (some stuff about empathy and also a lot of cool stuff on race/feminism/gender/sexuality studies and Anne Fadiman book!) and the discussions were also pretty good. Justin was a very engaging and helpful professor - always eager to look over your work or answer any questions. In terms of feedback on the essays, I think he gave fairly good feedback on the arguments/structure of the essays, but not as much feedback on the style - which is VERY understandable since it would have taken a long time to mark up every sentence of a student's essay. \r\n\r\nDuring class, I think first going around in a circle to ask everyone one their impressions before going into full discussion mode was a good idea. However, sometimes, I feel it would have been better if the discussions had a bit more guidance, especially when they veered off into just a few people arguing back and forth which sort of made the discussions hard to follow. For the most part, I heavily enjoyed the discussion - both hearing from other people's points of view and because it was through the discussion that I grounded by understanding of the readings. \r\n\r\nThe workload was on the slightly heavier side but I think that's just because I am really really really really slow at writing essays, even 3-4 page ones. The reading didn't feel like it took a long time because most of it was very interesting. \r\n\r\nWe also did class presentations for our 3rd research essay which was very cool - it was nice to see how fellow students had approached the research essay and how they were exploring empathy. \r\n\r\nIn terms of content, I would have appreciate maybe doing a bit more on working on the mechanics of writing. I think what would have a helpful is if we did more of looking at a piece of writing, discussion with the class the good/bad of the piece, and then trying to rewrite it to be better. \r\n\r\nIn terms of content, I don't think I actually learned that many facts about empathy but I think my critical understanding of empathy improved. My writing also got better through the process of writing a few essays. \r\n\r\nThe class atmosphere was on the more chill side which I really appreciated - just made the class feel a lot less stressful. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely - I already have. It helped me grow a lot as a writer and exposed me to a lot of fascinating, life-applicable ideas. ",
            "\u00a0Yes.  The topic was interesting and new, and the readings provided varied outlooks without losing intellectual rigor or challenge.  While the writing was challenging, there are plenty of support at Yale to help. ",
            "\u00a0Its an interesting writing course, and it helps you improve your skillset and base of knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course, especially since it is one of the more interesting ENGL 114 sections. Justin is a great discussion mediator and provides useful feedbacks on essays, which is always appreciated. The workload is also very reasonable--and even a little generous at times when we need it the most (midterms/finals). ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Very good course with which to achieve a basic mastery of college level writing. The themed nature of each section makes for vivid discussion and ability to focus on one specific discipline across the entire course. ",
            "\u00a0I would most certainly recommend this course to others, especially to those who are not confident with their writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I feel like I'm more comfortable writing papers across the board, and I have a better understanding of the amount of work I need tout into a strong essay. I remember that after a paper in another class, the professor went over a list of common things she had seen in our papers. Everything she mentioned we had covered at the very beginning of this class. My writing across the board feels stronger, and I feel that I can see that improvement both in this class and my other writing classes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because the topic is worth our attention when empathy (and its related concepts) is a concept that is highly encouraged nowadays. As writing is an important component in our lives, it is also worthy for us to better our skills through writing courses as well. "
