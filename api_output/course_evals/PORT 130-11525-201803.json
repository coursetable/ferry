It was very interesting learning more about the language in connection with the culture. most notably things expanding outside of syntax and spelling. Like learning different vocabulary, colloquial language, and cultural phrases, and music references. "

            "\u00a0The course had many more strengths than weaknesses and was engaging at all times. I never felt as if something was simply being given as an assignment for the sake of it. I was engaged at all times and felt prepared to engage with my peers in a language I was somewhat familiar with. "
