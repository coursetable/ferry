I gave a presentation but it was within my individual lab. Additionally, somewhat more standardized guidelines would be helpful -- as is requirements were pretty unclear and ad hoc. ",

However, this sometimes meant that in less straight-forward projects, we didn't get so much feedback on how we were doing -- and this was a bit stressful for the theoretical work. ",
