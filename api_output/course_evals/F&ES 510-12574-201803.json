Would have been nice to at least learn about analyzing studies or reports so that even if we can't do it ourselves we can have an informed opinion about things that inform our work ",
            "\u00a0The class was awesome! Professor Reuning-Scherer has organized the course in a flexible way that everyone can learn in the way that works best for them. The workload is very reasonable and every assignment aided in my understanding of the material.  The only minor weakness (not a big deal) is that we were sometimes behind schedule and assignment deadlines changed from the syllabus. ",

However, I doubt students want MORE work (I certainly don't) so I don't have a remedy for how to get more practice...maybe offer external \"Jeopardy\" sessions? Or instead of office hours one day, have practice time?  Also, all my work got graded with comments on Canvas on what I had points docked for, but whenever I responded with clarifying questions on Canvas, they were never answered. ",

Jonathan does a fantastic job structuring the material/course progression, and provides resources for all different learning styles: engaging lectures (also available online, a nice bonus in scheduling flexibility), summary topic videos, super approachable in-person at office hours. ",
            "\u00a0JDRS is an amazing professor. He is ceaselessly engaging on topics that would be otherwise boring, and is unbelievably smart. If i did the course again I would do the flipped class. \r\n\r\nMaybe including R tutorials for some of the topics would be useful since students are left to learn that themselves, but maybe that is outside the purview of this class. ",

Having most of the questions be framed within the environmental sciences contexts made the course feel very applied and relevant. At times, I wished the course contained elements of teaching us how to utilize statistical softwares that are commonly used, because Minitab, while incredibly user-friendly, is not commonly used in the field. ",
            "\u00a0The instructor is dynamic and engaging, and the material is important to learn. Some of the assignments can feel tedious, however, and the teaching fellows were not all prepared to effective. Many assignments went ungraded for months and the TAs didn't always provide uniform answers to explain concepts clearly. I would certainly suggest greater scrutiny in selecting the TAs for this course going forward. ",

            "\u00a0The course is intended to be useful for people coming from diverse backgrounds. What can be improved, in my view is the use of examples that are more related to socio-environmental topics. \r\nAlso, the format in which the homework and exams are submitted on is not the most helpful one, neither as some feedback provided by the TA's . To really learn, I believe a \"review session\" should be organized in class and not only during office hours - which, by the way, should be scheduled to happen in a larger classroom and preferably separating undergrad and grad students. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the way this course was structured, and how Jonathan provided us with very in-depth course notes. I also appreciated that we could work on our homeworks in a group, since I found it very helpful to talk through questions and learn from my classmates. I also liked that our exams were take-home, since math exams have always taken me a very long time to complete, and I thought that our final project was a good way to culminate the course. ",

The assignments were really useful- particularly the final project, which brought together a lot of the material we had learned and allowed us to apply this knowledge to the real world. \r\nThe weakness is that the class moved really quickly and some material therefore seemed rushed.

The course moves very quickly and it was really easy to fall behind. The weekly homework assignments and the end of the semester project were really useful in cementing the things you learned during lecture.
