            "\u00a0how to think about musical theater more effectively and constructively ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the past decade in musical theater, but I more importantly learned how to have a critical eye on the pop culture around me. I learned a great deal also about the musical theater world and the processes of collaboration that produce new musical theater. I find that these lessons are helpful and can be extrapolated to other disciplines. ",
            "\u00a0I learned that theater is hard to analyze when you have a personal and temporal connection to it. On a basic level, I learned about at least 10 new musicals that I had never heard of before this class, and I learned so many new scores and lyrics. I also learned that we can't codify current trends. The field changes so much that we can't say what is a \"Current Trend(TM)\" because things are always changing. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a comprehensive understanding of the various angles of commercial musical theater--music, lyrics, book, design, marketing, economics, etc.--that shape how a musical is created/produced as well as how it succeeds/fails. By focusing our interrogation on the last ten years, we were able to track trends as well as inconsistencies in the overall market of musical theater in order to get a sense of how things have changed from the 20th century form and where they seem to be headed moving forward. ",
            "\u00a0I achieved a broader understanding of the context and climate surrounding the last ten years of musical theatre, and I ask learned that there is more to modern theatre criticism than just rebuking a show for its obvious faults. ",
            "\u00a0This was a fascinating review of some of the major musical theater shows in the past ten years and the trends that have emerged because of them. It offered insightful discussion of these trends and allowed me to gain a more critical eye in examining art of this nature. ",
            "\u00a0This class was terrific for the impassioned, committed musical theater fan looking to delve more into the art form academically, but in a contemporary sense, with an eye for \"what's next\" in the practitioner's sense too (whatever that means to the individual!).\r\n\r\nDan is adept in gathering Yale MT's best and brightest into a room each week, and creating a space for critical, intriguing, guided discussion of interesting topics. I'm so grateful to have gotten to take all three of his classes at Yale ",
            "\u00a0Gained access to a mode of critical thought surrounding contemporary musical theater as well as building up knowledge of the canon. Gained greater understanding of musical structure and marketing in order to create own works. ",
            "\u00a0A deeper understanding of musical theater in the past decade\r\nA better understanding of the different approaches to the analysis of musical theater ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to look at the bigger picture and draw out overall themes and similarities. In a field where there is so much going on and so many different aspects to look at, this in itself was quite a feat. Before that, even, I also learned to look at all the different aspects of creating musical theater (especially for commercial spaces like Broadway) that previously I had not been factoring in. "

            "\u00a0all strengths no weaknesses ",
            "\u00a0The strength is Professor Egan's energy and brilliance, as well as how excited everyone in the course is. The seminar was always top-notch. The only weakness I can think of is that the expectations for what we'd pull out of each seminar (e.g., figuring out the current trends) that sometimes seminars felt like we hadn't fulfilled what we'd set out to do...but I don't think that's a bad thing at all. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the class is a family, each student gets to lead a discussion, the course material is soooo relevant!, the discussions are so though-provoking and real, and you learn from every student.\r\nWeaknesses: this class is only relevant to those who know a lot of musical theater background, and sometimes the class seemed to spiral without Dan giving us a clear topic of conversation. It was a mess sometimes ",
            "\u00a0I think having discussion leaders most weeks was very helpful for moderating class discussion and keeping it on course such that it never felt like we were merely talking in circles. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Egan is great, and the seminar style really worked well for this class (I don't think it would work as well as a lecture). My only critique is that it could've been a little more organized, but the organic flow of discussion shaped the class in a nice way. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths -- \r\nThe diverse outcome of the application process and the incredibly strong cohort of students that were in the seminar\r\nThe blogs were a HUGE success - and allowed us the time and space to be thoughtful and articulate about MT.\r\nThe syllabus and Dan's flexibility!\r\nThe weekly leadership model, giving each individual one week of having a lot more stake in the discussion\r\n\r\nWeaknesses --\r\nNot too many were glaring. It was hard to figure out \"where we were going\" with this class, but of course that made for a fun and inquisitive final paper topic.\r\nNot a weakness, especially because of the related costs, but for a class about contemporary MT it would have been nice to get to see more shows that were running (professionally and within reach) rather than resort to just listening to a soundtrack or following a few YouTube clips. ",
            "\u00a0The quality of class is really based on the preparation/whims of the students, as it is entirely class discussion. It might be interesting to have a biweekly \"Song Deconstruction\" segment or more specific tasks that force students to think outside their own idioms (e.g. orchestration, producing). ",
            "\u00a0I loved this class. I felt I learned a lot, and was always engaged in the class. However, I would love to see some changes to class structure including small group activities, This might help the less gregarious people shore up their ideas so they may feel more comfortable presenting them to the class. ",
            "\u00a0The course is quite well-structured to cover a large amount of material so that by the end of the term one feels confident drawing out 'trends' or looking at the big picture and saying 'yes, I think I can make some conclusions or form some opinions about this.' I thought the format of blog posts before seminar was also incredibly helpful, because it allowed each of us to synthesize our thoughts (or come across thoughts we didn't even know we had), engage with those of others, and see where all our classmates were coming from before we stepped in the room. At the same time, however, sometimes this encouraged class discussion to go down a rabbit hole or a tangent, or else made in-class discussion a bit repetitive. That brings me to my biggest (but probably only) issue with the course, which was that at times the discussion felt like it was on a loop (cue: Preludes 'Loop'). It wasn't that nothing was different from week to week as we discussed vastly different sets of musicals, but just that conversation sometimes felt it had not developed or didn't take any steps beyond tackling the same themes or repeating what was said in a previous week. This wasn't unbearable, and class/assignments were still enjoyable, but sometimes was a little frustrating and I didn't know how to help get around it. However, this was the first time the class was offered/taught, and so I think we were all learning week to week what structures and methods worked best together. "

            "\u00a0if you have the chance to take any course at all with dan egan take it in a heartbeat. this is a fantastic seminar. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course, but other classes with Professor Egan are better suited to people from outside the musical theater world or people who have not studied musical theater before (I was the former, but have studied musical theater before, and I was an anomaly but loved it). With that said, it's a fabulous deep dive into the world of musical theater. Professor Egan is ABSOLUTELY incredible and leads a wonderful seminar each weekI truly looked forward to attending always. We also saw a huge range of live musical theater, which was an excellent experience and made the seminar much more than just a weekly meeting and papers. I am a huge fan of this course and absolutely recommend it to anyone who loves musical theater and has studied it formally before. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Yes. YES. YES! Dan Egan is the best professor at Yale, and you will have so much fun in this class. Musical Theater is such an important component of American culture that even if you aren't a super fan (like me), you will get a lot of it. Though the class can get heated and judgmental at times, the conversations you have with Dan and the classmates are invaluable. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Any student with an interest in musical theater--whether or not it's something with which they're involved on campus--would benefit greatly from this course, especially if you have plans to continue with a profession in the arts in your post-grad life. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Anyone who is interested in musical theater should take this class, even if you simply want more exposure to the theater world. ",
            "\u00a0This class was terrific for the impassioned, committed musical theater fan looking to delve more into the art form academically, but in a contemporary sense, with an eye for \"what's next\" in the practitioner's sense too (whatever that means to the individual!).\r\n\r\nDan is adept in gathering Yale MT's best and brightest into a room each week, and creating a space for critical, intriguing, guided discussion of interesting topics. I'm so grateful to have gotten to take all three of his classes at Yale, capped off with Current Trends.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in becoming exposed to a comprehensive survey of athe best (and worst!) of musical theater of the past ~10 years with a critical and discerning eye, take this class. Trust Dan's guidance along the way and it will be a fabulous and absolutely worthwhile use of a Yale College credit. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It forces us to think critically about American musical theater as it exists today -- thinking about both business and artistic decisions. It gives us a sense of how art and business are blended -- and gives us a chance to think about contemporary MT as an academic subject, delving deeper into something that is usually talked about with emotionality. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It was an exceptional. It was an amazing expirience to hear this group of minds talk about something that they were so passionate. Readings were interesting. I loved getting to know the shows that I knew less. Well worth taking. ",
            "\u00a0I would, if you are 100% interested in musical theater and don't think you could ever tire of it. It has a very enjoyable syllabus, a workload that is conducive to learning and understanding your own thought, a wonderful professor, and it is fun! That being said, I was expecting a bit more of a larger-picture takeaway that I didn't quite come away with, but that's okay-- I would still recommend. "
