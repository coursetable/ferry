            "\u00a0I learned many different lab techniques and learned how to indepdently carry out many different experiments and understand its relevance on a larger more conceptual scale. ",
            "\u00a0This course was really an independent one, so what you learned depends on your PI. My PI was fantastic so I learned many techniques and troubleshooting problems in her lab. ",
            "\u00a0I learned that wet lab research is stressful and never goes as planned. ",
            "\u00a0An all rounded experience of academic research, from conception of project, lab work, to presenting results in multiple media. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how to do research, got practice at writing a lab report (new to biology, for me), and got practice giving a presentation. Good class; totally depends on the PI as to what you're doing. ",
            "\u00a0I really appreciated the fact that I could do research for a class. It made committing time to a lab feel less daunting and it also let me analyze data during a scheduled time instead of squeezing that in at the last minute. ",
            "\u00a0I loved doing research at the Yale School of Medicine! I learned a lot of new laboratory techniques, and carried out my PI's project as well as did several experiments on my own out of curiosity. I learned how to write a journal/scientific article, and improved the skills needed to do an oral presentation. I also discussed my project during the poster presentation. Overall, this course MCDB 486 (which is necessary if you want the B.S., or MCDB 496 if you're doing the Intensive one), is quite informational and you will form a bond with your PI and learn so much. ",
            "\u00a0Reasearch has honestly been the best decision I made at Yale. I loved my lab and I think this is a great way to fulfill the thesis requirement. I learned how to be independent, understand science in hands on way, explain it to my peers and troubleshoot in an effective way. ",
            "\u00a0Conducting independent research; forming an experimental plan from beginning to end ",
            "\u00a0I gained a thorough understanding of lab procedure and protocol as well as more deep knowledge about biomedical implants and bone cells. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to design experiments, work with a research mentor, and generally engage in a meaningful independent research project. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to manage my own independent project as well as different lab techniques (cell culture, ELISA assays, etc.). ",
            "\u00a0I learned basic laboratory lab skills and what it takes to be a researcher in the field today. It was an eye opening experience and am grateful for having the opportunity to do so. The entire experience was surprisingly positive, even the negative results / hours of pipetting, was more rewarding than any other class I have taken at Yale. By the end of the poster symposium, I was glad that I had chosen MCDB as my major and could consider myself a scientist. ",

            "\u00a0The MCDB department should definitely subsidize the poster expense. ",
            "\u00a0This was fine. My main critique was that we had to make a poster and there was no funding available from the department. On top of that we also had to write a paper and a present a PowerPoint. Personally, I felt that the poster was super unnecessary and led to a large disparity in what students were able to do due to funding restrictions. This disparity was super clear at the poster symposium and thought it was pretty unfair. ",
            "\u00a0Though actual contact with the department or instructors was sparse until the final presentations, I very much welcomed this style. I have two points of suggestion:\r\nI wished there was a better leverage of the fact that we are conducting research at the same time for the major. Some sort of social platform like piazza, a discussion forum, or a facebook group could potentially let people discuss about their experiences and maybe even help each other out. The collaborative dimension of research was the one thing lacking from the whole experience.\r\nWhile it is very reasonable for there to be no funding for poster printing, I envision that the department could strike an agreement with tyco or docuprintnow etc. to ask for a discount for MCDB students, and in return encourage MCDB students to use that printing shop. It wouldn't incur additional cost to the deot but still alleviate the cost of posters for students and also give them a reliable shop to go for. ",
            "\u00a0Everything depends on your faculty PI, and it might be nice to have more resources available as students look for labs, or even doing this earlier in the Yale career would be good. \r\n\r\nStrengths: possibility for a lot of research. Quick learning curves in new labs, can develop good relationships with faculty or post-doc mentors. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: 10 hr/wk is pretty limited. Might have done 495/6 to actually accomplish something in lab. ",
            "\u00a0I think the strengths of this course are that it is flexible based on the lab you are in. I think something that could have been helpful for the final thesis submission was maybe having deadlines throughout for some students who needed more structure that could've been nice. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that this course allows flexibility in where you do your research, and is transparent on the requirements for the presentations and research paper. It would be great if there were more dates offered for the oral presentations, but that's not too much of an issue. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly I think its perfect as is. ",
            "\u00a0I think students should be placed in labs before their senior year and encouraged to try at least two labs before committing to the lab for their senior thesis. This will ensure that they have a varied research background and also that they understand that the culture of their first lab is not universal. I think that the experience of MCDB 485/486 depends on the lab culture/mentor so it is important that students spend more time thinking about this. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths--instructors could have sent more emails or reminders about the fall paper deadline and spring deadlines ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed doing the presentations and hearing about the work of my peers. I think that it was a rest experience to spend time in the lab for my undergraduate degree. ",
            "\u00a0The fact that we had to do a presentation, a poster, and watch another presentation was completely overwhelming. Most other STEM majors only require either a poster OR a presentation. ",
            "\u00a0I think the guidelines for the research reports could be more clear. I really enjoyed the oral presentations at the end of the term. But I think having a paper, poster, and oral presentation might have been too much. Maybe there could be a way to spread out these assignments so they don't all come right at the same time. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed my lab work as well as the lab I was working in. I wish there was more interaction before the final presentation/poster sessions, however. ",
            "\u00a0Really shouldnt be mandatory for MCDB. So many people arent actually into it, which just takes away resources and lab spots from those who are. Maybe let people write a lit review or take two advanced courses as a substitute for this research? ",
            "\u00a0I would have appreciated more communication between the course coordinators and the students earlier on, especially first semester. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - the course made good attempts to be designed to give students a real-world experience in lab research. The course syllabus made it clear that mentors and PIs were supposed to work closely with the student and give the student a lot of support.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - while the structure was good, the execution was poor. The expectations for what the instructors had set for the course and what my PI and mentor expected from me were very, very different. The course syllabus expected 10-12 hrs of work per week in lab; in reality I ended up working closer to 20 hrs/wk (25+ at the worst of times). There was a large emphasis on only what my output could be in lab and whether I could represent the lab well, which felt like a lot of pressure given my small beginning skill set and my limited time that I could put into lab as an undergrad. Additionally, I was stressed because I felt I did not know where to turn when I needed help. In particular, I was struggling to execute a protocol that had never been demonstrated to me and had already been told would be difficult. I wanted to turn to my PI and mentor for help, but in a previous conversation, my PI told me explicitly that I was a burden to the lab, a waste of their time and money, and that they were being generous by giving me a chance to be there. This left me unsure whether I could continue to ask them for support. I felt nervous asking my PI and mentor for feedback on my presentation, poster, and paper, although it was clearly outlined in the syllabus that I was supposed to do so. Ultimately, my mentor did give me very constructive feedback for my presentation, but neither responded to emails asking for feedback on my poster and paper.\r\n\r\nI am not trying to point fingers and accuse one party for blame, but I hope this problem could be avoided for future undergrads by making it clear what the expectations are for both parties. I think in my case, a large reason for the problem was due to a misunderstanding in what the syllabus expected, and what my PI and mentor expected. Because they should also have read the syllabus and signed a contract, I'm not sure how this disconnect became so vast, but I think they based what my performance should be on what previous undergrads had done in lab. These previous undergrads had all done the intensive course (which does expect ~20hrs/wk of work) and had aimed to go to grad school for research, which was different from my situation. I also wished for a better way to communicate to my PI and mentor what I needed from them in terms of feedback and support. I felt very blindsided by my PI's comments on my performance because my mentor had only ever given me positive feedback. When the protocol wasn't working, my mentor made it sound to me that it was only to be expected because it was so difficult, whereas my PI interpreted this as laziness and carelessness on my part. While laying out the need for support and feedback at the start of the year may have been the better approach, this also felt difficult to me because I was very intimidated, and my PI had made it clear to me when I first started working there that lab exists in a hierarchy, of which undergrads are the bottom. This resulted in a very poor experience for me, although it may be reflective of the true working world where your employer only cares about your work performance. ",
            "\u00a0This course requires so much more work than any other STEM major and should rid itself of some of the requirements. Having three things due the last week of classes was absurd. One of the presentations should be eliminated at the very least. ",
            "\u00a0There could be more communication between the course directors and students engaging in independent research regarding the research proposal and reports further in advance. ",
            "\u00a0The material was interesting and built on itself nicely throughout the course of the semester. The outlines given for each lecture were very helpful. "

With that said, besides the weekly lab work, I don't think the culminating workload of the course is too bad (15 page paper, poster, 10 minutes presentation). ",
            "\u00a0The experience that you will have is highly dependent on the lab you find yourself in and the research mentor who is guiding you. Almost everyone that I have met in the MCDB faculty has been extremely inviting and a pleasure to interact with so the odds are in your favor. But it would definitely benefit you in the long run to try and find a lab that you feel comfortable in and think you would enjoy spending time in. This arguably more important than the actual research you will be doing. You are going to be spending a lot of time on your topic, so you will become invested in it no matter what it is. You want to be able to enjoy the time in lab you spend on working. ",
            "\u00a0You dont have a choice if youre looking at this evaluation so... Just make sure you choose a lab with a nice PI and chill post-doc if youre starting in a new lab; youll appreciate it come Spring ",
            "\u00a0It's basically unavoidable if you want to graduate with a B.S. in MCDB. Since you have to take it, I can only advise you to be very, VERY careful when selecting which lab you work for. The critical thing is not just to choose a research topic you're interested in, but also to find a PI and mentor who actually want to mentor you. Find someone who actually enjoys working with undergrads and wants to see you grow because they care about you and your personal growth, not just as how much of an asset you'll be to their lab. Also, make sure your lab isn't falling apart and has enough money to sustain taking on another undergrad. Having equipment break down or working in a dirty space is not only unpleasant but can actually be quite unsafe. A lab that is strapped for funds and in such a stressful environment will inevitably filter that stress down to you, and this is NOT a working environment you want to be in! ",
