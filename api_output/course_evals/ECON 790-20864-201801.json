            "\u00a0Professor Washington was very helpful in showing us how to approach an academic paper critically.  There are clear patterns in how to present strengths and weaknesses in a paper, which she helpfully pointed out.  She also provided recent works in political economy, which was very informative. "

            "\u00a0The discussions were very useful and forced me to engage deeply with the material.  However, sometimes it felt that only a few students spoke during discussion.  Perhaps it would be best to assign a paper to each student to focus on so that all students speak similar amounts.  Moreover, sometimes we would prioritize papers that I found less interesting than others during a given week.  Perhaps it would be useful to ask the class at the outset which papers they would like to prioritize (although that sometimes occurred and students simply differed in opinion). "

            "\u00a0This is a great course for anyone who wants to specialize in political economy. The specificity of the discussions of weekly readings forced us to understand exactly what the paper was doing, so as to better our own ability as researchers. ",
