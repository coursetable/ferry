            "\u00a0This course gave me an overview of current topics and techniques in the field of robotics, giving me a relevant understanding of important topics to a field I work in. I also developed the skills necessary for completing an academic research project, including how to write an academic style paper. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about robotics! It was a very interesting course that covered a broad array of robotics topics, looking at the cutting edge research in each sub-field. I also developed my research skills significantly as I conducted novel research on a topic that I found very interesting. All-in-all, I am much better equipped at discussing robotics and conducting robotics research in the future. "

            "\u00a0Great course - no recommendations. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: grants high level of independence to students in pursuing research on their own timelines. Strong academic rigor due to immersion into state-of-the-art papers in the field of computer science and open discussion about these papers. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes discussions became redundant week after week, as we'd hone in on the same underlying themes. Perhaps enforcing discussion with a certain context i.e. today let's only dissect the technical aspects of this paper, or today let's only talk about the ethical implications. ",
            "\u00a0This course allows for hands on learning with the main project, which is a very successful model. It is a bit of a short time span, but that forces students to focus and stay organized. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Having the students read research papers, having the students present on a topic, allowing the students to choose their presentation topic, having the students conduct research, the funding available for the research, the help provided by Sarah\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the papers were just to long to read, like 50 pages long. I would have been nice if all papers were confined to 20 pages or less. "

            "\u00a0If you want to spearhead your own research project, practice public speaking, and become savvy about the current state of robotics via conference and journal papers, this class is for you. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course because it is interesting and the workload is not too great, but pushes you and is very interesting and tailored to your interests. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in robotics, then absolutely. You learn a lot, you get to do amazing work with a team of dedicated students, and you have a blast as you apply yourself. "
