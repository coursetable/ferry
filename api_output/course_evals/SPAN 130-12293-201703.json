            "\u00a0This course really improved my Spanish skills and knowledge. I had never spoken only Spanish for 50 minutes and did so every day of the week. ",
            "\u00a0I feel more confident now with my Spanish speaking skills and grammar since this course met every day and focused around discussions. Even though most of the grammatical concepts we covered were already familiar to me, I feel like I can use different verb tenses more smoothly now. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a far greater understanding of the Spanish language. ",
            "\u00a0Spanish L3 reestablished the foundations of Spanish that I learned in high school, while adding a lot of new skills and grammar. This course really helps you develop your speaking skills as students are meant to speak only Spanish during the class period. By the end of the year, I saw that there was a huge improvement in the students willingness and ability to speak aloud in class and contribute their ideas. ",
            "\u00a0My grammar, speaking and listening skills were greatly improved throughout the semester. Professor Asensio is one of the best professors I have had while at Yale, and she was greatly responsible for my having such a pivotal semester in terms of development. ",
            "\u00a0I developed stronger speaking and grammar skills ",
            "\u00a0I learned new new tenses and vocabulary. I also read my first short book another language was an amazing feat. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0You usually know what to expect as everything is very nicely laid out in the course packet. Sometimes things were a little rushed because there was so much that had to be accomplished in one semester. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course include the fun, energetic, and conducive environment created by the Professor for language learning. ",
            "\u00a0This class was great in its variety of different ways to engage with the language  there were short story readings, in-class discussions, news presentations, grammar presentations, worksheets, textbook activities, and simple question and answer sections. All of these different activities and methods merged together and helped us really develop our speaking, critical thinking, and reading abilities.   \r\n\r\nOne way this class could be improved would be to have more in-depth writing assignments. I felt that the ones I did were more simple than my classmates were capable of. It would be cool to see different writing assessments, like one that focused on superlatives for example  or one in future tense. I felt that the ones we did were always in the past and very basic in their structure. I didnt feel very challenged by them. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the quizzes were significantly harder than the tests. Even still, both were fairly reasonable. ",
            "\u00a0The class is really strong in drilling the different grammar and sentence structure concepts into you. The nightly homework is helpful and the order of the curriculum is done really well. Not a strong culture class, it's really mostly about language skills. ",
            "\u00a0We need to speak more. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0You can only take this course if your placement test indicated you should, but if you need the language credit, I suggest continuing Spanish because it is taught very well here. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The daily practice you get from this course makes you a much stronger Spanish speaker. The work can be tedious at times, but overall, I came out of this class with a much stronger grasp on verb tenses and conversational skills. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student because of how wonderful Professor Maria Pilar Asensio-Manrique is. ",
            "\u00a0I really would  I feel that I was able to gain more confidence in my command of the Spanish language. I wouldnt have wanted to learn it any other way. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend taking this class - Mainly with Pilar Asensio. Quality of instructor can have a great affect on experience, so try to be in her section if you can. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely would recommend to anyone looking to improve their Spanish or fulfill the language requirement. You won't become fluent over a semester but it's a nice departure from other classes and can be fun ",
            "\u00a0Yes. You learn a lot of vocabulary and how to properly write and form sentences. "
