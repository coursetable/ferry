            "\u00a0I LOVE this course. It was so rewarding to do relevant, wanted community health work in New Haven. Debbie does an excellent job preparing students for the obstacles that come up in projects like these, and also in helping us understand that community work has a huge potential to go wrong/be very paternalistic, and how to avoid that. As we discussed in class, some of the readings and lectures were a bit too abstract for me. Sometimes it was really helpful to think of situations in completely new and *very* big-picture ways, but other times it was a little over my head. ",
            "\u00a0I was initially very excited to take this course. However, I believe the structure needs a lot of improvement. The beginning of the course was very slow and involved a number of assignments that seemed arbitrary. The book we read was one of the greatest wastes of my time. The quizzes were graded unfairly as some TFs were WAY more lenient than others. During an in-class evaluation we were told that we could have gone at our own pace in terms of submitting IRB and starting recruitment but this was NOT what I, my group, or anyone else in our class thought. Because of this, IRB submissions did not happen until right before spring break meaning that recruitment either started during spring break (by group members who might have been in town) or had to wait until after spring break. This was not sufficient time to recruit. Because of this, most of the class was very behind schedule when it came time to write up the final papers and reports. While this is a community based course there was very little discussion of how to conduct community based research. There was almost no talk about topics such as social determinants of health, health equity, or ethics of community based research, topics which seem extremely important to conducting community based research. ",
            "\u00a0not as fun as I expected it to be. Was a bit more dry with less hands-on practice than I anticipated. ",
            "\u00a0The course was made difficult by a lack of engagement from our preceptor, so the plans we had for our research practicum were not able to happen.  This completely depends on the group and project, though, and other groups had great experiences with their preceptors. ",
            "\u00a0Project itself was fantastic, loved the opportunity to learn more about community research and engage in a hands-on experience. ",
            "\u00a0Every second I spent both in this class and working on things for this class was nothing but pure hell.  I regretted taking it every day.  Class sessions were the biggest waste of time, even in a school where almost every class is a waste of time.  If you asked me what we were supposed to have learned, I really could not tell you.  Class sessions seemed haphazardly thought out with no real continuity in material or any real content to be learned.  Seemed to me like it was a class just to have a class with no real point.  The projects are not projects that can be completed in a semester, let alone when you have to start from scratch at the beginning of the semester.  You can't even really start working on your project until after spring break and at that point the semester is almost over.  The projects seemed like they were meant for us to fail at them.  We made no real, meaningful findings and it seems like we harmed the New Haven community more than we contributed to it.  I was really excited about perhaps learning some research skills in this class but I really learned nothing and it seemed like all the time I put into it was a complete waste.  I wish I had dropped it in the middle of the semester but I felt bad leaving my group behind. ",
            "\u00a0This was the worst course I have every taken. I mean, I am honestly shocked that a school like this has a class this is so horrible and unproductive and just shit-tier public health practice.\r\n\r\nStrengths: I got to meet people doing real public health (preceptors) through this project. Other than network building, none. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Literally everything else. Professor ran this class like a 3rd grade class room having us produce assignments that were busy work. I don't pay this much money for busy work. Class time was wasted doing useless assignments. i mean the whole class was a weakness. TAs didn't do anything. Sure as hell do not deserve the money they are getting paid. ",
            "\u00a0Really good practical experience ",
            "\u00a0It was a good course and I learned a lot but the pace is so rigorous.. I really think it needs to be split into 2 semesters ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this course. I had a great experience working with my group and our assigned organization. I had never done qualitative research before and this course was a great way to learn about how to conduct it and actually go out and do a project, write a report, and present the data. It is a lot of work to carry this out in a condensed time period but I learned so much. ",
            "\u00a0N/A ",
            "\u00a0It was overall a good course, where the in-class components mostly complemented all of the projects well. Strengths: gives public health experience to those who may have none and really teaches communication skills and group working skills well. Weakness: Some of the in class components need to be changed into something better and more relevant. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the class but believe it should be year-long, there is almost not enough time to complete a project in only one semester. I also do not think the lecture sessions were beneficial and did not relate to the work we were doing precisely. ",
            "\u00a0The class itself was interesting, but the students in the class defined the experience (for better and for worse). My group was wonderful, and we worked well together on our community project which was a great learning experience and way to apply our public health skills. The class time was not always an effective use of time- mainly due to some students not being engaged or interested in being engaged with learning community health research tools and skills. The project was the main focus of the course, but an equally important component was learning the necessary skills to conduct future community health projects and research. This second component was not made clear at the beginning of the course, and as a result some students were frustrated when class time was spent learning these skills that may not have directly applied to their specific community project. However, overall the class project was interesting but I think there could be a more clear emphasis on the time that will be spent learning community health research skills to ensure that all students in the class are interested and invested in being there, to create a better learning experience for the entire class. ",
            "\u00a0While I greatly enjoyed the course, it could be very disorganized at times. I definitely enjoyed the hands-on process of running a research project and wish more class time could be devoted to that. ",
            "\u00a0This course could have been so valuable and beneficial, but it unfortunately fell very short. It was over-crowded, with too many projects for the instructor to handle at once. The course work at the beginning of the semester seemed like more busy work than beneficial to working on the projects. The project descriptions that we viewed in the fall semester were not at all what we ended up doing. The rush to start and finish the projects all after spring break was impossible to deal with schedule-wise. On top of all of this, your group makes or breaks this class. Unfortunately my group almost broke me. It was extremely difficult to work together, and overall it just felt like the work piled on just a few group members. Unless you are 10000% confident you can work together as a group, trust your group members, and really feel invested in the project itself, do not sign up haphazardly or naively think that you can't possibly end up with bad group members. Critically think about what you want from this class, what the project you are looking into will look like in the long term, and look to see if you have the skills and mindset required for the project. ",
            "\u00a0This course was among the worst I've ever taken. It was ill-formatted, ill-instructed, and ill-planned. We were not provided with support from the professor or the teaching fellows, and were largely left on our own to accomplish our project. Our preceptor was largely MIA. We were tasked with completing reading quizzes for the first two months that took up most of class and group time. We only really began our project directly before spring break, and by the time we returned we only had a month to accomplish our project. Guidelines and instructions were not clear. We were not provided with rubrics prior to assignment submission. Feedback was unclear - or not provided. If you get assigned a group like ours, where only a few people are working on the assigned project and the others slack off, do not expect any sympathy or extra help from the professor and be prepared to take on extra work for more people. This class also had no social justice lens or component, and research ethics and community-based involvement and best practices were barely touched, which is problematic when there's a group of privileged Yale kids going off into the community to work on these projects (with organizations that do not necessary even want them - or community members who don't want it or think we are focusing on the wrong things; in temporary positions where we are attempting to help but are often creating more work for others; and when we are not actively engaging with community members or those in partnered organizations). Course was inherently problematic, chaotic, and emotionally and physically stressful. This class needs a complete revamping - restructure it entirely. Get rid of silly class activities (skits, quizzes) and make time for meaningful group work. Find a way to ensure that all groups consist of at least a handful of individuals who want to work on the project and will put the dedicated time in. Find preceptors who want to work with students and will communicate regularly and have clear expectations (and do-able expectations). Provide more consistent and timely feedback, and let students know how they are doing as they go along. Make group sizes larger (some only had 3 students, while others had upwards of 6). Ensure that projects are community-focused, not just research-focused. ",
            "\u00a0This course was not what I expected it to be. It felt all over the place and very rushed. The group component was necessary but difficult, as my group dynamics were not good. However, the strength of this course is that I learned a lot about myself, my role in a group, and what I expect from other group members. I think this course could be a year long so as to not feel so rushed. Further, I think class time could be more productive. I also think their should be group evals throughout the course, so group members are kept in better check. It is amazing to me why some people signed up for this course. The individuals who barely did any work caused a lot of stress on those individuals who did the majority of the work. This then led to other classes being pushed aside, and a lot of stress over the duration of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: I was able to conduct research with a local org in New Haven, I got to work with a team\r\nWeaknesses: the book wasn't helpful, I wanted to learn actual skills, I used skills from a different class to apply it to this class (qualitative methods, danya keene), I feel like we wasted a lot of class time learning theory. There was also a class that was triggering for me as a student of color that was about \"colonization\" or how we (as in White majority students at YSPH) should think about community health work for populations of color. I don't remember specifics, but felt uncomfortable as I was surrounded by White classmates. I wish we had more time to actually conduct community research and felt like we wasted the first couple months of class. We only had one day to conduct focus groups, which was not enough. Also, my groupmates were not instructed on how to code qualitative data (except for me and one other groupmate) so that was really tough for me and the other groupmate to figure out emerging themes. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course is so important for those who have not worked in public health previously, but also so much more valuable to those who have. It's a real challenge to teach principles of good working relationships to those who have never worked in teams (over extended periods of time). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: provides real experience working in a public health capacity with local nonprofits and agencies, and therefore provides students with insight into the inner workings of these agencies and their real problems.\r\nWeaknesses: the course doesn't allow for prerequisites, but requires a lot of statistical or qualitative work to carry out the projects, which in turn puts more or less pressure on group members who have those skills compared to those who do not. There is not enough clarity among the groups as to what they need to be doing to achieve the outlined goals. There was a lot of misunderstandings and poor communication between the preceptor agencies and the groups. Many groups commented on how their project turned into something totally different when they began class versus what was described to them before classes began. There needs to be more oversight by the instructor for additional clarity for both of these areas of the course, especially with providing students with additional resources for areas where they have yet to develop the necessary skills to complete the course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The experiential learning atmosphere was extremely impacting. The course paired well the conceptual with the practical in a manner that has been unmatched by my other courses.\r\nWeaknesses: This class spent a bit too much time on the theoretical and not enough time on the actionable work for the organizations. Instead of a 50-50 split a 60-40 split of class time spent on tangible work would be a better use of time. ",
            "\u00a0The composition of the  course and marrying theory with practice was strong. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course provides a good way for applying some of the concepts learned in other courses to the work of a community organization. I think this course would benefit from moving to a bigger classroom that can better facilitate group work. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, it was enjoyable to work with a community partner. There were readings assigned at the beginning of the semester to provide a more didactic edge to the class - these were at times interesting, but overall a little too heavy and not that useful. We could have spend more time at the beginning of the semester focusing more on the project and less on the literature associated with projects. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: This class provides the most hands on experience you will be able to have during your time at YSPH. The art of building and sustaining community partnerships is the best part of the class. The teaching fellows and Debbie also do a great job at pairing your personal preference with a community organization that reflects those passions. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: You are working with the same group the entire semester. If there are rocky group dynamics that that might lend itself to a difficult semester. ",
            "\u00a0I honestly did not really get too much applicable knowledge from the class other than navigating group dynamics and working on how to abridge a project to adjust for time constraints. I did appreciate the relationship that we were able to build professionally with an organization in our New Haven community. The course book that was used to teach the theory behind evidence-based public health practice did not actually teach me, but the quizzes on the book every week led to us speeding through the information, only to be tested on small details for the long and dense chapters. This also led to the front-loading of all theoretical material and the rushing toward completion of our actual projects toward the end of the semester. This could be improved by distributing the theoretical material through the semester or the assignment of certain components of the course (IRB) to the previous semester or before the spring semester begins.

When she spent time with each group, she was very knowledgeable, attentive, and helpful. As a student, I always felt that she was giving me her undivided attention when I sought her out for questions or support.

            "\u00a0The specific aspect of the instructor's teaching that I struggled with was the review of the quiz we took moments before. It is not already graded, so in many cases, we did not know what we ended up answering and did not get too much usable information out of its review. Similarly, because of the unnecessary specificity of the questions on the quiz, the review time was spent on relatively useless and small points from the book chapters. By structuring lectures to teach the concepts from the book, rather than just going through the quizzes in over an hour, I believe we would have really understood and been able to apply relevant concepts.

You do not learn anything at all, do not find any meaningful or real findings, and waste a bunch of time working with people you probably don't like.  I can't describe in words how much of a waste of time this class was.  I wish someone had warned me not to take it. ",
            "\u00a0Horrible, the worst course i've ever taken. \r\n\r\nDO NOT take this course. Honestly, just go ask a professor, literally any professor, and see if you can do research or practice with them. This class was a massive waste of time, money, and effort and should not even be offered at this school. \r\n\r\nSeriously, do not take this class. It was really bad. Take anything else. ",
            "\u00a0YSPH is very research-focused and I am really glad I got the chance to do more practical project-based work ",
            "\u00a0workload is intensive ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. I would let them know that it is a lot of work but it is an amazing hands on learning experience. ",
            "\u00a0N/A ",
            "\u00a0A course that gives you public health experience in community research/work that has heavy emphasis on group-work. Yes I would recommend it because there are very few courses that have a real-life component like this one. ",
            "\u00a0This course is for students interested in learning how to conduct community based practice and research AND actually conducting your own community projects in the New Haven area. This course is very time intensive, and the project is done under a very tight deadline throughout the semester. If you are invested in your project and establish good group dynamics early on, your project will be enjoyable and successful. I would recommend this course IF you are truly interested in the subject and willing to commit to your assigned project. Do not take this course simply to fulfill the Practicum requirement- this course is more than a practicum as it also teaches you to tools to conduct community research and practice. If that interests you and there is a project or two that you are interested in working on, then definitely take this course. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed this course, but also feel I lucked out by having a good group to work with. I know of other students had a very negative course experience because of their group members. ",
            "\u00a0Truly think about what this class is going to bring you before you take it on. It took SO MUCH time and effort, with little return in my opinion. Yes, I developed something new, and saw a project from start to finish. But there are many ways to do this more effectively, and to find a project you actually care about/aligns with your interests. This class fell very short from my expectations and ended up being much more exhausting, difficult to deal with, and a lot of stress/heartache. Carefully consider what you want your semester to look like, what group you may be with, and why you want to take this course. If you have the opportunity to do similar work outside of this class, then don't bother with this course. If you truly think that a class setting for a scrambled and hodge-podge research project is something you can handle/want to tackle, then by all means take this course -- you will definitely learn a lot. Especially about crisis management/ time management/ how to deal with difficult group members. ",
            "\u00a0If you like emotional chaos, minimal explicit feedback and clear expectations, turbulent group dynamics, a ton of work, and problematic course goals and objectives (with minimal discussion of community-partnernship ethics and research ethics - or social justice), take this course. Otherwise, don't. It was truly the worst class I've ever taken (and I've been in quite a few). Biggest academic mistake of my life - did not learn anything new, did not feel supported in any way, did not assist with anything meaningful in the community. This class totally misses the mark, and YSPH should take a careful look at the syllabus and strategize about how to better offer a practicum-based course, if at all. Perhaps just allowing students to form their own community-based partnerships and creating their own practicum experiences for credit would be a more worthwhile and useful start. DON'T TAKE THIS COURSE - or, if you do, be warned. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to another student. I think it causes too much stress for what it is worth. If the course was somehow \"fixed,\" though, to ensure equal group contribution from all members, I think it would be more worthwhile. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this class to another student because I didn't come out of it with any tangible skills that I could use with future employers. I just got a community health research opportunity, but given to me with little to no direction ",
            "\u00a0A challenging semester on many levels, but an important experience for years to come. Carefully consider your assigned project and group before accepting. ",
            "\u00a0This course will give you practical experience in the public health world. Therefore it will be challenging, frustrating, and tedious at times as you work on your project. This fully represents actual work in the field and needs to be considered. Any student looking for an easy course, should not take this course. It is challenging, though ultimately worthwhile. ",
            "\u00a0A great learning experience. ",
            "\u00a0Community-based participatory research principles should be something that everyone leaving with an MPH should be have a basic familiarity. This course is difficult and is largely dependent on your group dynamics.  However, a lot of learning and great work done with the community.  I commend Debbie for her strong partnerships with local organizations and her ability to mentor us through sticky situations. A valuable investment of time. Be ready to do the work. IF you are, I would recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0This class is one of the most time consuming classes you will take at YSPH, but if you are able to time manage well and keep the community's needs at the forefront, then this can lead to a tremendously rewarding experience. You will do a lot of work with your organization and the most efficiency and productive efforts will inevitably be in person, thus be aware that the learning in this class expands beyond the classroom into the New Haven community. You should feel comfortable with your people skills and ability to work with community board members in order to do a good job in this class. ",
            "\u00a0The course incorporated both theoretical review of evidence-based public health practice, thought they were not done equally or effectively for the objective of the course and the individual projects. I would not take this course unless absolutely necessary or if the curriculum or structure was changed drastically, because, to me, it was much more work than it was worth in knowledge or application of concepts.
