            "\u00a0This course was conducive for the discussion of multiple controversial topics including politics and discriminations. The instructor acted a very good facilitator with leading great examples. As a class, we would have appreciated more rigorous historic structure to the course regarding the major milestone articles or figures in social behavioral sciences. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - this course is the most important topic of public health. Made me think critically and reconsider some of my own opinions and open my eyes to things I hadn't previously considered. Lecturer great at stimulating interesting discussion.\r\nAreas of improvement - certain people in the class spoke a lot more than others, there wasn't much nomination of people to speak which I would have liked. Very poorly organised lecture slides - trying to make summaries of them was difficult. Would have liked lectures that were clear, concise, categorised with the ability to make good summaries of. ",
            "\u00a0Great course and the best teachers and best learning environment\r\nStrengths: Easy going class, camaraderie between teacher and students, great involvement\r\nWeaknesses- focus on race and American Black White disparities, there are international students who come from backgrounds with other disparities that also need to be focused on\r\nWould have liked a more international focus on each topic that was taught\r\nEspecially welcomed the Teacher who came from another college and also Ms. Shannon for her approachability and her knowledge of the subject\r\nEnjoyed writing the op ed and the fact that there were not many assignments that took our time, so could devote the extra time to personal reading and keeping up. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: It makes you think critically and think about different determinants of disease besides the usual pathway risk factor to outcome. It opens your mind to other important things in research and public health\r\nWeaknesses: I feel that most of the things taught were not applicable enough. The instructor provided useful examples of how the concepts were applicable to real life situations but I did not learn how to apply myself these concepts or how to integrate these concepts in my career as researcher. For my it was kind of abstract although useful and made me think differently ",
            "\u00a0The course has a lot of potential, however there are significant weaknesses.  My main grievances with the course are: \r\n1.  Strong liberal political inclination\r\n2.  Failure to address multiple health disparities (e.g. rurality vs urbanity, veteran's status) with primary focus/emphasis on racism and socioeconomic status.\r\n3.  Lack of formal syllabus\r\n4.  Lack of in class discussion of lengthy assigned readings ",
            "\u00a0It was helpful to understand social and behavioral theories and research methods. However, I felt the topics discussed were quite broad and focused on public health issues in the United States. As an international student, it was sometimes difficult to understand the contexts of the issues and participate in the discussion. Still, the class discussion and assigned readings helped me to learn and critically think about various public health issues with the framework of social epidemiology. ",
            "\u00a0The course was certainly very engaging, and the professor did his very best to foster positive discussion. The topics were all very interesting and incredibly useful for the course. Some suggestions for improvement: creating more structured lectures as it was often hard to follow along the topic and difficult to draw back to the bigger picture of the course as a whole; allowing for more group activities and smaller written assignments in between; and being more transparent about the grading process for participation in class since that was not very clear. ",
            "\u00a0The course was well taught. The case studies were very helpful in relating coursework to real life situations. The only problem with the course was that the assigned readings were too long compared to available time. ",
            "\u00a0the use of videos (especially the Hill documentary) was an effective way to illustrate concepts and spark discussion.\r\nreadings were at times long and very theory-heavy - probably could be streamlined ",
            "\u00a0Overall this course was a positive experience. It was thought provoking and was very beneficial to discuss with the professor and the class about these complex topics. The course was not clearly/logically laid out, did not have a defined structure or progression through material. Readings were not applicable to discussions many times. The major benefit to this class was the discussions and learning alternative perspectives on complex topics. ",
            "\u00a0This is a huge subject area so difficult to distill it into 6 weeks. Yusuf is passionate, experienced, and knowledgeable, and Shannon was a great facilitator. Weakness of the course was difficulty in ensuring I had covered the required material prior to the exams so a tad more structure and focused readings might be useful. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the class, I just really wanted more discussion. I think it would have helped the material to come alive more for people. There was a strong need for talking out situations. It would have been great to hear different points of view on various issues. ",
            "\u00a0Super interesting class - talked about many interesting topics on how society and health interacts. Some of the topics really made me reflect on how I can decrease the health disparities through controlling social factors. I particularly liked the open discussion opportunities in every class session. It was an interesting learning experience to hear all types of opinions. I would like to have more summary slides at the end of each lecture. I felt that I understood the concept in class while talking about it, but when I needed to refer back to the slides to refresh, I was not able to recall the key words all the time. Having a summary slide including keywords and key concepts would have been really beneficial. ",
            "\u00a0It was a great course , there is enough time for discussion in almost every class . Always encourage every student to participate . ",
            "\u00a0This course could have been much more intellectually stimulating and informative than it was. Given that so many of us were taking the course after several years in the workforce or in health care training, there should have been more of a focus on experiences we already had and the relevance to our work. I also think a case-study method would have been much more instructive for a course like this one. Alternatively, a course that went into more detail on the history and terminology of the issues we were discussing would have been more useful. I feel like I came away having enjoyed some in-class discussions and the opportunity to think about certain social issues, but not having learned much new. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: Great knowledge and resource person, extremely humble and caring and a great teacher- group discussions were a great method and he came and partook along with the students during the discussions\r\nWeaknesses: Use of white board more effectively, markers often not working, slides font too small to be read often and also not giving out references for reading like standard textbooks or other research. \r\nScope for improvement: Text book recommendations, also asking us questions that we might have had opinions about, also asking students about involvement in his research work . Opportunities for involvement in research ",
            "\u00a0He provides a good learning environment and stimulates discussion in class\r\nCould improve his class explaining how to apply these concepts in real life scenarios. Also, he could take more time to really explain concepts and models in depth. ",
            "\u00a0Nice guy with good intentions.  Understandably focused on his main field of interest and tended to underemphasize fields outside of his area of expertise.  Did a real nice job trying to make course adjustments following a student input session approximately halfway through the course.  He actively tried to include historical context, discuss disparities in other countries, etc...  The teaching assistant Shannon Whitaker was terrific - actively engaged the class, was present at all class meetings, and readily available. ",
            "\u00a0He tries to help students to think about public health issues in diverse ways. It was helpful to learn topics with class discussions and group work in a casual atmosphere, and also various materials like watching documentaries. I think it would be better if the reading assignments or the class materials included more of the background information about issues that will be addressed in each class because sometimes, open discussions were rather confusing to understand the theories. ",
            "\u00a0Yusuf was an engaging instructor and helped foster multiple discussions. He did his best to include and involve students in critical discussions. However, as mentioned earlier, the class was not as structured and it was often difficult to draw back to the larger picture. ",

",
            "\u00a0Very thoughtful, encouraging of discussions, willing to field questions. Did not always explain things clearly. Did not progress through the course in a logical way that built on previous topics. ",
            "\u00a0The voluntary mid course evaluation that Yusuf did showed tremendous leadership. He responded to every bit of feedback and implementated changes immediately. A good example for the rest of us. On a side note, a very snappy dresser. ",
            "\u00a0The instructor was great. I definitely enjoyed the matter in which he thought about SBS. I do wish we had more discussion. Towards the end it seemed that was coming but I preferred to have it more in the beginning. Also I thought his power points were helpful but I would have preferred them posted before class as it would help me to follow along better. I spent more time taking notes in order to comprehend the class.  But overall I did like having him as a teacher. ",
            "\u00a0Yusuf had many examples from his own experience to draw into the class, which was nice to hear as it helped me build the connection between class and practice. I also liked that he used real examples (health campaigns, published papers etc.) to elicit class discussion on topics we covered. ",
            "\u00a0Dr Ransome is a great instructor. He is very helpful and always welcome questions and explain in details . Consistently very open to diverse opinions and do all what he can to make sure all questions are answered whether during the class or after it. ",
            "\u00a0Yusef is really nice but at times struggles with timing and managing discussions within the classes.\r\noften let particular voices dominate the conversation and did not encourage every student to participate ",
            "\u00a0Yusuf is a very thoughtful and smart instructor, but I think he could have done a few things to ensure that we got the most out of the course, including: (1) more depth on the terminology and facts in this space; (2) more exchange of experiences between students, since there was so much we could have learned from one another about social foundations of health in different countries and across different sectors; (3) provided readings that were shorter and more relevant, so that people actually would read them all and that we would then discuss them in class.
