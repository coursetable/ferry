            "\u00a0Learned more about Brazilian culture through literature and music. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to better communicate, read, and write Portuguese. I developed the skill of discussing different issues in Portuguese. I learned so much about Brazilian culture, and the style of language learning that is used in the classroom is much more effective than what you will find in other language courses. There is an emphasis of learning through usage of the language. Going to class was a pleasure every day. We read a book and a play in Portuguese. ",
            "\u00a0I have learned so many grammar rules that can be applied in daily conversations and writing. Most importantly, I have learned how to communicate more colloquially , learning day to day expressions and jargons used by the people of Brazil. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of conversational portuguese, perfected my grammar structure and tenses, and learned a great deal about modern issues in Brazil! ",
            "\u00a0Listening, speaking, & writing skills in Brazilian Portuguese. \r\nLearned more about several cultural aspects of Portuguese speaking countries. "

            "\u00a0No weakness. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is the instructor, who is very enthusiastic and prepared for class. Not a minute is wasted! Another strength of this course was the emphasis on using the language. The integration with the other Portuguese classes was also good. We had many chances to speak in class and get corrected because of the intimate class size. I think one improvement could be the organization of the class overall and notifying students of exams and homework earlier. Otherwise, I think this course was taught very well, and the classroom environment was very special and conducive to learning. ",
            "\u00a0The instructor was the biggest strength of the course. Professora Andrade is a great at transmitting the love for the culture and language to her students making the learning environment more enjoyable and tailored to keep the interest of the students. No weaknesses at all. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the course!! I have no recommendations to improve it, it was already so amazing. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: reasonable workload, unique teaching style (through different materials such as novels, movie clips, music, cultural events), AMAZING professor, small class so classmates become very close, ability to improve languages skills very fast "

            "\u00a0Yes. I would definitely recommend anybody to take Portuguese at Yale. It is fun, and you actually learn how to speak and use the language! The class sizes are small, and you will have a lot of time to speak. Taking Portuguese at Yale was the best decision I have made at Yale so far. Highly recommend! ",
            "\u00a0I don't know who is teaching the course next semester, but I know that the Fulbright awardees teach it . They are all so amazing so I am sure you cannot go wrong with this class. Also, you learn a lot and its mad chill compared to other language courses. ",
            "\u00a0Please take it, you wont regret. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Easy course during which you can learn an entire new language and become fluent after only 4 semesters. "
