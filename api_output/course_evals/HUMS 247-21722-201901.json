            "\u00a0I learned about Iconicity, Materiality, branding, and how groups interact with their sacreds and profanes. ",
            "\u00a0Greater understanding of iconicity and its role in shaping our sense of meaning. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much from this course. I gained a much deeper understanding of well known sociologists' theories and how they can be applied to real life. The material from this course is applicable to all aspects of life, and after this course you'll second guess everything around you! ",
            "\u00a0All about icons from a sociological view  didnt realize how powerful they were ",
            "\u00a0I went into the course having no idea what aesthetics was and being very confused about the first 1-2 readings. I came out of the course with a much better sense of aesthetics as a field of study, and much more literary awareness (syllabus includes Marx, Benjamin, and other big/interesting names I had never read before). The course developed my ability to give a cultural critique and think critically about icons in culture and materialism. ",

            "\u00a0This was my favorite class that I've taken at Yale. It's a lot of work in terms of reading, and the texts are certainly not easy, but it's so rewarding and relevant. ",
            "\u00a0I would have been interested in hearing more about the final projects my classmates were working onmaybe future iterations of the course could incorporate a presentation on the last day of class, or something like that. ",
            "\u00a0Very interesting and intellectually demanding. A little intimidating for those without much theoretical background and are on the shy side. ",
            "\u00a0Weakness  contemporary philosophy was majority men/white men \r\nStrength  good material first half ",
            "\u00a0Alexander was a really interesting guy, after a few weeks I started to realize that he was actually low key famous in the field of semiotics/sociology. He was pretty funny too (in a dry way), and wasn't afraid to blatantly roast people (myself included). Another person taking the course with me gave the course the superlative of \"Biggest Roasts.\" And not only did he roast students, but also authors, which was fun...he also roasted (pun intended) the poor Cathedral de Notre Dame (/tear) and its architecture. Dicky, the TA, was also great!\r\n\r\nSome weeks had way too much assigned reading, which was a huge bummer (I'm looking at you Dicky!). It made it difficult to really get a hold on all the assigned material for those particular weeks. Most weeks, however, were fine, and the reading was very doable for a once-a-week class.\r\nThe papers were fine, but I think the second prompts were less interesting than the first prompts. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses included communication between teaching staff and students. "

            "\u00a0An interesting course with a quirky, learned professor. Lots of dense theory in the first few weeks, so be prepared for that. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Lots of reading and writing, but definitely worth it for how interesting the material is. ",
            "\u00a0Yes if you like conversations about materialism and consciousness ",
            "\u00a0Would definitely recommend this course! If you're a STEM person like me, I recommend taking it to finally read big names like Marx and Walter Benjamin, as well as learn about the ideologies of other big names. It's also really interesting because it gives useful tools to analyze and critique society. ",
