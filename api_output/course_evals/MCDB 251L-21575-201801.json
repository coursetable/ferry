            "\u00a0This class was incredibly accommodating and fun to be a part of. I learned effortlessly, thanks to the well-organized nature of the class and the moderate workload. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were the great professors.\r\nThe weaknesses were that many of the laboratories had a lot of empty down time that was quite annoying. Also, many of the techniques were repeated between labs, making it slightly monotonous. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - format of the lab report, content of the lab, collaborative nature of the course\r\nWeaknesses - maybe give students access to the lab report beforehand? ",
            "\u00a0Straightforward, interesting, and low-work lab class the complements the lecture well. Highly recommend! Assignments assess what you learned in lab without being stressful, confusing, or unnecessarily time-consuming. The lab techniques used (Western blot, immunohistochemistry, H&E staining) were well explained and well applied to the subject of reproductive biology. I honestly don't think this lab could be improved at all, I wish all the MCDB labs took the approach of this one (emphasize learning without busywork). ",

            "\u00a0The labs were all really interesting and informative\r\nAs we discussed in class, I did hope that we could have more engagement/discussion about the papers instead of just lecture-style ",
            "\u00a0The class is great in that it teaches information and techniques in a low-stress setting, which made it really easy to learn.  It was pretty low in terms of workload though, and it doesn't feel like we covered a particularly broad amount of content. ",
            "\u00a0The course is a great introduction to tissue staining and cell visualization techniques, and I feel that I have a much stronger grasp of the the lab techniques after taking this methods course. I feel that the course could benefit from a few more graded assignments though. The lab work was relatively simple, but it could often be difficult to figure out hat was expected on lab reports. Because there are only a few of these assignments, a less-than-stellar grade on one can greatly affect a student's final grade, even if the students was dedicate to the course and was able to properly conduct the lab work. This could often feel frustrating, as the level of difficulty in the course was not high enough to warrant final grades below a certain level, but not every students will hit the grade they feel reflects their lab output because so few graded assignments exist. I really enjoyed the course overall though, and have highly recommended it to several students. ",
            "\u00a0This was THE best lab course I took at Yale! Perfect combination of lab and biology. Very reasonable in expectations. I learned so much and it was an enjoyable experience! ",
            "\u00a0The lab ordering could be improved by grouping labs on tissue type instead of technique to limit the amount of backtracking needed to remember past material. The protocols were very streamlined and easy to follow, making it easier to focus on interpreting the results instead of getting stuck on procedure, which I thought was a strength of the course. The course may also benefit from adding focus on discussing papers during downtime with more participation from the students. "
