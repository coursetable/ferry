            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Kavathas does a great job orienting this course toward non-science majors, combining scientific knowledge with trips to the Yale Medical Center and readings about the history of polio. It's not a very effort-intensive course, and helps you really come out of it with basic knowledge of diseases that is actually helpful for future reference. I also really appreciated how Professor Kavathas would provide printed slides and readings so that we didn't have to go out and buy certain books! The booklet she gives you at the beginning of the year is also very very helpful, especially for the problem sets.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It can be a little unclear at times how much biology you actually need to understand (sometimes our TAs were unsure of that as well), and it appears that you may need some sort of high school background in biology. I definitely found myself pulling in some old AP Biology knowledge, which sometimes seemed to be assumed. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Kavathas is very caring and does her best to make sure students (organizing extra review sessions etc.) Material is very useful and everyone should have some knowledge about the immune system and some diseases we hear about a lot but don't really understand. Trip to med school was pretty cool.\r\nWeaknesses: The discussion sections felt a bit frustrating at times, it felt like there wasn't much value to discussions and people were saying things for the sole purpose of making comments. Lectures were a bit dry sometimes and I felt myself zoning out quite often (definitely partly my fault though). Some activities during the lectures felt kind of unnecessary, took up time and did not facilitate learning. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n-Very well organized \r\n-Professor was amazing and so kind! Learned all of her students by name!\r\n-Biology was explained in a clear manner, even though the topics could get complex\r\n-Engaging for all students, especially non-Science-y people\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: excellent professor, she is amazing in every way (prints out slides and handouts for everyone, is so nice, learns everyone's name in the lecture), also very good at explaining stuff, making sure students understand the more complicated material\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes moves pretty slowly ",
            "\u00a0The course was very fun and well-structured. However, the level of detail in lectures didnt seem to match up with the level of detail we were expected to know for homework assignments and exams. Going through the slides more slowly could help with this. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Dr. Kavathas is great! She actually cares about her students a lot and is always willing to look into students' questions. Although the material can be fairly technical especially at the beginning of the course, it is all pertinent to our immediate health which makes it interesting. I also liked the people in the class. Everyone seemed chill in class and in section. This class is much harder than most science credits for non-science majors but it's worth it. This class is also super well organized. All the powerpionts are literally printed off for you before class. \r\n\r\nWeakness: Section was a complete waste of time!! Please get rid of section. The readings were too long and not pertaining directly to the material, and as a result, few people did the readings and section was always super awkward. Our TA was great, but it's hard when no one talks in section. I also think a midterm and a final or a midterm and a final presentation would be solid for this class. I'm not sure why we had a final presentation and a final exam. It made for too much work at the end of the year. Lastly, the exams were hard so beware. They require studying and a lot of memorization (especially the final). I think the exams could be made slightly fairer as this is a class for non-STEM majors and not everyone has the science knowledge to complement what they learn in class. ",
            "\u00a0Better interactions in class ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Kavathas is a great instructor and the readings she assigned were very well-written and interesting, not just dense scientific articles. The problem sets were also uncomplicated and clearly served a purpose. The two trips we took were also great and helped sum up the two parts of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: applicable to our daily lives\r\n\r\nWeakness: Sometimes there's not enough time to go over difficult concepts. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the subjects that were covered in this course and thought they did a pretty good job explaining them, although sometimes they went really far into technical details before giving a more straightforward overview. I also thought they were extremely \"nitpicky\" for want of a better word in grading problem sets. I would get information directly from the class packet or PowerPoints, and it would still be wrong or incomplete. Perhaps the questions could be more specific about what they're looking for. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - Professor Kavathas was very fair. And she loves teaching and engaging with students. Also, it was nice that each class was not an insane amount of work, but the PSETS did help to facilitate everything we learned.\r\n\r\nWeakness - sometimes Prof Kavathas is not the best at explaining concepts the first time around BUT if you ask her questions, she will answer and is SO HELPFUL. ",
            "\u00a0The grading of the problem sets was at times unfair and fluctuating from student to student. I did appreciate the professor providing us with the handbook and lecture slides. ",
            "\u00a0Lots of memorization and readings that arent super useful for tests but rather for real world knowledge. But also the class does a ton of cool stuff like visit the medical school! And the professor is amazing. ",
            "\u00a0The professor is really nice but I really don't think this is a good science option for those who have no science classes like it was passed off to be. I often felt like there was a wide learning gap between students who were STEM and had already learned the material and non-STEM students were struggling. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: paula is really caring and loves her students, the course is extremely well-organized and she prints out the slides for everyone beforehand, there's a handbook that has all the course content you'd ever need\r\nweaknesses: pretty inaccessible to non-science majors, if you ask me. you will have to work very hard to do well in this course. immunology is very detail-oriented and complicated and requires a lot of memorization. i also think some of the concepts were full of such minutia that i had trouble relating to the bigger picture. don't expect this course to be easy. ",
            "\u00a0The course has easy to follow and straightforward lecture slides. Sometimes they are taught in a way that is infantilizing. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Kavathas' enthusiasm for the subject matter and for non-STEM students engaging with the Sciences are apparent and a strong benefit to the course. The fact that she gave out a comprehensive and intuitive course packet to accompany the lectures (for free!) was something I had not seen before and deeply appreciated. Yet the course ultimately suffers from a lack of understanding of the level of science-literacy that the average Yale humanities major has before arriving on campus. This means that despite being marketed as an introductory course, the class quickly becomes frustrating for those who do not already speak the language of biology, and was a discouraging exposure to science on the collegiate level. "

            "\u00a0Yes, it was a wonderful science credit for those not only in science majors but for those that are not. ",
            "\u00a0I would! If you're a non-science major looking for a credit but actually want to learn a bit and not take a boring class, this is the one for you. It's not the easiest course around, but you definitely won't be bored out of your mind and feel like your efforts aren't going toward anything concrete. ",
            "\u00a0If you are looking for a science credit but don't want to take a gut! I didn't enjoy it as much as the humanities classes I took this semester but it was a good distribution requirement, and I actually feel like I learned a lot coming out of the class. It's not too much work (total 5 psets, weekly readings) but the material accumulates and can be a bit of a pain come midterm or finals time. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Learning about the immune system, vaccination, and diseases/infections like HIV,HPV and the flu are essential to our lives. The more people that learn about how these disease spread, how important vaccines are and the science behind each immune response, the more we can de-stigmatize certain illnesses and work to advance research to help people. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely - if you need a sc credit, take it! Prof Kavathas is extraordinarily friendly, helpful, and understanding. She learned everyone's name in lecture, prints out all the slides for everyone, and takes the class on 2 cool field trips to the YUAG and med school. Workload pretty light and most material is very easy to digest. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to someone who needs a science credit and wants something interesting and useful. This is not a super gutty course however. You need to put in work. The psets are short but graded harshly and the exams are difficult and detail oriented. This class also has a fairly unnecessary but mandatory section that will require reading if you want to contribute. Take this class if you want to learn but not if you have a hard semester and want an easy science credit. ",
            "\u00a0Its an okay class ",
            "\u00a0If anybody doesn't have a strong science background or is just interested in immunology like I am, then I highly recommend the course. Dr.Kavathas is a great professor and I would recommend taking the class for her. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would because this course is applicable to everyday life. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I thought it was very interesting and applicable to real life. Great way to fulfill a science credit. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - I learned so much about the immune system and diseases - not only how they infect us on a molecular basis but also their historical background, etc. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course because everyone should have a basic understanding of their body systems. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!!! Take this course ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class wholeheartedly if you are willing to put the work in. The material can be interesting and is great to know outside of class. However, I think I would be less inclined to recommend this with someone of a weaker science background. ",
            "\u00a0not unless you really need it. there are more accessible science credits at yale. this is conceptually really difficult, albeit interesting, but will make you work for the exams. paula is lovely tho and there are excursions to the YUAG and med school that are really interesting ",
            "\u00a0It is a science course that is interesting and there is relatively low workload. The concepts learned are very applied and can serve one well in daily life. Everyone should have basic knowledge about immunity. ",
            "\u00a0While I deeply admire Prof. Kavathas and the entire TF staff, I am not in a position that I could recommend another Yale student take this course - especially from the perspective of a non-STEM student. While the course certainly aims to be accessible, with popular press and easily accessible scientific studies as section readings, the overall starting point of the course is not at the level of being able to be followed by a student who has come from a low-quality public school with little to no scientific exposure prior to arrival on campus. The class is very generous in terms of grading, and a motivated student could perform well. That being said, the course is often unclear in terms of larger overarching themes, and instead focuses on granular detail, which might prevent a first-time STEM student from being able to fully engage. I am confident that if this course were to be seriously reformed, it could be an excellent introduction to a genuinely fascinating field, but until that time I cannot recommend that another student enroll. ",
            "\u00a0If you need a science credit but aren't great at science, the material in this course is not super hard to understand I wouldn't call it a gut, though. "
