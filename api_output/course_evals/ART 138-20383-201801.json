            "\u00a0This is, by far, one of the best classes at Yale. It's not just about learning or improving your photography skills. I feel this class has changed how I approach art, challenged my perceptions in how I see the world, and encouraged me to cultivate my own style and goals related to photography. ",
            "\u00a0Learned technical skills of photography (using DSLR, post-production editing of photos with Photoshop, and printing) as well as more artistic aspects of photography (how to select photos for critique, how to sequence the photos in an exhibit, how to talk about and critique others' work). ",
            "\u00a0Looking differently and thinking critically about photographs and the print medium ",
            "\u00a0This is a fantastic class! Both a great introduction to digital photo and (at least my year) an exciting space for collaboration/criticism. ",
            "\u00a0this is an amazing class. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: great class discussions, an amazing field trip to New York, introduction to so many amazing artists and their work, made Photoshop and all of its crazy functions accessible\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: N/A ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Ka-Man is a great professor and helped guide us through the process of learning photography\r\n-Ka-man was very available for one-on-one meetings which were always very helpful\r\n-There was a range of skill level and expertise in the class which I thought improved the quality of the class\r\n-There were multiple learning opportunities outside of the classroom such as a field trip to museums in New York City, a visit to the Art Gallery print collection, and viewings of MFA portfolios in the Haas Arts Library which I thought helped add to the course\r\n-The final project gives you the chance to come up with your own idea for a photo exhibit and pursue this\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-Lectures can be boring at time\r\n-More one-on-one help with editing and printing would be helpful. I got to the end of the course and still felt like I was having difficulty editing my photos \r\n-Very very expensive ",
            "\u00a0The course allows for a lot of space and flexibility in developing one's photographic interests. However, I would have liked some more concrete feedback on my work throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0really encouraged to explore what we are interested in. ka-man is wonderful. "

        [
            "\u00a0EVERYONE, even if you're not into art or photography, should consider taking this course. You'll come out the other side a better person and leave with a  newfound appreciation for the medium. ",
            "\u00a0Even Credit/D this course is a lot of work. Take it seriously. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend Digital Photography with Ka-Man! I had no experience with photography whatsoever prior to this course, but now I can say with confidence that I know how to operate a camera, both in technical and a creative sense. Ka-Man is an amazing instructor with countless PDFs explaining how to use a camera, how to navigate Photoshop, and how to correctly use the printers. That being said, she can be kind of blunt, so bear that in mind. Also - the course is reeeallllyyy expensive! I didnt have a digital camera so I had to buy one ($600ish), along with hard drives, paper, and printing. This course easily ran over $1,000 for me, so definitely take that into consideration. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you have enough time to devote to it. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely - worth it 1000%. You will learn and make so much! ",
            "\u00a0Without a doubt  Ka Man is a wonderful teacher and this has been one of my favourite courses at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0love it "
