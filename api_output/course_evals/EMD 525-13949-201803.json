Many of the seminars were very bio/research heavy and specific for certain diseases, would be nice to have a balance--for instance someone who works in vaccination policy, practicing epidemiologists, or people who have jobs we could get right after this master's rather than just academic research every single week. ",
            "\u00a0Overall I enjoyed the diversity of the speakers and the depth of their presentations. However, after the classroom was switched from LEPH to 47 College Street I could never find the sign-in QR code. A physical sign-in would have been better. ",

            "\u00a0This was hands down my favorite course of the semester. The strength was that despite my lack of biology/science knowledge, I was still able to participate in the discussions of class. She encouraged discussion and critical thinking throughout the course and created a safe environment where it was more about encouraging deeper thoughts about the subject rather than right or wrong answers. I understood the reasoning for the exam formats, but it did give me a lot more pressure trying to boil down loads of content to 4 questions; I would mistakenly try to know every single detail about every thing we ever covered, and sometimes be hurt by not being able to answer some questions in depth. But she did grade generously to make up for that. I wish the course wasn't right after lunch. ",

            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the seminar! I loved being able to hear about the work being done at Yale by our own professors and faculty, but also visiting professors. It was really cool to see this wide range of people doing a wide range of research from many different angles. I enjoyed this every week. Plus, a free lunch is great too. ",
