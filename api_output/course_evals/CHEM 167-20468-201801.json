While the Oxtoby textbook presents problems that are of AP Chemistry level, Professor Wang challenges us to go above a surface understanding of each topic, such as thermodynamics or kinetics, and combine different concepts together when solving his problem sets or midterm questions. I gained a better understanding of inorganic and physical chemistry, and can now definitively say that I enjoy chemistry and STEM and will want to major in something related. ",

The course was very math-heavy, in contrast to CHEM 163, so we were pushed to think about how we could apply different equations and concepts to solve problems. I think that this meant that this course required us to use a conceptual understanding of the topics in a different way from how Prof. Mayer's did. ",

You really have to understand the material in order to apply that knowledge in new ways.

We learned about different phases and their properties, thermodynamics, chemical kinetics, electrochemistry, nuclear chemistry, spectroscopy, and a bit about solid materials. Beyond the academic material, I learned how to approach different problems and got a lot of good tips on how to study in general from my TA. ",
            "\u00a0By taking this course, I gained knowledge about foundational concepts of physical chemistry, acid-base theory, kinetics, chemical equilibriums, thermodynamics, electrochemistry, spectroscopy, and nuclear reactions. No practical skills were learned (since lab takes care of that), but the topics went over in CHEM 167 were interesting. Although there is significant overlap between CHEM 165 and 167, I believe CHEM 167 had a more in-depth and interesting investigation into chemical concepts. ",

            "\u00a0The course was designed in a way such that lecture and textbook material complemented each other, which I greatly enjoyed, since usually one will render the other obsolete and useless. I do wish that there were more practice problems (ungraded) like practice midterms released by the professor, since only one TA wrote his own extra practice problems, and they usually were not parallel with midterm content. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The TAs were a tremendous resource for this course--they held weekly office hours for help with psets or to clarify topics from lecture, and the professor also had office hours if you needed to ask any questions.\r\nWeaknesses: this is not really a weakness, but something that students often struggled with was the pace of the course. We covered at least one new chapter every week, and you had to keep up with the material because you would be tested immediately. It was nice that we had a week between the last chapter covered and an upcoming exam, but that meant that most people weren't really engaged during that week and would have to review it well before the next exam. ",
            "\u00a0It was often unreasonably complicated or hard. The concepts themselves weren't often terribly difficult, but they were often explained too quickly and in unclear ways. The saplings in general were also just far too long. Although they were generally helpful to an extent, they'd always take many hours and I gained nothing from the extra problems except wasting time. The psets also were often confusing or very difficult, I'd only be able to do them after spending hours with friends, and going to several TF sessions. Although psets should definitely be challenging, and this course as a whole should be hard, at a certain point there was no way I could figure out answers by myself even when I wanted to and tried, so I'd just be relying on other people to show me what to do, which didn't lead to any actual understanding. ",
            "\u00a0This course teaches a wide variety of topics, which is a positive, but these topics are taught too quickly. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were a little rough at the beginning, but got better with time. ",
            "\u00a0It's very very comprehensive. A bit extra, I think... people stuck with it and learned a lot, but it does have a high barrier of entry insofar as you have to put a lot of work into it. The term-time exams are a lot of material for the time given, which means that score is affected by ability to do the problems quickly. I wish that hadn't been the case as much. So maybe making the exams shorter would be better.\r\n\r\nThis is something that is a personal pet peeve, but the TFs did often show you exactly what to do on the problem sets in section. This comes at everyone's expense... the people who watch them do it get the answers right but don't learn and suffer on exams, while the people who try on their own end up losing points and being way below average because so many people are getting full or nearly full points. So please let us do the problem sets on our own since this forces us to choose between losing options. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include mathematical basis and understanding of how formulas and concepts are derived ",
            "\u00a0One strength of this course is the curve. Although the class is very challenging, Hailang Wang is very generous with the curve. He is aware that he is really challenging us on the exams, and he equates an A with raw exam scores close to an 80. Without this curve, the majority of the students would be failing the course. \r\n\r\nOne weakness of the course is the lack of organization in material and within lecture. We go topic from topic without any real transitions between material, and sometimes its more difficult to see the big picture of the course because we spend so much time on nitty-gritty derivations and tangents into the professor's research. ",
            "\u00a0The course was strong because it covered so much material that we learned a lot, while having a strong support system to prevent us from falling through. The organization of the course could be improved because sometimes the material felt a bit scattered, but when you take a step back you realize every piece of the puzzle fits together in the end to tie all the different topics together in a meaningful way. ",
            "\u00a0Especially at the beginning of the course, it felt like Prof. Wang didn't have a good sense of what we knew and what we didn't know as intro chemistry students. A lot of us felt that he vastly overestimated what we knew when he wrote the first test, and a lot of the early lectures were difficult for many of us to follow. Over the course of the semester, however, I definitely think that Prof. Wang got a lot better about judging the level that he should write the lectures at, and they became a lot easier to follow and learn from. \r\n\r\nI found this course really challenging overall, and I think that in a way I'm glad of that because it pushed me to try my hardest and seek out help when I needed it, but there were also a few things about it that I thought made it tough but didn't need to. One problem that I ran into whenever I was preparing for exams was that I felt like we didn't have adequate materials with which to prepare. Prof. Wang always suggested that we study the problem sets, and I think that helped, but the problem sets alone didn't really provide us with enough study material, especially since they were each 4 or 5 questions each. Prof. Wang wrote a lot of challenging questions on the exams, and though I wouldn't say that his questions were necessarily unfair,  it could still be really hard to know how to solve them when we hadn't been able to work with similar problems in the problem sets, just because the problem sets could only capture so many of the types of questions that he would write. Also, towards the end of the course, we covered material in spectroscopy that didn't really align with the textbook, and I had trouble finding good materials to study it at a similar level to how Prof. Wang was teaching it. I think it would be helpful if Prof. Wang could have written us a few practice tests or supplemental practice problems to prep for exams, or perhaps pointed out particular textbook problems that he thought could be helpful (the textbook problems were often very different/easier than the types of questions he wrote, so it wasn't very helpful to try and work on them on our own). \r\n\r\nWe had one really dedicated teaching fellow, Zach, who really went out of his way to help us out. He always held office hours and review sessions and tried to write us some practice problems, and we definitely appreciated that. I thought that Yizhou was a good teaching fellow too, and he always helped me out with my problem sets when I asked him about them. Having good teaching fellows definitely made a big difference for a tough course like this. ",
            "\u00a0Chem 167 was a very challenging course that covered a very wide range of topics. Although each individual topic was interesting, the course tended to be so overwhelming that the material could not be properly internalized. By slowing down the course a bit, or not adding so many varied topics, it might help students better learn the material and better understand the connection between different topics. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very interesting and the material was explained clearly. The pacing of the class seemed challenging but not overwhelmingly fast, and I liked that exam questions required us to adapt our knowledge to new types of problems. One weakness was that the exams were long for the time we were given, so they seemed to test quick thinking and didn't always reflect how much we actually understood without rushing. ",
            "\u00a0The workload of this class is extremely high. Prof Wang gives challenging psets in addition to the Sapling homework, and together, the class has around 6 hours of homework a week. The course material is difficult and can be really hard to grasp from Prof Wang's lectures alone. It is definitely a large time commitment (sometimes unnecessarily so), but go to peer tutoring and section if you can (especially if you have Zach Carter as a TF). Though hard, it is a really fulfilling course and you do learn an extreme amount of material that will supposedly make future chem courses much easier. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes disorganized. Professor was very knowledgeable though. ",
            "\u00a0This course is great to challenge yourself in regards to thinking quantitatively about chemistry.  In the first part of this course, the professor did a lot of derivations very quickly on the board, and it would have been better if he went slower through that material since most students in the class had not taken physics yet in college.  He could have more clearly defined the variables he was using. As the semester progressed he did get better at defining variables and going slower such that most students could understand the derivations he was doing.  I think it would be beneficial if he could allow for more questions from students during lecture. ",
            "\u00a0The course was well taught, and I feel I did learn a lot. The pacing was especially jarring in the beginning, but became better as the year continued. I feel that the course was heavily shaped by the outside help as well though, and without it, I do not know how the class would have felt. ",
            "\u00a0Very organized ",
            "\u00a0The strength was my TF Zach. He really went above and beyond with his discussion sections and office hours. Also, I think Professor Wang was a very organized teacher. The course could be improved by making the tests not during the 50 minutes of class. The time constraint made them way too difficult to finish. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of the course include the challenging content that forces you to think in new ways. Weaknesses include the fast pace and at times the organization. ",
            "\u00a0The course was definitely very difficult content and while the explanations were engaging and clear (for the most part), the supportive resources and materials could have been more expansive. The power points, for example, did not have many of the equations that were taught in class. This presented problems, particularly when I could not read all of the expressions on the board. Access to copies of derivations or even to equations sheets would have been invaluable. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is the interesting material, the teaching, and the TAs. One weakness is the time pressure on tests, which made it difficult to fully master concepts because there wasn't enough time. But I think that this still served to improve time management skills. ",
            "\u00a0The course was challenging. The strengths of the course were my TA, the weaknesses were unorganized lectures. Professor very open to feedback, and got significantly better as course went on. Not enough time to take exams. If want to challenge us with level of tests, must offer more time for students to have time to think. Hard for students with testing anxiety and who are not fast test takers. ",
            "\u00a0hard as hell ",
            "\u00a0Professor Wang is a terrific lecturer and was extremely engaging. I also enjoyed section, but I would have preferred if TAs had more structure in section meetings. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this class is that it's a challenge. I feel more confident going into higher level courses. However, this class has more weaknesses than strengths. There is an absurd amount of work that goes on outside the classroom. This is not what I take issue with; I'm here to learn things, to understand scientific concepts and master the material, and I'm willing to do an absurd amount of work to achieve that. My issue with the amount of work in this course is related to the KIND of work that we were doing on a week-by-week basis. I feel strongly that having an electronic Sapling Learning problem set in addition to one written by the professor is unnecessary, and the Sapling is consistently busywork. Far from ideal. I suggest eliminating Sapling. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of the course was the problem sets. Although difficult, they were helpful to really learn the material. A weakness is that sometimes the lecture does not match what is material is on the problem sets. Often I felt like the material we needed to know was not clear. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Resources (TAs, peer tutors, etc.), organization\r\nWeaknesses: Very mathematically based, less conceptual knowledge tested ",
            "\u00a0In the beginning the lectures were a bit weak, and I think the class would be more enjoyable and easier if the lectures were more engaging. ",
            "\u00a0The material was interesting. However, I do no think that lecture was very helpful in teaching the concepts. The class required a lot of time outside of class to learn the material. There were also not many resources, no practice exams or practice questions, which made it very difficult to study. ",
            "\u00a0I think that a strength of this course is its difficulty level. It's not fun sometimes, but it challenges you to think critically about every situation. The course material is very advanced, that is another strength, you are being taught high-level topics in a first-year class, that too is also a strength, it's not the average general chemistry course. Lecture was good, the professor explained the topics reasonably well. With that said, the course is very fast paced, and the material very challenging. \r\nBut the biggest weakness was the uneven quality of the TA's. One was outstanding, and worked very hard to make sure everyone understood the material. The other two were not as good, one example being they used section to go over homework rather than reinforce material learned in lecture. They were also less capable of answering questions and teaching the material. ",
            "\u00a0The class is very comprehensive and covers a lot of material in detail. It can be hard to learn much in lecture, but TA office hours (especially Zach's) are super helpful ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The order of the material makes sense, and the lectures pretty much follow the textbook with some extra information, so it makes studying the material much easier. The test turnaround was also extremely, abnormally fast, so it was nice to know our grade so soon.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: We usually ran out of time with the exams, so I felt that our knowledge wasn't tested as well. ",
            "\u00a0A strength (and possibly a weakness) of this course is the amount of material covered in the semester: it is a lot of material, but not all of it was tested on (how could you test on every detail of every topic?). Another strength is the lecture, and how Professor Wang would start and end lectures on time, and how he did not require close reading of the textbook: although everything he said in class wouldn't be on the exams, 1) it is easy to pick out the important parts, and 2) it was interesting nonetheless. For example, we learned how a car battery and a lithium ion battery worked. One weakness, however, is the inconsistency among the TF's: one TF would lead discussion sections by covering material learned in lecture, while the other two TF's would only go over the PSETs and exams. ",
            "\u00a0Way to much Sapling online homework on top of the written homework. ",
            "\u00a0This course covers an incredible amount of material, and it does a great job getting you to think outside the box to solve tough problems in chemistry. The breadth and intensity of this course are both incredible, and while this means you will learn to think critically in chemistry, the course can also be very challenging and fast-paced. Many important concepts are covered in lectures but the course moves so fast that it can be easy to misunderstand them or never grasp the reasons why certain concepts where even taught. The course content is expansive, and it makes the class interesting but at the same time makes each unit feel disparate and incongruous. ",

            "\u00a0The course was difficult at first since it was the professor's first year. This meant Professor Wang had somewhat unreasonable expectations. Having said that, one of the greatest strengths was the implementation of feedback from the students. Towards the end of the semester, course material was still very challenging but not unreasonable. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very challenging but there were the adequate resources available to help students. One of the major weaknesses of the course was the fact that the level of helpfulness of the teaching fellows ranged so greatly that it almost felt unfair if you didn't have the TF most students considered \"the best\" "

Definitely don't take this class if you are concerned about your grade, because the midterms and problem sets will take you down (our class averages on the midterms were around 50%, 70%, and 80%). But, it is worth it if you are willing to put in the time and effort to practice and really understand the material beyond a purely computational mindset. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. People will tell you to take the other general chemistry class because it is easier, but I found this class extremely engaging, despite how challenging it was. It definitely takes up a lot of your time, so you have to be willing to put in the effort. But if you put in the effort, I think that what you get corresponds with what you get. The professors and TAs know how hard this class is, so they provide you with resources and end up curving the class generously. ",

If you're just pre-med or going for a major like G&G or something else that requires a little chem, this will be a lot of work, and a lot of what you learn you'll probably never use again. I was one of the only non-freshmen in the class, and I didn't take 165. I didn't feel like it was impossible to keep up, but it is worth noting that when a lot of the other people in the class are taking BIOL 103, Psych and the Good Life, underwater basketweaving, etc., and meanwhile you're taking an upper level Chem E class, CS, etc., the competition can be tough--everyone else has a lot more time to study that you do.

            "\u00a0I would only recommend this course to students who truly want an academic challenge. You can receive the same credit in GenChem and have a much easier time with the material and workload. This course is alright for someone who is willing to spend a lot of time studying the material and going to review sessions to gain an understanding that you can't get just from lecture. ",

It is quite the challenge but they do compensate for that with the support system and curves that are reasonably generous. ",

Overall, I'm glad that I took this course instead of CHEM 165 because I'm glad that I challenged myself and I think that helped me learn the material more effectively. However, now that I've spent a year at Yale, I'm pretty sure that I'm not going to major in any of the natural sciences and that means that I didn't need to take this course at all. I think that if you're going to take chemistry, and you know you need it, then taking a course like this will be more rewarding than taking a course you know will be easier -- at the same time, you should know going in that it's going to be a lot of work, and you should be prepared to work hard to understand the material. Sometimes it felt like even when I was working really hard, it was still really challenging for me to be successful on the exams. With that in mind, this course may not be the best choice for you if you know that you have one or two really other really hard courses in the same semester. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if it took a step back from intensity and pressure on the students. I feel as though many times the work was overwhelming and too much to handle for those who had a weaker background in chemistry. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would. It was an interesting and well-structured course that provided good fundamentals for general chemistry. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this class to another student. The workload is very high, but if you're interested in chemistry, you will learn SO MUCH and it's more interesting than gen chem. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student who enjoys science and thinking quantitatively.  You really need to enjoy learning the material for this class to be worth the amount of time you will need to put into it.  But if you enjoy learning the material this can be an extremely rewarding class. ",
            "\u00a0If you want a challenge then take this course. If you don't want to invest mass amounts of time into chemistry, or don't really find it interesting do not take it. You need to have at least some moderate level of interest in chemistry. Without it, you will struggle in this course, and it will not feel worth it all. ",
            "\u00a0If you want a challenge ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to someone who wants to study chemistry in depth. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course only if you are prepared for a very challenging chemistry course. If you merely need to com[lete the intro chem requirement I would take an easier course instead. The math and critical thinking skills that you must use are fairly difficult, but completing the course is rewarding if you are ready to put the time and effort in. Just be aware that the time and effort required are significant, and that you will likely feel overwhelmed at times. Going to TA office hours and the peer tutors is absolutely essential. Although lecture is decently well taught, it is difficult to grasp the material without the help of the TAs. We had extraordinary TAs this year which made the course doable. I don't think I would have been able to complete the course without this support network. ",
            "\u00a0If a student has a strong interest in Chemistry and Applied Math I would recommend the course, but I would not recommend it to all students because it is definitely time and energy intensive. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course for anyone who is interested in the quantitative chemistry aspect and is willing to challenge themselves. ",
            "\u00a0Only if the student is interested in the more mathematical side of chemistry/physics. I was hoping that, like the first semester of Chem 163, this would continue our exploration of chemistry in a more qualitative, contextual way. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another Yale student. I enjoyed learning about a variety of chemistry topics in a balanced and quick-paced manner. ",
            "\u00a0I took this course because I placed out of General University Chem and wanted to challenge myself; in terms of the material, I think the course does this successfully and on those grounds I would recommend it. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who hasn't taken AP chem or who is just taking chem to fulfill premed requirements. ",
            "\u00a0Only if you need to take it. Gen Chem (165) is a far easier alternative, and unless you plan to take P chem, you won't really need any of the concepts covered in this course. 167's precursor (163) is a much better and more useful course overall. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student who has a strong chemistry background and wants to take  a \"comprehensive course\" that will still enable them to learn a lot of new material and be intellectually stimulated and challenged. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend it to any freshman loooking to deepen their knowledge of chemistry. ",
            "\u00a0Only if they want to be a chemistry or chemical engineering major. It is a very intense class that requires a lot of work, and is purely inorganic physical chemistry. It is interesting, but not good for an intro chemistry class, in my opinion. ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend this course to someone who is interested in chemistry, and/or is thinking about majoring in chemical or biological sciences, or engineering. It is a challenging class in every way so in order to succeed, you have to be willing to learn and work hard. ",
            "\u00a0No, definitely take 165 you can. There's literally no purpose to take 167 instead and its not worth the extra difficulty and workload. ",
            "\u00a0Only if you have a genuine interest in chemistry, want to learn more conceptually than mathematically, and don't mind putting in a lot of work and time. A background with chem, calc, and physics would help, as well. CHEM 167 is much harder than CHEM 165 but also much more rewarding when you finish the course. ",
            "\u00a0I would most definitely recommend this course to another student: the amount of material you cover is astounding, and although that sounds intimidating, it is worth taking the course. The material in the course overlaps with CHEM 165, but the depth you go into some topics (and the introduction of new topics entirely) is worth going into if you are interested in chemistry: I would recommend this course in conjunction with CHEM 163, however, since one topic (Materials Chemistry) takes some knowledge learned in CHEM 163 into the lectures (although this topic was not heavily emphasized in CHEM 167, and more emphasized in CHEM 163). Definitely a great class. Also Professor Wang makes some funny jokes, so it livens the atmosphere too. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course under specific circumstances. To people who are already experienced with chemistry or deeply enjoy the subject, this course will feed into your existing interests and could potentially be one of the most interesting chemistry courses you take at Yale. To people who require time spend time to truly understand the material, do not already have an above-average understanding of chemistry, or want to learn things from the ground up, I would not recommend this course. This course moves very rapidly, so any gaps in your understanding will add up. I don't think this course is suitable for people who need an instructor to go into detail about why things work or behave the way they do. ",
            "\u00a0If you're going into chemistry specifically, it probably provides far more insights than chem 165. It's also a LOT more work. Don't take it just because you took chem 163. It is very different, and very math-heavy. Really think about whether you want to take this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this class is wonderful if you have a strong interest in chemistry or learning in general. If this class is only being taken to fulfill a requirement, Chemistry 165 is better. "
