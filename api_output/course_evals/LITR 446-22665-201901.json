            "\u00a0As indicated by the title, this course offered students broad exposure to works of literature and theory emerging from various experimental and avant-garde movements throughout the 20th and 21st century. Through papers and presentations, the course insisted on close reading, as opposed to an understanding of mere content or context, as a critical analytic tool for understanding these works. ",
            "\u00a0Close critical analysis, how to read longer texts in French, deep understanding of major experimental concepts and thinkers ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus exposed me to authors and movements I had never heard of before, and I really appreciated the diversity of authors discussed. The movements and books were not organized chronologically so the class, while at first glance seems to be a survey of 20th century french literature, is really more centered around the theme of the city and \"arbitrary\" ambulation. ",
            "\u00a0an understanding of experimental French authors and some of their major works ",
            "\u00a0I practiced and refined my literary analysis abilities, gained experience writing and speaking in French, and was exposed to ideas and schools of French literature that I had not previously studied. "

        [
            "\u00a0This is a great introduction to French experimental literature -- and Prof. Cadieu is a fantastic professor. What this class lacks in depth it makes up for in breadth. ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus was great. I felt it offered a decent diversity of strategies for understanding an avant-garde, from more politically oriented feminist works to computationally inspired formalism. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Cadieu made the seminar a welcoming space, encouraging all comments and questions. Sometimes class discussion became slow or repetitive but this was usually because of the students' lack of engagement. Some of the novels, particularly in the later section of the course were a little hard to understand and be excited about. The weekly presentations helped start class discussions, but maybe having brief reading responses would have helped make class discussions stronger. ",
            "\u00a0this course gave an extensive overview of French experimental theory; it was well facilitated for student discussion. could have benefitted from more discussions about student assignments and student writing ",
            "\u00a0This was a great course! Prof. Cadieu is a wonderful discussion leader, and the reading list for the course was absolutely phenomenal. The class was well-organized to let students develop their ideas. Amazing! Prof. Cadieu and Carole also gave really detailed, helpful feedback on every assignment. "

            "\u00a0Yes, take a class with Prof. Cadieu. She's very kind and an astute reader. She's also French and offers great feedback on papers, in terms of both content and language use. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class if you're interested in a French-language seminar on 20th century experimental literature with a pretty doable workload! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Mostly, I recommend taking a course with Professor Cadieu. Her particular literary interests, the way she structures her syllabi, and her encouragement of open ended discussion make for a highly engaged and enjoyable class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend any class with Professor Cadieu to another student. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to another student, if they are willing to dedicate the time to doing the reading and being present for every class ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this, or anything with Prof. Cadieu! The reading list for Experimental Lit was really fantastic, and every class meeting changed the way that I think about literature and life. Prof. Cadieu gives really helpful feedback on written and oral assignments, and facilitated really great, productive discussions throughout the course. Just an all-around great class. I also took it Credit-D, and got a lot out of doing the readings and assignments and attending class, without having to be too stressed about perfecting each essay. Highly recommend!! "
