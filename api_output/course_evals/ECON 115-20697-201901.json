The concepts he taught made sense most of the time, and he really tried to tie the concepts to economics problems in real life, which was really interesting. Section was not that helpful, I found peer tutoring to be more helpful for help on the psets. ",

He's willing to help his students and goes out of his way to engage students in economics. That said, this class is a huge lecture so it's very easy to get lost in the crowd and feel no personal connection with the instructor. I'd recommend going to office hours. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Economics is actually very interesting. Cormac O'Dea is an adorable human being with a great sense of humor and made the class bearable. There was lots of help available for Psets and studying for exams, however, this availability did not translate into a good grade in economics.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The teaching fellows. They do not know how to teach economics. Being an economic genius does not translate into knowing how to teach it and that was the case here. There were unnecessarily hard questions on exams that were never covered in class or section that made a lot of people lose points. Additionally, the graders on the exam were entirely to apathetic and didn't understand that this was an introductory microeconomics class.\r\n\r\nImprovement: This course makes so much more sense when calculus is used. Please stop avoiding using calculus in this course it makes it so hard to follow. I understand trying to make this course open to everyone by not including calculus, but you're impeding the learning of everyone else when you don't explain that marginal cost is the derivative of cost. ",

However, section seemed entirely disconnected from what we learned in lecture, which made me confused and made exams unpredictable. ",

It could be improved with the further integration of active participation activities such as surveys. ",
            "\u00a0The course was surprisingly excellent. The biggest strength was Professor O'Dea. He was especially good at explaining the assumptions and shortcomings of the models we learned so that we didn't leave feeling like economics is a myopic field. The weakness is probably the students, many of whom can't wait to get into finance and extort the poor for their personal enrichment. ",

He is a wonderful professor for this course. \r\n\r\nThe weaknesses of this course are that the TAs very greatly in quality. It could be improved by a more consistent hiring process. ",
            "\u00a0Professor O'Dea was a great lecturer, and the peer tutoring resources for this class really helped with p-sets. Overall, it felt like this course tried to pack too much info into one basic intro course, and I think that there was a big gap in performance and perceived difficulty of the class between those who had taken an economics class before and those who had no exposure. Providing extra enrichment/review could help to decrease this gap. Also, the lecture slides and format could be more entertaining if it maybe incorporated more videos, polls, etc. to engage the class. ",

The parts I understood best were things I learned in high school and on Khan Academy.  Professor would use examples that (it seemed) he would expect the class to be confused by.  Not conducive to learning. ",

Rather than slowly go through practice problems, I feel like it would have been more helpful to review the information addressed in class.

Exam material followed directly from what we'd done in class, for homework, and for review, so I never felt blindsided by material. In general, the course was just well run and well organized. It could be improved by implementing greater variety of teaching methods and student engagement rather than just powerpoint slides for 75 minutes. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course was the professor, and course director, and TA's. Professor O'Dea always came prepared to lecture and made an effort to make the lectures interactive, which was great. I also felt that the course director and the TA's were always willingly to help students, and provided wonderful resources like office hours and additional online materials to help with the course material. I really appreciated the strong network of instructors who wanted to help students learn. \r\n\r\nA weakness of this course was the slight disorganization with sections in the first few weeks. At first, there were not enough TA's to teach sections so we had to combine sections and then go to alternative locations for these sections until this issue was fixed later on in the semester. Another weakness of this course is the grading system, in my opinion. I found it stressful to know that the class was graded on a curve, which meant that 1) a certain percentage of students is allocated an A/A-; 2) even if one scored a high raw score on a test, their score was compared to other students' before turned into a final grade (for example, if one scored a 55 out of 60 but the class average was 52, that would put the student at the lower end of the curve despite 55 out of 60 being an A- by traditional percentage calculations). I feel as if this system can be improved by ridding of the grading system, which would create more collaborative, less stressful spirit in the classroom setting. It was also stressful to know that because of the curved grading system, we did not know our final grade until after the term was over. I also wish there was some way for us to know the benchmark of our grades before then. ",

He really tried to connect with the students, and he certainty made what could be a very dry subject quite fascinating. The major weakness would be the TAs.

            "\u00a0This course was honestly one of my favorites at Yale, a fact I completely attribute to Professor O'Dea's dynamic teaching style. He is very diligent about stopping for questions and conducting a brief review at the start of every class to ensure that our intuitions from class are consistent and permanent. Given the rather strict confines of the ECON 115 class, he was really effective at going at a speed that didn't bore people who understood the concepts, but didn't confuse those who felt more fresh to the concepts being introduced. He gave us a good sampling of more advanced concepts as well in order to prepare us for what to expect at upper levels, while simultaneously ensuring that we had the more basic foundational understandings necessary to succeed at those levels. He understood that, especially in a class of 300 students, there is a diversity of adeptness with the material being taught, and strove to make his class accessible to everyone. \r\n\r\nI do wish that section did more than practice problems, and instead was conducted as a bit more of a review. I also think that if attendance at section were included as part of the grade, more people would show up (I was often one of two or three students that came). Also, I think having occasional quizzes might, while increasing stress a bit, reinforce the ideas from classes effectively. A daily quiz at the end (even an ungraded one!) might be really helpful to test how the lessons from class have been conveyed. ",
            "\u00a0This course is taught very well during the lecture, but the TAs were not very helpful. They simply walked through sample problems, and it would've been more helpful if they could review some of the content in the lecture, as lectures covered a lot of complex content that needed to be reviewed. The readings also could've been more closely related to the lecture content. ",

It sometimes seemed that we were expected to know how to extrapolate knowledge learned in class in very different ways on the problem sets, so some in-class examples might be useful, but in general I felt like the psets and tests were consistent and fair. I also thought that the mix of conceptual/theoretical and practical applications was useful for understanding both the broader scheme of economics and society, and the ways in which these ideas are applied. Some more feedback on the psets and tests would have been useful, but I understand that that might not be feasible in such a large class. ",

Weaknesses: Clarify teaching around algebra and graphs by listing out key equations and types of algebra/graphing problems students must solve; Lack of day-to-day preparation - we had problem sets due once a week but no weekly assignments outside of this; I could have bought and prepared for our lectures with an introductory micro textbook if I really wanted, but I think giving students a website/online resource/short summaries as simple assigned reading before class (15 mins before each class, let's say) would help me keep my econ mind sharp throughout the week and would prime me to absorb lectures more than just glancing at pre-posted slides before hand; sections are a little monotonous ",

Sections and problem sets were key for being really prepared for the exams -- while group work can be helpful, it's also important to try to solve the problems on your own. The course did a good job keeping math prerequisites to a minimum, though applying a little bit of calculus to understand marginal changes would have been helpful. The short unit on market failures at the end of the semester seemed insufficient given the importance of this topic to the practical applications of economics. ",

He really supports his students and wants them to succeed. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is a good intro course. ",
            "\u00a0yes. the teacher is great and its important to take Econ ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because I felt like it helped me understand the markets in which we engage every day and why producers and consumers make the choices they do. It was challenging, but also a reasonable introduction for someone who had never taken economics before. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially with Professor O'Dea. Econ was somewhat of a \"bucketlist\" college course for me -- something like computer science or statistics I thought it was important to possess a foundational knowledge of. Although the material is sometimes dry, it applies to a lot and is fascinating when you consider how economics impacts so many aspects of our lives. ",
            "\u00a0Before you take this class, ensure that you have a reason for doing so. If you are interested in a particular aspect of microeconomics, say game theory, it may be more worthwhile to study this aspect independently. Overall, the material is quite dry and not readily applicable. ",
            "\u00a0I would. I really liked this course. It is a great intro econ course for someone who has never taken econ before. The curve is hard though because many people have taken econ before. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's a good and easy social science credit. ",
            "\u00a0This isnt a fun course. Its usually pretty boring, although to his credit Professor ODea put lots of effort in to making the material engaging. The economics concepts can be interesting, but there wasnt anything particularly notable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you're interested in analyzing human behavior from a mathematical point of view. The lectures included a good balance of theory and example applications, and the course provided plenty of support between small sections and office hours. Although math beyond algebra wasn't required, a facility with algebraic manipulations like those used in physics and chemistry was very useful. The course didn't focus on the macroeconomic issues that are most often discussed in politics and daily life, but it gave a good introduction to economic decision-making that helped me better understand everyday phenomena. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because I think microeconomics is an important class to take and the professor was very good. ",
            "\u00a0Yes if you are into econ ",
            "\u00a0yes! ignore all of the \"snake\" comments and just try it to see if you like it. it's probably the easiest intro class in econ and a prereq for a lot of majors ",
            "\u00a0YES!!! Especially if Professor O'Dea was teaching the class again. His teaching style was extremely clear, he encouraged class engagement, and answered all questions. Plus, he was very approachable. "
