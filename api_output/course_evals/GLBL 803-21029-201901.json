            "\u00a0Broad understanding of the key issues debated in the global politics of the present day. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about democracies, liberalism, neo-liberalism, post-truth, securlarism, the anthropocene, the 4th Industrial Revolution, populism ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me understand the intellectual lineage of many of the terms that are in today's headlines, such as populism, liberalism, and fascism.  In this regard, the course helped clarify both what certain terms mean, and what I personally believe. ",

            "\u00a0The reading list was excellent and I liked the fact that the instructor summarized clearly the key takeaways in the readings. Room for improvement in the student presentations and following debates, as I sometimes felt that the discussion could have been more nuanced and leave room for longer debates to practice oral argumentation. ",
            "\u00a0This course couldn't decide if it wanted to be a lecture or a seminar.  I think sometimes I got frustrated that there wasn't enough discussion even though the lecture portions were good.  I was disappointed a little in some student participation however without knowing if you were going to have a discussion or a lecture, it makes sense that not everyone was involved and engaged. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n    o Excellent reading selection--and not too demanding on students' time\r\n    o Instructor contribution in each class--the instructor's knowledge on these topics and their intellectual background is inspiring\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n     o Students are not held accountable for doing the work.  I really think the reason that a lot of class sessions were quiet or subdued was because only a handful of students would do the reading, knowing that there would not, ultimately, be any form of penalty for not doing so.  Recommendation: the once-a-semester presentation on the readings by a student is important and should not be done away with...but I also think that students should either be routinely called upon to present their thoughts on a particular reading, if not assigned this directly. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting readings, concepts, and overall direction of the course.\r\nWeaknesses: Class discussion was really flat. Could be improved by having more of an agenda to get through by the end of class period, and being extremely deliberate and transparent about that. It often felt like we were just covering 20 different strands of thoughts, but each 1/20th of the depth that they deserved. ",
            "\u00a0More guidance of the discussions ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the course structure and the readings were great! I would have liked to do more prepatory assignments for the final paper as I think feedback from the class could have been useful. "

            "\u00a0Yes.  Regardless of nationality or desired profession, this course is important for anyone who cares about having more than opinions on politics--this course allows students to appreciate where organizing political philosophies at play today originated, and what the implications are for subscribing to one set of beliefs over another. ",
            "\u00a0If they are interested in history, than no. If they are interested in a high-level discussion of the history of ideas, then sure. ",
