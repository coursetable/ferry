            "\u00a0gave me a critical view of american education at all levels, improved my writing abilities, and generally provided me with a more analytical mindset ",
            "\u00a0I learned a whole lot about the state of American public education and just how bleak this current moment really is. Especially with the focus on reforms in the first half of the course, oriented against discussions of philosophy and purpose - we all were really confronted with a \"come to Jesus\" realization that this indeed is the state of our education system, and the world and our country is really in need of big thinkers about how to fix the system.\r\n\r\nAnd the discussions about higher education were particularly enjoyable too, especially in placing our Yale experiences in the context of American higher education broadly. I am super satisfied with how much, and how widely, I learned.\r\n\r\nAnd I have to thank Prof Hersh for challenging us so specifically and incisively on our writing and argument - and for taking the time to provide such quick turnaround and specific, guided feedback. Thank you Prof Hersh! ",
            "\u00a0Ultimately, I think I am a more effective citizen, writer, and scholar (especially of education) for taking this course. I gained a rich cultural literacy in issues of American education-- becoming familiar with the recent history of K-12 reform, privatization, and the school choice movement, issues (and limited learning) in higher education, the neuroscience and developmental philosophy of learning, the driving forces behind the achievement gap between students along lines of race, class, and socioeconomic background, and more. Furthermore, I became a much clearer and more effective thinker, speaker, and writer. Truly, I cannot believe that this course is not a writing credit; I have written so much (~one 4-5p essay per week) and moreover, I have learned so much about writing clearly through consistent practice and Professor Hersh's timely, rich feedback and high expectations. I have gained experience in different types of writing-- from op-eds to speeches, traditional/scholarly arguments, coauthored essays, and hybrid scholarly/personal essays. I have learned how to efficiently read enormous reports (the class often assigned hundreds of pages of reading for its weekly meeting), hone in on their most salient arguments, and synthesize and evaluate many disparate sources of knowledge. I have also learned how to evaluate what I want from my own education and seek out developmentally rich learning experiences at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0In the first half of the semester (before fall break), I learned about the overarching debates about the state of K-12 public schooling in America, the major federal and state policies aimed at rectifying the alleged problems, and the critiques of said policies. In the second half of the semester, I learned about human development based theories of education and how pre-K and higher education fit into the picture. Moreover and above all else, I learned what it truly means to write well and to deliver an argument clearly and cogently. The content by itself is certainly interesting (unless you already have considerable knowledge about education policy and philosophy), but honing your critical reading and persuasive writing skills is the real value of taking this course. Also, depending on the group of students who decide to enroll, this course can show you what it means to have a positive seminar experience. The ten of us this semester became somewhat of a small community, partly because of the shared trials of writing weekly papers, and partly because our personalities and senses of humor meshed well together. ",
            "\u00a0This class greatly improved my ability to express ideas clearly and convincingly through writing. Further, I developed a thorough and nuanced understanding of education. ",
            "\u00a0This was perhaps the most transformative class I have taken at Yale because it confronts two major questions: what should we be learning and are we actually learning? Addressing these two questions has allowed me to view my Yale experience in a different light - I can appreciate the undergraduate institution for its faults and benefits. ",

            "\u00a0this class demanded a lot of me and therefore I got a lot out of it. it also drew a group of extremely engaged and brilliant students who I learned a lot from. sometimes the class discussions got stuck in one place though. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely loved this course (see above) but I must admit it was a pretty constant source of anxiety, especially in the 7-8 weeks leading up to the midterm.\r\n\r\nThere was always SO much work to contemplate doing - all the reading, thinking, analyzing, composition and revision. I would hope that in the future, you might consider spacing out assignments more (especially like was done post-midterm) to make the course more digestible, comfortable and less anxiety-laden.\r\n\r\nDuring busy weeks, it was frankly quite difficult to get the work done (all the readings and a well-composed, edited paper) in a way I was really proud of. I almost never really had the time to dedicate to it.\r\n\r\nBut while I would pare down the sheer amount of content, I wouldn't fundamentally change much. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths definitely include Professor Hersh's truly helpful feedback, caring for his students, and accessibility, the other students, the challenge and growth experience of the weekly essays, the course's cumulative nature, and the wide but deep scope of the course (lots of topics, deep dive within them) so that by its end, I felt meaningfully knowledgable about 'the theory and practice of American Education.' \r\n\r\nAs for weaknesses, one of the course's greatest strengths-- the way it enforced rigorous, active student engagement with a long, small seminar and weekly essays (not just reading responses) with challenging prompts-- can also be seen as one of its weaknesses because many Yale students just don't have the time for it. Also, perhaps the weekly (two hour) seminar could be better structured to facilitate student discussion; it sometimes felt like we reverted to talking to Professor Hersh instead of each other-- although, I should note that it took necessarily us some weeks to build up a class-version of cultural literacy to hit our stride in discussion and have more efficient, meaningful conversations. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Hersh, no doubt about it. He is at once demanding and soft, both holding his students to exceptionally high expectations and caring deeply about each individual student's personal growth and investment in the course. He is an accomplished education practitioner and it shows: the way he structures his class is based off of years of his own teaching experience and research-based best practices. He is also such a sweet and sensitive guy! He allowed us to call his cell phone whenever we had questions and also invites the class to his home in Guilford for dinner at the end of the semester. Another strength, although seemingly a weakness to the faint of heart, are the weekly papers, Prof Hersh's signature touch. These papers are grueling, which is exactly the point. They hold students accountable to engage meaningfully with the course readings (of which there are plenty), toy with their arguments and ideas, and then develop and articulate their own stance on complicated concepts and multifaceted debates. This time-consuming, highly cerebral, and repeated process of reading, thinking, writing, and receiving his often sharp and unapologetic feedback is the kind of rigorous education Yale is supposedly all about but fails to deliver on a large scale. Few courses ask as much of students as this one does. While the content on educational philosophy and policy that EDST 210 teaches you is integral to the class, the practice of critically reading high volumes of text and writing persuasively and concisely is what makes the class invaluable to everyone who has the time, energy, and will to take it.\r\nWeaknesses: More often than not, Professor Hersh dominated the conversation in class. While he usually had much wisdom and knowledge to offer us, it could get repetitive sometimes and tangential to the week's readings. I wish that much more time was dedicated to student-driven discussion. It is one thing to learn how to write convincingly, and it is another to learn how to speak with the same conviction and rhetorical force. The course could double its instructional power by affording students more opportunities to speak and debate candidly with one another, like a true seminar. ",
            "\u00a0Overall an excellent course. It's well organized, topical, and truly helps students grow. I would advise the professor to spend much less time at the beginning of each class discussing the next week's writing assignment. All of the information he conveys could be included in the writing prompt freeing up more time for class discussion. Further, the professor, rightfully, hold very high standards for student written work, far higher than any other professor at Yale. I think students would be better served if they were required to submit drafts of the weekly papers and the professor provided his feedback with time for students to revise the papers before they were due for a grade. ",
            "\u00a0While a hard problem to fix, I wish this course could have been longer. By spending so much time of the foundations of the issues we were not able to spend very much time on solutions. ",
            "\u00a0There are no weaknesses ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting topic, feedback from Hersh\r\nWeaknesses: meeting times lot was too long "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0absolutely take this class - it'll change the way you think about education, and generally force you to be a more articulate and thoughtful person. you'll work a lot and learn a lot. ",
            "\u00a0If you're looking for a challenge as a thinker and a writer and you're interested in American education broadly, I couldn't recommend Hersh's seminar any more.\r\n\r\nYou will not find an instructor at Yale that provides the abundance of clear, directed feedback on your writing and argumentative style that will really challenge you to think critically and present arguments cogently and clearly like Prof. Hersh does. He's a wonderful seminar leader, and assigns interesting sets of readings and has an incredible wealth of experiences to offer the seminar discussion. Just listening to him speak about education is arguably worth the course credit.\r\nProf Hersh will also have the class over for homemade dinner, and really make the effort to get to know everyone individually inside AND outside the classroom in a way that the vast majority of Yale teachers do not. This was absolutely wonderful.\r\n\r\nMy biggest warning: this course requires an incredibly high level of dedication. There are regularly 150-200 pages of reading (albeit more interesting and digestible reading than your typical Yale social science course) weekly, and a reading response that's basically an extended 2-4 page essay. Every single week leading up to the midterm (which itself is a long analytical paper). And response papers a few weeks after the midterm, too. \r\nIf you're game for that workload (as our class of ten was), you'll see tremendous and rewarding benefits. But be wary of this.\r\n\r\nA nice Cr/D if you don't want to risk low grades, but even then, Professor Hersh has an incredible penchant for intrinsically motivating students to write, think and perform at their best.\r\n\r\nTake (or at least, shop) this course if you're remotely interested. ",
            "\u00a0If you are realistic about your other work/ability to invest a lot of time in this course and excited to rigorously engage with issues in education (including your own educational experience) and grow as a writer/thinker/student/citizen, then YES! The class is demanding and often exhausting but will help you grow so much. I loved how cumulative it felt, despite different 'topics.' The midterm essay prompt shows this element of the course well: we were asked to write a response to a hypothetical Congressional joint subcommittee asking In light of the necessary, multiple purposes of 21st century schooling, the diversity of our population, and the seemingly intractable \"achievement gap, how should the country best proceed in improving its schools?\" \r\n\r\nProfessor Hersh is amazing; his feedback was thorough and almost immediate (I often would wake up after a long night writing the weekly paper to find he had already sent me my grade and feedback), he really cares about his students (and offers his phone number and in-person meetings as extra support), and his experience in education is long and diverse.\r\n\r\nI also learned so much from the other students in this small seminar. It really drew students with diverse interests and experiences-- from all majors (only a few were education studies scholars), years, and many different professional aspirations. I really appreciated having so many different perspectives-- and so many diversely talented, caring, intelligent people-- lifitng this class.\r\n\r\nA last note, instead of a final, the course ends with a 12-15p research paper. This-- diving off into independent research on any educational topic of my choosing-- was the one thing I didn't really feel prepared for. That said, Professor Hersh made himself very accessible for advice/feedback. My advice if you take this course (and DO IT if you can commit to it, it's amazing) would be to be alert to what topics might interest you throughout the course and to the fact that question- and source-finding will take a while.\r\n\r\nYou can (and should!) do this course if you are excited about education and willing to invest in the class and embrace transformational growth. I had no previous experience in education coursework, and as a first-year, this semester was my first at Yale. This in theory intimidated me a bit-- what could I contribute to a class full of upperclassmen?-- but wasn't actually a problem. I felt fully engaged in/excited by the class and able to contribute to and grow from it; I am so glad it started my experience at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Great class! I would definitely recommend it to anyone with an interest in education and education policy, specifically. Professor Hersh is incredible - he's a harsh grader but very fair and willing to meet one-on-one with anyone to improve their writing. Every week, there's 100-200 pages of reading and a short essay, but Professor Hersh is relatively flexible with the due date on the essay if you're having a busy week, and the reading is super interesting so it doesn't feel like that much. Take the class!! ",
            "\u00a0I recommend this course to everyone who is serious about improving their writing skills, debating what exactly it means to be 'educated,' and reflecting on their own Yale experience in the context of developmental learning and psychology. Many students bemoan the fact that this class is not a WR credit, but the value of the course far outweighs the inconvenient lack of a distributional requirement designation. Clear thinking and cogent writing are instrumental in all of our endeavors as students and in leading fulfilling and successful lives beyond Yale. While most everyone at Yale can write decently, many have settled with their abilities, and few devote the time and energy necessary to reach their fullest academic potential. Professor Hersh understands this about Yale students, how a lot of us amass too many responsibilities and commitments to engage meaningfully in each one, including our academic pursuits. He works with each and every one of us to take our critical thinking and writing to the next level of thoughtfulness, sophistication, and clarity. If you decide to take this course, I implore you to dedicate the time this class and Professor Hersh deserve. He will whip you into shape and into the student and writer you ought to be, but either never allowed or never believed yourself to be. This process of personal growth will be excruciating (particularly on Sunday nights, when weekly papers are due), and the class will certainly become your biggest commitment of the semester, but it will all be worthwhile and immensely rewarding by the end of the term when you see how far your writing has progressed in such a short amount of time and how your Yale education seems to possess even more gravity than you previously thought. It might be hard to fathom how a single course can leave such an indelible mark on its students if you've never taken a class with Professor Hersh, but trust me, if you take EDST 210 or 250 with him, you'll hold yourself and your education to a standard higher than ever before. ",
            "\u00a0This was one of the most engaging and rewarding classes of my time at Yale, though it does require a great deal of time and effort. Unlike other rewarding yet difficult classes, this one never felt unpleasant. I did a lot of work for it, but I always enjoyed it. If you want to grow as a writer and a student take this class. You'll also have the added bonus of getting to know professor Hersh, one of the sweetest and most caring mentors I've ever had. ",
            "\u00a0Don't let the relatively high courseload rating scare you off, this class has been the best I've taken at Yale almost solely because Professor Hersh is so amazing. The class was challenging because of the time spent doing the (again, relatively) high volume of reading and writing but (as you'll learn in the course) it is truly worth it because you will learn SO MUCH and your writing will improve immensely. Take this class early in your Yale career because the way Professor Hersh teaches is transformative. He is always available for advice on papers and lets you revise to earn a higher grade. Y'all, he grades things within HOURS. I'm talking I wrote my final paper and turned it in at 6am and he had comments, the grade for my final paper, and my final grade for the class back to me by 10am. AMAZING. You will also form a tight bond with your classmates (partly because of the shared misery of a paper due every week but mostly because of the way Professor Hersh runs class). The seminars themselves are engaging and every week is different. Professor Hersh varies the papers, sometimes you're working by yourself and sometimes you're working in pairs or groups, which helps to lessen the workload. As far as the subject matter, you'll learn about the state of education in America from early childhood to college. Since it's so broad there's not much time to go in depth but the issues we face at each level interact so it never feels choppy. On top of being a dream in terms of an educator, Professor Hersh is also extremely understanding and compassionate. Plus, at the end of the semester he invite class to a dinner hosted in his home which is a lovely way to wrap up the thirteen-or-so weeks of class. ",
            "\u00a0This is the best course I've taken. All students should take this course, especially if you care about education. ",
