I have been humbled by hearing these highly accomplished individuals share their struggles, adversities and triumphs with their audience, from a human perspective. \r\n\r\nThere was no pomp and show or a parading of their glory but rather a portrayal of determination and persistence in the presence of confusion and uncertainty. This was a common thread in all their stories, reaffirming the necessity for resilience, self-compassion and faith when pursuing one's dreams. \r\n\r\nThis class should be entitled, 'Classes in Wisdom'. \r\n\r\nHighly recommended.
