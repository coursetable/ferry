            "\u00a0It's definitely a writing credit class, as Prof. Kreiner gives you plenty of feedback on each essay. If you're not familiar already with black literature, this course is a good overview of that, which also intersects with strains of black political thought, identity, and racial form for the past ~200 years. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the close reading and in-class discussion of this class. I also learned how to elaborate on my thoughts, framing them into concise paragraphs organized by theme. My rhetorical analysis vastly improved. ",
            "\u00a0I learn to write and research a thought out college level paper while also being able to analyze literary text. "

            "\u00a0My semester, the class was 6 people, but I hear that it was 20+ the year before, so your mileage may vary. The 6 person class felt like a boon, though--each class was a true conversation, and a lot of our views about works in question were contributed without inhibition.\r\nProf. Kreiner knows what he's looking for, will give you grades accordingly, and will give you plentiful feedback on each of the three essays. A qualm about the class structure I had, though, was the lack of room for rewrites/edits after full drafts were written. With each of the three essays significantly different from each other, it was sometimes hard to improve based on comments on the previous essay and to internalize his feedback when the next essay was so different. ",
            "\u00a0Some strengths include the interesting readings and the avialiability of the professor. "

            "\u00a0Yes, if you're interested in improving your written literary analysis skills and African-American literature. Be wary, though: 115 is different from 114 and 120, in that 115 is indeed mostly focused on discussing and analyzing literature during class, and basically all of the parts that make it a writing credit are done outside of class (ie writing the three papers). ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested in writing and literature. The books on the curriculum were really interesting, although sometimes a challenge to understand (ex. the Salt Eaters), and the critiques I got on my writing in the form of partial draft comments were incredibly helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Yes because you learn a lot about the word and the Black expierence while reading interesting books. "
