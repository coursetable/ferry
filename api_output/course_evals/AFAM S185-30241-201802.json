The writings are still fresh, resonating with the class and giving room to discuss not only the technique of each piece individually, but how their narrative relate to contemporary issues. The weakness would be it relies heavily on student contribution and discussion, so the quality of the class would be directly linked to the engagement of your classmates. "
