            "\u00a0I have a very solid basis of the Russian language now.  The vocabulary was appropriate to what I need to know in basic conversation and in relation to being a student, and all the basic grammar concepts were covered. ",
            "\u00a0The course covered a lot more grammar concepts than were covered in L1. Definitely moved at a fast pace and you'll fall behind quickly if you don't review a lot. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to utilize Russian grammar to produce my own speech and writing.  I learned Russian vocabulary pertaining to a range of practical topics. I also learned how the Russian language connects to the cultures of Russia and Eurasia more generally. ",
            "\u00a0More conversational skills in basic russian, everyday vocab ",
            "\u00a0Russian language skills and insight into the unique culture of the country. The class solidified my understanding of concepts learned in L1 and helped provide me with a framework to talk/understand. ",
            "\u00a0Learning a different language is super tough but opens you to a new part of the world. It's a challenge that is unlike any other academic area. ",
            "\u00a0Russian language skills in speaking, listening, reading, and writing. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Lots of material; could be organized a little more so that I knew exactly what to study for the test.  A lot of the time, there were things on the test that we had talked about once in class, and that was in passing.  Proportionately stressing what is taught vs. what is on the test would be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Really amazing language course overall. It really feels like Russian is taught in a really good way that allows you to learn it faster than most other languages at Yale. The course is incredibly well-organized, and as long as you stay on top of it you shouldn't have any problems. Great professor and TAs. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very strong for multiple reasons.  The explanation and attention to grammar was excellent.  The instructor, Julia, was very engaging.  The course brought in certain elements of contemporary and historical Russian culture through poetry and song as well, which helped us to connect what we were learning to real life applications.\r\n\r\nThe one thing that I would like to have had more of in the course was opportunities to listen and speak in conversational settings, however, this was mostly due to the fact that my schedule prevented me from attending the Russian table. ",
            "\u00a0Very good at forcing students to interact with the content every day but a little intimidating ",
            "\u00a0More spontaneous speaking practice in class. I felt very comfortable writing but I could not answer questions in Russian quickly. ",
            "\u00a0It allows the student to engage i.e. daily speaking in Russian. Sometimes the homework and unit schedule is rushed because of overall semester planning. We ended up having little time for the last units that were tested. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: nice have alternating teachers, needs to be more collaborative with each other to practice speaking more, hard to get talking practice\r\nweaknesses: teacher's aggressiveness sometimes scared or upset students, lots of work and assessments and not enough time on them ",
            "\u00a0This term is definitely a pick-up in pace from last, but the clear structure and the fact that we have access to all the materials in advance and always know where we're going to be headed helps with expectations and planning for the term. The continuous assessment with quizzes and regular unit tests also helps to keep engagement consistent rather than with spikes around midterms and finals, which is really important for language learning I think. "

            "\u00a0If you want to learn Russian, you will not find better instruction than here.  It's tough, and it's a lot of material taught very quickly, but it's worth it. ",
            "\u00a0I would 100% recommend taking Russian at Yale. It's a challenge, so you have to want to do it, but if you commit it'll be a great experience. The structure of the course allows the language to be taught really effectively - more effectively than any other language course I've taken - and Julia really wants to help you learn the language. Taking Russian was one of the best decisions I've made at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to other students.  Russian is a beautiful language with a rich history and culture and practical application in today's global world. Julia is a great teacher and cares deeply about the material and the students.  I found this course to be a great way to learn Russian. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Culturally relevant and very interesting ",
            "\u00a0Julia is a great professor. Take this as a language! Definitely not easy but very rewarding if you put in the time. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course. This language is taught in a very easy to understand way and I am amazed at the amount of Russian I know with having initially no knowledge. I started with L1 only knowing the Cyrillic alphabet, but I have fan now recognize different phrases and hold conversations. There is nothing more satisfying than hearing the bad guys talk in Russian in action movies and being able to understand what theyre saying. This class isnt the easiest in terms of grammar, but the teaching style is set up such that the grade isnt that important. The main focus of the class is to learn and the grade that results is an indication of how much time and effort you put into the class. ",
            "\u00a0Only if you are willing to dedicate yourself fully - your time, your focus, and be strong enough to keep pushing forward ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. Now is a really interesting time politically to be engaging with Russian both as a language and culturally. It's also a very well-conceived course where you learn a lot in a short space of time, but feel well-supported throughout. "
