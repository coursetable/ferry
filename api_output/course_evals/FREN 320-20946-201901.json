            "\u00a0I learned about the fundamentals of existentialism, albeit from a literary perspective (which I personally prefer). We also read a lot of very interesting work from the era: novels, philosophical essays, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Understand the social, and ideological background of post wwii Paris through the study of existentialism. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about the historical context of Resistance in Nazi Occupied France, post-WWII France and French colonial empire. Learned about how various existentialist philosophers were in conversation with each other throughout this period, the different media through which they presented their philosophical ideas (novels, plays, philosophical essays, etc.) as well as how they interacted with each other in their deeply enmeshed personal lives. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my close reading ability and received instruction in writing while studying French existentialist literature and culture. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a really solid understanding of existentialist philosophy. Specifically, I learned how different writers incorporated existentialist principles into the narrative of their works of fiction. I also feel like I left the course with a much better understanding of post-war French history. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a ton about existentialism, close reading, and the intersection of literature and history and philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt about the French exisitentialists, their culture, their works and their lives. I thought it was a very nice overview of their work in general and the movement they were so fundamentally a part of. "

            "\u00a0I like the overall structure and choice of reading for this course. Professor Kaplan is good at 'lecturing' during the beginning of the seminar, and it is always interesting to see what materials she has brought to discuss. The downside of this is that we have very little time to discuss any individual book, since the class only meets once a week. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed all the readings in the course tho I feel the discussion is a bit insufficient. Its hard to discuss an entire book in just two hours. ",
            "\u00a0Biggest strength is that this course was taught by Prof Kaplan, who is absolutely incredible and is extremely knowledgeable about this historical period, the philosophy of existentialism and the personal lives of the writers/philosophers. \r\nWeakness was that the course was too big for a seminar, which often made the class discussion feel incoherent and not unified or continuous. If the class had been smaller, I think we would have had more time to dive deeper into passages and do more close reading. However, Prof Kaplan's efforts to draw participation from every person in the class made up for this weakness. ",
            "\u00a0I found the seminars to be very effective, and I very much looked forward to class every week. Prof. Kaplan is brilliant and her historical approach really illuminated the readings. Sometimes I found it hard to participate because the some people were pretty intimidating, but Prof. Kaplan did her best to curtail this, especially in the second half of the course. The workload was also very reasonable, consisting of a midterm presentation, one two page reading response, a final presentation and final paper on a book or film not on the syllabus. \r\n\r\nI have three suggestions to improve the course. I appreciated doing the midterm presentation in lieu of a midterm paper, but I think my writing would have improved even more if two, 2 page reading responses were assigned given that Prof. Kaplan gives extensive comments on your writing. I think doing a response in the first couple weeks of the course, and one after the midterm presentation would be ideal. Also, I found preparing for the final presentation to not be that productive, and in hindsight I would have enjoyed reading another book for the last seminar. Finally, I wish the course were not on Friday. Because of shopping period, we lose out on a class so that the semester is 12 weeks long instead of 13. If it were offered some other afternoon, we could have an extra day. ",
            "\u00a0The course was well organized, the reading list was extremely well curated, and class discussion flowed well. The writing assignments were meaningful and not too long. I don't think the course has any weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent reading list. Even the books that I didnt like (Sartres Nausea) I was glad I read, as our conversations were illuminating and these works are all essential in understanding the existentialist movement. ",
            "\u00a0I thought it was great that we got to survey so many works throughout the semester. I wonder if the coursework could be made more manageable spending more time on longer texts and doing more close reading of it. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student with one caveat: this is a course on literature, not philosophy. Hence, the reading is mostly novels, which are all very good. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, easy and very enjoyable class. You'll read a book a week, and discuss it. Other than a paper at the end, that's pretty much it. Professor is lovely. Highly recommended ",
            "\u00a0Yes! All the readings are amazing. If you like French culture / existentialism, take it! ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend, for the opportunity to be in a seminar taught by Prof Kaplan, who is amazing and cares a lot about her students. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course is a great opportunity to learn about French existentialist culture for experienced and novice readers of literature alike. The readings are super interesting and compelling, Prof. Kaplan is brilliant, and the workload is entirely reasonable. I found it to be the perfect combination of historicizing and close reading. The class is not a gut by any means, but it won't be the most difficult class on your schedule. I highly recommend taking the course if it's offered again, or anything with Prof. Kaplan for that matter. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to any student who is interested in philosophy or French literature. The readings were thoroughly enjoyable and the class discussion was very enriching. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Its great for anyone with an interest in the topic, no matter if you come from philosophy, literature, or STEM. Prof. Kaplan is incredibly brilliant and facilitates great discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely take it if you're interested in an overview of the French existentialists, their works and the moment in France that motivated so much of their thoughts and beliefs. I think this is a great class to take and Professor Kaplan does such a great job to make the whole class an experience. Bear in mind that there are quite a bit of readings every week (we cover about a book of varying lengths a week), but it's worth it because if you enjoy that, you will really learn a lot throughout the semester.
