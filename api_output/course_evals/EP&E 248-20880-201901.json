            "\u00a0Learned a ton about the theory of the American political system -- not just how it's written in the Constitution, but how it's lived every day. As Professor Fotos said on the last day, most classes in political science here teach you how to play the game, but this one teaches you why the game matters, and how we can make sure that it sticks around. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a lot of knowledge and exposure to political theory and the interactions between institutions and social movements. The course was really interesting and linked many topics together. Good reading list and a lot of freedom when it comes to paper topics. ",
            "\u00a0We talked about some of the theory underlying American democracy, with a focus on the writers Alexis de Tocqueville, Danielle Allen, Vincent Ostrom, and Martin Luther King, Jr. In the second half of the course, we applied the ideas of these authors to discussing modern social movements and particular policy debates. There was also a bit of a military focus towards the end of the course; we had a guest come and speak about the Navy, took a trip to West Point, and hosted some cadets from the academy in our class one week. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a more clear framework for understanding the theory behind the constitutional design of the republic. I particularly enjoyed discussions about reconstituting moments and each political bodies role (citizens, representatives, activists, military, etc) in the very sustenance of the democracy. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about using political language more precisely.  This skill has really helped me think through a lot of long spanning problems that incorporate variables of history, language, culture, politics, economics and more.  I feel I have a much more sophisticated understanding of how to discuss and comprehend broad political ideas. ",
            "\u00a0This course had nice discussions in class with participation from many students, but the topics were both general and commonly taught ones (MLK, Tocqueville) so I'm not sure I learned many new things. ",
            "\u00a0I learned quite a bit about how to ask appropriate probing questions about our political institutions. I also engaged quite a bit with reading material from Martin Luther King and other authors that I had never been exposed to before as extensively. Those two things were about the only positive aspects of the course. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: the best seminar discussion I've ever seen here, and Fotos deserves a lot of the credit for that. Field trip to West Point was a highlight, as were the guests.\r\nWeaknesses: theory can be really hard to discuss without having done it before, so some more support for students without much theoretical background would be great. Some readings can be pretty dense and hard to access, too -- Ostrom in particular. ",
            "\u00a0Course is structured really well and weekly assignments help with writing skills and learning. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the way that this course focused on student discussion. This can often be difficult to manage in a seminar, especially when there's one or two students who attempt to always dominate the conversation, but Prof. Fotos was a really great moderator. This was the first course I've taken at Yale that was so deeply focused on student discussion, but I thought that it worked really well and challenged me to present my ideas in a way that was clear and supported. It seemed to me that the material of the course lent itself well to this format.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I really enjoyed the book we read about the March on Washington Movement. It was really valuable to learn about the decades of organizing that led up to the actual March on Washington in 1963, and there were a lot of important figures featured in the book who I don't think that most Americans (or Yale students) know nearly enough about. ",
            "\u00a0If you like student-student debate and discussion, this class is almost entirely that. Whether thats a strength or a weakness depends on your preferences. That said, I found some lessons lacked the cohesion that a more professor-led seminar provides. Fotos writes excellent memos for each class but as discussion moves, we often lost the themes of the memo and moved into our own, less structured discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Many strengths - this is an incredible professor with a gift and apparent passion for teaching.  Excellent feedback on writing, excellent accessibility to discuss ideas.  I think more readings on the nature of political language would be helpful to clarify the deeper themes of the class as I understand them. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were few and far between. I appreciated some of our class discussions, and learned quite a bit during our field trip to West Point. The weaknesses, however, were overwhelming. We were expected to come into the course understanding Professor Fotos preferred style of writing, and his stubborn commentary and lack of detail in feedback made it incredibly difficult to succeed in the course. Seminars were often poorly led and Professor Fotos did not continue discussions well, leaving the students to make unfounded claims, claims which he would later scrutinize us for if we used them in our writing. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely, if you can get in. Probably the best seminar I've taken in political science. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course for anyone interested in gaining exposure to political theory. The course combines learning of theory with practical applications to divide up the density of the reading and the theory, which is really ideal. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Fotos is all-around wonderful, and it's very clear that he cares a great deal about his students and the course. Having a professor who takes the time to try and construct the best course that they can makes SUCH a difference, and I'm glad that I ended up taking this class with him. \r\n\r\nThis course also improved my ability to write concisely. Fotos gave us weekly \"memo\" assignments based on the reading, and they always had a word or sentence limit. I normally find weekly reading responses pretty annoying, but Fotos was very deliberate in the way that the designed them and they helped me practice conveying my ideas clearly and briefly. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely shop it. This is a very different style of seminar to most and its worth sampling before buying in for the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely - one of the best seminars I've taken at Yale and excellent for anyone who expects to remain a citizen of the U.S. after attending school here. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely not recommend this course to another student. Professor Fotos was punitive in his grading technique and passive aggressive in his suggestions. The quality of the readings does not even make the course worth it. Do you writing credit elsewhere. "
