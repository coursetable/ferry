            "\u00a0In this course I gained an extensive variety of knowledge regarding German grammar, vocabulary, and culture. The amount of information we learned and speaking skills we gained is amazing considering we have only begun learning the language. ",
            "\u00a0Basic German conversational skills and grammar. A wide breadth of basic vocabulary ",
            "\u00a0This class teaches what a lot of introductory language courses would teach. This class teaches how to read, speak, and listen to German. In taking this class, you learn vocabulary, sentence structure, the present and a past tense of verbs, and the nominative, accusative, and dative cases. ",
            "\u00a0At the end of this class you will have gained the ability to understand spoken German at a rudimentary level and you'll also have gained a clear grasp of the basic grammatical and syntactic aspects of the language. ",
            "\u00a0Learning basic German conversations ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of basic German vocabulary and grammar, as well as culture information. "

            "\u00a0The homework system as well as the textbook choice is excellent for english speakers. The assessments were fair and included information from both the textbook and supplementary vocabulary. The final project was fun and actually helped me gain a lot of knowledge regarding German culture. The long walk everyday to this class was completely worth it. ",
            "\u00a0Using some English for clarification throughout the course would be helpful, particularly for grammar concepts. Oftentimes, when new grammar was introduced it was taught in German which made it difficult for me to learn initially. ",
            "\u00a0Since this class meets Monday through Friday, and there are frequent homework assignments, this course is very good at reinforcing what is learned in class. It is also great at showing clearly how the concepts learned should be used and outlining the grammatical rules. One weakness of the course is that vocabulary-wise, it is not exactly clear what vocabulary is essential and what is not, especially with words that are not nouns or verbs. ",
            "\u00a0This course has instructors that care deeply about the class. There is very little focus on getting students to speak unrehearsed German within class. ",
            "\u00a0Some activities are beyond skills for L1 students and a lot of time students would just write responses in English and put it into Google translate because it is almost impossible for them to complete it otherwise. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the classes and workload were both effective and interesting. There was nothing in this course which I found particularly problematic. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course if you are interested in learning another language. German is very similar to English in both grammar and vocabulary, and the teaching curriculam is very fair and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course because I feel it was effective in developing basic German conversational skills. I went from knowing no German at all to being able to have simple conversations, so I feel like the course was successful and time well spent. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student who wants to learn German. German 110 is a fun class and it is a class that you learn a lot in. The teaching style is also very helpful for learning the material and the pace of the class is good. To learn the material well, the student needs to put in effort outside of class to review what was learned in class, but overall, the class teaches a lot and it is a rewarding experience. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class, if you have a deep appreciation for German culture and language. Though the instructors are knowledgeable and caring, this is not a fun class. ",
            "\u00a0Ya I do enjoy learning German! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I thought that I got a good understanding of the language in a way that was interesting and prepared me to continue. "
