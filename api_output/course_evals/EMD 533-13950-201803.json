            "\u00a0I really liked that the first hour of class was a lecture, and the second half of class was meeting with your group to discuss the weekly homework and make progress on your project. ",
            "\u00a0The course was a great introduction to the field of implementation science. However, I do wish it were a little less clinical/medical based, with a greater focus on implementation science in public health. ",
            "\u00a0It was a good and comprehensive introduction to the field of implementation science.  I liked how the course was structured around a semester-long individual/group project so that each week's lecture could be applied in the homework to a topic that each student was interested in. ",
            "\u00a0I found this course to provide a useful background in implementation research and its key concepts. I appreciated how the assignments were intended to represent a scaffolded approach to developing a proposal to conduct implementation research as well as the liberty to explore the application of implementation science on a topic of my own choice. I also appreciated how the final assignment represented a real-world product that an implementation researcher would be expected to produce. Finally, I liked how the instructor directed us to additional resources to continue training in implementation science.\r\n\r\nI think the class could be improved by better scaffolding the assignments to build towards the final project. This could be done by providing clearer instructions and expectations for each of the assignments and by expediting feedback so that it can be incorporated into subsequent assignments. I often felt that feedback provided on assignments seemed to convey contradictory or unreasonable assignment expectations. Additionally, some of the assignments could be improved by better tying them to the final project. I also think it would have been helpful to explore some of the concepts in a more open-ended fashion during class rather than spending as much time on lecture as we did. ",
            "\u00a0This is one of the best and most useful courses I took at YSPH. It has real-world implications, teaches and encourages critical thinking as well as study design. \r\nLecture and discussion with the professor and the TA were definitely the strengths of the course.\r\nThe one hour discussion part of class (each class has 1 hr teaching, 1 hr discussion) was ok, but I think it needs to be restructured for best use of time in the course. A lot of students in my class worked on solo projects so that time was partly wasted. A lot of the questions that were generated during that discussion were meant to clarify concepts from class and I think a larger group discussion (including the professor/TA - who even when they did the best job they could circulating, still couldn't address all questions) would have been helpful.\r\n\r\nPerhaps taking a bit more time in lecture going over examples of how the concepts are applied (and having more reading examples of concept application, rather than theoretical discussion regarding the concepts) and making the discussion session more interactive would improve the course. ",
            "\u00a0One thing I liked about this course was the chance to practice writing a NIH-style grant. This was an interesting final project, and I appreciated the chance to learn this skill!\r\n\r\nHowever, this course was somewhat of a disappointment in terms of the learning outcomes. Coming into the course, I was slightly confused about what implementation science was. After finishing the course, I am still slightly confused about what implementation science is. In my opinion, the lecture style and homework setup of the course was not conducive to effectively learning about implementation science. I appreciated the discussion time of the course after the lecture, but generally my group was confused about what was supposed to be happening during that time, the classroom was very loud (it always seemed to be too many people for the size of the room), and we did not make any good progress during that time. If we were going to have discussion time, I would have preferred to meet with my group outside of class instead of spending an unproductive hour in class. For the homeworks and group project, it would have been more helpful if we completed the homeworks (after the midterm project) together as a group instead of separately. By individually completing the homeworks, my group ended up feeling confused and conflicted each week about what our group was doing for the final project.\r\n\r\nOverall, I was excited for this course but felt that the lectures (heavily focused on communicable diseases), class time structure, and homework/project structure was not effective or enjoyable, and I did not walk away with a much deeper understanding about implementation science. ",
            "\u00a0Implementation science is very important and quite different from regular studies that most do in the scientific research field. Thus it was hard to wrap my head around this at first, but the professor and TFs were very helpful. The cons were that during the discussion half of class, rather than staying within the same final project group, mixing people from groups up, or pairing groups would have been much more useful. There's a wealth of backgrounds in the class, including professionals. I've learned more that one day we were told to mix than the numerous days of talking to the same people and just doing the project, and relying on the Cheryl or Luke to come around for questions. ",
            "\u00a0Dr Davis is a great lecturer who clearly dedicates a lot of time in preparing this class. Really liked the structure of the homework. Liked the structure of class with lecture and then chance to work in teams on the project. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The course was designed in a way where each week built on top of each other making it easy to follow along. \r\nWeaknesses: The course seems to be geared towards advanced professional students and PhD students. ",
            "\u00a0AP- Strengths: Has given me a toolbox of skills to apply to real-world situations, where I might want to address an evidence-practice gap. An evidence-based and systematic approach is used throughout the course.\r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes learning about the theoretical models underpinning implementation science can be a little dry, I think the course would be improved by using real life examples where implementation science has been used. We had some sessions where there was time for group discussions, this wasn't particularly fruitful for our group and perhaps this time could be used for more examples of IS in practice. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this was a very stimulating course. The material is very interesting and relevant to all fields essentially. There was an extensive focus on theory which was difficult for me to wrap my brain around. Perhaps some more case examples along the way would be beneficial to help focus down the theory for people who think more practically. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed this course.  My understanding of implementation science has greatly improved.  I might recommend that the time allotted for group work be shortened to 30 minutes so that we can spend more time learning the key concepts from the lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Practical. I see myself going back to these notes and utilizing these frameworks in my future work. I also appreciated that we had ample time to work on our project within class.\r\nWeaknesses: Homework seemed a little bit nitpicky. Lecture sometimes felt non-engaging. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the interactive aspect of the course. The professor incorporated his own experiences into lectures and many of the students in the class also had experience in the area of Implementation Science so I found that I learned a lot from them also. ",
            "\u00a0strengths:\r\n-great introduction to implementation science\r\n-having the grant proposal be the final project was a great way to apply the concepts introduced in class and also experience the process in a classroom setting \r\n-introduced and discussed concepts and strategies that will be very helpful to use in the future\r\n\r\nweaknesses/improvements:\r\n-providing more examples of the process implementation science, as well as type of grant proposals for implementation science would be really helpful for future classes ",
            "\u00a0I think it would have been helpful to have worked on the grant piece by piece each week instead of the weekly assignments which we also went over in class anyway ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- provided a structured way to think about solving implementation challenges. Introduced a relatively new field to me.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- implementation science is still emerging and the concepts can come across more like jargon if you don't really invest the time to understand the nuances and differences. \r\n\r\nI think that assigning groups and topics so early was a little tough- perhaps working through examples as a whole class in the beginning and then establishing the groups more towards the middle of the semester might have made the course a bit more cohesive. ",
            "\u00a0I ended up auditing this course because the material was harder to keep up with than expected. ",
            "\u00a0I went into this class excited about implementation science but unfortunately am leaving quite disappointed and disillusioned with the field. I think this class could have been much more effective if it were kept very small (10-15 students or so). I did appreciate how class was divided into ~1 hour of lecture and ~1 hour of group-work, but the lectures themselves were not that helpful and only made me more confused about the terminology. It also gave off the impression of being a high school class, where the weekly HW assignments felt like busy work with nit-picky grading. I also don't believe that a HW response to an exercise to build a research proposal/NIH-grant in progress can be \"incorrect\" and felt that these weekly assignments were actually painful and time-consuming. Overall, I think treating this class more like a graduate-level course and less like a point heavy high school course would be a positive step forward, as well as clearer lectures and more in-depth examples. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: great breadth of information, very supportive instructor\r\nWeaknesses: hard to come out of it with tangible knowledge of everything. we covered so much so quickly that it was hard to retain. i also struggled with attaining a more tangible project till basically the very end. the class is more geared towards clinicians and medical students, so as a public health student with no background in implementation science, it was hard for me to conceptualize everything. i was also one of the only groups that presented specifically on a public health intervention, not clinical intervention. i wish the class more geared towards PH students + actually had tangible projects within new haven ",
            "\u00a0The class provided a good introduction to the field of implementation science and gave students a chance to apply concepts on a sample project. However, there were times when the concepts seemed disjointed and difficult to apply. Instead of multiple individual projects, I wonder if we could develop one research question as a class so that we can apply the concepts discussed in class on that one topic and clarify any confusion.

Finally, I think the instructor did a good job of focusing above all on supporting our understanding of the key concepts of implementation science.\r\n\r\nThe main way the instructor's teaching could be improved would be related to the structuring of assignments, as mentioned above.

One area for improvement could be in the structure of the course, and potentially having a shorter lecture period and then a lab/discussion section later in the week where groups could come meet with Luke to talk about their individual projects. Meeting individually (our group) with Luke was generally the most helpful time during this course, and I think having a time where he could provide his help and suggestions to each group individually could improve the overall learning experience.\r\n\r\nHowever, overall Luke was a wonderful professor and truly cared about us learning the material and considering all potential barriers/facilitators to effectively applying or \"implementing\" our ideas.
