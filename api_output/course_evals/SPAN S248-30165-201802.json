            "\u00a0I learned a ton about the Spanish civil war and Spanish culture during the twentieth century. In Bilbao, we also learned so much about Spanish culturein day-to-day life, as well as Spanish economics and politics. ",
            "\u00a0SPANISH S248 through the Bilbao Study Abroad Program taught us of the Spanish Civil War, life under the dictatorship of Francisco Franco, and the transition to democracy after the dictatorship. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about a culture very different from my own, and the history of that culture and how the political atmosphere of Spain today came to be. ",
            "\u00a0Marketed for a better understanding of Spanish Culture and the History of Spain, this course offered far beyond simple cocktail conversation, this course gave essential background into Spain's development into the Modern Nation, and helped develop the skills necessary for a Spanish Study Abroad Experience. ",
            "\u00a0Coming into this class, I knew nothing about  La Guerra Civil, and very little about Spanish history overall. However, leaving this class, I now know SO much about the civil war, the culture, the effects of the war, what caused it and followed it. I was able to form opinions about the things I read and saw, and gained a new appreciation for certain aspects of the Spanish culture that I previously didn't know existed. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the history of Franco in Spain. ",
            "\u00a0Learned all about the history and politics of Spain from 1930(ish) to present with a larger focus on the Spanish Civil War and the ramifications of this conflict on Spanish culture and politics. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about Spanish history from 1936 to present day, specifically Spanish politics and culture. ",
            "\u00a0This class covers the history of Spain, introducing a little bit of background from before the twentieth century, then covering the Spanish Civil War and the reign of Franco, to the culture and life of Spain's modern society. All aspects of life are covered: politics, fine arts, theater, music, television, cinema, sports, and more. In addition to class discussions of the material, excursions that explore Spanish traditions, art, and life are included in the course. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the history of Spain, and was able to further develop my cultural awareness and historical knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0I was able to gain significant knowledge on the political, economical, and cultural landscape of Spain throughout the 20th and 21st centuries "

            "\u00a0I thought it was great! It moves quickly, but it has to do so to cover so much material in such little time. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is the inherently interesting and curious material that it covers, however I appreciated the films that was assigned as homework. I believe the clarity of the cuaderno readings could have been better. ",
            "\u00a0The strength was the amount of information we covered in a small amount of class time. The weakness was how detail oriented the quizzes were to the point that I would have to study upwards of 5 hours every weekend just on the culture part to do well on a 15 minute quiz. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The guest Lectures and activities in the second half of the semester.\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the ultural'selections for the first 4-weeks were better than others, for Example: Ay Carmela! offered more cultural insight then Pan's Labyrinth ",
            "\u00a0The class consisted of a 4 hour lecture once a week covering lengthy readings assigned during the week. While a lot of the information is fascinating, it gets repetitive and does not contribute to a thorough understanding of Spanish culture. ",
            "\u00a0The quizzes during L3 could be tough and the majority of us students would study 7+ hours for each one. The compositions were quite easy as they did not require this level of preparation (as long as you can write well in Spanish, you are good to go). Class discussions of material beyond merely regurgitating information from the text provided a great opportunity to practice spoken Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0The course was taught very well and graded fairly. I do not think there are any weaknesses with this course. ",
            "\u00a0This course was extremely important to my understanding of Spain and its culture. The most valuable part for me was the political aspect of the course. I couldn't imagine living in Spain for a month as I did with this program, but without the knowledge of the political system that this course taught me. Even still, I feel that this course was very well-rounded and very beneficial. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were that the history was taught very well. And the museums helped solidify some of the history. Some of the lectures from the Deusto professors were interesting as well. The course could be improved with more videos about the history. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were that the topics covered were relevant to our immersion portion which allowed us to interact with the host families better having already learned about the historical aspects of the country "

            "\u00a0Yes. It is a lot of memorization but very interesting material. ",
