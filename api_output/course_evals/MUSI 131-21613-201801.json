            "\u00a0A lot of music history and the history behind musical time periods, composers, and pieces. ",
            "\u00a0Prof Kreuzer made this class amazing because of her enthusiasm and passion for the topic. Take this class - you'll appreciate music so much more in such new ways. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a very comprehensive understanding of western music from the 1800's and on: how the music was composed, the composers and their lives, how society affected their music, and how to analyze their music. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a basic, broad understanding of the history of classical music. ",
            "\u00a0I can say I know western music since Beethoven now and I can talk about music in the musical language now. ",
            "\u00a0Social, political, cultural context for how musical composition and performance have evolved since 1800 ",
            "\u00a0I was able to learn so much about music history as well as how to listen to music more critically. I really enjoyed learning the historical context during which music was created. ",
            "\u00a0Great survey of the progression of post-1800 Western music. ",
            "\u00a0A really great summary course of western music history ",
            "\u00a0I learned about music history from 1800 on. I also learned how to effectively listen to a piece of western music from this time period. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a much greater comprehension of and appreciation for Western style of music. I learned how to write and talk about music using both technical and aesthetic terms. ",
            "\u00a0An ability to analyze and evaluate the intricacies of how and music developed. I now listen to music - both classical and all other genres - in a completely new light. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me an extensive overview of all the important movements in music that took place over the last two centuries, how to identify those different movements, and the contributions of well-known composers to the history of western music. This class covered everything from classicism and romanticism and composers like Beethoven, to very recent forms of music like electronic and chance music. In the more technical terms, I learned how to listen very carefully to different genres of music and tell how they are different, what meter, rhythm, tempo characterizes them and why do they belong to a specific movement and not the other. I also learned how to analyze pieces and use more musical terms in my academic writing. ",
            "\u00a0Cool facts about history of western music since Beethoven ",
            "\u00a0This class introduces you to the Western Music canon. You listen to the most important pieces of the last 200 years mostly chronologically while learning about the historical context and the composer's biographies. This course acknowledges that it does not represent all valuable music, but only Western Music though it does touch several times on non-Western music but only insofar as to provide context for something within the Western tradition. ",
            "\u00a0This course covers music history starting from Beethoven and ending at post-modern music. The course also covers relevant music theory concepts as well. Through the class, I now have a much more unified view of music history than before. "

            "\u00a0I enjoyed the listenings and class material. Wish there were more assignments or activities to get the information across. ",
            "\u00a0This class was simply great. The professor was extremely into what she was teaching and explained things very enthusiastically. The material was very engaging. There was a fair amount of work that built up my listening skills. ",
            "\u00a0The exam grading seemed non-uniform and a tad arbitrary. Professor Kreuzer is a wonderful lecturer. I wish that the course required more listening, providing a better picture of each composer by preventing a single work from defining their entire compositional style. ",
            "\u00a0this is a very dense course that could use an extra day to focus on lay music of the 20th century ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the music listening assignments because it allows us to apply what we learned in a challenging way. The lectures from Prof. Kreuzer are amazing and I was engaged for all of it. The structure of the class and the midterm made sense and challenged us in a way that we could apply our knowledge well.\r\nWeaknesses - the music memorization for the final felt like forced and almost unnecessary. ",
            "\u00a0Great breadth - honestly really enjoyed it. ",
            "\u00a0Our professor is an extraordinary lecturer and the course is structured nicely. It would have been nice to get to know the other students in the class better through more activities together, but it did not significantly make the course worse by any means. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Great overview of the history of Western music.\r\nWeaknesses: Readings tended to be redundant (ie all the content would be discussed during lecture). I would like future iterations of this class to have readings which differ greatly enough from lecture material. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Professor was honest, professional, passionate, efficient, and incredibly prepared for every single class. ",
            "\u00a0I think having to memorize the names of pieces and years for around 60 pieces for the final was a bit too much. I spent a lot of time trying to memorize names and years when I could be studying the actual material. I also think that the open questions in the midterm took more time than it was assigned to them. Other than that, the lectures were incredibly interesting, I really enjoyed the material being taught and the fusion of historical background and listening to actual pieces. The papers were also short and fun to write. In general the course was very well structured and thought-through. ",
            "\u00a0I very much enjoyed this course. Professor Kreuzer is an amazing lecturer and presented the material in a digestible way. The class connects music history with political developments, other forms of art, etc. The assignments and assessments were fair and solidified concepts for me. "

            "\u00a0Yes, will learn a lot about music history and increase music listening skills. ",
            "\u00a0This class is excellent. Although I came in with a music background, I learned a tremendous amount as this class is taught by an amazing professor who loves what she is teaching and that clearly shows. There is not too much work in this class and the work that there is really helps build your listening skills. Certainly worth taking if you have any interest in \"classical\" music. ",
            "\u00a0If you do not know classical music, or know very little about it, this course is fantastic. It is a great way to expose yourself to and understand classical music as an art form, and its role in history. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Good introduction to music over the past 200 years. ",
            "\u00a0If you're genuinely interested in music history, take it. Otherwise, don't. It's an basic lecture course on the subject. Assignments aren't that demanding but exams do require some preparation. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely!! I'd especially recommend it to people who have taken the western art history lecture with tim barringer before. the two classes really go well together because artists and musicians intermingled and it's fascinating to see common themes. ",
            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY! One of the best courses Ive taken at Yale. Incredibly good engaging course that was more interdisciplinary than I thought it would be! If youre interested in music history or how political, economic, and social factors interact with music this is the class for you. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! This class is challenging, the midterm and final are hard, but you learn so much and even though i didnt have any experience with music theory, I learned so much and had so much fun. Really recommended! ",
            "\u00a0Great course for people who like music but don't have a great background in it - definitely useful to know some beforehand though. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, one of the best classes I've taken ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this course! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. It is well taught and fun! The workload isnt bad and it is extremely interesting to listen to and learn about music from this time period. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you are interested in Western music in the abstract. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - especially if they play an instrument. I play cello, and after interacting with Professor Kreuzer and learning about the development of music, I have become more musical and more aware of the pieces I play. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, I highly recommend taking this course. It is not heavily work-loaded, and is very rewarding to look back and see how much interesting facts you know about music by the end of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Yes especially if you've played classical music before, it's a cool way to learn about the history and sociopolitical influences of various time periods on the evolution of music ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This course fits a wide audience. The professor and teaching assistant do a great job of accounting for widely varying musical talent in their grading.\r\n\r\nMoreover, for relatively little effort this course inspires you to appreciate one of the pillars of the Western intellectual tradition. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Even if you have no musical experience, you will find this course interesting and the course assumes no prior musical knowledge. Even if you are generally interested in history and not necessarily music, you will benefit from looking at history through a different lens. "
