            "\u00a0This course is an amazing look at how utopias have been developed and explored in fiction for centuries. The reading list and assignment breakdown is great and even ideal, but the divergence between the creative workload and the critical workload can be confusing and wasn't as well suited for workshops at the end of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0This class was led by two engaged, brilliant professors and it had a great reading list. I appreciated the chance to write creative and analytical assignments within the same course of study. I did not think the workshop format at the end of the semester was the best use of time, especially the workshopping of the 20-page analytical papers. I also thought that class discussion could have been better throughout the semester, but that might have been a result of us having a particularly quiet group. "

            "\u00a0Take this course if you want to read some great books from throughout history and really engage with your own thoughts and musings on what makes a great utopia. I recommend taking this class's creative writing component because it is unlike anything else you will be able to do at Yale and you'll learn so much about yourself from what you imagine makes a society perfect or imperfect. The workload is manageable overall, even if the reading can be a little heavy on some weeks, and there is a lot of flexibility in the writing that is perfect for the creative mind. ",
