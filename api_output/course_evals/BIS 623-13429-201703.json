            "\u00a0I think the course concept was interesting. We tried to prove the OLS model for regression and talk about how it was maybe not always the best way to estimate. But because of the structure of the course you could get by without understanding the math or the implications. Then, we didn't do similar proofs for logistic regression. Additionally, the homeworks often had errors which made it very confusing and often much more difficult to complete correctly. ",
            "\u00a0students need basic R knowledge beforehand ",
            "\u00a0It was hard to follow sometimes that everything (including the theoretical stuff) was in R. It seemed easier to do slides for the stuff that was like \"this is how a regression works\" even just for facility of review in the aftermath. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: learn regression and how to work R from base up; very useful for future use\r\nweakness: not very organized, no clear class structure ",
            "\u00a0The course is great. ",
            "\u00a0This course is structured poorly. The instructor does't have basic idea how to develop the course.\r\n\r\nThe instructor posted the final project on around Dec. 15th but it is due on Dec. 19th. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the textbook that the professor chose for this course is excellent - very clear, explains both the biostatistics and coding behind regression concepts, professor is kind and approachable\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: class feels too unstructured, difficult to follow the concept that was being taught due to unstructured teaching and jumping back and forth between windows especially for someone with little experience in R\r\n\r\nSuggestions: Use powerpoints when introducing concepts in class, a short background on the type of regression we are going over in class that day including assumptions, applications, etc would be very helpful ",
            "\u00a0I definitely learned a lot but the class seemed kind of unorganized. It could be improved by having more concrete deadlines and clearer assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - I learned R and got comfortable using R to run regressions.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Lectures are very disorganized and move way too fast, especially for someone who is new to R. The assumptions on what students should already know in regards to R and statistical concepts are not properly conveyed. The constant switching back and forth between R and Terminal (or whatever it's called) was jarring and made it hard to type notes. Also PLEASE give a short break in the middle of class or better yet, make class shorter because almost everyone stopped paying attention an hour in to class. ",
            "\u00a0Loved this class. At first it was hard and abstract because R is a complex platform to understand. But after 2-3 weeks, it became a breeze. I enjoyed learning R and how Dr. Kane structured the class. ",
            "\u00a0This course was effective at introducing me to R programming. It should probably be re-advertised as a course in R rather than a focus on regression analysis. The statistics content was often taught somewhat disorganizedly, and unclearly. It could be improved by including more formal statistics instruction, and especially more information on assessing the goodness of models. Even the R content could be presented in a more straightforward way, with more instruction in fundamental practices/concepts in R programming. I think a lot of this could be facilitated by formally adopting the textbook and assigning accompanying readings. I would say the strength of course instruction was the in-class analyses performed, which was where I learned most. Probably the best part of the class or the midterm and final exams, which gave plenty of latitude for exploring questions and trying out techniques. I really enjoyed the exams. ",
            "\u00a0I found this course very useful both in instruction on R as well as the concepts related to regression analysis. \r\n\r\nI think the course could have been structured in a more linear fashion, with more of an introduction to R syntax and basic features earlier on.\r\n\r\nAlso, I did now know that the course had TAs until midway through. I think that providing a larger role for TAs could have been useful. ",
            "\u00a0Great course! This course taught us very important knowledge of regression modeling, and we learned lots of updated modeling methods, tools and resources. We also got a chance to participate data analysis communities. ",
            "\u00a0Liked his style of using real time questions to learn material. There should be an intro R class first. ",

He was very receptive to questions but sometimes got caught up in the code and it wasn't always clear what the takeaways at the end of each lecture were.\r\n\r\nI think the course could be dramatically improved by having learning objectives listed explicitly at the beginning of each session. ",
            "\u00a0strength: answers questions well, improvement: posting the lecture before class so we can follow along instead of trying to code along (gets confusing for people who are just learning to code) ",

            "\u00a0Kane clearly is incredibly knowledgeable about R and is willing to make sure students are exposed to all of the advantages of the software. He was extremely responsive to questions in class. In terms of teaching though, a little more organization would have been a bit better. ",
            "\u00a0Fantastic professor. Very flexible and sensitive to student's feedbacks, needs. Goes the extra mile to help student's understand difficult concepts. Always willing to review concepts and to meet and discuss issues with codes. I enjoyed the flexibility of the class structure. I would prefer if lecture codes were posted prior to class so that I could focus more on the material than trying to copy the code. But otherwise, great great class! ",

            "\u00a0I really appreciate Prof. Kane's willingness to live program R coding class, as it helps demonstrate problem-solving and adaptation. At the same time, sometimes the class got sidetracked by very specific programming questions, and while Prof. Kane was able to answer them, that often led to very long tangents (30+ min) that were not relevant to most people in the class. I would recommend finding some balance between being willing to answer very specific questions, and keeping in mind the relevance of questions to the entire class. ",
            "\u00a0I am impressed at the instructor's ability to teach both in tandem and in a way that was constantly engaging and sensitive to student needs. I really appreciated the instructor's commitment to incorporating student feedback into the course design at all times and found office hours with the instructor to be very useful for resolving ambiguities or any lack of understanding on my part.\r\n\r\nThe only think I think the professor could do to improve the class is to make sure we are provided the code used in class as soon as possible, preferably before class, but immediately afterwards in those cases where new coding is developed in class (which was a fun and engaging way of presenting material). ",
            "\u00a0Professor Kane is great! He is very patient with us. He is good at explaining concepts in a way we could understand. He taught us on how to work on projects and solving problems step by step, and he kept updating all codes on Canvas. ",
