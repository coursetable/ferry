            "\u00a0We didnt even finish the syllabus like we were supposed to we left an entire chapter or 2 about nitrogen chemistry out. What we did learn, we learned very poorly. ",
            "\u00a0The best things that I got from this course were (1) a knowledge of many biologically-significant reaction mechanisms, (2) a taste for complex organic synthesis, (3) a refinement of organic chemistry concepts from the first semester course, and (4) a feeling that I have the tools necessary to easily continue learning organic chemistry as desired. ",

            "\u00a0Prof Spiegel is a malicious human being who has no sympathy for his students. Please find a different professor for this course in the future. ",
            "\u00a0This class was very poorly organized. Too much time was spent on inconsequential information instead of actually learning how to think about synthesis problems or how to get an intuition for mechanisms. \r\n\r\nHonestly, the best way to improve the class would be to teach some more of this semester's material in Orgo I so that Orgo II isnt as much of a speedy rush through the material. Also, more time needs to be spent on the important parts of the course like understanding mechanisms and not on useless things like the half-lecture we spent on the history of what people thought the benzene molecule looked like. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: (1) Problem sets toward the end of the class were challenging but realistic, making them fun and informative. (2) Great textbook, very useful. (3) Tests were fair (though second test was oddly heavy on reaction mechanism drawing).\r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: (1) Problem sets at the beginning of the semester were unrealistically difficult, as they required knowledge of things that we hadn't learned and wouldn't learn until later that same semester; instructor should try to keep in mind what students have and haven't learned from the first semester course. (2) Presentation of content often felt a bit sporadic, especially when it came to carbonyl chemistry; it was claimed that this was the way the book presented it, but I found that the book was organized very differently and far more straightforwardly. (3) It's fine for students to have to read the textbook before lecture, but instructor should make sure to go over concepts that students may find challenging with great care; if he is not sure of what is not understood, he should probably ask before starting the lecture. (4) Class schedule set at the beginning of the semester was not followed very well at all; quickly became outdated. (5) Considering how small this course was, it may be wise to, in the future, talk with students about what they know and don't know; this may aid the professor in teaching the students in a way that suits their needs. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: My TA was super helpful, exams were generally representative of the material covered in lecture. A huge strength of this course was its ability to let Dr. Parr come teach for a period of time. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There is not much continuity between what we learn during the beginning of the semester. I think that the common themes among the reactions we learn should be more strongly emphasized in lecture so that we're not just memorizing an almost random string of reactions. This is really crucial for keeping students excited about how awesome chemistry is. That to me is one of the biggest weaknesses of the course. \r\n\r\nAlso, and I'm sure this will be ignored as a suggestion, the psets really need to reflect the important take-aways of lecture. Otherwise, we really don't get enough practice working through the kinds of problems that are relevant to our exams. The textbook questions are way easier than the test problems that Dr. Spiegel writes himself, and yet we practice for those using psets that are (at best) tangentially related to the concepts he sees as important. ",
            "\u00a0There could be more support in how to hone study skills. Orgo is different than most science courses. Professor Spiegel mentioned towards the end of the semester how he would read the chapter, take notes, look over class notes, and then combine all these together on index cards, and after he was sure he knew the material attempt synthesis problems. It might seem straight forward but I think if this technique was mentioned a few times in the beginning of the semester, I wouldve taken more from the course. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly this course wasn't easy for me. The classes were general lectured well and the section run well, but I struggled understanding basic concepts. I'm not sure my opinion is very useful.\r\n\r\nIt would have been helpful to concentrate more on synthesis problems, since that was such a big part of the course. ",
            "\u00a0This course allows for constant engagement due to the plethora of information that needs to be learned. I was never bored. However, sometimes, this information is overwhelming. To improve this, I think a more standardized model and flow of learning should be created to ensure that concepts are brought together and not just thrown around at random times, causing confusion. Any formalized method of synthesizing all of the information as well as reviewing regularly would be incredibly helpful.\r\nI also would have preferred to have this course be taught three times a week, just to not have the big Wednesday to Monday gap that creates a larger space to forget concepts and not solidify them through repetition. ",
            "\u00a0So, this class was insanely difficult. Grading was not very transparent, and many times lectures were hard to follow and sometimes not helpful for the actual coursework. Several times homework assignments dealt with things we wouldn't learn for weeks if not months which made actual learning and comprehension really difficult. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very difficult and I felt that the problem sets and exams were may more challenged than what we learned in class. I felt as if we learned basic reactions in class and then we're expected to know various applications of every reaction in organic chemistry for the exams. I did however like that the class was on only mondays and Wednesday's for 75 minutes rather than 50 mins on M/W/F like the usual science courses. ",
            "\u00a0The structure of how it was taught was very non-optimal for me. I would much prefer a branching organization than one revolving around named reactions. Ex. starting from an aromatic ring, how to we get different things? What are all the ways to get to Phenol and which one is best experimentally. Or \"what are different reactions can a carboxylic acid undergo?\" rather than starting with how LiAlH4 affects a bunch of different carbonyle compounds. ALSO a full list of reaction mechanisms we should know should be provided at the start of class in a pdf or something. sometimes there were gaps or mistakes in lecture and it would have been nice to always have a complete list to refer to and annotate. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Psets at the end of the class were well made.  I also appreciated that the psets included optional textbook questions, this helped me to focus my studying.  I also really like the small class format.  It made asking questions less intimidating, and it also motivated me to keep a higher level of engagement with class material.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Psets often did not correspond to the material we were learning in class, especially in the first half of the semester.  So instead of reinforcing the material, I found myself going on wild internet goose chases to find the \"relevant\" reactions.  It often left me more confused than where I had started!  it was also often not clear which concepts we were responsible for, or what the professor's expectations for us were.\r\n\r\nThe pacing of the class was often too quick.  I know that we are responsible for everything we learned in O-Chem 1, but a brief (even 30 seconds) explanation of the concept the first time we re-encounter it in O-Chem 2 would have made a huge difference in my understanding.  This is especially true when the concept in question is a key building block of a more complex reaction.  Also especially true for the off-sequence class in particular as many of us are coming from a summer or longer gap since O-Chem 1. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n-Not having class on Friday was nice\r\n\r\nWeakness:\r\n-The tests were the complete opposite of what anyone would call well rounded, especially the second exam which was just writing out mechanism and heavily focused on multiple reactions covered THE CLASS JUST BEFORE THE EXAM\r\n-No other way to say it: the class was just poorly taught \r\n\r\n\r\n-Basically, I went into this class loving chemistry and was debating whether to be a Chem major. But this class sucked out all the joy I once had for chemistry. It made everything feel so much harder than it was first semester, so much more dull, and so much less intuitive. It made me feel like I was just too dumb or incompetent to be a real chemist. "

            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY. NOT. ",
            "\u00a0I would NOT recommend taking it with Dr. Spiegel. No matter when you take the class, it will be tough, but after spending a semester in extreme frustration and still feeling like i barely learned anything, I have to say that it really doesn't get worse than this. Wait until second semester. ",
            "\u00a0Organic Chemistry II is a great course both for those interested in chemistry and those interested in biology. I hope the course will continue to improve in order to better serve its students. ",
            "\u00a0You probably have to take this. \r\n\r\nSome warnings: Be good friends with your TA. They will be able to help you not waste about 10 hours a week on your pset. Your psets will often not have anything to do with what you learn in lecture, so your TA will be the key to you figuring out what to google so you know what random chemistry concept the pset is giving you practice with. \r\n\r\nAlso, it's pretty crucial that you understand that any feedback Dr. Spiegel asks for about the way the class is run, he will ignore. You will be heard, but you will then be disproven by him, because in his mind you're pretty much just a strung-out premed who doesn't understand the importance of practicing a string of unrelated concepts that aren't learned in lecture. \r\n\r\nLast thing: the class is on a curve, so it's not likely you're going to end with a horrible grade. That being said, don't expect the classroom to be conducive to learning. For a teacher, Dr. Spiegel really hates teaching. Before you raise your hand to ask a question, try googling it on your phone first.. at least your iPhone wont roll its eyes at you ! ",
            "\u00a0I dont know how it compares to orgo in the spring, but the avergae is an A- so if you put in effort you should be okay. ",
            "\u00a0Not really. Nothing against the class or the professor, but it's a hard course and unless you are pre-med or majoring in organic chemistry, there's no point in stressing yourself like this for it ",
            "\u00a0I think organic chemistry in and of itself is a very fascinating subject. However, when taught poorly, it is very difficult and frustrating. I would recommend this course depending on who is teaching it. If you have the option of taking it with a better professor later on in your college career, I definitely suggest doing that. ",
            "\u00a0So, if you don't have to take this course, please don't take it. Save yourself. If you can easily teach yourself organic chemistry then go for it, but this course was VERY difficult. Grading was not very transparent, lectures were slow and sometimes off topic, and homework at times dealt with material we didn't learn until weeks later. If you are a chem major or premed or whatever, then good luck. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to another student unless they absolutely need to take it. It is very difficult and the exams were not super representative of what we learned in class. ",
            "\u00a0It's useful chemistry. You learn the basics of aromatic and carbonyle chemistry and get practice with more mechanisms and synthesis. Don't take it with Spiegel if you can help it. ",
            "\u00a0If you're debating whether to take this class in the fall or wait for the spring, it depends on your priorities.  The small class environment is helpful in keeping you awake on those early mornings.  The 2x/week class is also a bit better than the 3x/week.  Spiegel's style is... interesting.  He expects a lot of background knowledge from O-Chem 1, and provides almost no review as you go along, which can lead to a lot of confusion if you're (like me) not the strongest O-chem student.  But supposedly the curve in this class is better than that for spring O-Chem 2, which was nice, since I was able to do okay in the class without O-Chem 2 taking over my entire life. "
