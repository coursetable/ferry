            "\u00a0Already evaluated this course because it was listed as a school of Management course ",
            "\u00a0This class was very interesting and allowed us to develop an overall understanding of central banking and financial crises ",
            "\u00a0I can now say that I understand what is monetary policy and the challenges facing central banks. I have also learned to write long, persuasive and insights papers. Readings in the class cover many economic topics outside of central banking. I think coming out of this class I have a better grasp of the history of economics as a subject. "

            "\u00a0The strength of this course is definitely Prof Mohan - he is so passionate about the subject and really cares about his students. The readings can be long, but the grading is fair and the material is engaging. Would definitely take this class again! ",
            "\u00a0Perfect seminar!! A really nice combination of student presentations, professor's lecturing and discussions. The guest lecturers are always really good. I have made many new friends out of this class. "

        [
            "\u00a0Definitely take this class if you get in - it is the best econ elective I have taken so far. The material is interesting and practical to real life, and the grading is fair. The readings can be long, but if you keep up with them they are not too bad. The essays are also long, but interesting to do because they are critiques. You can also choose your essay topics, which made sure that students wrote on topics that they found interesting and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. If you ever read about the Fed in the newspapers and find concepts like interest rates and QE puzzling but exciting, take this class! "
