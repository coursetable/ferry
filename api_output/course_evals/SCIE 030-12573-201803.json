I can hold a science conversation with my STEMMY friends for like more than 30 seconds, which is a feat for me.\r\nSometimes it makes 1.5 hours feel like 30 minutes, and sometimes it makes 1.5 hours feel like 4 hours and it really just depends on the module. ",
            "\u00a0I wish the materials for the modules were more easily accessible. ",
            "\u00a0Mostly just students looking for an easy science credit. The material was not as engaging as I had hoped and the class was much less discussion based than anticipated. ",
            "\u00a0The course has many different topics that range from many different fields, which helps keep the students engaged. Sometimes assignments are a little unconventional, and the debates usually go on for a while. ",
            "\u00a0A strength is that there is not many people in the course, so class discussions are very efficient. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, to anyone with a bit of interest in science. Interesting lectures by extremely knowledgeable professors from different fields, very manageable workload, and cookies/drinks catering every week. A great way to get exposure to various contemporary topics in science and doesn't require a strong background in math or science. ",
