            "\u00a0I had never taken an anthropology class before so I didn't know what to expect, but this was a great class. I tend to take more STEM-y courses where there's a very clear answer and method, but this course taught me the value of objectivity and questioning. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to view law in a more human light. This course changed my definition of law and made me develop a more flexible definition that helps me understand the processes of other societies and even the American justice system. It was a great introduction to the anthropological method and popular anthropologists. ",
            "\u00a0This class helped me to develop a real understanding of how culture influences law around the world. \r\nI loved how this class teaches you to un-entrench all of your previous assumptions about law and government. It teaches you to develop a lens / perspective for looking at the world that is incredibly valuable. ",
            "\u00a0I did not get anything from this course. Section was the only time that I got insight into the readings because my TA and other students were making observations about the readings. I wouldn't have to go to class because it was a simple regurgitation of the readings ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely nothing. Can I ask for a refund? ",
            "\u00a0This class was rather engaging and encouraged us to analyze the concept of law from different cultural perspectives. The content was extremely interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Understanding about the role of law in societies and methods of solving conflict and affirming common values outside the law ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the way we can observe and learn from different lifestyles. I also gained important knowledge in how to critically analyze dense sources. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about anthropology as a field, both its pros and cons, how to make an ethnography, how to look at societies that we consider anarchic with an unbiased perspective, and more. In terms of personal development, I think that I gained insight into how to write an anthropological paper and reading responses. ",
            "\u00a0Through this anthropological approach to law, my understanding of punishment, discipline, culture, war crimes, and human rights were expanded. ",
            "\u00a0Learned how to better approach justice and law, and gained tools by which to analyze the two. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about both anthropology and law as fields of study (I had no prior experience with either). Lots of meditations on culture's influences on ethic, legal thinking, how we handle conflicts, etc. ",
            "\u00a0I thought it would be a surfacy course, but it actually surprised me by how much in-depth readings we did (engaging). The units flowed really well in a cohesive way. ",
            "\u00a0We gained a lot of insight regarding how morality and agency are factored into law through cultural contextualization of different systems of law. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a lot of insights in terms of my own internal biases and the way that I think about law and legal systems. We looked at many different cultures and all types of legal systems. The class is incredibly interesting and even made be rethink American treatment of pedophiles and other incarcerated persons. I also gained introductory anthropological skills. ",
            "\u00a0I think I developed a better understanding of how normative cultural ideal shape systems of law around the world and how something that can easily be misconstrued as well understood is so complex atone the world. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about several different cultures and how each of them uniquely conceptualizes the law. We did lots of interesting readings. ",
            "\u00a0Realizing how to view societies with an unbiased lens, such that one fully grasps individual cultures ",
            "\u00a0I learned lots about Sardinian Shepherds! And about the importance of considering all demensions of culture, people and context when attempting to understand dispute and criminal proceedings. ",

            "\u00a0Learned to think about law through a broad lens. We discussed legal theory from the standpoint of anthropology and ethics. Additionally, we reviewed numerous case studies in the use of law in various cultures. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt a lot about the complexity of law and its multiple global manifestations. I developed good skills of questioning ",
            "\u00a0I was introduced to many different ways to think about the source of law, the types of law, and the role law plays in representing the society it was formed in. I realized that law is simply not a way to keep social order in check, but also a way of life, a way of cultural practice and social values. ",
            "\u00a0The main goal of the class was essentially to teach us not to judge a book (or in this case a legal system or perceived lack thereof) by its cover. I feel that I learned about different cultures and their legal systems around the world but these tidbits arent connected to each other and exist essentially as fragments that may or may not still be in the back of my mind. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths- great professor + TAs, interesting lecture, good debate in section. \r\nWeaknesses- material wasn't structured very clearly so it was hard to study sometimes, reading can be a bit too long/not super relevant sometimes. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this course and how it was structured and separated into units that were both distinct and reliant on each other. We got to look at a variety of societies and systems and look at the connections between them. ",
            "\u00a0The first half of the course~ up through and including the midterm paper~ was very tight and intellectually engaging. Everything meshed well for learning and synthesis. After the midterm, things fell apart a little bit~ the course material became more difficult and unwieldy, the professor guided us less through the themes, and the flow of the class became more disjointed. I think the second half of the course could just be tightened and more consistent with the first half. ",
            "\u00a0The professor did not have insights into the readings during class and the expectations were not clear for the class in any way. ",
            "\u00a0STRENGTHS:\r\nThis class covers subject material and includes interesting readings + case studies. Professor Lombard also tries to transform the traditional lecture environment into something resembling a seminar by encouraging group discussions.\r\nWEAKNESSES:\r\nIn spite of everything interesting about this class, the course as a whole is very choppy and lacks a \"big picture\" element. By the end of the course, I had learned a good amount, but didn't know the purpose of having learned everything I had. The teaching fellows (or at least mine) greatly reduced my level of engagement with the course. ",
            "\u00a0I think the class was structured pretty well. The sections were really helpful for further discussing the concepts. It would be helpful however to have lecture notes of some sort posted, as sometimes its difficuly to gather all the notes in class. ",
            "\u00a0I think the strength of this course was how fascinating the material was. The weakness was that not all of the material was discussed in lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Extremely interesting conceptual material for a class. Good spread of source material for study.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lecture material often only repeated verbatim what was assigned in the readings or was seemingly entirely unrelated. Both were unrelated from section material. There was little to no preparation offered for the final exam, which was exceedingly nitpicky and had almost nothing to do with the course material students thought was important. ",
            "\u00a0The class had good readings, for the most part, and the Professor was really good at connecting our readings to the lectures without just giving a summary. But I think there could have been more small group discussion, and more small group activities in class, because the grade depended on participation, but there was not a lot of opportunity for discussion during the lecture itself. The biggest issue with the class was the way homework was structured: between Wednesday and Monday there were often just 1 or 2 essays assigned, but from Monday to Wednesday she assigned whole books, even multiple books. That made it hard to keep up with the classwork and stay engaged, because the workload was too overwhelming and then sparse. ",
            "\u00a0I thoroughly enjoyed Professor Lombard's lectures as they were always eloquent and compelling. However, I did not find the class' required section or weekly reading responses to be of much use. Furthermore, not only was the grading on assignments extremely unclear, but the final paper did not do a good job at reflecting the knowledge students had acquired. ",
            "\u00a0Class readings are really solid for the class and lectures were fantastic. I would maybe change the final exam to a final paper since it may make more sense for the course work ",
            "\u00a0The final exam actually had a bunch of information we briefly talked about in class instead of the readings, even though we were told that the final would be based on the readings. A little misleading that way. ",
            "\u00a0The readings and lectures are incredibly interesting and Professor Lombard lectures incredibly well. The readings start off slow, but do increase in quantity and length. The final seemed a bit abrupt, but other than that the workload was not abundant. ",
            "\u00a0I think a more well understood curriculum and definable notes. I also think more assessments would provide greater engagement in the course ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Prof. Lombard is an awesome lecturer who is extremely passionate about the subject matter.\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the material was repetitive and feedback on reading responses was confusing. ",
            "\u00a0Lecture was inconsistent in terms of engagement ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the readings and the lectures. I also enjoyed my section. Did not feel like the exam tested my knowledge appropriately as there were very few passage ids taken from the readings. Also the reading responses were too Long. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course could have been improved by a little bit less class discussion. Although it was fruitful and Louisa was a great facilitator, I also wanted to hear more from her sometimes. ",
            "\u00a0The course strength lies within its engaging discussions during Professor's Lombard lectures. I like how the syllabus divided different concepts of law and provide reading materials that are relevant to each debate. The course can be improved by having research paper assignments that allow students to use example and materials of cases outside of what the syllabus provided. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Some of the readings were interesting. I actually enjoyed coming to lecture despite the irrelevance of the readings. Professor Lombard is lovely and really interesting to talk with; she really cares about her students.\r\nWeaknesses: The class was extremely disorganized in terms of connecting ideas to the readings. Readings were long and tedious and rarely connected to lecture topics. The midterm essay had no rubric despite specific things being looked for and then students were punished for not including those things. My TF wasnt helpful at all in his comments on response papers; additionally, his contributions to section rarely prompted other students to speak up. RESPONSE PAPERS SHOULD NOT BE GRADED!! I felt graded on the content of my work rather than the actual quality, which is very discouraging in a class constantly asking for our opinions. The final exam (oh god the final exam) was extremely specific and too long for sufficient answers to be given (especially for the long essay) in the time period. ",
            "\u00a0Some of the readings were dull and confusing, and some were good. Some readings were hard to access. Some lectures felt repetitive. If there had been a more even mix of philosophy and case studies I would have been more engaged with the readings. ",
            "\u00a0I liked how our readings drew from case studies all over the world, and that there were various guest speakers invited to share more about their expertise in the field. I also liked that the course was interdisciplinary in its approach of issues such as justice, ethics and law. ",
            "\u00a0The selection of readings was a strength of this course, as they were all diverse, interesting, and informing. The monotony of the lectures could be improved. "

            "\u00a0Yes- Professor Lombard is very passionate and knowledgeable and the course material is varied and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0This course was so interesting and opened my mind to legal anthropology and the different ways the law manifests. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested in either law or cultural studies. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely - the class offers a fascinating take on the law, exploring it from an anthropological approach across various communities/societies. The TA's are incredibly resourceful and knowledgeable, and Professor Lombard is a dynamic lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! To students of many fields~ anyone interested in law, ethics, culture, social mores and social psychology, anthropology and sociology, statistics, etc~ it is a wonderful course with a wonderful framework. ",
            "\u00a0No, I would not. Take any other anthropology course ",
            "\u00a0No. No no no. This should be a gut (and probably is a gut...)it just didn't work out that way. \r\nHonestly, this course has put me off taking another anthropology class ever again. ",
            "\u00a0This is an amazing course. As a student of sociology and as someone who is considering a career in law, this class really opened my mind to how law functions in our society and in other societies and also how law is not the only way to create social change (and is not even the main tool of justice in some cases). The course is not difficult but I ended up putting in more time and effort because of the weekly sections and the reading response. There are a lot of readings but you dont necessarily have to do them all, as Prof Lombard provides a great summary of them during the lectures, however you should read at least most of them before the final to do well on the exam. ",
            "\u00a0I would. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to somebody who was really interested in legal systems throughout the world, and how they differ but are also similar. I valued some of the information that I learned, and I think it made me think about certain places, peoples, and ideas like Human Rights differently. But for someone who wants a really intellectually stimulating course, I do not think that it is the right fit. You get out of the class what you put into it, but for people who were unmotivated, it was not that useful in the long term. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it if re-structuring was made in terms of the weekly reading responses, midterm paper, and final exam. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to any student interested in law who seeks to gain greater perspective on the topic. Definitely not your typical case based law course, more an exercise on how the law is conceptualized and defined. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you have any interest in law or culture or anthropology, it was a thought-provoking introduction to these fields with great texts. ",
            "\u00a0As a science major taking this course, I was pleasantly surprised by how inclined I was to dwell on some of my opinions on different aspects of law outside of class. I think this course is a great introductory course to anthropology and law, and it has helped me personally become more articulate in regards to explaining personal values and perspectives on social and political issues. Highly recommend this course. Prof. Lombard is also one of the sweetest people you will ever meet. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course. The material is engaging and the workload is not a ton. But make sure to stay on top of the readings, otherwise the final will be rough. ",
            "\u00a0I think I would recommend this course purely because the topic is engaging and interesting to discuss. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I definitely learned a lot of new and interesting stuff. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if youre interested in ethnographic work ",
            "\u00a0Yes it was interesting and pretty easy but I thought the exam was weirdly hard and too long for the 50 minute time slot ",
            "\u00a0Would definitely recommend this class. Really fun look at law and not super difficult. Great for anyone who wonders why laws are the way they are, and it challenges you to rethink what constitutes a legal system. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this for anyone interested in law and assessing our relationship to law. But I also recommend this course to anthropological thinkers or people interested in undermining long-held, barely questioned institutions! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think the course will change a lot of your preconceptions about the law. There is no one way to describe what law is or what people think about the role of law. Taking this course will give you many more ways to think about social conflicts using philosophical as well as anthropological evidence. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly, if you want a class where you can sit back and just learn cool things in the legal anthropology field, this is it. That being said, be warned; if you dont at least attempt to keep up with the readings, it will definitely come back to haunt you in the final exam. Also, figure out what your TF specifically wants in the response papers early on. No rubric is given and unless youve previously taken a class in the anthro department or have previous experience at Yale, youll be at a disadvantage. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a good introductory course because it wasn't too difficult and was actually introducing the concepts of anthropology in a way that those who had never studied anthro before would be able to understand. There were ample opportunities to bolster grades, and Professor Lombard offered extra credit and brought food in sometimes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. As this was the first anthropology course i took myself, I would highly recommend it to anyone who is keen to take a class in sociocultural anthropology. ",
            "\u00a0I will absolutely! Prof. Lombard's lectures are the best ones I've had at Yale, and she managed to make them quite interactive (discussions with classmates, in-class anonymous feedbacks, etc). The readings are never dull for me-- they took me to all parts of the world. This class made me think about law in new ways, and I am very grateful for its anthropological viewpoint in answering some of the worlds' most pressing issues related to justice. "
