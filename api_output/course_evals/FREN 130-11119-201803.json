            "\u00a0This course did exactly what I would've expected it to: enhanced my vocabulary, clarified several grammatical structures, and improved my confidence in written and spoken French. ",
            "\u00a0I greatly improved my knowledge of French grammar and vocabulary. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a stronger foundation in the French language and really learned how to more properly utilize grammar. ",
            "\u00a0Focus on grammar. French verbs, stories, basic vocabulary ",
            "\u00a0I developed my intermediate French skills in this course, especially my grammar skills in the language. ",
            "\u00a0I explored the French culture and became more comfortable while speaking a foreign language in a classroom setting. ",
            "\u00a0french conversation, profound analysis of french artistic expression (esp. literature and film), beauty of the french language itself ",
            "\u00a0This course is mostly review, but my french is better after taking the course. "

            "\u00a0This course is made for students coming in from high school basically speaking French. Not for those coming in from L1 and L2 the year before. The jump from L2 to L3 is too excessive and this made the semester a nightmare ",
            "\u00a0The \"Course Packet\" and daily homework model definitely resulted in a much steeper learning curve than language classes I took in high school, which was a key strength of the course. I also appreciated the biweekly evaluations, which gave me a continuous sense of what I had been learning and where I needed to improve. \r\nI would have liked more opportunity to explore the cultural and literary significance of the works we studied, although I understand that perhaps that is not feasible in an L3 language course. ",
            "\u00a0I think the combination of reading a book, listening to French, speaking, and writing grammar every day really worked. I felt like every area was improving at the same time. I can't really think of any weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that we cover the French language holistically - in our reading, writing, and speaking. I can't think of any weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0I liked how small the classes are for French and the engagement is very personal with the teacher. I don't think that the course could be further improved given its small size and high professor involvement. ",
            "\u00a0intense conversation and academic approach to the french language (french not only as a tool of communication but also as a cultural/philosophical presentation of francophone thinkers) ",
            "\u00a0Would be much more engaging if included more contemporary literature and media. Also more speaking practice, conversational as well as on current events. What was going on in the Francophone world was not discussed outside of brief student presentations. ",
            "\u00a0More standardization across the sections "

            "\u00a0No. Unless you plan on living in France after college or already speak semi fluently ",
            "\u00a0This course is well-designed to help students achieve what they would intend to by taking a language course, and so I would definitely recommend it to fellow students wishing to improve their French. ",
            "\u00a0If you really want to learn French, definitely take this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I definitely would, as French L3 offers a great foundation of the French language. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to expand on their French skills. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it to anyone who wants to become more familiar with French and learn beyond grammar. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this courses allows us to learn what it means to speak/think/discuss in French. It's the greatest pleasure in learning a foreign language when you can express your own thoughts in the language you're learning ",
            "\u00a0No, unless a requirement. No contemporary media and very little practical conversational practice. Get ready for generally boring books (aside from Camus's L'Etranger) and old media--Truffaut is cool to know about in cinema but Jules et Jim is not of great merit. The French Department generally needs more diversity and cultural competency in their pedagogy, and was as a better lens on the real world outside the classroom. The great opportunity of Yale French classes that meet five days a week with exceptionally dedicated, knowledgeable, and conscientious faculty within small classes of 15 or less is that it could truly be a fantastic collaborative and conversational space, engaging with literature as well as the present world, such as social issues in the Francophone world with relevant vocabulary. This opportunity is wasted on an outdated curriculum and rote memorization of generally not-so-helpful vocabulary. Grammar practice is generally good though, which is obviously important for learning French! But then again, you could do that with myriad apps/ software and save yourself some of the agony of this course. It is sad, considering the French faculty are fascinating and accomplished, that a more vibrant, productive, and engaging dialogue isn't created by this course. "
