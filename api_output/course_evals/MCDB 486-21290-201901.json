I think that conducting research in a course based setting is great because it provides a way of standardizing the experience. I enjoyed having the opportunity to present my work at the end of the semester, develop a mentoring relationship with those in the lab, and overall thought that this course offered one of the better MCDB experiences that I have had at Yale.

I really enjoyed synthesizing my research in the report as well. ",

I have learned so many lab benchwork skills that are not taught in a classroom setting. I've become somewhat of an expert on my topic of research, and the overall experience was positive enough to motivate me to do a post-bacc in my lab. "

            "\u00a0This course is really effective at learning by doing. I personally love learning this way. It was awesome that each senior had a different, niche project to talk about at the end. I do think that the course is a little too back heavy. It would have been nice to do the presentation as a research-in-progress talk earlier in the semester. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are entirely based on the type of lab that you are in and the engagement that you receive from your lab mentor. A downfall of undergraduate research is that the PI's are so busy that you are never able to interact with them and get their expert level mentoring. Furthermore there is very little oversight from the actual MCDB department with regards to the type of research that is being done and the level of mentoring the student is receiving. The final deliverables of the course--paper, poster, and presentation--are a nice capstone on the major, however at times it felt as if the hard work that was being put in was not being properly evaluated by any MCDB professors, if only by the PI or the graduate student mentor. ",
            "\u00a0I felt like there was little evaluation on the work presented in the final undergraduate symposium. some individuals were never presenting or near their posters. ",
            "\u00a0I think I enjoy the fact that so much of it is dependent on the lab and mentor you are paired with. I think there can be perhaps more clarity about the formatting of the papers/slides, if there is a sample paper/slide presentation sent around that would be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Having all of the assessments backloaded in the last week of classes (presentation, poster session, and final report) was not fun. ",
            "\u00a0There are too many things the very last week. It isnt fair to the students who definitely have a lot going on. The course would benefit even from spreading deadlines into 3 separate weeks, with presentations due first, then posters, then the final paper. ",
            "\u00a0Great structure overall. May have been good to have one or two optional sessions for MCDB 485/486 where a professor goes over ways to write grant proposals and reports. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: focus on lab work, real experience\r\nWeaknesses: Little community (focus on independent work), no check-ins with actual class proctors ",
            "\u00a0This course could provide more standardization somehow, given that every lab is different and that every PI has vastly different expectations and post-docs offer varying levels of guidance. Please, this is very important. ",
            "\u00a0Experiences varied based on the PI, so maybe there should be more direct involvement between the course directors, PIs, and students to make sure everyone is on the same page. ",
            "\u00a0There needs to be better communication (including in-person communication) between the professors and students. For MCDB seniors new to research, this course can be challenging at times. ",
            "\u00a0It could be improved by more direction from the MCDB organizers about how to find a lab and then what is required. ",
            "\u00a0The real lab involvement is great for the students and the end of the year presentations were great practice for future conferences and talks. The poster session was very enjoyable as well. ",
            "\u00a0This course is incredibly strong because it allows MCDB students to gain necessary research experience, and allows the \"Bachelor's of Science\" degree to really stand for proficiency in an academic research setting. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: real time experience in lab\r\n\r\nweaknesses: i got lucky in my lab pairing -- had a great PI and mentor -- but some other friends weren't so lucky. choose your lab wisely! ",
            "\u00a0It was hard but I thought it was a wonderful learning experience. There is no other way to learn scientific research than trial by fire ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Well organized given the large amount of students required to take this course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not significant. Since most of the grading is dependent on the PI of the lab, expectations were variable but overall guidelines for the fall grant proposal and spring report were fair and self-explanatory. ",
            "\u00a0On the one hand, the research itself and my lab were really good experiences and I learned a lot about hot to conduct basic science research which is really valuable. However, this course itself is so sporadic and there is never enough information on how to do things. You basically get a few sheets of paper at the beginning of the year that vaguely outlines what you are supposed to do for the entire year. This can be good or bad since you have a lot of leeway to make this what you want it to be, but it can be frustrating to not have clear directions sometimes. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are the independence of the project, the detailed reports at the end of each semester, and the less intense nature of the course relative to other lab I've taken. I don't think it was a weakness, but it is definitely easy to fall behind since you depend on your mentor/PI to keep you on track.  My PI and mentor were great at making sure I was always doing something related to my project, but I can see this being a problem if that is not the case. ",

Unfortunately it could also be a time where you discover that research is not the best fit for you, making the process more painful to complete. Nonetheless, the course is undoubtedly a very nice capstone on the major. ",
