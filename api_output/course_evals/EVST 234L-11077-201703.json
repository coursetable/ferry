            "\u00a0Writing lab reports, collecting data on the field, tree ID, being inquisitive about nature in general ",
            "\u00a0I learned the dynamics of agriculture, forests, and urban ecosystems. The highlights for me were our readings about forest dynamics (Reading the Forested Landscape is an amazing book) and food politics. In terms of skills, I learned how to write a solid 7-9 page lab report, which Im pretty proud of. ",
            "\u00a0I now feel very familiar with the tree species of the northeastern United States. I learned how to identify trees based on their leaves and bark. I also developed a much better understanding of the current issues surrounding sustainability both in regards to agriculture as well as in cities. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to conduct a study in the field, what measurements should be used, what information to look for when reading a landscape, and how to identify a large number of tree species just by looking at them. "

            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nProfessor Kealoha and our TA Ben Rifkin were both very patient and enjoyable to work with. Prof Kealoha was really sweet and Ben was always there for us when we needed help with our lab reports. They had a lot of knowledge about field science in general, even though they both have different specializations. Obviously another benefit is the fact that you can go outdoors every thursday to collect data, which is very enjoyable. We also took many (3) field trips to other parts of CT outside of class time and we got to learn a lot about the forest from other experts in the field. \r\n\r\nYou get quite close to your classmates because of your field trips and data collection, which you need to do together.\r\n\r\nLab reports were quite leniently graded. No background environmental knowledge required for this course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nLab reports were a lot of work, but at the same time they weren't as rigorous as they could have been. We went into the field to collect data without having a research question and had to distill the research question from the data, which is not how I think research should be conducted. Research should be conducted with a rough goal in mind BEFOREhand. Because of this, sometimes the lab reports felt a bit forced and like we were doing it for the sake of doing it, as opposed to conducting actual research. \r\n\r\nOur readings were mostly lab reports, and sometimes discussion involved nitty gritty details like methodology so if you aren't into reading experiments down to the t this may not be the most vibrant discussion you will have in class. Discussion depends on your classmates and their knowledge + how much reading they have done (with every seminar) ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the field trips and some of the readingsProfessor Freidenburg works hard to pick readings that are really interesting and relevant! Readings he Forested Landscape was my favorite; Ive recommended it to friends and family that are interested in nature and forest dynamics. Its also really cool to be able to apply what we learn in the classroom in the fieldnot very many Yale classes offer such a unique opportunity.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: class discussions could be more engaging. Lab reports were also very stressful in the week before the due date. Office hours with the TA could be expanded to so that students have more time to ask questions about the lab report. ",
            "\u00a0This class was well organized and gave a great in depth overview of the current challenges of sustainability. The labs were interesting, and it was great to get off campus every now and then. The one weakness is that our three weekend field trips were all very similar. I felt as though we were learning the same things at each one. It would have been nice to have some more variety. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the field trips and the urban ecology course. I found the format of the class was very dynamic and engaging. At times, the discussion felt a little disorganized, and it was difficult to gauge the main ideas of the readings from the discussion. I think using the students' questions will help guide discussion. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of the course was how hands-on the learning was. The field trips every Thursday were a highlight for the students and a nice break from the more theoretical, academic learning more commonly found at Yale. Reading primary sources, though tedious at times, was also very helpful in that it taught us how to actually read that kind of paper and find the pertinent information.\r\nWeaknesses of the course were few and far between. I would recommend that more guidelines be given on how to write the labs, but otherwise, this was an excellent course. "

            "\u00a0This is an interesting and fun class to take especially for your science credit, if you want to spend your Thursdays outdoors taking data as opposed to being in the lab. However, be warned that the lab reports were hard work, and yet not as fulfilling as they could have been (read the weaknesses for my take on this). If you are a science student, have written lab reports before and/or are already knowledgeable about environmental science (forestry, farms/pesticides/GMOs, urban ecology etc.), this class may not be advanced enough for you. However if you are not knowledgeable about env science, this would definitely be an eye-opening course for you to consider! ",
            "\u00a0Yesthe field trips were a great opportunity to apply the stuff you learn in the classroom in a fun and refreshing way. I also found them to be a big stress reliever-it was greatto get out into nature more his semester! Professor Freidenburg is very supportive of her students and very helpful in answering questions. Our TA also did an amazing job of responding to questions around lab deadlines and explaining concepts in the field. Labs are a ton of work and pretty stressful to write, but if you put in the effort you can do well. I liked the structure of the class in terms of the in-class discussions, Thursday labs, occasional field trips, reports, and end-of-semester presentation. I learned a ton and feel very proud of the lab reports that I wrote. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone interested in the environment and sustainability. The labs are all off campus which is fun, but I would say you definitely have to have an interest in scientific research to enjoy this class. The labs took a lot of effort and could be challenging at times. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a breath of fresh air (literally) amid the scholastic stagnation of Yale. This is one of the few practical courses that actual teach you valuable hands-on skills that will help you academically, professionally, and just as a person. Tuesdays you discuss a few scientific papers you had to read and then Thursday you go on field trips, actually going out and collecting data, hiking through the woods, sometimes going camping if you're lucky. This is a really fantastic course. You're going to make great friends and learn a lot from the class. Professor Freidenburg is amazing, very patient, very knowledgable, and she really wants you to walk away with a solid grasp of an array of sustainability issues and field science methods. And if you're willing to put in the effort, you will, and you'll have a lot of fun doing it. Homework involves weekly readings and reading questions, three labs, and a final presentation. "
