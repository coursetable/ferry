            "\u00a0The structure of the content and testing is well organized and makes absorbing information easy--in some ways it feels like a high school class because of this. Some lectures feel a little bit slow but overall the relevance of the material as it applies to our world today makes the class engaging. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are not particularly engaging, but the overall topic is interesting. The textbook is straightforward and there are weekly readings that dont take too long. ",
            "\u00a0exams are poorly designed, way too long, and lecture does not prepare students for them whatsoever ",
            "\u00a0The course was interesting and engaging but at times it felt like the lectures were redundant, particularly in the final third of the class. ",
            "\u00a0I think the strength of the course was the nature of the material and teaching. I think it could be improved with more focused readings for section (i.e. choosing to spend a day on either scientific articles or the Sixth Extinction and not both). ",
            "\u00a0The course is fairly easy, although the tests can occasionally have application of concepts that have not been thoroughly explored in class. I also found that the ease of the course was actually a weakness because it made it harder to want to come to class. The course could be improved by clearer explanation of the expectations of the class. ",
            "\u00a0Exams can be a bit confusing and too long for the time given. Other than that, I loved the course. Learned a lot of interesting things, liked the teacher and loved my TA. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: You get a great overview of a lot of topics in Conservation Biology, and the supplemental readings are relevant and interesting. I particularly enjoyed the class trip to the Peabody where we got to see specimens of endangered/extinct species that we may not have otherwise had the opportunity to see. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Can't really think of any! Really enjoyed this course. ",
            "\u00a0Well-organized! The expectations of work were not depicted in the syllabus as they ended up to be. ",
            "\u00a0The exam questions were sometimes vague and a little broad. Other than that it was a good course over all. Relevant and great for anyone trying to get a science credit ",
            "\u00a0This course could be improved by making the tests more relevant to the material and less convoluted. Many times during exams I was unclear on what the question was asking and this was a hindrance to showing how well I knew the material. ",
            "\u00a0There is not enough support/guidance and reinforcement from lecture to lecture. It feels as if nothing matters until the exam, and there is not much enthusiasm surrounding the teaching. ",

            "\u00a0The strengths of this course would be the sections, I enjoyed the time in my sections and took away a lot of information from the one-v-one lessons with my TA. The weakness would probably be the lectures, not very engaging, but full of information. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures could be more engaging, however they did a good job of covering introductory conservation biology. While the material was easy to grasp, tests were often worded poorly and it wasn't always clear how or what to study for a good grade. ",
            "\u00a0The day to day work was very easy, but the exams would be more difficult than anticipated. I personally really liked and thrived under this kind of environment, but it may not be for everyone. ",

            "\u00a0Puth wasnt the best lecturer and some of the material got repetitive. I thought the way the tests were written did not line up very well with the material we learned, or the questions werent asked specifically enough for the answers they were looking for. The questions were supposed to apply the material but they were asked in a really confusing way. ",
            "\u00a0It uses examples that are interesting, the guest lecturers were GREAT! The second exam was a little long, but the first and third were okay. Better job of making clearer questions, Im glad the TAs read them before hand too. ",
            "\u00a0The instructor doesn't explain the application of the material, but rather surfaces through it. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: material, workload, having such a great TA, and learning cool content. \r\nWeaknesses: the lectures were boring when they were given, even if the material is very cool. ",
            "\u00a0I think the material for the course was presented in a well-organized and clear manner. In addition, I think the usage of Kolbert's book improved my experience in the course, as I greatly enjoyed reading it. \r\n\r\nIn terms of weaknesses, I think the workload for the course could have been spaced out better (i.e. there was one week when we had several major assignments due in succession). In addition, I think the test questions were sometimes unclear (i.e. they would ask for three categories of something when we had not discussed the course material necessarily in terms of categories). ",
            "\u00a0This course was very organized, the lecture notes were posted online, and the textbook wasn't necessary if you attended lecture.  The weakness of this course was that no one asked questions during lecture and the lectures were very slow. In addition, ",
            "\u00a0I like how in this class, the tests were not an incredibly large part of the grade. I also liked reading the Sixth Extinction.\r\n\r\nI think a major weakness of the class was the tests - they were too hard because the questions were all phrased very broadly. ",
            "\u00a0I feel like this course was a great first time conservation biology class. Everything we learned felt very relevant to application outside of the classroom. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very thorough coverage of the course material, fair tests, sections TFs are very knowledgeable and effective teachers. Professor Puth is very reasonable and makes her expectations clear. A great way to get a solid grasp of how humans affect biodiversity on Earth and what we can do to mitigate negative effects. \r\nWeaknesses: many lectures are repetitive, I found overall student engagement to be low. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the section discussions and case studies integrated into the course. I also thought the Kolbert readings were a great supplement, although I wish we would've talked about them more during discussions. I think the evaluative part of the course was fair especially since so much weight was given to discussion and the lecture write-up and position paper. However, the tests themselves were very much application-based and required not only memorizing the material but knowing how to apply it. Although I think this helped me apply what I learned, it took some time to get used to. In the future, I would recommend more example questions to become more accustomed to this type of testing. ",
            "\u00a0I mean honestly I wish the powerpoint slides were more detailed so I wouldn't have had to attend every lecture, but I thought that the course was pretty straightforward. ",
            "\u00a0I think professor Puth is doing the school and students an incredible favor in teaching the class. She has found the perfect balance between teaching an engaging class, teaching a class that isin't going to kill a students GPA, and making sure that students fulfill their science distribution in a meaningful way. By saying meaningful I do not just mean that they care slightly more about the environment, after this class you actually feel that you have been given the tools to think more critically about the effect things have on the environment around you, and I hope that it has made students much more responsible consumers and future policy influences. If professor Puth does not yet have tenure, she deserves it as she is really doing everyone a huge favor in teaching this course. "

The course is not too difficult and the material is actually interesting. It's also nice that there's no final, just three exams that aren't cumulative. The tests are somewhat strange because the questions are often pretty unclear, but if you actually put in the time to learn the fairly intuitive material, you should be fine. ",

While the material in itself was really easy, there was a lot of work (3 tests, weekly discussion where you had to send questions to your TA in advance, 2 papers, a worksheet, and a debate). Also, the tests were really difficult because the questions were phrased very broadly - you never really knew what the question was asking. However, if you are looking to take a moderately easy science credit and have actual interest in conservation biology I would recommend it. ",

My section activities were good, but also majority reliant on student input, so it's really a situation where you get out what you put in. Luckily, it's a class that's definite easy to put energy into because the material is so timely. ",

Much of the information is very intuitive, so it's a good science class for someone who is not necessarily a STEM person. On the hand, even those with experience in this area will still be interested and can learn a lot through the case studies, applications, and discussion sections. ",
