            "\u00a0I learned about the methods of documentary filmmaking, oral and written histories, positionality, perspective, as well as many other elements that are beneficial to my own career. The class project portion of this course was also beneficial to work with students on a common topic and foster community building and learning. ",
            "\u00a0I began to understand the ways in which the public influences humanities and vice versa. I enjoyed viewing the different ways (documentaries, oral histories, etc.) we document the public. Moreover, I learned how to put together a group project with my class and some New Haven citizens. It was great getting out of the Yale bubble to create this project. ",
            "\u00a0Learned how to develop and put on a project for the public. How to think about public exhibits and how the unfold / all the different things to consider. ",
            "\u00a0A look at Public Humanities like never before. The structure is excellent--the first half filled with important readings and discussions and the second with project-based learning. Just ideal. "

        [
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course is the flexibility of the schedule and learning within the course. It also provided many real world applications to the work we are doing through site visits and in class speakers. The ways the course could be improved are to move the final project organizing up in the semester. The discussions on the topic were ongoing for months, and no decisions were made until the very end. It would be more effective if some hard decisions were made at the beginning of the semester in order for everyone to know their roles and responsibilities early on, and see a final product at the end of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Could be improved by having like two papers instead of reading responses that make students really analyze a topic of interest or research something they find interesting. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course. Professor Brasseux is an energetic and passionate professor and is very easy going. He makes the classroom very comfortable and relevant to the student's experiences. The small classroom dynamic also contributes to an elevated learning experience. ",
            "\u00a0yes ",
            "\u00a0If you think you would really enjoy doing a project and working with a group of Yale students then yes. The course is very backloaded and you must enjoy working with groups on projects. If so, take the course. Interesting material and cool activities. ",
            "\u00a0YES! A Yale gem. ",
            "\u00a0I wish I had taken this course earlier in my college career. The field trips will change the way you interact with the city and make you appreciate New Haven in a new way. You will get to know everyone in the class and form new friendships that you probably wouldn't otherwise. Getting to work so closely with grad students was a nice bonus as well. Don't be overwhelmed by the group project, it will all work out! "
