            "\u00a010\r\n\r\n(re above: Dr. Lichtman (and Dr. Louis) were EXTREMELY sensitive to the students and understanding, but I think where our professors fell a bit short was providing adequate feedback) ",
            "\u00a080+ for 4 weeks\r\nfollowed for 3+ for 6 weeks ",
            "\u00a0In the first half of the semester, it was 6 hours or more per week. In the second half of the semester, it was less work (maybe 2-3 hours). ",
            "\u00a0It depends on the amount of assignments, but I spent between 3 and 8 hours per week. ",

            "\u00a0It would have been better to have the first half of the assignments for the class due later when we had a better sense of our research proposal topics (biosketch, timeline, budget, etc. due at the beginning instead of the end). I think getting more substantial feedback on assignments throughout the class would have made our final products stronger and of the quality to actually submit for funding somewhere. I feel like all of the feedback we got wasn't critical enough and thus not really as constructive as it could have been, making it difficult to improve based on feedback for the final proposal. Pairing up with a peer in the class (as has been done in this class in previous years) to get feedback weekly would have been great too (in addition to getting feedback from the professors).\r\nWould have been great to have professors outside of just CDE read our grants and provide feedback as some of our work doesn't fall in that area. Maybe getting profs in HPM or EMD to look at our proposals could have made them stronger? I think this is one of the reasons why we didn't get critical feedback of our work. Also would have been good to read grants (in class as examples) by professors other than the course instructors to get a sense of how proposals look in different fields of public health. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: The course topic is great and important for PhD students. Provides very useful information for future applications, and step-by-step guide to structuring an R01.\r\n\r\nWeakness: the topic is not immediately relevant to the needs of the students and having it for credit or with such strict assignment deadlines make it very hard to follow and complete on time. this course would make an excellent PhD seminar-style class over lunch or something similar. The course could also be expanded to include a detailed overview of other PhD relevant grants (F31, NSF, foundations) as well as junior level NIH grants (F99, R03, R21). These topics would be more useful to the immediate needs of the students. Given the small number of students of class, the faculty could also be more flexible to accommodate the projects and needs of the students to help students further their own grant and prospectus applications. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the grant writing and review process that I otherwise would not have known in as much detail, so it was worthwhile in that sense. The amount of detailed information and the experience of the instructors were two of the strengths of the course. However, the course was not what I expected in many ways. We were told at the beginning that we would be reviewing each other's work and that the instructors would be critiquing our work during class sessions, and that we would get a lot of feedback. In reality, we spent at most 15 minutes out of each 110-minute session actually doing this, which was only time to go through a few people's work at a very surface level. We didn't always need to spend so long on the slides, and could have spent more time actually getting feedback on our own work so that when it was time to submit the final draft, we had more to go on than just the few track changes comments. Finally, assignments were not returned in a timely manner. ",
            "\u00a0It was a very helpful course and I strongly recommend it to PhD students, especially if they are thinking about applying for F31 or aiming to work in academia after graduation. Dr. Litchman and Dr. Louis were so supportive and gave us a number of great tips to write grant applications. They also kindly shared their previous applications and provided us with real-world examples, which was tremendously helpful. Also, it was so great to have two professors teaching this course. Their expertise and perspectives are different and it was so helpful for us to hear thoughts from both of them. The mock study section was also very helpful for us to understand how grant applications were reviewed by NIH study sections. This kind of opportunity is probably not easy to gain outside the classroom, and thus, I think it is a very unique and important opportunity and I strongly encourage PhD students to take this course. ",
            "\u00a0Extremely useful skills for grant writing; knowledgeable instructors. ",
            "\u00a0Course did a good job of getting me writing each week, and in reviewing the components of grant writing. It could be improved by helping students focus on more relevant grant types (especially F31) from beginning - it often seemed instructors were less familiar with this grant, which is the most immediately relevant to students at our level. ",
            "\u00a0The instructors are extremely experienced and shared many honest, interesting tips with us based on their own grant successes and failures.  The only weakness is that the course felt somewhat front loaded with the big assignments (specific aims, significance, etc) which could have each used two weeks instead of the usual one (which better suits biosketch and budget).

            "\u00a0Strengths: Good lecturer, interactive, and extremely flexible.\r\nWeaknesses: not initially receptive to students concerns about the relevance of the topic to PhD student's needs. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: clearly has a lot of valuable experience to teach from for this course, and we learned a lot from personal examples, which were explained clearly!\r\nWeaknesses: not all assignments were returned in a timely manner. ",
            "\u00a0Great instructor ",
            "\u00a0Main weakness was that I did not receive feedback on all of my assignments, despite asking for the feedback multiple times. This was frustrating. ",
            "\u00a0Judy was great professor for the course because of her great tips/suggestions, instruction, and feedback.  She also very obviously cared about supporting our individual passions, which is key for any great instructor to connect with the class.  No weaknesses, as anything we had concerns or questions about, shed answer or correct ASAP. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend it as a way to get your proposal done. I think there are some key areas of improvement but overall I found the course useful and forced me to get my proposal/grant on paper (finally)! ",
            "\u00a0The course is very demanding in the beginning, but then the assignments are more spread apart. I would not recommended this course because it is not very relevant to the immediate needs of a PhD student. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course to another student, but I would tell them that if they are hoping to actually submit the final grant they should look elsewhere for peer review and substantial feedback (of course, one should do that anyways). I would tell them that it's a good way to add structure to the writing process, because having accountability to the deadline each week helps those of us who work better with deadlines! ",
