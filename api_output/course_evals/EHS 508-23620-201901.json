            "\u00a0Packed syllabus which can be a weakness at times because I felt like I couldnt keep up with reading. Hard graders but the subject is easy or was taught very surface level. It was sometimes hard to follow Professor. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course was a bit too heavy on the front end of things. The first half of the semester was a lot of work, with assignments almost every week. These assignments could also be a lot of work like the problem sets and especially the biomarker assignment. The second half of the semester was a lot more relaxed which kind of makes up for the crunch of the first semester, but some more balance would be great. I also found the diet focused lecture to be the most engaging as it tied in new areas of research that many students in our department are interested in. Also, as someone who has spent over a year working in GIS, I would have preferred to have the option of attending the GIS workshop since I didn't learn much, but I do appreciate brining in GIS into the course for those that may not be familiar. ",
            "\u00a0Online discussion boards felt like busy work. Would've appreciated more in class discussion of the readings instead. Discussion sections were used for guest lectures, which was fine, but we had two hours of lecture which easily could've allowed for more meaningful discussions on the readings. ",
            "\u00a0Very well executed course. Enjoyed the topics and information was presented in a very helpful and clear way and I feel like I learned a lot. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great class that gives an introduction to exposure science and exposure assessments/tools. The class materials are very informative and practical that everyone might use some of them in their career one day. The class assignments and exams truly reflect what we learn in class and encorage us to critically think about each exposure assessment. They expect you to appreciate and apply the tools, but by no means to nitpick on details. ",
            "\u00a0The course felt somewhat repetitive of other EHS courses, such as environmental epidemiology and risk assessment. Although the topics were interesting, I did not think I learned a lot of new information from the class. I think the lab section could be expanded, since 50 minutes to do an actually meaningful lab is not sufficient. I most enjoyed the air sensor lab and thought this could have been made into a larger project in the course. ",
            "\u00a0The course was well-structured and helpful, but workload was too much for the first half of the semester (and they only made up 40% of the final grade) ",

            "\u00a0This course is not well-suited for doctoral students, but it is useful for MPH-level students. A critical review of literature and methods is lacking, and it serves as an overview course. That being said, Nicole is an excellent instructor, provided timely feedback, and sought to ensure the students learned the material. ",

Just not the best at communication to her audience. ",

Many times the instructor implied student should only do the way as instructed, while it may not be applied in the work field. \r\n2. The course did not cover many materials. The quality of slides, especially in the first few weeks, should be improved. Homework 1 and 2 needed some adjustments. For example, students should go into the real working field of welding and take samples and measurements. It seemed the instructor was taking it easy and judging the students homework hard, but the material itself was lack of content. The instructor should arrange some real world exposure sampling and should lead the student by doing it herself. \r\n3. The courses got better in the last few courses. In particular, the occupation matrix helped students understand the how work place exposure was measured. \r\n4. The work load of this course was over valued. It looked like a lot of instructions yet not  solid and applicable to real world exposure assessment. ",
