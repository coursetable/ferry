            "\u00a0basic principles of psychology and all of the major studies to know and link to those principles ",
            "\u00a0This was a very comprehensive introduction to psychology. I learned about the history of the field, prominent theories and scientists, interesting phenomena, and how the human brain and mind work. I also developed skills of reading about psychology studies, writing in response to discussion questions, and thinking like a psychologist. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the basic concepts in introductory psychology. ",
            "\u00a0Developed a baseline understanding of psychology. ",
            "\u00a0By taking PSYC 110, I built upon concepts that I was already familiar with, in addition to learning new ones. Most importantly, I addressed various misconceptions that I had with respect to psychology. ",
            "\u00a0I developed knowledge of important psychology experiments, concepts, and findings that covered several interesting topics such as developmental psychology, mental disorders, and others. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about psychology findings in diverse areas, ranging from learning to mental illness, and gained insight into the pursuit of psychology as a scientific field. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about the basic mechanisms of human thought and behavior. I understood what makes humans unique and what we share with others. I gained so much insight on how we develop and learn! "

            "\u00a0Having the class online was really interesting and very interactive. It was awesome to get to speak to professor Dunham personally and ask him direct questions. Way better than a big class lecture that can get banal at times ",
            "\u00a0The course was well organized and there were never issues with communication or assignment planning. The lectures we watched were engaging and the discussions went well. ",
            "\u00a0This course did a great job of clarifying the material we watched in lecture of the students. I have no complaints! ",
            "\u00a0Does a good job covering a significant breadth of information in a short time. \r\n\r\nNot much to be improved on, but was not a class that rocked my world. ",
            "\u00a0I wish there was more of an emphasis on social psychology. Besides that, the course was structured well relative to its length. ",
            "\u00a0I think there could be more of a group dynamic in the course. We once utilized breakout sessions  on GoToMeeting to discuss things in smaller groups. I think this could be utilized more. \r\n\r\nI also, personally, did not learn that much from the Noba readings. They were full of too much information, and I think they can be omitted from the course entirely. Instead, I think more articles, both scholarly and from popular press, could be included. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course is how it is structured, as well as an amazing professor to explain difficult topics very clearly. The only downside of this course is how much information is packed into the summer session, but it is still manageable. ",
            "\u00a0The major strength of this summer course was the small class size, which allowed for direct conversation with the professor, TF, and rest of the class. I also really appreciated the condensed nature of this course, since it was easier to remain engaged in the material and devote more energy into it. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the lectures and thought the assignments reinforced the material! The online discussions were a treasure. The only weakness was no captions on the videos :( ",
            "\u00a0The course was so well taught! Professor Dunham does an amazing job moving through so many topics in such a short period of time. ",
            "\u00a0This course put the amount of one semester studying into 5 weeks, which really makes it difficult for high students like me. The videos and homework are necessary for students to understand, but they may really not that interest students. ",

            "\u00a0Yes. I think this class is great to take over the summer because you can engage more with the professor and the material. ",

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student, regardless of their major. Psychology is one of those dinner conversation subjects that everyone should have at least some exposure to. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. Leaving this course, I have gained a deeper understanding of what makes us tick, and I believe everyone should have a basic understanding of how and why we think. This course also was fascinating in the sense that it went beyond course principles to relate psychology to everyday life. ",
            "\u00a0yes, absolutely. this course, even if it is not in your major, is something that is so interesting and applicable to everyday life that it is something I would highly recommend to anyone without hesitation. ",

            "\u00a0Yes! It's a wonderful way to take an introductory course and at such a nice pace! I was able to work and travel and learn! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely! Psychology is a field that touches everyone's lives, and as a survey course, this does an excellent job of touching a broad variety of subcategories and sparks any interest in pursuing more specific studies in the future. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! The content I learned was applicable in everyday life, and interesting as well. I believe it made me a more thoughtful individual. "
