            "\u00a0Mainly just getting an overview of discussions in the field.\r\nMet some new cases and got introduced to new frameworks. ",
            "\u00a0Learned to think more broadly on the different spectrums surrounding social impact and impact investing. The course was in general a great learning experience, as it provided a broad range of tools - from guidelines on personal decisions to frameworks for project analysis. ",
            "\u00a0Great readings on philanthropy , good insights from guest lecturers on their practical experience. ",

            "\u00a0Broad base-level understanding of the different ways capitalism can be used as a force for social good; business structures, organizations, etc. This course was as much a journey of self-discovery into how I can do good in my own life as much as it was a class on the social value of business. Guest speakers are maybe the best part. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided a framework for reconsidering the role of markets in addressing the needs of historically under-served populations and regions. ",
            "\u00a0A strong understanding of social entrepreneurship, impact investing, and how businesses can better serve the public. ",
            "\u00a0The course has deepened my understanding of the role that businesses can play in achieving sustainability for itself and the stakeholders that it interacts with. The business models that were reviewed were insightful and inspirational. The impact investing concepts and tools used in decision making were also very interesting. ",

            "\u00a0The readings were the best part of the course. Unfortunately, the in-class portion was not equally as strong. \r\n\r\nClasses could be improved with:\r\n-Professor Miller rarely appeared prepared to lead in-depth, nuanced discussions. I wish she had had better, clearer questions to steer the conversation, rather than letting them wander way off. \r\n-I also would have appreciated introductions and concluding notes from Professor Miller. She rarely spoke or added anything. \r\n-It was interesting to be in a course with people from such disparate backgrounds, however, our lack of common terms did not lay a strong foundation for nuanced discussions. Professor Miller should have helped us develop these terms, and stepped in when it was clear many people were using objective terms in the wrong way. \r\n-I'm disturbed and disappointed that though we talked about Africa in every single class, we never had a non-white visitor to the class. This does not seem ok at Yale in 2018. ",
            "\u00a0The external speakers that were actively used (e.g. to present) were really interesting.\r\n\r\nWeakness and strength is the flexibility of course which allows a lot of interesting discussions... that also often end up being very hand-wavy. Such is life ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very interesting materials, discussions, and guests; instructor has practical experience; format of a seminar/ small class size is great!\r\nWeaknesses: classroom space was not appropriate for the number of people in it; also, resources often failed to work (e.g. projector); too much reading required sometimes; sometimes classes referred too little to the required readings ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - course content, guest lecturers\r\nWeaknesses - lack of structure on case study analysis, class discussions, topics are too broad without getting into any depth ",
            "\u00a0S: Blair, syllabus/readings, manageable workload, group projects, interesting mix of students\r\n\r\nW: bad classroom location ",
            "\u00a0Fantastic course. Discussions with students from all the graduate schools as well as undergrads are always engaging and interesting. Readings are always cool. No weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0Exceptional speakers, Blair is wonderful, nicely paces course with relevant readings.\r\n\r\nThere were a few weeks before Spring break where it felt like conversation started to stagnate, I might suggest accelerating some of the impact investing material as to not lose the momentum.  It certainly picked back up after spring break. ",
            "\u00a0The case studies were fantastic and added value in terms of having practical discussions. It was a good balance between the practice and theory. Guest speakers were also of great value. \r\n\r\nWhile the seminar setting is useful as well as student led presentations, there should be an emphasis on having guided presentations and discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - Blair is very knowledgeable about the space, and she brings in a number of amazing guests to participate in our discussions. This is the ONLY class I've ever been in that effectively integrates guests with lectures (it avoids the sort of disjointed feeling that normally comes along with this approach).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Definitely a more \"survey\" course, rather than a deep dive into any one subject (not necessarily a weakness, just something to be aware of). Class was a bit on the large side, which precluded it from being a proper seminar. Reading was very interesting, but could have benefited from accompanying guided questions. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: guest speakers, class set up, diversity of students\r\nAreas for improvement: Eliminate case presentations / group project ",

            "\u00a0Yes, definitely. I especially like the format of a seminar, which allows for discussions that must be made in depth. ",

            "\u00a0If youre interested in anything impact take this course. Blair is amazing and makes sure that everyone gets something out of the class. The material is fascinating and some big names in the industry join lectures (I.e. COO of Andela) ",
            "\u00a0Yes. 100%. This class will force you to think about how you will have a positive impact in the world and you will learn so much along the way. ",

This semester had students from all different parts of the university (Divinity, Business, Public Health, Forestry, College) and I found that the diversity of backgrounds lent itself very well to the format of this course that emphasized varied approaches.    \r\n\r\nI think that the content of this course and the nature of the discussions would be relevant to anyone at the university.
