While difficult at times, this approach proved ultimately useful--I observed students in his class making cogent economic arguments in other courses within FES. Very thankful that this class, which I wouldn't have taken otherwise, was required and that Matt was the one teaching it. ",

Problem sets went a little too far, speed of concept introductions was a bit too fast, etc. I understand this class is a graduate level, but again, given the mandatory nature and the fact that many students had no econ knowledge, this was a little too challenging. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the course and thought that it did a good job keeping concepts as simple as possible. At times, the teaching felt disorganized and there was a lack of clarity, and the TAs had to step in to fill in the gaps in students' understanding. But overall, I thought it was great. ",

            "\u00a0The biggest weakness of this course was trying to fit too much material into too short a period of time. I understand the course was approached as a primer for future coursework in economics applying concepts to environmental and natural resource problems. However, the course was much too ambitious in what it aimed to achieve given the course is 1.5 credits over six weeks. Homework assignments were much more difficult than the concepts explained in class, and I found I spent a great deal of time in office hours with TA's trying to understand how to approach and solve the problems. A strength of the class was introducing a wide range of students to microeconomics. Although the professor was not always effective at explaining concepts to students who had never taken economics previously, he did try to engage and ensure that most students at least understood the basics. ",

            "\u00a0I enjoyed the course but felt frustrated with how slowly it moved. But I suppose that's because Dr. Kotchen had to teach to a room with a wide range of backgrounds and familiarity with economics. ",
            "\u00a0Both the professor and the TA's did a great job covering the concepts in understandable ways and providing help with working through the material. Office hours were very helpful. One suggestion might be to bring in more specific real-world examples to discuss in class in a more intentional way, as opposed to just coming up with examples in class in the moment. ",
            "\u00a0This course moved far too fast for me to comprehend appropriately. \r\nThe Professor was wonderful and insightful and would love to take future courses with him in a different context than a prereq. \r\nMy objection is to the fashion in which the prereqs were implemented, in which it feels like I only really had half a semester of actual learning in the courses that I was fortunate enough to take, and the prereqs were a blur. ",
            "\u00a0The reference book for the class is a really good one to follow well the lectures. Also, weekly assignments are helpful to understand well the concepts. But this class should be full term course rather than half-term course. ",

            "\u00a0In class lectures and problems were very clear and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of the course was the weekly assignments, which were a lot of work but seemed to cement the concepts we were learning in lecture by applying them to problems. The lectures were organized and often straight-forward, which made them easy to follow. I appreciated when environmental applications of economic concepts were given. ",

It is helpful to read the accompanying textbook, but for students without any previous knowledge in economics, you will likely still be confused in class and need to attend office hours to fully grasp the material.

The assignments were a bit of work but were useful in learning to apply the economic concepts we learned in class. The textbook was really basic and did not cover anything advanced, and Professor Kotchen seemed to model the lectures off of the chapters in the textbook he assigned each class. ",
