            "\u00a0I learned about the causes and consequences of civil war and civil conflict, especially what motivates these conflicts. The test case was Northern Ireland, about which we had many discussions, so I learned a lot about the conflict between Unionists and Republicans in Northern Ireland. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about theories of mobilization and of participation in civil conflict, as well as a variety of theories on how to end civil conflict. ",
            "\u00a0Wonderful class, I have learned so much about the different dimensions of conflicts, different types of civil conflict and processes of resolution and peacemaking. ",
            "\u00a0We learned generally about how to read and interpret political science papers through class discussions. The presentations were fun and the people extremely opinionated, so class was generally pretty interesting. ",
            "\u00a0This course will give you so much in-depth information about civil conflicts. Professor Weir is amazing and once you realize how qualified she is to be teaching this course, it blows your mind how pertinent the subject is. I gained so much and will take what I learned from this class with me moving forward. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a significant amount of the theory behind civil conflict, especially as it applies to Northern Ireland. "

        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting material, fascinating guest speakers in class and over Skype, a very reasonable workload\r\nWeaknesses: no feedback or grades all semester -- this made it difficult to track progress over the semester and to improveeand/or learn the professor's preferred style ",
            "\u00a0It was a great course ",
            "\u00a0Class was facilitated around student discussion which was great, but I would have liked to hear more from the professor. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Weir is an absolute joy to be around. She is so funny and brings such a wonderful, light-hearted atmosphere to the classroom. Probably the only seminar I've ever taken at Yale where I didn't feel like anyone was trying to be a section a-hole, because Professor Weir didn't create that sort of intense and annoying culture. Instead, I felt like our conversations were actually insightful and productive and fun, like when you're talking about interesting intellectual topics with your friends. Weaknesses: this has been written before, but nobody in our class has received an actual grade back by the end of the term. If you're wondering about your standing in the course, you can always go to the professor's office hours and ask her, but it would have been nice to receive some more concrete feedback. ",
            "\u00a0Great course ",
            "\u00a0I think this is already a great class. Prof. Weir is an extraordinary instructor who can bring out the best in every student. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Presentations were interesting and there was always a lively discussion of the themes for the day. The guest speakers are generally pretty amazing. The Professor is amicable and doesn't take herself too seriously - even though she's really accomplished and intelligent. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The students tend to take themselves way too seriously lol and some discussions were really weird to have. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths would be the material from the course. The papers were all very relevant, and I feel like once I started to engage with it more, it became extremely amazing to come to the sessions. Weaknesses would include the lack of feedbackI'm not sure if I ever received an assignment back which is kind of worrying. ",
            "\u00a0No weaknesses. It covered all the bases. The subject material built on itself, and the teacher was excellent about making connections between lessons. "

            "\u00a0This course was interesting, but I would only recommend it if you are particularly passionate about Northern Ireland or civil conflict in general. ",
            "\u00a010/10 would recommend.  Talking to former IRA guys is great ",
            "\u00a0Take It ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this class. I normally hate seminars but this was one class I actually looked forward to each week. We had awesome guest speakers, really interesting conversations, and great readings. The course does focus more on Northern Ireland than any other case, but that makes sense because it's the professor's area of expertise and it's also a perfect case study for many of the topics of the course. I also didn't feel like we focused so heavily on Northern Ireland that we never got to discuss anything else. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. You will learn so much and have fun doing it! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, class was great,  unique format and content interesting. I took the class credit/d. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend it, even if you're not interested in civil conflict per se, you will definitely gain so much by taking this class. ",
            "\u00a0If you're super into international relations and political science, yeah, but I felt like the texts all looked at events throughout history towards a solely political, and a non-social or material view of history. If you're interested in *how* things regarding civil conflict occur this isn't really going to satiate that, it's more just talking about what's happening/happened in a descriptive sense which was alright. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this if you're at all interested in the topic of civil wars, ethnic conflicts, etc. "
