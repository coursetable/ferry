Having taken it, I feel like I have a command of most current events ranging from climate change, to nuclear geopolitical politics, to basic knowledge of point of views of China, Japan, Russia, the Middle East, and the EU. Professor Howorth is an engaging lecturer, and does a pretty good job of mixing in-depth knowledge with the requirement of a survey course. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the biggest weakness of the course was a lack of standardization of what was happening across sections. Some sections focused a lot on map quizzes, other discussed the readings in depth, some did simulations, etc. Although the course is comprised of a lot of people, I feel like the experiences of my peers were really disparate from mine, making studying together sometimes challenging.

However, there was a lot of knowledge that I felt we were expected to have even though this course is supposed to be an entry level one. There was a lot of knowledge that was meant to be gained from this course that I did not attain due to the impossible amount of material and the poor quality of communication in trying to relay certain wisdoms.

The workload was very manageable and the readings were mostly interesting. \r\nI also liked that the readings consisted of articles, audios, documentaries and a ted talk, and not only having to read a hundred pages. I also enjoyed lecture very much, it was always interesting even when I did not care about the topic that much. And the lecture notes with all the pictures and charts facilitated the learning and helped me stay focused. I also liked having several 'guest lectures'. More so, the tests were well-structured and reasonable. ",

It also covered a wide range of topics (1 topic per lecture), which was great because then we could learn about many different things. A downside to that is that really each lecture could be it's own class, so sometimes I felt I wanted to learn more about one subject but we were moving on to the next. Downside is the classic TA dilemma: if you have a not great TA, you're going to have a not great experience with the material. ",

            "\u00a0Yesoverall and enjoyable class with a low workload. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Easy class, light work load (depending on TA, but still in general pretty light), weekly section where you review material from lectures, readings are required by they aren't really required. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only if you are going to engage in the class. If you are taking it because it looks easy you are going to miss out on some incredible lectures that are pertinent to you now. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0For the material, I'd recommend this to students who either don't have much experience in international relations or don't pay attention to the news. Otherwise, I'd recommend it to students who want a low-key fifth course or international relations course for the political science major, or just want to have more structured conversations about things that are happening in the world. Very low commitment if you look at the Times everyday, for example. ",
            "\u00a0Not really. It doesn't really delve much into current events except for consolidating an entire topic into 50 minutes, so things get really jumbled and rushed through. ",
            "\u00a0YES! Unfortunately this was the last time this course was being offered, but I would definitely recommend taking a similar course. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely - if it's taught again. The information covered was just wide enough to get a clear understanding of most issues we're facing -- but also deep enough to get a clear understanding of exactly what the problems were. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0Soooo gutty. No psets/essays, just a midterm, final, and required section (which is probably graded mostly on attendance). You could probably get a lot out of it if you did the readings, paid attention to lecture, etc - the topics are interesting. But if you've got a busy semester otherwise, it's a perfect 5th (6th?) class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to another student but I believe Professor Howorth said this would be the last time he teaches the class so I probably won't tell others to take it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This course is very interesting and it covers important stuff. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I loved the content and section was super interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I'd recommend it! Although I know it is the last time it is being taught. ",
            "\u00a0The class is relatively easy and pretty informative. It's practical more than intellectual, which can be a nice break from the rigor of many of the other Yale classes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0Good overall poli sci course that surveys topics; don't go into much depth. As a STEM major, this was a good course to take for a change of pace. Be mindful of which TA you choose though; some assign extra assignments as part of their assessments. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to other students. I can honestly say I enjoyed going to lecture and learning about the challenges the world faces today and it was a pretty low workload so it's super easy to sit back and just enjoy the learning. ",
            "\u00a0It depends on the student. It is such a broad survey that you don't get too much out of the class. I would recommend it to a student who does not carefully follow the news and would like a background on a lot of current events. It is a good 5th class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course only if comfortable with the TA after rthe first section. They play a big role. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, at least if taught by Holyworth. He is a wonderful lecturer with broad knowlege of global affairs. While this is rightly regarded as a gut, it is still one of the most substantive classes I've taken, if you are willing to commit yourself to doing readings and attending lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I recommend it! Not just because it was a class you could float by in, but also because it did genuinely give me a good base for tackling contemporary political dilemmas. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to all Yale students interested in engaging with or simply understanding current events. It really gave me a strong understanding of current events, America's relationship with the rest of the world, and the basis of America's policy towards international challenges. This class provided me with a good overview of these events, and little background in political science was needed to understand these events. ",
            "\u00a0Yes but not offering it anymore lol ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I finally have a broad understanding of the worlds conflicts and how they relate to each other. ",

            "\u00a0Course will No longer be offered, but if it were, I would recommend. Interesting topics and not a high workload. ",
            "\u00a0yes because t is good to help you decide what youre interested in and gain a broad knowledge of the world ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely if one is looking for a class that is engaging and based on current problems that can be used in everyday conversation. ",

            "\u00a0Yes and choose your TA wisely ",
            "\u00a0Great survey course to learn about current issues and acquire the analytical skills and frameworks to understand them ",
            "\u00a0Yes, big lecture without a lot of work. Readings can be a lot sometimes but you definitely do not have to do all of them, or any of them for that matter, if you already know about basic world events and global politics. Good introductory class in global affairs and political science for freshmen and sophomores, though my semester there was quite a sizable number of juniors and seniors taking it for an easy A. ",
            "\u00a0A super standard intro survey PLSC course. Take it because youll gain exposure to virtually all current events issues, take it because Professor Howorth is actually a pretty good lecturer, or take it because its not a lot of work at all and pretty easy. If you keep up to date with the news, and/or go to lecture, you can probably get an A. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to another student if they are looking for an interesting and low-workload survey of the many international challenges that the world faces today. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very low workload, and is good to take if you know very little about the international world. ",
            "\u00a0If you are not very interested in international relations or find foreign relations confusing, do not take this course. Some of the  lectures were absolutely awful and skipped over so much information, it always felt like we were going a mile a minute and if you got left behind, not much you could do about it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to a peer. ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely! This class is especially good if you're looking for a fifth class that teaches you about some of the most pressing issues over the next few decades. ",
            "\u00a0great class ",
            "\u00a0This course is a great course if you want an overview of international challenges. Coming from a STEM major, this is a great introduction as it touches on pretty much every important foreign policy challenges you might hear about in the news. It makes you feel more well-versed in current events. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I loved this course and would definitely recommend it to other students. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - a gem of a class. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, without a doubt, this class was definitely one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. I have also learned a lot about the institutional, natural and security challenges that the world is facing these days as well as other future threats. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to any political science major, or any student looking for a fairly broad and manageable analysis of major current events. ",
            "\u00a0Unfortunately this class won't be taught again, but it was an amazing class that I'm very glad I took. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend for anyone looking for a class with light workload and more recent and relevant topics. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this as a class to add on during a high-workload semester, because this class is very low workload. I hardly did any readings (although they were interesting and current! I just didn't put in the time). It's also just generally an interesting class, especially as someone who doesn't keep up with current events or read the newspaper as often as I should. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would certainly recommend this course. Gave me an outlook on the world today and also allows me to engage in discussions on current world issues that I once knew nothing about. ",
            "\u00a0Great intro to political science theory and an excellent way of putting world news into context. Lectures were a bit dry and section/grading is very TA dependent though. Good guest lectures, especially the Russia one. Would recommend as a pretty chill lecture with very interesting subject matter. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because I found the curriculum to be very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student if they are well-informed and motivated to study the various global conflicts. The course moves very quickly because of its expansive topics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes strongly recommend. The work is not demanding since it is only a midterm/final but at the same time you have to keep up with the material throughout class to have a voice in section. It is very interesting and fun so the more you learn the more you can relate the class back to the themes of the course. "
