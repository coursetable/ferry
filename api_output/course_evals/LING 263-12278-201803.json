            "\u00a0I learned how to work well with peers and engage with difficult class material. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about logic and set theory, lambda calculus, syntax trees, derivations, and many new ways of modeling/thinking about language. The material towards the end of the semester really blew my mind - especially when Hadas taught us that there are many things going on in sentences that we cannot even see. ",
            "\u00a0In addition to an introduction to truth-conditional semantics, this class taught me a lot of skills in dealing with sets, first order logic, and lambda calculus which are applicable to other fields. It also gave me good practice in problem solving and derivations. ",

            "\u00a0I gained an entry-level understanding of compositional semantics. The course emphasized ways of understanding the meaning of language through logical systems, so I also became familiar with propositional and predicate logic. I was interested to find that many intuitive aspects of language present significant challenges for a compositional system -- so I also gained some insight into the complex questions of linguistics as a field that were beyond the scope of this course. ",
            "\u00a0I have a deeper understanding for how words can be put together into phrases and sentences that have meaning. This knowledge is useful in other fields of linguistics like syntax. In everyday life, I think the skills and knowledge I learned in this class will be less directly applicable, especially if you are a humanities major trying to learn how to write with more clarity and precision or something like that. However, the content was interesting in and of itself. ",

            "\u00a0This course had many weaknesses. I found the material uninspiring, and I also feel that the structure of the course was dry and unexciting (the professor usually just talked us through a note sheet). The majority of our grade was composed of PSET grades, and because of this the professor and TA would not help us with specific questions about the PSET (until some of the later PSETS). This, I think, is not conducive to learning. I believe that homework should be a space to learn and make mistakes so as to master the material. But, because I was afraid of making mistakes on the PSETS, I don't feel like I was able to use them as learning experiences. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of this course:\r\n\r\nHadas is super kind and smart, and always willing to help. Material after the midterm is very interesting - and pushed me to think creatively in a quantitative way - something I had never successfully done before. Finally understanding lambda calculus/actually having natural language examples in the second half of the semester was fascinating - and very rewarding. I had never in my life felt like I had actually figured something out quantitatively - as opposed to just following a formula/model - before. I really appreciated the beauty of semantics by the course's end. I am also grateful that this course was accessible to someone with zero math background (like me).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n\r\nThe material before the midterm could be tedious at times. We didn't get to a lot of real natural language examples until after the midterm, and, until then, I sometimes struggled to understand the point of what we were doing. The problem sets were often difficult and really required a lot of creativity - this is NOT just a class in which you can plug things into formulas/learn a pattern and follow it. While this was ultimately rewarding, it was stressful as it was happening. ",
            "\u00a0The content of the class is very interesting and a very cool way to approach meaning and language. It was almost always very clear exactly what we needed to know thanks to very detailed and helpful handouts. However, sometimes the lectures felt a little slow as if we were just reading the handouts as a group, when we could have read the handouts on our own time and then spent the lecture on more novel material or practice problems. ",
            "\u00a0It could be improved by making it more accessible to non-linguistics majors/students with no background. Also emphasize its usefulness in the real world and not just as an academic field. Also, emphasize the conceptual parts of the course (as opposed to the mechanical; I feel like understanding the tools we used was made more important than the ideas we used them to express). ",
            "\u00a0The course could be improved by choosing a narrower intended audience. Right now there are significant numbers of graduate students in linguistics, undergraduate majors in linguistics, and people who have never taken a linguistics or logic class. Any one of these could work but the combination is understandably very difficult to teach. Under the circumstances though, it's well organized and well taught and I think all levels were getting something out of it. ",
            "\u00a0This course is generally a strong one. Hadas is personable and knowledgeable, and her extensive lecture notes were particularly impressive. I think the course could be improved by providing a more specific schedule on the syllabus and sticking to it throughout the semester. While I appreciate Hadas's attention to students' questions in lecture, classes often became bogged down in questions that led to a long digression on another topic in linguistics, or a future topic of the course. As a result, some of the topics that the course intended to cover had to be dropped throughout the semester. I would have valued the class more if we had streamlined the lectures and moved more quickly through the material as a result. ",
            "\u00a0The expectations for this course were extremely clear, and the pacing was regular. I knew exactly where to seek help when I needed it, whether it was reaching out to the TF, looking through lecture notes, or something else. The lecture notes were helpful and useful references to completing the homework assignments. The main weakness of the course was that sometimes, the pace was a bit slow and boring. Additionally, some of the problem sets  (as well as the take-home final exam) were excessively long. ",
            "\u00a0The beginning of this course was very slow. It was focused on teaching the fundamentals of logical operators and set notation. This was all clearly described in the required reading for the class, but very few people in the class did this reading and struggled to understand the notation. We could not progress in the course until the entire class understood this and thus we wasted a lot of time repeating the same material for weeks. Once we did move on, we had to play serious catchup and immediately jumped into the more difficult concepts of the course at a much faster pace and the stark contrast between these two modes of learning was shocking and caused many students to drop the class. As well, although it was convenient to have printed notes provided by Dr. Kotek during studying, these printouts discouraged more active note taking in class and thus a lesser understanding and engagement during lecture. Frequently, Dr. Kotek would wave her hands at topics we were learning that were above the level of understanding of much of the class saying \"oh it's just the way that we do things\" and this discouraged a stronger understanding and internalization of the material. ",
            "\u00a0I think one of this course's very obvious weaknesses is its repetitive teaching structure. The class was taught in lectures, supplemented by notes that we're provided with. Although I thought having the notes was a wonderful idea, lectures were taught by essentially reading off the notes word for word. And there was no deviation from this lecture-note style. I'd imagine it's hard to keep students engaged when each class is essentially the same except changes in course content. Changing the way in which the material is presented from time-to-time would better ensure that students are actively interested and want to genuinely learn more. Semantics in and of itself is a fascinating discipline, but the way in which the class was taught was quite repetitive and tiring. ",
            "\u00a0The goals, expectations, and concepts in the class were very clear and well explained. The class was difficult and it could possibly be improved by addressing the difference in backgrounds of students who take the class; i.e. some students have linguistics backgrounds and are familiar with basic syntax, while others are not familiar with it, and this made it a little difficult to keep the entire class both engaged and up to speed. Maybe a Syntax I prereq would help. ",
            "\u00a0The class was very disorganized, and it seemed that there was poor communication between professor and TF. Also, it assumed a lot of background in linguistics, and hadas used a lot of linguistic terms throughout the semester without formally introducing them. The problem sets were at times difficult and extremely time consuming; Dolly and Hadas were sometimes unable to address students concerns or questions relating to the problem sets. ",
            "\u00a0This class has very few strengths. I am a linguistics lover and enthusiast and had not taken a class in the LING department I didn't enjoy until now. The lectures are not engaging, sections practically useless, and I went the entire semester without doing a reading to absolutely no consequence. It's strengths are that it's a QR class and if you have a general grasp of formal logic and proof-based reasoning, I'd be amazed if you didn't do well. ",
            "\u00a0The disconnect between lectures and skills tested in P-Sets felt a little unfair. I would have liked more guidance on understanding things before we were asked difficult questions on the P-Sets. I wonder also if the things we were tested on were quite difficult and favoured experienced majors, even though I, taking my first Linguisics class, was told this wouldnt affect my experience.\r\nStrength is that Hadas is a good lecturer who discusses everything clearly and wants to help "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0No. It is difficult and uninteresting. Hadas is a good Professor. She is very smart, nice, and helpful. But my TA was not very helpful. I would leave section feeling very confused. Most of your grade is PSETS, but the professor/TA won't help you with specific questions about them if you go to their office hours, so it's just hard to get clear answers about what you're confused about. I also found the material to be dry and boring. I went into this class thinking I would be a linguistics major. I now do not want to take another linguistics class. ",
            "\u00a0If you had asked me this before the midterm, I would have said no. After the midterm, however, I would say yes - IF you are interested in linguistics and really like to think creatively about language/want to improve your creative quantitative mind. I would NOT recommend this class to someone looking to fulfill a QR - just take First Order Logic instead. Moreover, I think this class could run very differently with a different TA - I know a big issue was that sections were quite confusing for the first half of the course. ",
            "\u00a0If you're just looking for a QR credit without any math, you may not like this course. There is a lot of time in the beginning spent on laying a technical foundation with set theory and first order logic. However, if you are remotely interested in language, meaning, or how we can quantify meaning with logical formulae, absolutely take the class. Take it at the same time as Syntax I for a deeper understanding of both. Watch out for psets that take a really long time to type up, although if you go the LaTex route you will get a lot of good practice. ",
            "\u00a0No; I'm not a linguistics major, but I thought this course would be cool, stimulating, and give me a new perspective on language that would change my world view. Instead, the course was tailored to a particular field such that I don't think it will be a useful part of my education. That's not to say that it's a bad or useless course. It's just that if I'd known that going in, I probably would not have taken it. ",
            "\u00a0This course is an excellent QR credit. Semantics provides very interesting and often challenging material for developing quantitative skills through language. I found Hadas to be a helpful instructor, and I enjoyed her lectures. Unfortunately, I would not recommend taking the course if Dolly is still the TF -- her reviews of the material in section often left students more confused, and she sometimes made mistakes in grading the problem sets. On the whole, however, I would recommend the course to a student who is interested in a reasonably challenging QR credit. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course because I think many people will find the content interesting. However, sometimes, the content can get very technical and less interesting, though it is all necessary in order to have a clear understanding of the content. I would recommend this course as an enjoyable QR class, but not as an easy QR class. The problem sets, while usually not too conceptually challenging, require a lot of time and work. Moreover, a lot of the topics introduced early in the semester may be confusing if you are someone who is very mathematically uninclined. However, I think overall it is worth it to struggle through your moments of confusion in order to learn about the topic as a whole. ",
            "\u00a0This is not a gut QR. If you are looking for a QR and you have no background in linguistics please do not take this class. It slows down the course for those who are ready for it and causes them to ultimately learn less and be frustrated by the class. That being said, for those interested in linguistics, this class with Dr. Kotek was a lackluster introduction to the subfield of semantics. I do not feel that I understand what semantics is after having taken the class and that is upsetting. I would not be able to pose a question about semantics after hearing an interesting sentence that might be semantically intriguing. ",
            "\u00a0I'm not sure if I would. While this class does not require any prerequisites, I would highly suggest people take this class only after having taken a logic class or the intro to linguistics course. Without either, you're sort of throwing yourself in at the deep end. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class if you are interested in linguistics; it formalizes description and derivation of interpretation of sentences/phrases, so it gets pretty technical and requires you to be willing to do some pretty meticulous derivations. Especially if you're a linguistics student, some knowledge of semantics is pretty essential regardless of what subfield you specialize in. And Hadas is an excellent professor, excellent at explaining things/clearing up confusion. ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend this course to linguistics majors taking syntax concurrently. Otherwise it can be very confusing. ",
            "\u00a0Not unless you have to, or the teaching staff involved is entirely turned over from this year. "
