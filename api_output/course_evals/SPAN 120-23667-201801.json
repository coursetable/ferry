            "\u00a0Ramos-Ruano was a great professor, but the structure of this course was immensely stressful and difficult. Class time should be made more collaborative and homework should be assigned where it is actually constructive. Often the assignments were so time consuming in a busy week many students did not have any time to actually study independently or learn the material. ",

I felt like the course spent too much time covering Miguel Cervantes and Don Quixote. ",

            "\u00a0No, save yourself. Run. Avoid the Spanish department at all costs. I don't mean this to disparage the faculty. The professors I've had have been great. But with the average Yale student's busy schedule, grade expectations, and opportunities to support further study, taking Spanish at Yale is a huge mistake. It will unnecessarily sap tremendous amounts of your time. It will still sink your GPA. Several students dropped this course halfway through, causing them to lose their L1 credit from last semester, just to avoid the abyss this course would create in their lives and on their transcripts. Do yourself several favors and just take one of the obscure, easy languages. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend Spanish 120 with professor Ramos-Ruano because she is a very passionate professor, probably the best professor for 120. However, if you want a professor who grades very leniently, look elsewhere. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend the SPAN 120 with Julianna Ramos-Ruano, as she is an excellent professor dedicated to student learning. The course itself is great, however at times it had trouble balancing between material appropriate for L2 and what may be more advanced. ",
