            "\u00a0This is an awesome class. You'll learn a lot about the law and how the media functions in covering the law. ",
            "\u00a0I developed critical thinking skills and the ability to consider all sides of a gray area. After this course I am able to position myself on any side of an argument and make a solid defense for it. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about how to look at the contexts of cases and to think about the time and place in which they are situated. I also learned how to pay attention to media responses and to consider how cases in the past are relevant to issues today. Often times, I would think about trials in their own bubble without paying attention to how they were at times inevitable or a factor of cultural issues. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the significance of many 20th century criminal trials. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about some of the trials that happened in the 20th century. ",
            "\u00a0This course was comprehensive in its analysis of important historical trials. Not only did this course strengthen my ability to analyze historical context, it also taught me to think critically about legal implications. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about a slew of interesting trials. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to analyze iconic court cases from a legal, cultural, and societal perspective. I gained great insight into American society during the twentieth century and how the legal system impacts and and is impacted by such. Professor Ford posed many hypotheticals in class about the legal system that fostered fruitful discussions and exposed me to unique perspectives on such issues. "

        [
            "\u00a0Professor Ford is an AMAZING professor. We were all so lucky to take a class with him before graduating  very knowledgeable but also has great anecdotes about his time working in the media. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Ford is incredibly engaging--the discussions were definitely the best part. The course material is awesome. I honestly don't have any suggestions for improvement; I loved it! ",
            "\u00a0Our discussions were always wonderful, and it was exciting to be able to think about hypothetical scenarios that are relevant to issues today when talking about cases that took place in years as early as 1920. Professor Ford created a really great environment for us to ask questions about the trials, cultural issues, or even basic proceedings of law. I really don't think it had any weaknesses! ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus for this course is really interesting and the trials are fascinating. Professor Ford is really knowledgeable and friendly. However, there was almost no discussion in this class because he stands and lectures to the seminar for most of the class. It felt like student participation was really limited and our ideas were only really entertained/listened to if they supported to point the professor was trying to make. We also didn't get to discuss the issues of the trials as much as I would have liked because we often went on tangents. ",
            "\u00a0The trials were super interesting to learn about and Professor Ford is very nice and approachable. However, the course is really a lecture and student participation is only encouraged at a low level. We didn't really discuss most of the issues that I found most interesting, or if we did, it was mostly Professor Ford telling us his own opinion on the issue. Prof Ford has a lot of really interesting experiences to share but I feel like his experiences dominated class time and took the place of student engagement. The class is very easy and not much is required but don't expect to think very critically about the material. ",
            "\u00a0This course is incredibly strong - I am not sure I can even name any weaknesses. Class discussions are engaging and the professor is incredibly knowledgeable. There are some weeks with quite a bit of reading, which can be overwhelming. ",
            "\u00a0I wish this course were more of a discussion between the students and the instructor and less of a lecture-style especially with the cases where Prof Ford doesn't have personal knowledge or experience with the defendants or actors involved. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course allows students to engage with famous trials of the twentieth century which brings great awareness to the societal climate of these moments. The mix of course reading and media furthered high student engagement in the course material outside of class. I think Professor Ford is a dynamic professor who makes every minute of class interesting. I really enjoyed Professor Ford's teaching style of starting the class with his own remarks about the trial's background and then opening it up to student discussion although I do believe some students would have preferred a seminar without the informal lecture component at the beginning. Overall, this class provided excellent reading content and discussions that increased my knowledge of the cases and provided a very positive seminar experience. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely. If you can get into this class, definitely take it. Not only is the workload manageable, but all of the readings and videos are actually interesting. I looked forward to class every week. ",
            "\u00a0This was an interesting course and a great not-to-stressful credit for a senior. I'll say the class was much more the professor lecturing while then asking questions than an actual discussion-based seminar. I would have preferred more of the robust, decentralized aspect of the latter. Some students never spoke the entire semester, so probably don't take the class if that's going to be you. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. It was one of the best classes I have ever taken at Yale and I am so glad I had the opportunity to take it. Amazing course!! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely! Professor Ford is wonderful and cares about his students, and the course really opened up my mind to trials of the past and how they are relevant to issues today. One of the best classes I have taken at Yale! ",
            "\u00a0No, I didn't find it very engaging. ",
            "\u00a0If you want an easy and interesting class for senior spring. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This course is one of my favorite at Yale. I left every class excited to discuss topics with friends. The course is so well developed and organized. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great fifth course as a senior. Ford is incredibly knowledgeable and his value-add about trials and cases he reported on is huge. You'll learn a lot about some foundational criminal trials with minimal work. This is course is much more of a lecture with a question - answer component where Prof Ford asks a lot of hypotheticals about the social, political and legal issues arising from certain trials. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class for someone looking to learn more about famous trials and how their course of events directly reflects the climate of American society at the time. I think this is a great course for seniors looking for a seminar experience that makes students want to stay engaged while not requiring a tremendous amount of work. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I loved it and found the material very interesting and engaging. It's a very special class, and if you get in you should take it. A note that the class is not very discussion based, it's very instructor led (which I preferred but I know some people do not). If you are looking for a class with a lot of student banter, this might not be the best class. If you are someone who loves to listen, absorb, and learn, this is the perfect class! "
