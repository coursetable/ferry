            "\u00a0I learned how to read and write Hindi, as well as some basic speaking and listening skills. I also gained some insight into Indian culture that I didn't have before. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of basic grammar and vocabulary and am now able to have basic conversations with people. ",
            "\u00a0Hindi language and culture. ",

            "\u00a0I learned about the Hindi alphabet, something completely new to me. With knowledge of the alphabet I am now able to understand to some extent what hindi words around me say rather than looking at them as an alien form of artwork. Skills I learned not only encompassed language skills, but collaboration, and even presentation skills. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to approach my teachers to ask for help when I felt like I was struggling. I also learned how to effectively form study groups, memorize long lists, and work with peers to learn.\r\nI also learned to reckon with being the slowest learner in the class. I was one of the few speakers in the class without a basis in the language or a similar language from the sanskrit language family, and often struggled to keep up with my peers. "

            "\u00a0Occasionally disorganized in content and communication, as there are two professors who alternate days of teaching and two different sections every day. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Swapna Ji and Seema Ji are both fantastic, kind, and very invested in the learning of their students. \r\nWeaknesses: structure and transparency with grades. ",
            "\u00a0The course teaches you to write really fast. The immersions with regards to writing was really beneficial, but I wish there was more immersion with regards to speaking. ",
            "\u00a0The material covered in the class is good, but I wish there was more practice done in class. It seems more like we read the textbook at night and then go over the lesson the next day, so the teaching style could be more efficient. ",
            "\u00a0Teachers are amazing and the course moves at a good pace. The beginning can seem a little fast with learning the letters during the first two weeks but it is an amazing class. ",
            "\u00a0Class is very comfortable so it's easy to ask questions about what you do and do not understand ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the easy access to help, and the desire of the teachers wanting you to succeed.\r\n\r\nTo improve there could be more variety in activities and grammar concepts. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - the teachers took extra care with us, taking so much time to meet with any students who needed help in Hindi. Each meeting they would spend upwards of an hour with me, and afterwards I would always have a firmer grasp on the content than before. They never made me feel stupid for being behind my peers, instead they empowered me by allowing me to observe my progress.\r\nThey were very clear about expectations for quizzes and used Canvas effectively, as well as keeping closely with the textbook, which gave clear instruction on the subject we were learning that week.\r\nI loved the cultural parts: Hindi dinner and the Bollywood movies, they redoubled my desire to apply myself to the language\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - as a non-heritage speaker, I felt constantly behind, regardless of how hard I worked. Since my classmates already had some basis in the language, they could pick up the content much more quickly than I could, which lead to me falling behind despite working very hard. This could be improved by a slower pace of learning and more seperation according to prior experience.\r\nThere was not enough conversational practice. Although I feel pretty confident writing Hindi, because of too little individual conversation practice, I don't feel comfortable speaking Hindi. This could be improved by going around the table each class and each translating a sentence, for instance, and breaking into groups of two to practice of conversation. I found I learned the most from these moments in class, but there were not enough.\r\nThe Friday quizzes were often way too difficult. Me and other non-heritage peers would often get below 75%, despite having studied for many many hours prior. "
