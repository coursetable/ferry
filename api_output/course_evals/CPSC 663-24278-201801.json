I get that this is supposed to be a survey course of sorts that just touches on the main topics in the deep learning, and it does a good job of that. However, I think it would be really good to maybe even split this course into two parts. The first part could be offered in the fall and it could cover the \"essentials\" like regular NNs, CNNs, and RNNs. Then the follow-up course could be offered in the spring and go into more detail on things like reinforcement learning and GANs.\r\n\r\nOverall, as a single-semester survey course, I think it does a good job of covering the basics and I'm sure it will only get better as it gets refined over the years :) ",

If you've already taken a course using neural networks, though, a lot of this will be review. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The homework. Some of the psets were absolutely ridiculous, and the TA's didn't know how to do them. Going to office hours was useless since they couldn't help you, and they basically just told us to put anything and they would grade leniently. So, most of us just BSed answers and got full credit, and it felt like we weren't actually learning. The homework absolutely needs to be looked at in future years. ",

They were long, but uncomplicated for the most part. Would have liked to see less explain what this line of code does questions. Some questions were ill-defined, especially on the first homework. The lectures didnt contain much material that wasnt in the course books, so class meetings werent super useful. Graders were generous, but would take off a half-point or a point for something random most times. Received a point off for a missing question that was present, for example. Seemed like lazy grading.

Demonstration of code, sample codes could have improved my take away from the course. ",

The slides should have been more than just reading off slides that felt as if they were copied out of the book. The course should also be more developed so that hw's are not straight out of the book and so that the end of semester project is initiated earlier than April.

The homework assignments are very clearly structured and feature several \"build up code file-by-file\" format questions, which I deeply appreciated and felt truly helped me understand the somewhat foreign TensorFlow process.\r\n\r\nHowever, the assignments were quite long, and as a result grading rarely entailed any feedback. If instructors are not able to spend sufficient time to deliver feedback on assignments, perhaps they should be shortened, or at least 1-2 questions per assignment should be chosen for strong grading, as clear feedback on assignments and project proposals/update reports was lacking. ",

The psets were sometimes very very long, but they consisted of both concept based questions (with proofs sometimes or simply explanations) and coding (which walked through tensorflow and really helped you learn what the code was doing and how to create working autoencoders, conv neural networks etc.). Also, we later found out that the psets seem to be graded on completion. The main topics we covered in the Problem Sets were Backpropagation, Optimizers, Regularization, Convolutional Neural Networks, Autoencoders. It was definitely not math heavy, but I think they did a great job of introducing enough math to help students understand the intuition behind the concepts. I did not attend many lectures, but the lectures were far beyond the concepts I listed above. To truly appreciate everything this course has to offer, I think you should make sure to set aside more time for this class. That being said, I initially went to every lecture and did not find the lecture style that conducive to my personal learning. Also for the final project, make sure to continue working on during the school year and attempt to go into the TA and relevant resources for help to truly get the most out of the course. ",
