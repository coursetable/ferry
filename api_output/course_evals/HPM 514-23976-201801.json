I feel like the readings connect very well to the course material but there were so many that I could never get through them all. The written assignments are incredibly challenging. I felt very accomplished after the first one considering this is not my area of expertise, however, they are very time consuming and very difficult to grapple with. ",

            "\u00a0This class was OK. I don't like Mark's lecture style, especially because he usually has 1 correct answer he is looking for when he asks questions, instead of just students honest opinions, which makes it scary to participate in class because he may quickly dismiss your comment. I think there should be a way to exempt out of this class if you've taken a lot of political science classes before, as much of the material was repetitive. Having 3 person groups for the final paper does not feel fair, when other students can be in groups of 4 --- maybe try to address this? ",

The assignment prompts were too broad and convoluted. ",

This should really be a discussion and introduction into topics and concepts, but rather was a survey of topics that interested Mark and his opinions on them. Very little actual political theory or practical application taught. Pretty disappointing class ",

Topics were interesting but could have used more examples, visual aids, pulling from current events, other forms of media, etc. Also, having part of your grade based on participation in a class with over 40 students is just unrealistic.

An improvement could be to make the course more neutral. ",

The course is wonderful and invaluable in learning about policy and change-making, and the only thing I would have changed about this class would be pushing for greater participation from peers. ",

All the course readings were organized and available to download from Canvas easily.\r\n-- The curriculum does a good job of covering the history, economics, and governmental aspects of healthcare in the U.S. \r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES\r\n-- There were only 2 assignments. Student understanding builds up incrementally over time, not in a 2-week heroic push. Student work should thus be evaluated incrementally and over time, with multiple small assignments. \r\n-- I wish descriptions of things like the final project were written up and sent out farther in advance. Students have complicated schedules, and time management was difficult when I could not prepare more in advance. ",

I know some students would have preferred him to be more unbiased in the way he would speak about Repulicans, the south, etc. The policy briefs were challenging, but I felt like they were a good assessment of how we were grasping the material. Group essay was tough--especially on a complex topic like LTC and being limited to 15 pages. ",

As someone who knows little about health policy but also found a lot of overlap between the classes talking about health economics, I found this class incredibly refreshing. I didn't love the assignments, but they were an interesting exercise and I do appreciate the effort Mark put into providing the necessary background information. "

He is also encouraging and does a great job of trying to get the class to participate in the conversation. ",

I think his teaching could be even better if he worked a bit more to monitor implicit partisan biases that sometimes came through in the way he discussed politics, and if he made slightly shorter and clearer prompts for his assignments (prompts were several pages long and a bit confusing to decipher). ",

When a student would say something that was confusing or not quite correct, he would always find a way to tie it in or re-package it to related it back to the material. ",

Also, would be helpful to just be told facts, instead of long lists of different factors that may / may not impact a health policy phenomenon. ",

Incredibly partisan, and even as someone who leans very left, I found it distracting and hard to see his lectures without bias given his extreme partisan leanings. I would highly recommend he avoid the snide remarks about conservative political thought as it discredits his ability to teach political theory in an objective manner if it is clear he does not take seriously one side. ",

It can be hard to follow him talking straight for two hours, so it would be nice if he included more discussion or even just a current events video or something to break it up. He takes ages to get grades back to you, but when he does he includes extensive comments that I found very helpful regarding how to build better political arguments, etc. ",

Every class was well-structured, flowed nicely, had room for discussion, and still managed to conclude on time. Professor Schlesinger would benefit from posting the course-handouts online after lecture, and from reviewing the course syllabus to see where newer materials may be available. ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Schlesinger is a \"master of his trade.\" I truly to believe him to be one of the best policy professors in the nation. It was unbelievable to me how he had no power points and was able to lead a lecture based on an outline on the board. I loved his discussion-based style of teaching. A weakness is that he seemed pretty partisan towards Democrats. An improvement could be attempting to make the class a little more neutral. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: vast knowledge set of the topics, relevant research, and history of health politics\r\nWeaknesses: the course has a liberal tilt, though at a school of public health this is not completely surprising. A suggestion for the future might be to not automatically assume malevolence by the Republican party, but rather explore financial repercussions or moral arguments. ",
            "\u00a0Mark was awesome. You can tell he is really enthusiastic about the material and that he loves teaching. My only criticism is that the course was very one sided. Mark is very left and that was definitely the leaning of the class, but in terms of having a well rounded discussion, his far left lean made it challenging. ",

I would have liked maybe 5 minutes each class to discuss 1 short reading that had been marked in advance for peer discussion in small groups. That would ensure that students keep up and engage with the reading. The class periods would have benefited from being broken up into more types of activities besides lecture. ",

However, I may not recommend it to those not interested in policy or who aren't in Health Policy due to the mental gymnastics required for the projects we are assigned. With that being said, I believe to be successful in public health regardless of the field, you need to understand how policy works. Furthermore, it was a great civics class, and I am afraid colleges and high schools are failing to provide a solid foundation of civics, so really, everyone should take this class to be a more informed voter and societal participant.
