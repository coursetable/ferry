I also gained very practical skills to apply machine learning to neuroscience data in a rigorous way. The course also helped me with very basic skill such as utilizing the powerful computing resources, and writing clear and efficient codes. "

            "\u00a0The course very efficiently equipped me with practical skills, and taught me to look at fMRI data and design fMRI experiment differently from my existing knowledge. I really appreciate the nice course structure and tremendous effort devoted by instructor and teaching fellows. One weakness is that sometimes I feel unsure when applying these skills without a solid theoretical background. This is perhaps outside the scope of the course, and depends on myself to develop them. But it would be helpful for the course to direct me to more resources on campus (e.g. great course recommendation in other departments, readings of theoretical backgrounds that are suitable for people outside math or computer science).

            "\u00a0Yes I would highly recommend this course to another student. Mostly because this course is well-structured, workload is challenging but reasonable, and the class materials come from the frontiers of neuroscience. Also, the instructor and teaching fellows engage very interactively with students, and are able to provide timely help. "
