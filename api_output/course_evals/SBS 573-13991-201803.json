            "\u00a0strengths: given the sensitive nature of the material a main strength is the well-established friendliness and sensitivity of the classroom environment. \r\nweaknesses: addressing the differences between epi of mental illness and more familiar content like epi of the flu or epi of cancer explicitly at the beginning of the course would helped frame the issues better. ",
            "\u00a0This course is really interesting. Its strengths are that it allowed an open dialogue amongst students and the information was presented in a really useful way. ",
            "\u00a0I loved everything about this course. Exactly what a graduate school class should be, and how I wish all of my classes at YSPH could be taught. Outstanding, truly. ",
            "\u00a0This is my favorite class so far, I really enjoyed learning about all the factors regarding mental health. And also really enjoyed the assignments and presentations. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures in the course were rich and purposeful. It would have been nice to see more discussion of the concepts as opposed to just Q&A style learning from the professor. However, even the Q&A was engaging. The weekly student presentations were a unique and fun way to learn about other topics, of interest sot the student sand related to the course. i think they were a great way to diversify the subject matter. ",
            "\u00a0Great class, but sometimes felt that not everything was being covered because of having to get through student presentations. ",
            "\u00a0Megan Smith has an extremely relevant and experienced perspective - I learned so much from her thoughtfully planned out course\r\nEach class left time at the end for several student presentations. Due to the class size, presentations were limited to 3 minutes, which was very difficult to make and also to pay attention to due to the rapid nature of the presentation. This ended up taking almost 45 minutes from each class and cut into lecture time. I think I would have appreciated Dr. Smith completing her lectures rather than never getting through the week's material due to student presentations ",
            "\u00a0great survey of mental health issues and the social factors that influence their development and expression ",
            "\u00a0see above ",
            "\u00a0I very much enjoyed this course. Its major strength was the class structure (lecture, presentations, discussion) which kept the 2 hours engaging and interesting. Weekly readings were relevant, discussions were robust, and the workload was manageable. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided a strong base of knowledge in mental health and illness and the ability to consider how population-level factors influence mental health outcomes. I would have liked this course more as a smaller, discussion based course, but overall I enjoyed learning from Megan and from my classmates' weekly presentations and panel discussion questions. The assignments were all very relevant, useful, and interesting to complete, and I left this course with very valuable public health and mental health knowledge and practical skills (e.g. mental health policy brief for the governor elect of CT, short and succinct presentation and panel discussion, mediators/moderators). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of this course is everything. It provided a basis of how mental health is very much a part of public health research and organizations throughout the US. It helped to identify this topics within mental health from our 4 min presentations from all the students. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n-Interesting, engaging, dynamic readings\r\n-Supportive learning environment fostered by the professor and TF\r\n-Assignments that allowed practical application of material\r\n-Reasonable expectations in terms of time needed to complete course material each week\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-Class size. This is something I've come to see with most YSPH courses due to lack of capping. I think discussions would have functioned better with a smaller class/seminar-style setting (~15-20 students).\r\n-I would have enjoyed a bit more time spent on the lecture/discussion portion of class. While the presentations were an excellent opportunity to learn (and learn from other students), the material presented was sometimes a bit scattered and esoteric. Perhaps instead of having students propose highly specific discussion questions, the time might be better spent addressing how the presentations connected to the course material. I think that was the intention of the assignment, but it occasionally got lost in translation. ",
            "\u00a0The course really helped me to learn the basic concepts of mental health and related factors. The readings were related to the week's topic, the class environment was very interactive, student presentations were contributing to the class. But sometimes the process could be so interactive and it was hard to hear a student who was talking on the other corner of the class, which caused distraction when the conversations took a big part of the lesson. ",
            "\u00a0This was an amazing class with interesting material, and Professor Smith is a fantastic professor! ",
            "\u00a0This course was amazing in providing a linear and engaging story on the impact of social and cultural factors on mental health. The in-class exercises gave some perspective on the stresses and barriers to health that people face. I have absolutely no criticisms of this course. ",
            "\u00a0AP-\r\nTruly the best course I have taken in the MPH program. Best educator (M. Smith) and best TF (A Viera).\r\n\r\nDr. Smith truly understands how to maximize each 2-hr lecture period and structure a course. Course readings were selected very carefully; foundational tools in SBS were built upon throughout the course. As someone entering the course without significant affinity towards SBS courses, I found the principles highly informative, shaping my outlook on life/health and providing material for many wonderful dinner conversations.\r\n\r\nWhile assignments seemed to pile up towards the end, they added much depth to the course, affording opportunity for individual exploration. During weeks when I ran low on time for in-depth exploration of readings, splitting up readings (~60-80pgs/week) amongst 3-4 classmates, with each providing a brief summary, was helpful. Several key readings (Costello, Leventhal, Link/Phelan, Alegria, Luhrman) are referenced many many times throughout the course and having synopses compiled (especially since no electronics are allowed in class) are useful for assignments and class discussions.\r\n\r\nSingle Weakness: The course was such an overwhelmingly positive experience for me that I hesitate to comment on this. However, I did find that instructions regarding the initial assignments (experiential essay, mental health brief to the governor) were not as clear as they could have been. Simply a more detailed prompt would have ensured that readings/concepts were brought into the the assignments in the manner that was expected. ",
            "\u00a0Great course! Strengths: classes are engaging and professor and TA are both wonderful instructors, students present on a topic of their choice and all presentations were informative, readings and classes are varied and all very interesting. Weakness: fairly large class that made it difficult for discussions sometimes. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent course, I really enjoyed the structure of the class and the mix of lecture and group activities during the course. All of the assignments were fun because students were able to select their own specific topic within broader topics. ",
            "\u00a0Good overview of mental health issues from a public health perspective.  The assignments were well-varied and allowed me to think critically about a few key topics that were of interest to me. ",
            "\u00a0This course is my favorite course I have taken at Yale. It looks at a general overview of different disorders while also diving into the intersectionality of the disorders, all grounded in research. The greatest strength of the class is how Dr. Smith pushes you to find your specific interests in the mental health field. There are many opportunities for one to get involved in areas that are of interest through presentations and research papers. The assessment of the course cannot be separated from the assessment of the teacher because they are so interconnected that makes them inseparable. ",
            "\u00a0Outstanding course, highly recommend.  Mental health considerations touch every corner of public health and having an opportunity to deep-dive into mental health issues was extremely additive to the overall MPH experience ",
            "\u00a0AP Strengths: Taught me how to use the evidence to make policy arguments for public health issues. Would also be useful for areas outside of mental health.\r\nWeaknesses: With a large class, I feel that there were too many individual presentations and the time would be better spent discussing the readings,  possibly these could be done in groups. ",
            "\u00a0Wonderful class! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Up-to-date, intersectional, woke\r\nWeaknesses: Not super interactive at times, and it always felt rushed when it was interactive (could very well be due to the size of the class). I wish the final project was a little more creative because it felt more like a lit review. More assignments to engage with the material more would have been nice. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course from a content perspective. The information is relevant and interesting. However, if you are not in SBS, you may find it more challenging to relate all the information appropriately back to the assignments in the appropriate language. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this course was very interesting, and I learned a lot about the social and cultural determinants of mental health. I think I walked away with a lot more knowledge about various sub-topics within mental health, which was my goal for this course. ",
            "\u00a0Great course that encouraged integration of material during each subsequent class. I had anticipated more of a background into the etiology/epidemiology of the mental illnesses we discussed and would have appreciated more on this side. I think the class became very content heavy towards Indian reservations for some reason and a bit political. For example, we had many readings and discussions on eliminating the wealth gap, Medicaid expansion, handing out cash bonds to minorities, etc., yet I think there is a large deficit (and at many courses at YSPH) acknowledging that these routes are not the only \"correct\" means of achieving social and cultural sensitivity, particularly if we want to engage both sides of the political spectrum. I would have appreciated a more balanced discussion of these examples. ",
            "\u00a0Great course. Well laid out. Good progression. Fair work load. A lot of readings, but prof is not too much of a stickler on how much you got done. Work is relatable to class discussions and is practical. ",
            "\u00a0Course was fantastic in that it created a safe-space for discussion around sensitive mental health topics. ",
            "\u00a0amazing course on an important topic! I like that there are assessments beyond examinations. Although I left with more exposure on mental health, I wish there were more tangible skills I could have left with. ",

Carefully selected readings to build upon topics (social causation/selection, compositional/contextual factors, mediators/moderators...) throughout the course, offering concrete tools to my understanding of SBS.\r\n2. Remained very conscientious of timing and respectful of student opinions, inviting a welcoming learning environment. She maintained immense balance in the class in acknowledging each student comment while ensuring that biased/incorrect comments were addressed with grace.\r\n3. Offered many opportunities for individual exploration. Given her wealth of knowledge of the literature, she is an incredible resource for exploring individual topics in mental health, simply reciting relevant authors/studies/journals in response to questions/comments.\r\n4. Truly utilized seminal research to build upon key concepts throughout the course. As a medical student taking the course, I was most interested in obtaining key tools for understanding mental health and SBS; I left the course very pleased with the many tools Prof Smith taught us. She leverages the strengths from her strong research background with her clinical understanding of psychiatry. ",

Her knowledge is deep and she shares her expertise with the class/encourages the class to share their experience while making it academic and research-based.

The final consists of a paper where students analyze and evaluate a mental illness and a public health program that addresses said mental illness.\r\n\r\nThe course provides an opportunity to do a deep dive into a specific population and how that population handles mental health treatment. I would recommend it for any student interested in exploring mental health or in thinking critically about solving issues around mental health care access. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed this course a lot. I recommend it to everyone who are interested in mental health. ",
            "\u00a0Great course, would highly recommend. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave an overview of the social and cultural barriers of mental health that are faced from the time that we are in the womb until adulthood. I would highly recommend this as a mental health class to any student! ",
            "\u00a0AP-\r\nHands down the highlight of my fall semester. Best organized course. Best professor and TF. Best lectures. Would highly recommend any lunch talk/course/mixer involving Megan Smith and/or Adam Viera.\r\nAs someone who entered the course without a particular affinity for SBS courses, I would highly recommend this class to ALL MPH students. It offered me tools for understanding mental health and the world around me. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend! You leave with a much better perspective of mental health in our society. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting course on mental issues in public health.  Well taught with average workload. ",
            "\u00a0This class is an important and relevant issue that all students should take. Having it be grounded in research makes it academic, complementing the narrative side of mental health. The knowledge that you will gain from this class will be helpful for the rest of your life. It will help how you see everyday people, politics, and future research/studies. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend. ",
            "\u00a0Wonderful course, relevant literature and engaging conversations.  The student presentations were among the best that I've seen in my time at YSPH and forcing students into a 4-minute time window was helpful in ensuring presentations were concise (like mini Ted talks) ",
            "\u00a0AP: Highly recommended, I think this will be very useful in my career in public health/as a physician in articulating arguments to influence health policy using evidence. ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Smith is a fantastic professor and is able to explain mental disorders across the lifespan, specifically those directly associated with cultural norms and expectations. For this class specifically, you are in charge of your learning outcomes. The more effort you put into the material, the higher your learning outcomes will be. ",
            "\u00a0Would highly recommend this class to another student ",
            "\u00a0You will learn about the social and cultural factors of mental health in a very deliberate way. I would most definitely recommend it to another student because Professor Smith is simply wonderful. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course for students who are interested in the social and cultural determinants of various mental health problems across different subpopulations. A different topic in mental health is covered every week, although this does kind of suck when the class discussions get very interesting because it felt like we were often short on time. However, I appreciate the diversity of topics covered, and I would recommend it for anyone looking for a public health class that talks about important problems our society faces in mental health. ",
            "\u00a0Great course! I highly recommend to anyone who wants to think more deeply and holistically about the issues surrounding mental illness. However, this is not a course that dives into mental illness from an etiological or biological perspective. The workload was very manageable (with the exception of the readings-- there were way too many and I think this became counterproductive due to the fact that no one would seriously analyze all 8 articles). This class forced me to think critically and in a deeper way and really enhanced my semester! ",
            "\u00a0Really interesting course. Would recommend taking in Year 1 ",
            "\u00a0Yes - amazing course to think about and develop perspectives for mental health reforms in our country and abroad. Good practice in developing policies. ",
            "\u00a0great class, would recommend! ",
            "\u00a0This course is great for understanding how different factors influence the epidemiology of mental health disorders and how policies effect mental health disorders. I would definitely recommend it. "
