            "\u00a0I had never taken a course on China so I obtained a sort of baseline knowledge about China today and in the past, particularly in the Qing Dynasty. I also learned how to search and write about primary sources. ",
            "\u00a0Looking at China in the Imperialist Era which is really complicated but definitely not studied as much for students who are interested in present day China yet so, so influential on everything (policy, attitude, etc.) that happens under the CCP currently ",
            "\u00a0I learned about Chinese history from 1600 to the present (mainly focused on the Ming dynasty, Qing dynasty, and Communist-era to modern times). I learned about economic development, trade, various military engagements, environmental history, family relations, activism in China, and the lives of a few individuals. I learned how to analyze both primary and secondary historical sources. ",
            "\u00a0Great course in Chinese history. ",
            "\u00a0The course was a great insight into how centuries-old Chinese beliefs, practices and politics still permeate and contextualize current events in China. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about Chinese history, focused on the Qing and Mao era China, and the implications of themes of the past, including environmental consciousness, relations between state and society, and gender relations on today's China. ",
            "\u00a0knowledge of Chinese history, geography, tradition, religion, natural history and environmental history\r\nThe continuity between modern China and its past\r\nMajor themes facing China today\r\nAbout regions not usually covered in the news, including Tibet, XinJiang, etc. and how history has influenced their current conflict with Chinese people today. ",
            "\u00a0A history course that aims not only to explore what happened in the past, but see how it connects to themes in the present. ",
            "\u00a0This was my first Chinese history course, and I felt the course gave me a good solid overview of the historical context of current events in China and how to more intelligently interpret news about China in general. "

            "\u00a0Sometimes the lectures are a bit disorganized with no clear path. That being said, it is not the most important part of the class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: generally interesting material, can see direct causation on present day China so a very instantly gratifying class\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: readings were really dense sometimes and kind of long and boring. Prof Perdue likes to lecture \"old school\" but sometimes I felt it was hard to get the whole picture- lectures kind of scattered ",
            "\u00a0I thought this class did a great job in covering a wide variety of topics and providing very diverse viewpoints on the same events. Many of the primary sources were very interesting to read, especially since I had very little exposure to Chinese history beforehand. At the same time, I wish that the course provided an outline of Chinese history from 1600 to the present for people who had not taken any Chinese history classes. Often I had trouble understanding some of the topics being discussed because I had not learned about it before. Some of the lectures were a little disorganized, and it was difficult to discern the main point. ",
            "\u00a0If you are taking this course, Tiraana is the best. She has helped me a lot with the paper and preparation for exams. ",
            "\u00a0The course combined a nice selection of interesting readings and was well-structured by theme. The chronological jumps were at times confusing but overall made sense in the grand scheme of things and served to successfully historically contextualize current events. Workload was manageable and assessments were fair. My only complaint is that for the majority of the semester there were only two assignments, an essay and a midterm, and then in the last week of class/reading period (the busiest point of the semester in general), we had a presentation, a paper and a final. To be fair, these were fairly short assignments but it would have been preferable if they had been a little bit more spaced out, or at least not concentrated around reading period. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the connections to modern China that were made in every lecture; I learned so much about the modern day landscape of China from past history. One area that could be improved is the continuity of the course. The course is mainly organized by themes, and each lecture covers a theme (environment, gender relations, religion, etc.) which means there's not a much continuity and the class jumps from one point of history to another. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nGood TF\r\nWell Organized Syllabus and themes\r\nLectures were informative and referenced the readings\r\nLectures were entertaining\r\nUse of multimedia and different historical sources\r\nIntegrated history with the present \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nPotentially too extensive of a reading list, too many pages assigned\r\nWould be great if the readings were scanned and available online ",
            "\u00a0It spanned many topics from the environment, to the role of women, to religion. This was interesting, but much of the focus was spent on environmental history and activism which crowded out what I personally felt was more interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Great professor. Love the material. ",
            "\u00a0The course was structured by topic, and I found this pretty effective; it definitely helped the goal of relating current events to history.\r\n\r\nMy only suggestion would be to pare down the length of readings a little; it didn't really match up with the limited time we had in discussion sections to discuss the reading.

            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to another student, but be warned it is not a Chinese history survey class at all. You will get to learn about some really interesting current events in China and their precedents! ",
            "\u00a0Yes-- but only if you kind of already know about (historical) China and if you're really interested. If you're looking more about governance or present-day history (1949 onwards), a decent workload class is EAST 310 Rise of China with Mattingly (a really good class!!!). ",
            "\u00a0This course has a lot of readings and may be difficult if you know little or nothing about Chinese history (like I did). That being said, the topics were very interesting, and there weren't many assignments other than the readings. The course takes a good amount of work, and sometimes the lectures are a little disorganized; but it provides many interesting viewpoints on China's history. ",
            "\u00a0As China is only growing more influential, it is important that students understand some of its history. This course provided an excellent introduction to that for someone who had no prior knowledge, and made historical events relevant by linking them to their present day legacy. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are interested in China, you should take this course. It puts many modern events in China in perspective. Furthermore, if you are interested in U.S.-China environmental issue, Professor Perdue is very good at focusing on the natural history of China. ",
            "\u00a0If you have an interest in modern China, certainly. I had previously taken a course on Qing history but had never attempted to make the connections this course does. It also views many contemporary Chinese issues, including very hot button ones that are critical to evaluating China today. ",
            "\u00a0It can be a little disorganized at times, but the topics are all very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, for anyone interested in modern China and wanting to learn more about its history, this is a great overview class. "
