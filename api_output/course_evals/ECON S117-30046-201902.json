I also learnt to think critical about research papers, because now I know how some methods work and can use that knowledge to evaluate them. This course encouraged me to be more curious and try to empirically show something. ",

Personally, I did very few mathematical proofs at home and now consider them very helpful to fully understand where things come from. The weakness of the course is that it is very fast, but with a little more effort it can be done. \r\n\r\nI would say that the course needs more exercises other than those presented in the lecture slides.
