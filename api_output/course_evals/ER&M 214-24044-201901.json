            "\u00a0I think the structure of the course material could be improved in terms of making the lectures flow together. I also think the slides could be more informative in terms of containing dates, names, and overall significance of the person/event/place. It was difficult to catch what the professor was saying and take notes, so if these items could be on the lecture slides, the lecture could be easier to follow. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: my TA was amazing and essentially retaught us everything\r\nweaknesses: the class went too fast, lecture was too fast, content was boring and all over the place, never a clear path to what we are learning, spoke in monotone the entire time and couldnt look up from her notes, videos made no sense ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: had the ability to be an extremely interesting class with great material\r\n\r\nWeakness: material was confusing as Tess was not a good lecturer and all over the place ",
            "\u00a0Need different perspectives. This class is called historical perspectives (with an \"s\") but the focus felt very narrow and the narrative was portrayed in the same manner I feel like it always has been. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths in this course are the content, the lectures, and the section discussions. I thought all three were excellent, but I wished we could have engaged with the readings in a more meaningful way. ",
            "\u00a0It was taught horribly. The material was interesting and the sections were taught well but the lectures were very disorganized, lacked engagement, and the professor didn't even make eye contact. she read the entire lecture from a piece of paper very quickly so nobody could take notes or understand what she said. sad because the material is very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the class did much to describe historical blunders in global health and how this history has impacted equity and wellbeing via the creation and maintenance of many of the social, governmental, and economic dterminants of health in the field that we know today. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the class time needs to be lengthened from 50 minutes to 75 minutes. I can obviously tell that the reason why Tess lectures through narratives rather than engages on the floor with students is because of how short the class time is on top of it being for only 2days/week. Its unfair to her in that she is greatly limited and unfair to us in that we are not learning as well as we could be. Additionally, the class can benefit from a more diverse host of guest lecturers that are not just academics but health activists and doctors from different places. This is not to discredit academics but rather so that the historical perspectiveS (intentionally capitalizing the S here) can be heard. The historical documents that weve used throughout the class have done well to describe the historical moment and actors in the field but have come at great cost to limiting the voices of the historically oppressed/PoC actors since they did not have as much agency in those periods. This field is starting to change and I among many of my classmates would like to observe this change through the voice of diverse actors on the ground who are changing the landscape through their own involvement. If we are looking for them to be exemplary by not doing what we have historically seen to not work, we shouldnt. We should be able to question them as well based on what weve learned so as to improve student engagement with the material. ",
            "\u00a0lectures were a bit dry\r\nslides were sometimes hard to extract key information from ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Tess lanzarotta is very kind and cool! The material is very interesting, TAs are nice, section is useful to unpack what happens in lecture. \r\nWeaknesses: this was the first HSHM class I had taken and I am a stem major, so i sometimes was confused/had a hard time following lectures. I had a hard time differentiating the history/factual part from the critical/perspectives part but that is on me ",
            "\u00a0I really appreciated the critical approach the professor took towards global health, and I learned a lot about the history of American and European imperialism and how that is linked to global health today. I also loved getting assigned a country for the 3 papers as I was able to study another country in more depth than I would have been able to with just one paper. \r\n\r\nThe lecture slides and format of the lectures could be improved since the professor often ran out of time at the end or did not clearly convey important concepts + their meanings. It would be useful to add more information about key figures, ideas, and events in history onto the lecture slides rather than just a picture or a few words. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were very informative and worth attending. The readings were selected well as well. It was evident that the team of TF's put in genuine effort for the success of the students and the course. ",
            "\u00a0The only real problem I had was that the first paper was due very soon after the midterm. ",
            "\u00a0The course covers a lot of material that has the potential to be very interesting. However, the course itself is paced inconsistently. The first half of the course speeds through the eighteenth century, nineteenth century, and Pre-WWII 20th Century, while the second half focuses almost exclusively on Post-WWII history. I understand that the availability of information, as well as content applicable to the course, varies depending on the time period being covered, but it makes it difficult to follow. Moreover, the course itself lacked a clear acknowledgment of the narratives of women and people of color. I understand that it can be difficult to bring to light these narratives, but that's part of the point of a course titled \"Historical Perspectives\" (note the plural). ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: I really enjoyed writing the papers. It was interesting to talk to our peers about the medical histories of other countries across the world. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It was a lot of work. 3 paper, a midterm, & final. ",
            "\u00a0overall great ",
            "\u00a0I think the strengths of the course were the vast amount of information that offered a broad overview, the use of specific examples, and the papers. The papers were very interesting because you got a specific country and wrote three different papers on the health issues over time in that specific place. ",
            "\u00a0weakness: professor read straight off their laptop so the lectures were very boring and at times they would rush over important parts. The class felt all over the place sometimes and we would jump decades and units in history and then go backwards at points. ",
            "\u00a0I think the structure of the slides during lecture would be improved. It was often difficult to follow and write important details down. Also, while I liked the idea of learning about a new country it would have been better if we could each pick countries we wanted. I think that would have helped make our papers all the more interesting. ",
            "\u00a0The lecture and readings are very good. ",
            "\u00a0The readings are usually very interesting and relevant for the topics of the week. The lectures were very difficult to follow and it felt like the only way to learn anything was by trying to write down as much as possible from what she says and try to piece together the point of the lecture afterward. Also, there wasnt enough structure and clarity with what they expected of our essays. My TA was also a very good section leader and she clearly cared about my success in the course. ",
            "\u00a0One strength of the course was the quality of the discussion sections, which really placed what we discussed in class in a larger, international context. Another strength was being assigned a particular country in order to dive deeper into the global health issues there. One weakness of the course was the mostly monocular perspective in which this class was viewed. Another weakness was the relevance of some of the guest lectures to the course. I feel that making those lectures optional, extra-credit lectures not held during class would have strengthen the important concepts learned towards the end of the class. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses some topics are so large that we only touched the surface, but that is the design of the class. The paper structure was helpful and the TAs were really good. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest weakness of the course is Professor Lanzarottas lecturing style: each lecture feels like she is reading off of a script which makes the lectures unengaging and difficult to follow as she uses many big words in the sense that they have larger meanings that would have made more sense had they been qualified or specified.  She makes statements in her lecture that would be excellent in an article but, as she moves through lecture very fast, there is no time to dwell on them. ",
            "\u00a0First 3/4ths of the course had interesting material but the last couple classes were lackluster and didnt have content that flowed well with the early bit of class - could have had a better historical frame. ",

This class taught really important lessons about the complicated historical roots of global health and made me think about humanitarianism and philanthropy through a more critical lens. The country assignment (writing 3 papers about one assigned country) was also really fun! ",

I think this class has potential and there are valuable takeaways from the course but its not worth the time to try and do well. ",
            "\u00a0I would tentatively recommend this class to another student. The class itself is a bit difficult to comprehend the concepts because lectures are full of terms, examples, and concepts that are not known to most students. With so much material, lectures either fly by material or the material is recapped for 15-20 minutes at the beginning of the next lecture. While the majority of lecture focuses on the Western perspective, section shifts those concepts to other perspectives in the world. Be prepared to Google a lot of the words and examples used in class in gain a full understanding. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course because a lot of the information conveyed seemed rather redundant of other classes, such as Global Health Challenges and Responses and Media and Medicine, which are better taught.\r\nI think also for all Professor Lanzarottas talk of the problems with Euro-centric approaches to global health, the course spends a disproportionate time covering US and European perspectives on global health, while the only non-white person presented in the course as important to global health was Frantz Fanon (who is, of course, incredible).  Furthermore, there are several historical events that Professor Lanzarotta presented as fact or supporting evidence in her argument in class that were quite traumatic, but their significance in this capacity was not addressed - again an issue of not enough voices of the colonized.  \r\nOverall, the class was fine, but I did not end up getting as much out of it as I thought I would.
