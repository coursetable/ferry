            "\u00a0This course completely changed the way I report. I now have much higher standards for depth of reporting, and a much better understanding of reporting strategy. The class energized me to develop, through extensive interviews, a really holistic understanding of the topic I was going to write about, which really paid off when I sat down to draft. Now, I want to try daily journalism, and maybe pursue it after college. I also developed a better understanding of how people think and make decisions -- a quote I'll always remember is, \"People draw their own lines.\" ",
            "\u00a0Practiced skills in hard reporting, and got to discuss and read some super interesting journalism. ",
            "\u00a0This sounds lofty, but I honestly think I improved both as a writer and as sort of a thinker about society, people, and politics. Amazing semester! ",
            "\u00a0The project was intensely hard and you are truly tested as a journalist - this ofc depends on what topic you choose and how accessible that is ",
            "\u00a0I learned quite a bit about interviewing, verifying information, and the practice of journalism from this class. Both of the assignments were great learning experiences--it was very helpful to start the semester by doing a profile where we had to talk to at least 10 people. If you've never done journalism, this will push you over the hump of intimidation about interviewing strangers. The reading was also useful, although class discussions were not always fruitful. Hearing Bob Woodward and the guest speakers talk about their own experiences with journalism, especially as they related to articles we read, was a highlight of the class. I loved the class guest-taught by Elsa Walsh, who happens to be married to Prof. Woodward--so interesting to hear how she did this intimate, longform journalism. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about reporting techniques and strategies. It's definitely an amazing opportunity to study under Bob Woodward, and I'm grateful that he decided to teach the course. I felt that the highlights of the class were when he decided to tell us \"war stories\"  experiences he had when he was reporting and editing. I think that I learned more about the ethics of journalism, and that I learned more about how to write long forum pieces. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about journalism -- techniques for conducting effective interviews, fact-checking, different writing styles, the differences between straight and literary journalism, etc. The class also frequently touched on philosophical issues. While these issues were always related to journalism, the conversation we had about them were applicable to life in general. I definitely have left this course as a stronger writer and reporter. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided the opportunity to learn from Professor Woodward's multitude of stories/experiences in the journalism world. Woodward never lectures, but like a natural interviewer, he often asks questions that are intended to lead students to learn something for themselves. This class also gives students the opportunity to practice reporting and writing a long-form piece over the course of several months (with helpful guidance from Woodward, Chris, and Evelyn). ",
            "\u00a0This course is as much about how to do journalism as how to not. Woodward is deeply concerned with the ethical dimensions of reporting, and he really pushes you to think hard about the challenges of the professionchallenges that transcend intransigent sources and meticulous fact-checking, that address some fundamental questions about the nature of truth and the morality of journalism. Woodward encourages us to take a good, long look at journalism in both its beauty and its ugliness. As such we examine both the breathtaking highs of journalistic achievement and the shocking lows of journalistic failure, and accordingly the class is at once inspiring and sobering. \r\n\r\nThe class, of course, also has a pronounced practical dimension. Woodward doesn't just want us doing deep-think on journalism in the classroom, he wants us out there talking to people, tripping on snags, strategizing past obstacles, and the major class assignments really push you to do that. The class won't necessarily make you a better writer, but it'll certainly make you a far better reporter, experienced or not. "

            "\u00a0I loved the term-long reporting project and our class discussions. I wish the syllabus had included more examples of fantastic investigative long-form, though, since that's what we're ultimately trying to learn. I would've liked at least two fantastic pieces of that sort assigned each week. Also, I was not a huge fan of the profile assignment. Some people felt a pressure to depict their subjects in a negative light, as if the only interesting journalism were \"gotcha journalism.\" In the future, I think the professor should make it clearer what exactly they're looking for in a profile, and what they're not -- perhaps by showing the class an example of a good profile from a previous year. That way, students will understand that to do well, they don't have to portray their subjects in an unduly negative light. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very interesting, and the students who take it are super engaged thoughtful journalists. It is great to hear from Professor Woodward about how to do journalism, and I think that there is a lot to be gained from the assignments in the course. That being said, I found the discussion in the class to be severely lacking. I don't think that Professor Woodward leads a good discussion between students. He tends to ask one question to a student and then talk for a little. Then he asks another student a question, and then he talks for a little bit. Rarely, however, does he let the students discuss between them. When that happened the class was at its strongest, but unfortunately the discussion to frequently flows through Woodward. ",
            "\u00a0Fantastic course with a great professor and an excellent teaching assistant. Once-in-a-lifetime kind of thing. Im very grateful got to take it.\r\n\r\nThe one thing I would change has to do with what happens between the time students submit an initial outline of their final project and the time they really get going on it. We had an in-class session where everybody went around and described their projects and others offered tips on reporting or writing angles and potential sources. This was helpfulbut brief, and by necessity, given the time and the number of projects to cover, a little superficial. Also, some projects elicited more suggestions than others, which I think mainly reflected how much familiarity other students had with the topic or the reporting universe of the project. Perhaps more could be done at that stage to get more of the benefit of the groups wisdom  and, almost as importantly, to get people talking and thinking more about how to focus their projects. There probably wouldnt be enough time to have the whole class discuss all 16 or so projects at greater length. But what if the class was divided into, say, four or five final project writing groups that were required or encouraged to give each other more detailed feedback on those initial outlines? They could meet to talk about it or do it in writing. This could happen within a class session or, preferably in my opinion, outside of class. People are busy, and the class doesnt have any flab, so this might be challenging to find time for, but I think it could pay off. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths  professor Woodward is ultimately a caring and invested professor who will spend how many hours with him. He is completely accessible, which is not something I was expecting and invests in you if you show that you are also willing and invested. You will get as much out of him as much as you put in \r\n\r\nWeakness  the profile assignment is kind of just an assignment for Woodward to get to know the class but it drags on for too many weeks for the semester and could be shortened/replaced for another assignment. Also it really depends on who u get  u might have to write 1000 words on someone who bores you and doesnt have as compelling of a story as others in the class do, which means ur profile lacks something that u maybe didnt have control over which feels unfair. ",
            "\u00a0Both the assignments are strengths, and obviously Bob Woodward knows a lot about journalism. He is an attentive, honest, and surprisingly humble presence (much more humble than other, less famous professors I've had). We read his work in the course, but it actually served a pedagogical purpose and wasn't Prof. Woodward showing off. I also think the curriculum was good--there's a class on in-depth reporting, and you read the sorts of pieces Prof. Woodward doesn't write himself. \r\n\r\nThe main weakness of the course was that class discussion often became about the subjects we were reading about, instead of the practice of journalism. That's inevitable on occasion, but we were there to learn about journalism, not to debate controversial issues. I also wish we had talked more specifics about process, especially about fact-checking/verifying information, and that we got more detailed help/instructions on how to go about the final project. (Like, should we introduce ourselves as journalists, or tell people we're writing for a class? How much do we need to be able to fact-check hard stories for the purposes of the assignment?) ",
            "\u00a0I think that the opportunity to talk with Bob one-on-one was great. I also felt that he gave me good advice on my longer final project. However, I felt that the class discussions could be a little bit awkward sometimes. I wish that there were a better way to facilitate the seminar discussions. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot from this course and do not have much to say against it. Professor Woodward was always accessible, the seminars were engaging, and the readings and assignments were generally interesting. \r\n\r\nI wish that Professor Woodward had outlined the timetable for the final project more thoroughly on the syllabus. In particular, I think there should have been a deadline for a first draft of the final project rather than simply a deadline for the final draft. Revising is a really crucial element of the reporting process, and without a first-draft deadline it was too easy to put off writing the project until finally there was not enough time left to implement more than cursory revisions. ",
            "\u00a0The assignments in this course are a strength. I was initially wary of the assignment requiring us to profile another member of the class, but I found it useful to have one assignment before the main project, and it was illuminating to see what it's like to be on the other side of the interviewing table. I also think another strength is the way that Woodward seeks to foster equitable discussion time in class by calling on people to talk about their reflection essays.\r\n\r\nA suggestion for improvement: sometimes class discussions would digress from discussing journalism and turned into more political debates, which I found less helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Generally class discussion was meaty and flowed well, but there were moments when it felt more glancing than penetrating because we were trying to get through the points discussed in all of that weeks short essays, not all of which were necessarily in conversation with each other. The short essays themselves werent graded very promptly, and the criteria by which they were graded was rather unclearI never understood, for example, what really differentiated an A- and A+ paper, or an A- and an B+. \r\n\r\nThe strengths of the course were everything else. Literally everything else. "

            "\u00a0Definitely take this course if you get in. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to learn under a journalism legend and the two main assignments are super rewarding and engaging. You do a 2,000 word profile of a fellow classmate and a final 4,000 word in-depth piece as well as five one-page essays. Bob is the best and will for the most part lead interesting discussions (some days it can be a bit flat). Furthermore, he brings in guest teachers (including his wife!) who are just as interesting. Discussion doesn't tend too much to Trump and when it does, Bob always has new insights. Overall, a must-take course if you get in. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. It will change the way you report and think about people. It will also make you a harder worker. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I think it is a great way to practice journalism and Woodward has a lot of good insight. The assignments are interesting and prompt really really good learning, but as I said I think that Woodward rides his coattails as a journalist rather than being an actually great TEACHER of journalism. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely. Of course I would only recommend it to people who wanted to engage with it fully  but I think the course self-selects that way anyway. ",
            "\u00a0Yes Woodward is a good person who cares about students. Discussion could be improved and sometimes Woodwards politics inadvertently come out, but this is a great class and a rare opportunity if you can get in ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely. Overall, this was a good learning experience. You get to read and talk about a lot of journalism, do two pieces in a structured environment, and learn about journalism from Bob Woodward. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student if they are willing to put in the work. I think that you shouldn't take this course if you're taking 4 other classes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Journalism with Bob Woodward was a great experience. He put more time and effort into this course than I had frankly expected he would, and I learned a lot from him and the other students. I would definitely recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The opportunity to study with Woodward is once-in-a-lifetime, and it's a cool opportunity to be able to dedicate an entire to semester to basically one project. ",
            "\u00a0Woodward believes the study of journalism is the study of life. That sounds ambitious, but by the end of the course youll probably agree with him. Between the profile, which forces you to take on the intimidating responsibility of capturing the essence of another human being; the final project, which immerses you in different worlds populated by people whose trust you have to earn; and the short essays, which prompt reflection on why reporters fail and why they succeed; between all those things, youll probably come to see the journalist the way Woodward does: as no less than a student of human nature itself. \r\n\r\nWoodward is as humble as he is humbling. Sitting in the presence of such a legend is awe-inspiring, of course, but Woodward also makes a point of demystifying himself, speaking easily of both his successes and his failures, and delighting in hearing perspectives that contradict his own. He wants to learn as much as he wants to teach, and as such he encouraged us to push back against his claims. His cultivation of that dynamic resulted in some electrifying exchanges over the course of the semester. Aside from his contagious smile and kind heart, Woodward is a fantastic storyteller. Some of the most enjoyableand most insightful!moments of the course came whenever he pulled out some wild anecdote from his 40+ years of reporting to make a point. It was great fun. \r\n\r\nAn extraordinary professor, dedicated TAs, brilliant readings, rousing discussions, demanding but fulfilling assignmentsthis would be a wonderful class if that was all that it had to offer. But what the class ultimately offers is something more intimate. It teaches you as much about yourself, and your relationship with the world, as it does about reporting methods, journalistic objectivity, and political culture. If you care about journalism at all, taking this class should be, if not your top priority at Yale, then close to it. It's an incredible experience. "
