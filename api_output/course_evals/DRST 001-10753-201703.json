            "\u00a0I developed my close-reading skills. \r\nI read some of the greatest books of the West and actually understood them. ",
            "\u00a0Although DS is a lot of reading and work, I feel like I have greatly improved as both a thinker and a writer. The feedback from my professor was very clear and helpful, and my writing is much better than it was in the beginning of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read a vast amount of literature in a short period and still pick out what was most important and meaningful. ",
            "\u00a0Writing skills, learned how to discuss texts, learned close reading techniques ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me improve my writing abilities and taught me how to properly do close-readings of text. ",
            "\u00a0Close readings, how to find the broader themes of a work from small passages.\r\nExposure to great works of literature. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my critical reading and writing skills through the study of these literary texts. I also learned about in-depth analysis, the nuances of works in translation, imagery, authorial intent, and cultural influences on texts. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to analyze how writers worked with different repeated themes and ideas across the earlier part of the Western canon and how to put these texts in conversation with each other. I developed my close reading and writing skills. "

            "\u00a0It was a very strong course. The best lectures were by Professor Jane Levin, Professor Jessica Lamont, and the Divinity School professors ",
            "\u00a0This course provides a framework for thinking about overarching literature traditions that have emerged in the earliest written works. While we discuss many aspects and sections of the books in great detail, the sheer quantity of reading prevented me from truly immersing myself within all of the works we read. ",
            "\u00a0Strength-\r\nGood books to read (I wanted to read them anyway)\r\n\r\nWeakness-\r\nSeemingly contradictory essay comments\r\nI wish we had talked about the books in chronological order instead of jumping forward and backward.\r\n\r\nImprovement-\r\nBetter essay comments, less jumping around when we talk about a book ",
            "\u00a0Great class discussion, great essay feedback, easy access to professor ",
            "\u00a0The course covers lots of material very quickly but the works tie into each other very interestingly. The course would be improved with clearer essay feedback. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were that the texts were interesting and fit well with the topics and time periods discussed in the other DS classes. We were able to analyze the creative and cultural aspects of most of the texts to a high degree. I think that through the study of these older works, I have a strong base going forward for studying literature. In terms of weaknesses, some of the texts felt very similar in style, tone, and topic after a while. I think this is probably a product of the time periods they were drawn from, but I would have appreciated a little diversity. Also, we definitely should have spent more time on Sappho. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: We read a large number of texts, and I felt like I was challenged but learned a lot in class discussion. Having two seminar sessions and one lecture was also a good way to learn material in different ways.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I feel like I did not absorb a lot of the information just because of the pace at which we moved.

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to other students; it's a great, broad introduction to the Western literary canon. The only issue with this is that depth is often sacrificed in favor of breadth. This doesn't mean this broad introduction isn't valuable, but it can become frustrating when we cover Dante's Inferno in two class periods, or all of Sappho in one class. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely yes. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in gaining a knowledge of early works and ameliorating their writing. In the beginning of the semester, I was not an avid reader, but I feel like I now have an appreciation for books and writing in a way that didn't exist before. ",
            "\u00a0The selection of books we read this year was fantastic, especially considering I had not been previously exposed to much of classical literature. Professor Lamont is a lovely lady who is extremely passionate and knowledgeable about all Greek content and really brought our class to a new dimension of insight on the works of Homer, Aeschylus, and Sophocles. Highly reccomend. ",
            "\u00a0I love DS and think its a great challenge and way to read a lot and learn much more. ",

            "\u00a0Yes. The course is very interesting and covers lots of great material. It's a lot of reading but it's manageable and you learn a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - The readings are great and wonderful to engage with. It's essentially a crash course through the western cannon, which I would recommend for anyone. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course for anyone who really likes to read and has an interest in very old texts or works in translation. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I really loved some of the texts we read. I just felt like I did not have enough time to appreciate them. "
