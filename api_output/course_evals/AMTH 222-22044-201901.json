            "\u00a0Basic survey of linear algebra, not super exciting but worthwhile to have under your belt if you're going anywhere in any quantitative field. Really helpful for econometrics and statistics. ",
            "\u00a0I learned some basic understanding of linear algebra, which is a fascinating topic. However, I spent a lot of time outside the classroom learning because Ofir is a terrible professor. Do not take this class unless you have to. ",
            "\u00a0You learn to work with matrices, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, various types of matrix decomposition including singular value decomposition. What you don't learn is why you are doing any of this. There is never any theory or explanation given as to what these things mean. Also missing is any sort of application whatsoever, until the very end where we do some simulations of diff. eqs and population systems with eigenvectors. You get out of this course what you put in, cause Ofir sure isn't going to help you if you're struggling or confused. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the basics of linear algebra. There were some applications to engineering. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to use matrixes and vectors to solve linear systems of equations, how to solve the eigenvalue problem, and how these concepts relate to some specific applications. ",

            "\u00a0I learned linear algebra. Most of the fundamentals were covered, and we discussed some proofs in class. We spent one day on applications, but it wasn't really clearly covered. It is a more computational class. ",
            "\u00a0All I have learned about linear algebra I learned from the MIT online course videos. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a good introduction to linear algebra. It is definitely important for anyone going into STEM. ",

            "\u00a0222 is a very standard yale math class. I basically taught myself everything from the textbook and khan academy videos. better teaching and more example problems in class would be useful. ",
            "\u00a0There are absolutely no strengths in this class. Introductory math classes at Yale are generally bad, but Math 222 this semester has been an absolute disaster. Ofir is a bad lecturer; he has no enthusiasm and cannot teach any concepts. The problem sets did not align with what we were taught in class and often took gruesome hours even with the help of peer tutors. Most of the students didn't bother to show up to lecture and read the textbook instead. Yes, the textbook is better than Ofir. Some ways to improve would be for Yale to hire accredited math professors who care about teaching students. Ofir ain't it. ",
            "\u00a0This is a terrible class. This class is truly awful. The only thing saving this class was the excellent ULA, who basically taught us all the material. Ofir is worse than useless as a teacher, and the way the material is presented is bland and unexciting. If the class took a more visual and geometric approach (which would fit the material quite well), and explained, if not the theory, at least some of the basic reasoning behind the things we learn so that we're not just following formulas like zombies, this class might improve. Most of all, however, it needs a different teacher. ",
            "\u00a0the professor outed our grades, nough said ",
            "\u00a0This class was not taught well at all. The professors were not good at all. Everyone I talked to, myself included, watched the online MIT courses to learn the material. Many students opted to watch the online MIT lectures instead of attending class. The professors were not good at explaining the concepts and introducing new topics, and most students had to attend extra Peer Tutor hours to figure out the problem sets. ",
            "\u00a0The course was well taught with Ofir. The course follows the book closely and is very structured and organized which makes learning easy and it makes following along in the book very easy as a result. The course uses lots of examples of each topic which also makes it much easier to learn concepts as opposed to leaving things very abstract. ",
            "\u00a0They should 100% make this a flipped class! There is so much good linear material online and class could be restructured to much better teach the material. ",
            "\u00a0The course focused a lot on theoretical math, but it is targeted towards students who care significantly more about the applications of what they are learning, not the proofs of why a certain concept exists.  The class is called 'Linear Algebra with Applications', but I felt that I learned no applications in this course.  The course could be significantly improved if content was more focused on how certain concepts are applied outside of a mathematics field. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course were the material. I felt that the course was very applicable to my daily life, and linear algebra has a huge range of applications across all disciplines. I think one of the weaknesses is the organization of the course, due to it's size. ",
            "\u00a0It could be taught in a more structured way. ",
            "\u00a0This course needs more practice material in terms of the tests, but it clearly does vary significantly year to year. I also think more time needs to spent on the last third of the course since it was incredibly confusing and difficult. It did not feel like people understood it and many people came out of the final very confused. The tests are of varying degrees of difficulty, with the second midterm having been the easiest, and the final being very hard to the point where most of the class was unable to do the problems. I wish the distribution of difficulty was better and that we could have spent more time on the most difficult material. ",
            "\u00a0This course is taught so poorly and seems to be organised inefficiently. It is called linear algebra with applications but not once did we cover a particularly useful application. This course would be more appropriately named Linear Algebra Without Some of the Proofs. ",
            "\u00a0The course was not that well taught but the TAs are incredible. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoy how closely the course followed the Gilbert Strang lectures. Because of this, I was able to watch the online lectures if I had missed class or didn't quite understand what was going on during class. Section for the class was not as useful as it could have been. It often spent time on small things rather than being efficient at solving problems as a group. ",
            "\u00a0The teachers of the course are not very engaging, but watching the MIT lectures of the course was very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0It seemed quite disorganized. It was hard to get psets back. A lot of the time, what was on psets hadn't really been covered in class, and sometimes the peer tutors were baffled by it too. But, that said, I think one of the strengths of the course was the peer tutors; they were the reason I could understand the homework. I just wish that I came out of the class really feeling like I KNEW linear algebra, at least at a basic level. It seemed like there were a lot of underlying concepts that were just not focused on at all, that would've made the class more meaningful to understand. ",
            "\u00a0The course certainly covers all the material and goes over it in a way that's easy enough for students to grasp.  The pacing of the course, however, is slightly too fast, and the course could focus more on the concepts rather than the computations.  Additionally, the course includes relatively few applications which might have made it more exciting to students. ",
            "\u00a0Get a more engaging teacher. I watched the MIT OpenCourseWare lectures instead of attending class simply because the quality of teaching was higher from online learning. This is Yale. Attending courses is supposed to help me learn. "

            "\u00a0222 is a must if you're Econ or S&DS -- you might think you can get away without taking it, but it really enhances understanding of some really important material in both of those fields. That said, the class itself was *fine* -- not amazing by any stretch, but totally passable. ",
            "\u00a0Do not take this course unless you are required to. The professors suck and simply don't care about their students. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely not. I would literally rather die than take this class again. Yale claims to want to invest in attracting top undergrad talent to the sciences, then puts dour, washed-up postdocs who couldn't teach their way out a paper bag in charge of intro sequence STEM and then has the audacity to wonder why 1/2 of science majors switch to social science before they graduate. This class is a disgrace to the name of Yale, and should be avoided at all costs. If I hadn't had prior experience in linear algebra, I probably would not have made it through this class. ",
            "\u00a0I would because it is a requirement for many math-related majors, but I would not recommend this class because of class itself. ",
            "\u00a0Id recommend this class to CS or stats and data science students because the concepts involved here are very much related to these fields. ",

            "\u00a0It's a good introduction to linear algebra. It's useful, but boring. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a bit difficult to understand, especially because we are covering a lot of material that doesn't necessarily make intuitive sense. I would recommend this course to students who are more into computation over proofs (225). I am glad I took this course over 225 because it did cover proofs (we do some more computational proofs in the PSETs and the true/false on tests), but also covered important computational issues. Towards the end, the course got pretty difficult and it was fairly hard to understand things. They don't give much practice material for tests. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely not recommend this course to another student. Just listen to the MIT lectures and you will learn far more efficiently. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to another student. Ofir was one of the worst lecturers I have had at Yale thus far. His lectures bounce around with no clear organization and what he taught us in class didnt help prepare us for the exams. I had to watch hours of MIT videos to get a grasp of the materials. If you have to take this course, take it with another professor. ",
            "\u00a0Take it if you need it for your major. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Great course, and infinitely better than math 120 (I cannot stress how much better of a class than 120 it was). Well taught, and the TAs were phenomenal. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0It was a great course that accomplished its goal, but I would recommend future students to take 225 instead to get practice in proofs. That was my original intention but I took 222 due to a scheduling conflict. ",
            "\u00a0It depends on the teacher. The material is interesting, but the teachers are not. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it because the workload isn't unreasonable, as seems to be the case with 225. It was a fine class, the concepts were actually pretty interesting to me, though not a lot of my classmates may have agreed. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to a student if that student were interested in learning linear algebra, but I would not recommend it to the general student population.  The course does its job of teaching linear algebra but is not particularly exciting. ",
            "\u00a0DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE UNLESS YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO. Linear Algebra is absolutely crucial to understand for many application, but unless they get more engaging teachers, this course sucks. You end up teaching it to yourself from online videos. "
