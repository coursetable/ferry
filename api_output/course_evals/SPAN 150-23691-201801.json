            "\u00a0Outstanding!  Dra. Valle organized a superb course.  I grew in my written, speaking, and listening skills.  There was no busy work or wasted time.  Awesome! ",
            "\u00a0My writing, speaking, and technical skills are greatly improved due to this class. ",
            "\u00a0I learned better how to speak and understand Spanish, both Orally and in written communication ",
            "\u00a0I improved speaking incredibly ",
            "\u00a0I practiced my Spanish through thrice-weekly small seminar conversations! My speaking ability improved a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Much stronger speaking and writing skills across the board, I greatly enjoyed the level of sophistication expected of students with regards to their language abilities in this class and appreciated the diversity of topics covered. In general I felt that, while my speaking abilities did improve greatly throughout this course, it was my comfort level with writing and grammar that was most heavily impacted as, over the course of several writing assignments I both developed the ability to write extensively in another language and received enough feedback to dispense with common errors I had found myself slipping into. ",
            "\u00a0I greatly improved my reading comprehension and my vocabulary. My comfort speaking Spanish conversationally improved dramatically. ",
            "\u00a0I strengthened my Spanish writing, speaking, and comprehension skills! "

        [
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are many: well-taught, clear organization, followed the syllabus, communicative and interactive.\r\n\r\nI cannot think of any weakness.  I appreciated the grammar handouts prepared uniquely for this section (i.e., not just a photocopy of earlier stuff yet again).  The only drawback: we need another section!  Please consider 150A and 150B for a year of this important reinforcement and challenge.  Attendance by the whole class was strong as was completion of assignments so I think it would be worth the department's time. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course was that it tested everything--verbal, written, grammatical--so I left feeling much more confident about my Spanish abilities. ",
            "\u00a0Constant involvement and assessment ",
            "\u00a0It helped me so much but there is too much busy work! ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course is the diversity of topics covered which challenges students to think creatively and formulate well-conceived opinions about a number of subjects which they will then present to their classmates. I also enjoyed our coverage of various styles of writing throughout the semester, from argumentative to creative writing to movie reviews. One potential area for improvement however may be more clarity in the assignment expectations, at times I felt taken by surprise because assignments given in class or through email were not reflected elsewhere or I was unsure of exactly what I was expected to submit. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths included the diversity of assignments and the selection of reading and film materials, which were overall very interesting and engaging. The level of personalized feedback on assignments was also very helpful. The class was relatively light on instruction around grammar. ",
            "\u00a0I would prefer the course to focus less on academic texts with academic language and focus more on colloquial speaking and strengthening our ability to understand regular people during conversations. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course and this instructor to others.  It is worth the time and investment for real learning. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend taking this course. You improve your writing, reading, and speaking skills so much during the semester. You receive helpful feedback for every assignment and exam. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend to a student who wants to improve their Spanish with less work than other L5 courses. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Sonia is kind! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! definitely recommend. Especially with Prof Valle- she is really good at leading discussion and giving clear feedback, and overall such a great teacher. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a great way to move into Level Five of Spanish. It's emphasis on writing and grammar will serve you well in subsequent classes where assessments will be less based on your ability to use proper Spanish grammar and instead on the quality of your ideas. This class then helps to bridge the gap between Levels One through Four by not only providing extensive feedback but allowing you to experiment with writing long form papers in Spanish and formulating complex arguments in conversation. The day-to-day workload is likely higher than other L5 classes but will be of great assistance to you in the future. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - it's a good course to refresh your Spanish ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend it. Great way to get individualized support in learning Spanish and the syllabus is for the most part, great (the exception being that I would prefer that the class focused more on helping student understand colloquial speaking more) "
