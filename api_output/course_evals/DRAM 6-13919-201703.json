I appreciated the diversity of cultures covered while emphasizing Western Theater because of its relevance to American Theater. \r\n\r\nReadings, Lectures (including TA lectures), and assignments were clear, valuable and interesting. ",

            "\u00a0The easy availability of resources was fantastic. I don't think there was a single time I looked for something and was unable to find it. \r\nThere was occasionally a lack of clarity in some areas (only example I can think of was whether or not the final exam essay questions would be made available ahead of time), but this did not have a huge impact. ",

While my peers may not have been the most responsive to certain prompt questions, the section was often awkward due to unclear prompts or silences. ",
            "\u00a0Nahuel did a magnificent job at inspiring thoughtful conversations and debates. He did not shy away from pressing students (in a supportive manner) to deepen and justify their arguments.\r\n\r\nThe lectures are dense, and Nahuel perfectly balanced rehashing key concepts with in depth discussions of important issues/frameworks.

            "\u00a0The discussion groups were the best part of the class. Not being able to ask questions during class and just listening to an essay being read to us was very hard to learn from. Maybe posting what Paul is reading from on Canvas would be useful for people to look at on their own. ",

            "\u00a0The gist of the class paper was pretty appropriate to the aims of the course. Unfortunately, its proximity to the midterm made it difficult to devote a lot of time to it. Also, the list of largely unfamiliar plays, presented with little context, made it difficult to make an informed choice about an unfamiliar play. \r\n\r\nNot all of the short response questions felt useful or related to the play. The question about 'The Mandrake' stood out as somewhat frustrating. ",

It's also hard to have good discussions when the plays themselves are often dry and hard to read.\r\n\r\nTheatre is meant to be seen, not read - why can't we see productions instead? Or films of productions? This would allow us to understand concepts and stories much more easily, instead of getting stuck on colloquialisms and bad writing. ",

I would encourage more mindfulness of the production calendar when choosing plays and devising the syllabus. "

One suggestion might be to require the class to read/watch VERY small excerpts of supplementary materials. The class has the perfect amount of assignments overall, so substantial additional time spent on supplementary materials would not be worthwhile. ",

However, I worked at a Shakespeare company for the last decade and I had never heard of (or didn't remember) the influence of the Vagabond Laws. I thought the class's unique perspective on the Greeks and 16-17th Century English drama was particularly novel. ",
            "\u00a0The course is structured well but given the time crunch all the information we received this semester will be forgotten by next year so that really isn't helpful. If there were fewer topics or details to study and focus on, it would be easier to get a comprehensive understanding, rather than learning a lot of random facts. ",

An invaluable overview that would have been missed with just the tests alone (it is easy to get caught up in close reading and memorizing, forgetting the bigger picture). ",

Most/all of my learning happened when studying for the test and looking at the power points on my own and through the review session with the TAs. I don't think that really helped me retain anything, but I'm sure I have something in the back of my mind that wasn't there before. ",

Were it taught by someone else, I don't know that I would recommend it. ",

I liked when we spent a lot of time on a specific play like an entire lecture on Fuentovejuna. Being able to connect the terms back to a play was where I was most engaged.

Often I felt that by the time I started writing down a sentence Paul was saying, I missed the second half of the sentence that contained the most important content.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I would like to use a laptop to take notes as I'm a faster at typing than writing. If Paul is worried about people \"surfing\" in class, he can position TAs in the back of class to watch students' screens.\r\n\r\nI felt sympathy for ESL students or students who have not been exposed to such rigorous academic environments. However, to my knowledge, many of those students found the support they needed to pass the class if they sought it out.\r\n\r\nOverall, I appreciated the challenge of the subject matter's presentation.

Post mid-term, though, perhaps because we had more to cover, we really raced through the material. The first half of the term, I was able to follow along and take notes without problem.
