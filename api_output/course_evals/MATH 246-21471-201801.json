The lectures are very dry as the professor is just copying his notes directly onto the board every lecture, although I will add that he is very enthusiastic to answer questions (it's just that pretty much nobody ever asks). Material is pretty dry; I felt that I could have learned the material on my own just as easily and did just as well. ",

            "\u00a0The greatest strength of the course was the weekly problem sets, which provided ample opportunity to practice the techniques taught in class. Additionally, the in-class review session was very helpful in reviewing all the methods learned in a comprehensive manner. I believe that the course could be improved by having shorter midterms (it seemed like the entire class was unable to finish either midterm). ",

            "\u00a0The strengths are that it is very straightforward, and it is fairly easy to learn all of the material from the textbook. The weaknesses are that it is very difficult to understand what is going on in class because the professor is all over the place and does not teach in an organized and clear manner. The grading is also fairly harsh for such a straightforward class. ",
            "\u00a0Moncrief is very nice and means well, and he is certainly a genius. But that might actually be a bit of a liability here, because a lot of these things seem really easy to him but can be harder to grasp for us. So it would have been better for him to go slower on some things and really explain them with examples (instead of \"ok this is the rule, now convince yourself that it applies to this example,\" which ends up leaving us a bit unsure about what to do). The problem sets were often tedious, which is somewhat avoidable, but they weren't as terrible as they have been for some other classes. Textbook wasn't great, but it was often more reliable than the lecture. ",

It was so difficult to stay focused because the lectures were not engaging. I couldn't follow what the lector was writing on the board because he often skipped steps or just said \"convince yourself that this is what you would end up getting.\" I found myself wishing I was still in my high school math teacher's class because it was so hard to gain anything from going to class. Another strength is that the problem sets were manageable, and I learned a lot from doing them, but a weakness is that I ended up teaching myself everything from the book. At times it felt like I was taking 3 classes, and math was just something I did on Sunday nights. That was pretty unfortunate because before coming to Yale I was really passionate about math and could articulate exactly what I love about it, but now I feel pretty indifferent because I find it hard to get excited about math at Yale.

The class is decent, Professor Moncrief teaches quite well, the weekly problem sets are definitely manageable, but the midterms were way too long. The course was taught in a somewhat disorganized fashion - there did not seem to be a clear schedule of when we would be moving on to new topics. ",

However, it is very boring and in class, it is difficult to ever know what is going on, so in general, it is not an enjoyable class. ",
            "\u00a0I mean, not if you don't have to. Like I wouldn't say you should dread this course, it isn't that bad, but I don't really have anything good to say about it either. ENAS 194 is often another option, and there are some horror stories about some of the people that teach it, so if you're looking at one of them, then take this instead. \r\n\r\nHopefully you're good at math and can keep up/teach yourself from the textbook, because things go fast, there isn't a lot of support, and Moncrief isn't very good at explaining things. And everyone else is pretty good at math so you have to compete with them. I've heard from past years that the grading is pretty generous, which is good, because I only got through 70% or so of the second midterm... no way to do more than that in the 75 minutes we had. I wish that we could just have a proper final in the finals slot if the exam is going to be that long, or better, just make it one question shorter so people actually have a chance to finish it--I don't think it's really fair for the speed with which you can complete an exam to have such a strong bearing on your score.

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student if they need it as a prerequisite or a low-engagement QR class. I personally didn't gain more than that, so I wouldn't recommend it to someone looking for a mind-blowingly amazing class. ",

            "\u00a0No! I hated this class and do not think I did well at all, even though the material is actually very easy. Do not assume you can just take it as an easy math credit and get a good grade because the tests are actually hard. You could learn the same amount from maybe a day's worth of looking at problems. \r\n\r\nDo not take this. "
