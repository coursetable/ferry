            "\u00a0I received a lot of feedback and insight on the development of the manuscript I am writing for my degree. I also got more than ample opportunity to practice and improve my presentation of my research. ",
            "\u00a0I learned excellent presentation skills, and I developed my research and scientific writing abilities as well. I learned a great deal about my colleagues' research, and the type of work they are doing in a way that I might not have otherwise. ",
            "\u00a0This course was useful for providing structure/feedback during the paper writing process. ",

            "\u00a0Very well. ",
            "\u00a0It followed quite well. ",
            "\u00a0The structure of the course was much more rigid than I anticipated. The whole point of the course is to provide support for the students' research. The rigid deadlines for particular sections of the paper did not always align with the analysis/writing stage I was in, and the constant deadlines made it difficult to invest time into the areas of my paper that needed the most work. Instead, my time was constantly being diverted to piecing together a paper to submit for a deadline when I should have spent that time analyzing my data and finding a clear story to tell. ",
            "\u00a0They aligned well. ",
            "\u00a0They exceeded my expectations ",
            "\u00a0About what I expected, having taken the fall semester of the course. ",
            "\u00a0I expected to dive deeper into the writing process. We spent a lot of time presenting to each other as a group, and not nearly enough time discussing how to actually write a good paper. I thought there would be more structure and logical progression of course material than there was. "

            "\u00a0I would have like a little bit more guidance on how to write a results and discussion section. We got a lot of feedback after we wrote these sections, but a lecture on how to approach them before we began writing would have been really helpful. I think it was really beneficial to give and receive feedback on our classmates work as well as getting feedback from the instructors. ",
            "\u00a0I think it was a great platform to workshop my research. It was a little bit large to spend so much time on each person's project. I also would have appreciated a little bit more time spent on writing, and best practices for writing during in class time. ",
            "\u00a0Spending the first semester writing the introduction before we have our results and the story we were trying to develop was not helpful. I essentially created a fake paper to meet the course deadlines, and the process of writing a fake paper took time away from data analysis early on. There should be more flexibility for the students to adapt the paper writing process to their own writing style rather than enforcing deadlines for particular sections at particular times. For instance, I prefer to write my papers in the following order: methods, results, intro, discussion. This course gives no flexibility for different writing approaches. Consider having less deadlines (or making the additional deadlines optional for those who want additional feedback) and more flexibility. \r\n\r\nThe presentations definitely increased my confidence over the course of two semesters. However, I think there were too many presentations. Students who present on research day should not have to do another final presentation. Preparing for all the formal presentations also took time away from data analysis and writing. \r\n\r\nI really enjoyed the peer reviews at the end of the semester, and I think that could be incorporated earlier on. While the feedback from the instructor/TA was always useful, it was nice to have a fresh set of eyes on the paper. Breaking up into small groups with similar data during the analysis stage could be extremely helpful as we could learn analysis techniques from our peers and exchange R code. ",
            "\u00a0This was a good course. Highly relevant for me as a research student. ",
            "\u00a0Many people took the course this semester which made it difficult to get personalized help at times. \r\n\r\nA strength is that feedback was always useful and could be integrated into the projects we were working on. ",
            "\u00a0I think the class is strong in that Mark really does move people toward publication and presentation. That being said, he was WAY too busy this semester (not his own fault--too much of the program fell on him), and didn't have sufficient time for one-on-one meetings about our papers. I think some of the changes he and Danica recommended to my paper were really valuable, but overall, I think the year's schedule was too slow--with drafts due at intervals that were too far apart. I think they should have asked us to produce a new draft every other week, to have a complete first draft by the winter break, and to be reading and providing comments on a rotating classmate's paper on the week we weren't asked to submit our own paper. That kind of model is what is used in undergrad writing courses, and would have both eased the burden on Mark and Danica (to read and provide revisions on 10-15 papers every round!) and also provided us students with more valuable experience reading and reviewing peers' papers and also making sure we were getting meaningful comments on our papers every round, at a fairly constant clip. I also think there was too much emphasis on being presentation-ready (esp. given that half of us were MFs, who weren't allowed to present at F&ES Research Day--even though we'd done research and had full-length research articles in the works), and insufficient emphasis was placed on the paper writing and the crafting of the paper. ",
            "\u00a0This seminar provides a great opportunity for students pursuing research or a capstone project to implement their project and gather feedback through a peer-to-peer learning environment. It provides a great opportunity to develop and refine ones presentation and manuscript. Yet, there was very little structure and too much emphasis on the presentations. Listening to each other present our research over and over again isn't exactly an efficient use of everyone's time or productive. This class could be improved if a larger proportion of class time was spent learning how to write well. I feel that the class was really lacking in providing us concrete skills pertaining to how to write good academic papers. "

            "\u00a0If you are working on a research project, I would highly recommend it. It's really helpful to be in a class with others who are working through the same process and to have a group of people to bounce ideas off of. ",
            "\u00a0This is an excellent class if you have a specific forest related research project that you would like to eventually publish. ",
            "\u00a0Enter your data during the summer and dive immediately into analysis in the fall. ",
            "\u00a0Be ready to have your work challenged. ",

            "\u00a0I recommend a)knowing you want to do research, and have probably already collected your data but need help writing it up--otherwise you have no reason to take this course; b)having at least one, and perhaps several, outside advisors to help you through the process, given how busy Mark is and likely to be until some of the MF burdens are lifted from his plate, and that other advisors will probably give you more specific, detailed feedback on your paper. ",
            "\u00a0If you are pursuing a research-based degree focusing on a topic relating to forest ecology, or want to dive deep into a year-long capstone project your second year, this seminar provides a great forum for you to structure your project. However, don't expect a lot of structure or direct guidance. Pursue the course if you are interested in working relatively independently but having a space to bounce ideas off peers and Dr. Ashton. "
