Oh, dear...\r\n\r\nIn seriousness, through this class I have tasted the first glimmerings of understanding of what's beneath the surface of 241/541-level probability theory. There is still more, so much more, to learn about those below-the-surface things, so much in the analysis and measure theory that I can't say I've grasped well enough this time around. I am encouraged by two former TFs, who claim that their deep understanding of the material comes from having been in the course \"three or four times.\" I hope this isn't my last brush with the material, but I will always be grateful that I was able to start my journey with David and Elena.

            "\u00a0The class is notoriously difficult, and I wouldn't be comfortable claiming that I've absorbed as much of it as I'd have liked. I appreciated the no-exams aspect of it---this is Prof. Pollard's personal preference, rather than a necessary facet of the course itself---which could be argued to put an emphasis on understanding the material, rather than learning to a test. However, on the flip side, I did notice a tendency in myself to prioritize classes that had exams, when it came down to worrying about my grades: I am disappointed in myself for it, but I admit sometimes the incentive just wasn't there as strongly as it was when a letter grade was on the line. The homework assignments were time-consuming and pushed me to really recall what had been taught in lecture: a good thing, to be sure, but undeniably painful. This may all change next year, as David will no longer be teaching the course in his signature style, so I'm not sure what further good my feedback will be. ",

It is too bad for the next generation that David is retiring, and I feel some sadness for the students who will not get to experience him. As for the course itself, I would still very much recommend it for the limits it teaches you to push: how much harder, and how differently, you need to think, if you're not used to it (as I wasn't!). However, I'd recommend an otherwise \"easy\" course load when taking this class. To give it the proper time, it'd be a good idea to have little else on the schedule. ",
