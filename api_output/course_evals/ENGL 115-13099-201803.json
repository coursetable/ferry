            "\u00a0How to create specific claims for an argument, improved conciseness of my writing, take appropriate notes during reading to contribute to discussion. ",
            "\u00a0This course was so interesting! I improved my writing skills, and thoroughly enjoyed the readings! ",
            "\u00a0This course significantly improved my critical reading and writing skills. I am now comfortable with every component of a college-level paper, especially the introduction. I have also developed a greater appreciation for the environmental humanities, despite being a science-oriented student. This course also bolstered my verbal communication skills by pushing me to voice my opinions during peer discussions. After finishing this class, I felt prepared for higher-level coursework in English and Environmental Studies. ",

            "\u00a0There was definitely a lot of reading to go with this course, but it makes sense since it is literature heavy. ",
            "\u00a0This course was wonderful! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: lots of drafts, lots of feedback, manageable amount of reading, and class size makes it easier to stay involved and get to know the professor\r\nWeaknesses: none ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the collaborative, discussion-based nature of the class. Whenever an essay was assigned, the professor would schedule a \"workshop\" and allow students to edit each others' work. My peers, as well as the professor, always provided meaningful feedback on my essay drafts. A typical class consisted of a lengthy conversation about the assigned reading, followed by a Q&A session for the most recent paper. Our discussions were extremely stimulating, and I found myself building friendships with my peers outside of class. Meetings for weekly office hours were helpful and highly individualized. \r\n\r\nOne weakness of this course was the limited commentary on final essay submissions. The first draft would always receive plenty of feedback, while the final copy would contain very few comments. Also, the professor's handwriting was sometimes challenging to decipher. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very interesting readings, wonderful in-class discussions, reasonable expectations, & VERY INDIVIDUALIZED FEEDBACK\r\nWeakness: 2 of the books are a bit difficult to get through and aren't discussed very much, but the other 2 books are very engaging "

            "\u00a0Yes, I thoroughly enjoyed coming to this class and felt that I learned a lot about the world around me in terms of relating capitalism to global warming. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This course was fascinating, and I especially loved the readings! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course because I feel like a much stronger writer after taking this course. It really helped me create a system for writing papers and get to know my strengths and weaknesses when it comes to writing. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This is a great course to take if you are interested in exploring environmental issues and developing your college-level writing skills. The professor is very understanding, passionate, and knowledgable. Although the reading assignments were often burdensome, the work load was generally manageable. Four papers, one weekly reading response, and a few novels with supplementary articles. Grading is never too harsh, and the professor provides meaningful feedback on first drafts. Be sure to participate actively during class. ",
            "\u00a0YES! Katja is wonderful. The class dynamic is great (full of a bunch of tree huggers) and introduces you to a lot of passionate people! It has a good balance between the realistic and idealistic perspectives toward climate change and nature. This was definitely my favorite class this semester. "
