            "\u00a0I learned how to read letters from another time period and how to research and write a term paper. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a ton about America's founding and the debates between Hamilton and Jefferson in the early American republic. This is simply an absolutely fascinating class. Having never written a paper more than around 8 pages at Yale, the 20 page research paper was quite an experience I will not forget, and I loved it! ",
            "\u00a0Learned how to ready primary sources from history, learned about the lives (personal and political) of Hamilton and Jeffersonand came to understand these figures as real people, not just immortal Founding Fathers. ",
            "\u00a0Writing a seminar research paper -- not easy. ",
            "\u00a0Historical research; handling large chunks of text and primary sources; using library resources for research. ",
            "\u00a0This class helped me interact with primary source materials. I learned a huge amount about Hamilton and Jefferson and how to improve my writing. ",
            "\u00a0I learned, as you might expect, a lot about the inner workings of the minds of Hamilton and Jefferson. This course opened me up to their world views, putting their ideas in context with their contemporaries and with their personalities. I learned how to read an 18th-century letter and how to handle primary sources in a research paper. I learned much about the entire period of American history that Hamilton and Jefferson lived through, understanding the country and the world through the lens of their writing. ",
            "\u00a0Gained a lot of insight into the revolutionary era and the focus only on the letters of the two men was an approach that, as far as I know, is unique to this course at Yale. The final paper has a tendency to feel disconnected from the actual course content, but it's a good exercise and Prof. Freeman is quite supportive. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much from this course! The material was fascinating and shed new light on the post-revolutionary period in America, but much more valuable were the critical thinking and writing skills that I gained from this class. Professor Freeman is a master at encouraging students to deepen their initial insights, and she is a great writing coach. "

            "\u00a0This course was wonderful because the readings combined with Professor Freeman created the most passionate environment for this subject. I looked forward to coming to class because I knew we would have intellectually stimulating debates. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: amazing professor, fascinating readings and material, small seminar, great feedback on paper rough draft, paper is extremely satisfying\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: wish professor talked more in seminar (she's the expert!), have not gotten a single grade as of writing this review (no clue how this class is graded - it's just one big 20 page paper) ",
            "\u00a0Great in-class discussions and good amount of freedom to choose final paper topic. No real weaknesses, although it can be difficult to handle the amount of reading assined each week. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are Freeman's line editing of the essay and the seminar discussions.  Weaknesses are that not everyone does all the reading and that there is no real way to enforce it :( ",
            "\u00a0I love the class and all the readings. Professor Freeman knows the material very well and really picks the best readings. Working on the research paper was fun as well. I guess the only complaint, if I had any, would be that since Professor Freeman is such a well-known historian and has just released her new book, she is often not around and has limited amounts of time to meet individually with the students. But even with that, this class is still definitely worth taking. ",
            "\u00a0The course is not easy, a lot of reading. Be sure you are interested in the material before you start. Class is interesting but at times can feel long. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Freeman's passion; the course's emphasis on primary source material, namely letters; the structure of considering different themes each week (rather than just working chronologically); Professor Freeman's deep investment in her students' work and research, and her help throughout the research paper process.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Nothing significant, but there is always the problem in a seminar with a lot of reading that you fail to touch on a good portion of what you read (that feels important) / the difficulty of balancing breadth of material and depth of discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: syllabus is excellent and Prof. Freeman is totally brilliant. There aren't all that many 15-person seminars anymore, which is also a plus. Good cohort of students. Feedback on the rough draft is really helpful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: We only had one written assignment besides the final paper (and rough draft), and Prof. Freeman never returned it. ",
            "\u00a0Really only strengths! Interesting material and great professor. There was a lot of reading, but it was manageable. "

            "\u00a0This is a fantastic course that really delves deep into the minds of Hamilton and Jefferson during the formative years of the United States of America. Professor Freeman is incredibly passionate about this topic which produces a great learning environment. I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in American history or American political philosophy. Also, yes, there are references to Hamilton the musical. ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course to another student because I truly felt like I became smarter and learned a lot from this class, both with material and actual writing skills. Professor Freeman offers to line edit your rough drafts which is something that most professors won't offer. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely - best class I have taken at Yale so far. Professor Freeman is incredibly well-versed in the material and an expert in the era, and her seminars are riveting and entertaining. The readings are always interesting (all primary sources, except for two biographies of the men at the beginning). The paper is daunting, but Professor Freeman's guides you through it all the way! Fair warning though, this paper literally dominated my life for a month, and for about 2 weeks, basically all the work I did for classes was dedicated to this paper, so it's a big undertaking. ",
            "\u00a0Yesvery cool history course that works almost solely with primary sources (reading the letters of Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton). A different experience than I have had in other Yale courses because of this. ",
            "\u00a0Yup.  Do not pass up the opportunity to have your paper line-edited by a world-class historian/writer. Most profs don't do that. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but not if you're seeking a close connection with the professor. Or if you're looking for an easy class (I can't imagine anyone taking this class with that thought). The readings are heavy, there is a 20-page research paper, but it's worth it. I learned so much. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are interested in the topic, it is not just another history seminar it is pretty intense and you will have to do a lot of primary source reading and work but its fun. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this. Professor Freeman's passion is infectious, even if you aren't a huge American history person. This is a great seminar opportunity, to read hundreds of pages of the words of two of the country's \"founding fathers\" -- something you won't do after college. Professor Freeman is one of the best professors I have had, the readings are really interesting, and the research project is rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Definitely. It's a model seminar with a superstar professor that also happens to fulfill the pre-industrial requirement. Come in knowing a bit about the revolutionary era and ready to read a lot of letters and you'll be fine. Be warned that it'll be difficult to get in, though: Prof. Freeman caps the seminars at 15 students and 10 slots are usually taken up by pre-registrants, so either pre-reg or be ready to fight for one of the 5 remaining slots. There were roughly 30 students shopping the first class. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! "
