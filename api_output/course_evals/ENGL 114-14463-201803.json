            "\u00a0This course helped me develop skills that pertain to multiple modes of writing. I also learned how to form an argument, conduct research, and use evidence to express a viewpoint. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write effective research papers and synthesize multiple professional sources and communicate effectively across multiple mediums. I also gained a new perspective on how to approach questions surrounding technology. ",
            "\u00a0I gained very concrete skills in analyzing literary sources and writing papers. The practice I received from four different writing assignments was invaluable and extremely helpful. I also learned a lot about the history of technology, as well as the philosophical basis for understanding technology. More importantly, I learned that technology is mostly whatever we define it to be, and that we should think carefully as a society about what direction we're heading in. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the effects of technology on society and how to read and write more analytically. ",
            "\u00a0As a student with limited prior skills in writing, I took this course to improve my writing skills and learn from other students. I can say that this course has helped me improve my writing, and the readings also exposed me to various aspects of technology I had not previously thought about. This is definitely a course I would recommend. Also, my instructor was amazing! ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to hold a high-level academic conversation in an open environment. This course improved my writing skills and helped me think critically about various situations concerning the ethics and consequences of technological development. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the different views on various different technologies through the ages, especially regarding nuclear technology. ",
            "\u00a0Much better argumentative skills when writing papers, and better peer-editing skills. The course topic (discussing various technologies and their impact on society) proved to be much more interesting than I anticipated, and I feel that my outlook on technology as a whole is much more defined. ",
            "\u00a0Greatly improved ability to plan out arguments and essays. learned techniques to create complex arguments. Very metacognitive. ",
            "\u00a0Through this course, I was able to develop my skills as a writer, transitioning to a college mindset in my papers. I have also been able to learn all of the ways I can reach out to obtain help and resources, with the writing tutors being a prime example. "

            "\u00a0One strength of this course was allowing the students to edit each other's papers. This occurrence greatly helped develop ideas before the final draft was due. ",
            "\u00a0The course deals with interesting material across multiple mediums and is engaging as a result. There arent many apparent weaknesses in the course. ",
            "\u00a0One of the strengths of this course was absolutely the material we read and the discussions we generated. The range of readings was good, with both philosophical essays and more contemporary opinion writing, as well as video and audio pieces. Another strength was the spacing of the writing assignments, with each being apropos of a certain thematic grouping in the course. There were a few weaknesses, such as a few readings that seemed a little out of place - particularly the visit to the Eli Whitney Museum and an inscrutable essay by Heidegger. These could be fixed very easily, however, simply by substituting other readings or activities. There were no structural problems with the course and overall it was very good. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Manageable readings; Occasional movies and TV episodes; Submission of drafts for feedback; Small seminar; Flexible deadlines; My class was interesting and taught well.\r\nWeaknesses: Length requirements for papers; Some readings were dense; There could have been more debate amongst students. ",
            "\u00a0The feedback received on various essay drafts were very helpful. However, he emphasis was more on writing drafts than it was on pointing out what actually makes a good essay. ",
            "\u00a0This course was strong in its seminar conversations and having relatively light homework. The course could be improved by implementing more out-of-classroom collaboration rather than leaving individuals to do work. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very helpful in-class workshops to improve papers, and very thought-provoking discussions that were easy to contribute to due to the small class size. Weaknesses: one or two people mainly took over discussions every time, but that is not necessarily a weakness. ",
            "\u00a0The deadlines were a bit ambitious at first, but revisions of the deadlines solved the issue. ",
            "\u00a0Personally, the flexible assignment schedule was something I greatly benefited from. Although it was sometimes confusing not having set due dates, overall it made my semester much more manageable. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course, without reservations. It was both interesting and enjoyable. The readings were generally well-selected, in a variety of different fields but still grouped by major themes. The writing assignments were well-planned and I received good feedback. Professor Lane was really excellent and a great teacher. ",
