The instructor did an excellent job in incorporating economic data and explaining how the theories discussed fit (or do not fit) the data. The instructor also engaged with students personally. However, the instructor could have brought more emotion into the lectures to improve student engagement during lectures. I believe that many course dropped the course at the beginning of the semester for this reason, and those who stuck with the course gained from all of these advantages. ",
