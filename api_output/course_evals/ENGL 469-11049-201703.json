            "\u00a0Some say writing cant be taught. It can. I think, write, and edit differently because I took this class. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped develop my reporting, writing, and editing skills. Though I had done a fair amount of reporting before, I got to experiencing sourcing a piece over the course of a couple months -- and I had the challenge of compiling all of my research into <3,500 words! This class also involved writing four lengthy critiques of classmates' pieces, which offered the opportunity to practice editing as a serious project (rather than simply a fifteen-minute exercise done in an in-class workshop).\r\n\r\nLastly, I learned a lot about the process of writing by reading a myriad of nonfiction writers and hearing about their experiences. This class was full of small lessons that I've already found to be surprisingly applicable to my everyday work. ",
            "\u00a0Confidence in myself as a writer, reporter, and editor. A better ear, a better eye. A voice. It's hard to over-estimate how intense and productive this semester was. ",
            "\u00a0I really don't know where to start. I had never done journalistic work before this class: I learned how to do it, and perhaps more importantly, I learned that I enjoyed doing it. I learned how to interview people, how to pay enough attention to a scene to be able to write about it afterwards, how to look for details in everyday life that most people would miss. I developed a strong relationship with someone outside of the Yale bubble. I read the work of many different nonfiction writers with wildly differing styles and thought about what I liked and disliked in their writing. I improved my own writing, and I began to take risks with it that I had never considered taking before. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how /not/ to be interesting during interviews and how to strip a piece clean of dangling modifiers. That is, this class has given me a number of tools for the reporting, writing, and revising processes, and the recognition that I can follow through on these processes in a timely fashion. Through the critiques and Canvas comments (and through watching Anne, a master editor, at work during one-on-one conferences), I've strengthened my editing skills as well. ",
            "\u00a0Really, really accelerated the evolution of my writing skills. The difference between the pieces I was capable of producing before this course and after is striking. I'm now both a better writer and a better editor, with an infinitely greater appreciation for writing on the micro-level (word choice, sentence structure, rhythm, flow, etc). The course reading list introduces you to authors whose work can serve as a model for your own writing. This is true for any writing course, but Anne actually encourages you to, by the end of the semester, pinpoint an author whose style most resembles your own (or whose fixations/objectives appeal to you) so that you can consciously look to them as examples moving forward. Anne also helps us address common grammar errors--as she delights in pointing out, everyone makes them, even experienced reporters at the New York Times. \r\n\r\nAnne is also very much concerned with journalistic ethics and the importance of factual accuracy, and we focus on both to an extent that I didn't expect but deeply appreciated. "

            "\u00a0Strengths are that Professor Fadiman wants this to be one of the college classes that changes you. It will be. Your partnership with classmates, writing assignments, and conferences with Anne  inevitably, youll learn from these.\r\n\r\nA weakness is that each class is stretched down to the minute, meaning theres not much slack allowed for debate, extended discussion, etc. Very few silences. ",
            "\u00a0This course is strong because of everyone's consistently high engagement with the material. Anne always came to class extremely well-prepared, and I felt like my classmates did to. People voluntarily chose to edit each other's work on an optional online forum, and the class partnerships made the final project a lot more approachable.\r\n\r\nI'd say the only weakness was that this class has developed a kind of hallowed reputation on campus, which sometimes made it hard to keep each assignment in perspective. This pressure softened throughout the semester though as we developed relationships with Anne and each other. ",
            "\u00a0The course is probably the best-designed class I've ever taken, and the instructor by far the most committed. The students were incredibly interesting and motivated. All of the work was tremendously fruitful. The weaknesses are few, but one is that classes are long and sometimes slow, and sometimes discussion of the reading was less than inspired. But that had more to do with how people were feeling/how much sleep they had gotten than anything else. ",
            "\u00a0This was easily the best writing class I have ever taken. The biggest strength, in my opinion, was the use of Canvas for posting student work communally: this really contributed to a sense of community and allowed us to critique and learn from each other's work. After seeing this system in action, I think it should be an element of every creative writing class at Yale. I also really liked the fact that this course revolved around a single large assignment: I walked away from English 469 having produced something significant, maybe not a magnum opus, but at least something that I had invested a lot of time in and felt proud of. The author visits were also highlights. Talking with Anne was always a pleasure. I cannot think of any weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0The architecture of 469 seems to me pretty perfect. 3 short essays, 1 long essay, 2 revisions. Frequent critiques from genius peers. A stellar reading list (personal faves included Donald Antrim, John McPhee, Hilton Als, and A.N. LeBlanc). The opportunity to ask famous writers a question and receive a thoughtful response. 6-7 in-person conferences with Anne, who is whip-smart and eagle-eyed. Dense discussions regarding the craft of nonfiction: sourcing, ethics, structure, etc. Classmates who are not just great writers but great editors; not just great editors but great people.\r\n\r\nPractically all the bumps in my 469 experience were \"me\"-problems, so to speak. Because everyone is so invested in the course, it can be an emotional ride, especially if you procrastinate, or struggle to detach your self-worth from each assignment. Anne was wonderfully supportive the whole way through, which is such a gift--but if you don't exceed her expectations, you can feel like you're personally disappointing her. I feel like if I had waited one more year to take 469, I might have put even more in, and gotten even more out. All that being said, it was the highlight of my semester. ",
            "\u00a0I can't think of anything that detracts from the course! I will note some of its many strengths: the inordinate amount of attention, care, and time which is given to student work by both Anne and peers; a syllabus which delights in its variety of styles and substances; author visits from writers skilled at both reportage and memoir; a relationship with Roget (a thesaurus worth its weight in gold); grammar lessons for those of us who pick at our sentences fastidiously... ",
            "\u00a0Anne has fine-tuned the course with as stunningly detailed and precise a syllabus as I have ever seen, so there really isn't much room for improvement. The strengths of class are myriad, and well documented in previous evaluations. Anne's one-on-one conferences are both academically and personally fulfilling--you learn a ton from the individualized attention throughout the semester while also getting to know Anne as she gets to know you. Aside from the conferences, the course's emphasis on constructive criticism (you critique and are assigned a critique partner for every assignment, including the big Yellow Pages one) on the both the macro and micro level is fantastic. It pushes you to become a better editor, which after all is half of writing--I've never seen that acknowledged in other Yale writing courses to the extent that it is here, and that's really great. \r\n\r\n469's greatest strength, though, is its practicality. Anne has hit upon several systematic ways to improve the writing of her students, which is reflected in the syllabus's tight and coherent organization. This might seem simple, but experience with past writing courses has shown me that teaching writing in a way that builds on itself can be tricky. You'll come away from this course with a much better sense of your strengths and weaknesses as a writer, particular areas in need of improvement, and numerous strategies to achieve that improvement. Anne isn't teaching you to write better 469 assignments; she's teaching you to write better period, in ways that will benefit you long after your last conference with her. I don't expect to stop learning from this course any time soon. "

            "\u00a0I was told this class would make a better writer, and it did. But it also made me a better editor  a skill that is both as difficult to teach and as full of reward as writing is. No other class offers you this kind of practice (youll be assigned editing partners with each assignment) and mentorship, which youll receive over your conferences with Anne. You sit in her office. She discusses your piece generally. Then you move to her computer, and there, editing turns collaborative and intellectually stimulating and fun. Youll get good at insisting on accuracy; youll start saying things right. \r\n\r\nI say this because I recommend this class to anyone who wants more training in editing or in writing, both of which wind up related anyway. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class! Whether you want to be a writer or a doctor, you will get something out of the process of completing two pieces about yourself and reporting two stories about other places/people!\r\n\r\nENGL 469 is one of a kind in the way that it welcomes each student into a tight-knit community. Anne dedicates many hours to getting to know each student outside of class, and reads each piece you write with intense care. The class also seems to attract a pretty eclectic group, so it's a great way to know other students who care deeply about writing. I met a lot of people through this class that I hope to stay in touch with going forward at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0This is one of the best classes that I've taken at Yale and I would take it again without hesitation. \r\n\r\nENGL 469 has received nearly a decade's-worth of glowing reviews, so I wouldn't be saying anything new were I to write just \"Yes, absolutely take this, even or especially if you are new to journalism. Anne is terrific, the reading list is strong, and the assignments will push you to new places.\" What was also nice is that I learned a lot from the other students who took the course, in part because the class has a weekly workshop, because you are paired with another student to help you develop your final piece, and because Anne encourages students to give feedback on each other's work on Canvas, which brought us closer together. I wouldn't go as far as the reviewer who called Anne's other class, Writing About Oneself, \"basically a secret society,\" but we knew and liked and respected each other and people were generally very supportive.\r\n\r\nBut know that the course is very demanding, and you'd be best served if you took this class during a lighter semester, ideally four credits, especially if you have never reported before. (I hadn't reported before, as had about half the class, and I'd recommend the class all the more for people who are new to journalism.) That's especially important because the final assignment is difficult--a 2500-3500 word profile that discusses three elements: the subject, a person who lives and works in greater New Haven; historical research on the topic, that person's craft; and what approaches a person essay about yourself that relates to the topic. The reporting, draft (due before Thanksgiving) and revision (due after Reading Week) will take up the second half of the course, and you'll want to make sure you aren't juggling too much during the weeks leading up to those deadlines, especially the one before Thanksgiving break.\r\n\r\nAll the hours and work are worth it. As a writer, I grew more from taking this class than I had from taking any other. Go for it! ",
            "\u00a0If you want to learn about writing, if you want to do reporting, if you want to meet a bunch of interesting people and form relationships with them and your instructor, take this class. There's no better way of improving your skills as a journalist, and no better person to learn from. If you get in, take it! ",
            "\u00a0Yes!!! If you get in, you really have to take this - assuming, that is, that you have enough time to commit to it. Because it takes a colossal amount of time: as much time as you are able to put into it, and then a few hours more every week. English 469 is easily the best writing course I have ever taken, in part because Anne is a remarkable teacher, and in part because it succeeds in creating a sense of community more effectively than any other creative writing course I have taken. ",
            "\u00a0If you like writing, apply for 469! I did not at all expect to get in--give yourself the chance to be surprised. Only 2 people in our class are English majors. ",
            "\u00a0I'll add my meager voice to the chorus take the class! You will probably shed some blood (in between writing personal essays; reporting your Yellow Pages piece; writing comments and critiques for classmates; reading Adrian Nicole LeBlanc or Ted Conover or Anne herself and wilting, knowing that you'll never be as immersive or exhausting as they are; reporting more, anyway), working harder for a class you're taking credit/d than any other, but it will be worth it. You'll emerge, knowing the strength (& tensility!) of your writing skills, knowing eleven other brilliant students, and knowing one of Yale's most devoted and kindest professors. ",
            "\u00a0You pretty much have to take it if you're privileged enough to be admitted. I don't need to tell you that this course will improve your writing in ways you can't imagine--plenty of students have already testified to that over the years, years in which Anne has continuously perfected her syllabus. What really makes 469 special, what differentiates it and elevates it above the other excellent writing courses available at Yale, are all the small but significant touches. For example, instead of every student submitting their assignments privately, everything is posted on a public forum so that students see and critique each other's assignments. This allows you to learn from your brilliant peers' work, hone your editing skills, get feedback even on pieces that aren't workshopped in class, and most importantly, get to better know your peers through their writing. Knowing what everyone else is writing about, and why, helps demystify them and thus foster an intimate sense of community. Other examples: we write questions for some of the authors we read, and then elect to send the best one, to which we receive an actual response. We're assigned partners to serve as academic and moral supports throughout the semester-long Yellow Pages piece, rendering the process far less lonely and, again, helping to foster a warm sense of community in a class that one would expect to feel ruthlessly competitive. Then there's Anne's strong recommendation that you take the class Cr/D, which by removing the burden of grades really makes 469 the pure creative writing course experience I've always wanted at Yale but hadn't been able to get before this point. When there's no grade waiting at the end of the tunnel, you throw yourself into writing for writing's sake, which made the whole experience more elemental, and more visceral. \r\n\r\nAnd there's so much more. I don't want to spoil all of the delightful surprises contained within Anne's class (and yes, I somehow managed to be surprised despite having read all the evaluations from previous years). Just take it if you get in, as I can almost guarantee that it will be a highlight of your Yale career. Just a warning: this course is a lot of work. Let me stress that again: this course is a LOT of work. It pretty much consumed my semester. Take the workload seriously before you commit. That might require reorganizing your semester schedule or dropping a class, but I think 469 is well worth it. "
