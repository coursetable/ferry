            "\u00a0Good intro to Immuno, expectations are clear and the information on the slides is useful. ",
            "\u00a0I love the subject of immunology and took an undergraduate course in it, so I came in with high expectations (which were met). The material was rigorous, and went in depth into topics that were briefly mentioned in the undergraduate course. The lecture notes were very detailed and greatly aided my understanding of the material.\r\n\r\nOne thing I wish is for more of an epidemiological application. We mostly covered the biology for the majority of the semester. The only epidemiology covered was after the final exam, during group presentations, and for the final paper. Going forward, some curriculum adjustment would be good. ",
            "\u00a0Immunology is difficult if you do not have any background in it but Professor Krause worked hard to make it as simple as possible ",
            "\u00a0This was a very good comprehensive presentation of basic immunology. My one query however, is where was the epidemiology component. I can think of only a single lecture that presented a clear epidemiological implication of immunology. Nevertheless, I think it was beneficial that this course was heavy in the biological sciences. I do with that slightly more detail was given into molecular mechanisms, but understand that the course is based on a book that does not dig into that type of detail. A complaint that I have is that lectures did little to go beyond the content of the book. Whenever this is the case, it is tempting to simply read the book to obtain the information. However, Dr. Krause did embellish his lectures verbally with experiential information that surpassed the bound of the book. ",
            "\u00a0I knew next to nothing about immunology prior to this course and I can happily say that this is not the case anymore.  I fully enjoyed my time in this class as it was very interesting and informative. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed this course greatly, I have learned so much and thought it was well organized in its content and material ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: learned many basic concepts of how the immune system works, textbook is a good resource for the class\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: absolutely no epidemiology was incorporated into the course, course was very fast\r\n\r\nSuggestions: Either incorporate how we can use immunology for epidemiology, or take out the \"for Epidemiologists\" part of the course name and not make it a requirement for EMD students ",
            "\u00a0Great mix of exams, presentations, and essays. ",
            "\u00a0This course gives a very good overview of immunology. ",
            "\u00a0I thought it was interesting but I wish it weren't a required class for EMD. It was heavily based on the immunology aspect, which I thought would be appealing to those who are interested in medical school but not so for those who aren't. ",
            "\u00a0I love this course. This course gave me a refresh of memory over college immunology, as well as some new insights on how immunology may help public health development. ",
            "\u00a0Tests are pretty fair, based on memorization from the slides. Group projects were fu.\r\n\r\nLectures could be improved so that it is not a read-through of the words on the slides. I did not like having to rush through the material and take the final exam so early, but I appreciated not having a sit-down final during final exam week. ",
            "\u00a0It is a very good course which gives an introduction of immunology. ",
            "\u00a0Overall I thought this was a fantastic course.  It helps provide an in-depth understanding of the body's immune system which perfectly compliments the Principles of Infectious Diseases course taken in the same semester.  This way students understand not just what symptoms/side effects infectious diseases cause but also how the body's immune response causes these symptoms to manifest. "

He is very receptive to students' questions and goes out of his way to dig up additional information and answers to questions that at first he does not have a clear response. Though he can lecture at quite a fast pace, and tends to read off of the slides, he provides intermitted additional insight about each topic that is highly relevant to medicine and public health. ",

You will leave the class knowing a lot, and depending on your concentration, you will see how much your understanding of immunology will enhance whatever you learn. ",
