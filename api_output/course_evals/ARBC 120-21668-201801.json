She kept the class very engaging with interactive activities, invited students from the Arab Students Association to converse with us, and continually contextualized whatever we had learnt with appropriate pieces of news and pop-culture. She really cares a lot about the class, I am very glad I took it with her. ",

Learning with sarab was always fun and felt effective too. ",
