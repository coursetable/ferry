            "\u00a0high level Spanish grammar, worked on all levels of Spanish, but especially written and grammar ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about Spanish grammar and gained a new level of fluency in the language. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely improved speaking in Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0Developed fluency in speaking and a master grasp of all verb conjugations. Also learned very helpful vocabulary. ",
            "\u00a0Spanish L4 teaches you some complex grammar structures and allows you to engage with the Spanish language through readings, films and discussions. It's enjoyable since it is in a small seminar style class, and you all get close to one another because you meet each morning. ",
            "\u00a0Great grammar overview and it helped with vocab and fluidity. ",
            "\u00a0My knowledge of verb tenses, verb moods, and grammar in Spanish greatly improved. I now know all Spanish verb conjugations. Additionally, my vocabulary in Spanish increased. "

            "\u00a0the supersite homework is very finicky. A lot of it is typing sentences using a certain verb form or sentence structure, but even if you get that right, if you have an adjective or preposition different than what they want (even if it is still a logically and grammatically correct sentence) it will count it as incorrect.\r\n\r\nThe best way it could be improved would be to somehow have outside-of-class oral practice. If the Spanish professors had office hours where you could just come in to chat in Spanish, that would go a long way. There doesn't have to be anything planned, but the practice and repetition of new verb forms and grammar is the only way to get better. Spanish classes are in a vacuum because you never really speak Spanish outside of class (this isn't just a Yale thing, this has been a problem throughout my language career). Providing a way to work and practice consistently outside of class would be the best thing Yale could do since that is the real way to make headway in an intensive language course like the L4 languages. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this course was quite strong. I definitely learned a lot of Spanish and felt more fluent by the time the course ended. My one complaint about this course was the cold calling in class. ",
            "\u00a0I really appreciated how the course focused on Central and Southern America (as opposed to Spain) in all the culture and movie sections. The trips to art musuems were very fun and engaging ways to to learn more! ",
            "\u00a0This class is a classic Yale spanish class- extremely regimented, organized and easy to do well in if you put in the daily effort it requires. If you do all the assignments and participate in class, there is no way your spanish won't improve tremendously. ",
            "\u00a0The class is very standard in that you are given quizzes and tests which test you on the readings and grammar concepts. It is very routine. Though a nice thing was the fact that we had to give two presentations throughout the semester, which was a break from the routine. \r\n\r\nAn upside to the class is how language classes are small in a seminar style so that you can practice speaking and can ask many questions. ",
            "\u00a0While the course packet helps in that it contains all of the readings and the syllabus for the course, it would be more helpful to have an up-to-date syllabus on Canvas when the syllabus is updated. "

            "\u00a0If you want to get better at Spanish this will do it. High level grammar and assessments once a week make sure of this. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students who want to work hard at learning Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class. It is very straight forward and your spanish skills will be improved. By the end, you will most likely be conversationally proficient! ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend it if you are at this level of Spanish and want to improve. It is enjoyable because of how much you learn. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Learning grammar can be frustrating process but this was done in about as fun and engaging manner as I can imagine. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to students that want to improve their fluency in the Spanish language, as well as those that just want to fulfill their foreign language requirement. "
