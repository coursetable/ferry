            "\u00a0I definitely gained Matlab skills. Though some other courses that I took used Matlab, I feel like this one really gave me the tools and understanding of how to use it to solve problems, instead of just being a more plug-and-chug tool. ",
            "\u00a0I learned very basic Matlab coding and foundational knowledge of gene expression systems and feedback loops. ",
            "\u00a0I developed an understanding of gene expression and cell signaling networks as well as general kinetics to be able to understand the reaction pathways. Learned about different mechanisms that can result in different outputs of a pathway. Learned how to use MATLAB generally. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think about gene regulation in a way I honestly didn't really know people considered. How to model data according to distributions was an important thing I learned, as well as how to tell whether a system is stable and how to tune it to exhibit certain dynamics. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a greater understanding of kinetics, and learned how to perform basic tasks using MATLAB. ",
            "\u00a0A better understanding of coding in matlab. ",
            "\u00a0Mathematical modeling of biological systems. Feedback and adaptation and control of gene expression.  Really cool subject matter actually. ",
            "\u00a0MATLAB\r\nconceptual understanding of cell dynamics\r\nExcellent TAs! "

            "\u00a0The strength was definitely the use of Matlab and how it can be used to show real world problems and scientific examples. A strength was also how each of the topics tied together nicely into a coherent theme. The only improvement I could think of would be to make the classes a little more engaging. ",
            "\u00a0This course is poorly managed. The topics covered do not flow very well so subject material is often disjointed. At the same time, the professors assume a certain level of knowledge that is not necessarily applicable to all students which makes it difficult for some students to follow all of the material.\r\n\r\nThe TAs were only helpful on Matlab coding which, being only part of the course, is not very useful.\r\n\r\nThe final exam was very unfair. It was a take-home final that was longer than typical problem sets, yet students were given a fraction of the time to complete the final (three days as opposed to 1-2 weeks on a problem set). Additionally, being unable to collaborate on the final made it drastically more difficult than problem sets. Students should either have been given a shorter final or more time if these were the conditions of the exam. ",
            "\u00a0I would liked the professors to have been present during more office hours. For some homeworks, the TAs didn't seem to have a clear grasp of what the questions were asking.\r\n\r\nTAs gave clear answers over email though. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were giving a general knowledge base before going into more depth that was provided later in the course. Also providing relevant examples that connected to the course material covered, including the articles covered in presentations. On the other hand, I am not sure if there was enough help/insight offered with the MATLAB part of the course, definitely struggled with this. At times the lectures were difficult to follow and did not seem to have an outline, which would of helped. The homework/final questions were unclear and difficult to understand sometimes what was being asked. The final was really long and difficult even though there was only a few days given, really struggled with it. ",
            "\u00a0To me, this class would benefit greatly by having some type of textbook associated. There were times I wanted to reference topics or get some background to things I had no familiarity with, and going online can be very difficult to get good information. An introduction to systems biology would definitely help this course. I think I would have understood certain concepts more if I could have done some associated reading. I came into this course with absolutely zero Matlab experience, and I understand this course is not about learning Matlab. I think there could have been some better introduction to the program, however, because it was very difficult for me to struggle through using it. I'm glad the Matlab component was there, as now I am much more comfortable using the program to do extremely basic things, but it was difficult to figure it out. The strength of this class is that it covers extremely important topics that every biologist or scientist should be comfortable with. However, I think the overarching concepts were obscured by a lack of reference material. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a good mix of concepts, MATLAB sessions, and reading seminal papers in systems biology. One improvement would be to integrate the MATLAB sessions more thoroughly throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0more detailed coding instructions. ",
            "\u00a0I thought Thierry's section could be confusing. I wish he'd taken some time to go more slowly through some of the fundamentals and walk through some of the math. I'm rusty at math but not incompetent, and I think that walking through some things that seemed \"trivial\" actually would have helped me get a bit more of a physical intuition. \r\n\r\nI thought Kathryn did a really excellent job being very clear, recapping material at the beginning of each class, and answering questions.  I really enjoyed her teaching. ",
            "\u00a0STRENGTHS\r\nWell designed for students who have no prior experience in MATLAB\r\nLecturers were clear and engaging\r\nNotes posted were extremely helpful\r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES\r\nRecitations would have been more helpful if more structured\r\n- could include practice problems that are similar to HW sets "

            "\u00a0I would. I would recommend it to anyone who will have to code anything, as it is helpful in getting you to think in that manner. It was also good as a math refresher; it has been awhile since I had a course that involved math and equations instead of just science topics, and it was good to see how they can fit and are important in research. ",
            "\u00a0This course is good for students who are already familiar with the concepts presented and with Matlab coding. It is not the best introduction as the title might suggest. ",
            "\u00a0Before I would recommend this course, I think it needs to have more reference material and background about the goals for the lectures or concepts. There were many times I was not sure what the goal of the lecture was. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was a good introduction to MATLAB using topics I was familiar with as a biologist (gene expression, cell signaling). It made it an interesting problem solving venture to get the code to fit with my understanding of biological systems. ",
            "\u00a0most definitely. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah I thought it was interesting material.  Do wish some things had just been explained more thoroughly but definitely super valuable subject matter and I got a lot out of the class. ",
