You'll learn how the Fed works and how monetary policy is general is used to address economic shocks. You'll learn about how economies grow in the long run (e.g. where savings comes into play).

            "\u00a0I think that the lecture slides were sometimes a bit difficult to follow, and at times they had errors in them. Professor Nordhaus is a very nice guy and is clearly very intelligent, but sometimes his lectures seemed disjointed. The TAs were fantastic, though, and were able to clarify mistakes/confusions from lecture. ",

            "\u00a0Nordhaus is a really cool guy with a lot of great stories, but tends to tell those for an hour and a half and then spend ten minutes on the actual class slides (like equations/graphs that actually detail the material). I ended up learning a lot of the material in section, which sometimes was too short to really cover everything. So a bit more emphasis on the actual material during class would be good. Also, I hated the paper substitution for a final quiz - I think it really didn't help me outline any of the concepts, and was something you had to put a lot of effort into without a lot of reward. ",
            "\u00a0Good course, interesting material, bad lectures, psets were rather different than the exams ",
            "\u00a0there was very little guidance leading up to the midterm and final. No practice problems or previous exams along with no formal review sessions for the exams made it tough to know what/how to prepare ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were quite boring. Also it seemed like there was a lot of withholding information from students (like answer keys to practice problems/final) that does not promote learning the material well. ",
            "\u00a0Great guy, very good lecturer. However, he should have provided FAR MORE practice and learning materials for the quizzes, midterm, and final. It's not really fair not to give students any outside resources to practice problems, other than problem sets. ",
            "\u00a0I wish more relevant practice exams were posted, but otherwise a reasonable course. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Nordhaus is a fabulous teacher and made every effort to demonstrate all aspects of the models--especially encouraging questions in class and guiding confused students slowly through the material. The weaknesses included the textbook (which in part used the LM model--one we avoid in the class), which made it a bit harder to study. On the whole, what you might expect a Yale macroeconomics course from a Nobel laureate to be! ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were really, really disorganised, most of the times Prof Nordhaus talked about unnecessary but difficult math equations and rather irrelevant information. Had almost no practice material for the midterm and final (which weighs 50%) and had little idea how to prepare. Problem sets were way too hard, and we couldn't find clear instructions from his lectures. The quizzes were a nice addition. I hope the lectures could be more streamlined, and better-explained for learning. I feel like Professor Nordhaus is more suited teaching a higher-level class, since somethings the most brilliant scholars aren't necessarily the best teachers, especially for this rather introductory/requirement course. ",
            "\u00a0I think some of the beginning Psets were frustrating, for it would ask for things we had not yet learned or had not learned at all. Nordhaus is charismatic, but can sometimes rush over parts that he should spend more time on. ",
            "\u00a0The lecturer is really cool. Nordhaus is awesome.\r\nI wish he went deeper into some topics though, and went faster over some not-so-interesting things (like the lecture on investment was way to long for what is was, I think).\r\nI like the fact that some psets were replaced with quizzes. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Interesting course content, comes together at the end.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Structure of course hard to grasp for much of the semester. Not a lot of opportunities to apply knowledge. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nI really like how the course was structured by topic\r\nTAs were so helpful for psets and understanding the material\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nHard to see the big picture of macro until the very end of the course, but that's not the course's fault ",
            "\u00a0Professor Nordhaus does a good job of connecting the material we're learning and explaining even more challenging concepts well. However, I thought the class could have been better run from an administrative perspective, as I often felt the TA's were not pulling their weight to manage the class. We rarely received grades on canvas, and the schedule of quizzes and psets was changing rather frequently as well. Overall, the class is rather well done considering the material it is covering, but I would appreciate more feedback on my work and more clarity about assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the professor was engaging\r\nweakness: sometimes the lecture slides had incorrect info during class, but professor Nordhaus always edited them ",
            "\u00a0I think one strength is that it is taught by Dr. Nordhaus. A weakness is that the theory is often not well explained in order to devote time in class to explain the derivation of models. I think developing the intuitive understanding is more important than the math because otherwise it would be difficult to follow along with the math. ",
            "\u00a0This course has a lot of potential as far as the content goes, but its execution was very poor. Workload is fairly light- only 4 problem sets and 4 quizzes, a midterm, and the final, but each assignment is a bit time consuming. The material itself is not taught well. William Nordhaus is a great, kind, brilliant man, but I found it very difficult to follow his lectures. Everything is taught in a very theoretical and lofty fashion, so I never really thought i was learned anything substantial. The book is very different from what is taught in lecture and section, so that adds another element of confusion. ",
            "\u00a0I think having alternating psets and quizes was useful because it made sure that students kept up with the material. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n1. bragging rights that you were taught by a Nobel Prize winning economist\r\n2. Nordhaus is a really nice and funny lecturer, I liked the case studies he used in class and how he tried to put macroeconomic concepts in context\r\n3. The final paper was not intended to be part of the class at the start of the semester (Nordhaus won in October and had to go to Sweden in December) but I really enjoyed writing my paper, even though I don't think the class equipped me to undertake any sort of even remotely rigorous analysis. If anything, the paper made me realise how abstracted and inapplicable the models were\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n1. I wish we had gone more in depth into newer models of macroeconomics (mostly the Endogenous growth theory) which may be more relevant to the reality we observe. The most complicated model we learnt was Mundell-Fleming and even that is barely representative of the real world. ",
            "\u00a0For one, the textbook could actually follow what we go over in class. And, the lectures could be much clearer about what we actually need to know vs what is just superfluous \"interesting fact\" type information. I also wish Nordhaus would be less grandiose and theatrical instead of digging into the material; he seemed to talk about popovers more than monetary policy. The course would also greatly benefit from teaching when exactly we should use each of the models we learned. ",
            "\u00a0I thought it was taught about as well as it could have been. ",
            "\u00a0Could be better organized ",
            "\u00a0This course was low key pathetic. There is a clear lack of communication between professor and TAs and between the TAs themselves as they all taught different things. There was never a right answer to problems. For instance- what is the equation for this ... - textbook says one thing, lecture says another thing, TA says another thing. SO WHAT IS THE REAL EQUATION? WHY DO I SPEND HOURS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHICH SOURCE IS INCORRECT?! THIS IS NOT WHAT ANY COLLEGE SHOULD BE LIKE. Another for instance- what happens in this fiscal situation. Three TAs would say three different things. How am I expected to learn. This makes no sense!!!! And the textbook literally contradicts things the lectures say. The lecture slides are poor. I get it he's a noble prize winner but please get rid of the typos and incorrect graphs. The strength was the research paper. I think it really helped me to apply whatever I learned to real topics. The professor should teach the TAs what answer he wants for tests/psets so everyone isn't left off wondering- even the TAs don't know the answers. I mean they tried and I don't blame the TAs. But the course is pathetic. Seriously. A Yale fail. Macroeconomics can be such a real and relevant topic as we saw in our papers. Too bad this course didn't foster this ",
            "\u00a0I think that the mix of problem sets and quizzes in alternating weeks is a good way to get students to engage the material in different ways and to continually review the material. I enjoyed the problems on the problem sets because they allowed us to apply the material and models covered in lecture, i.e. the problem that had us calculate and model data using the Solow model. I think that greater time spent on the finance and banking section would be helpful to better understand the national and global financial system. ",
            "\u00a0While I thoroughly enjoyed the material, Professor Nordhaus often hard a hard time clearly communicating the material. In addition, he provided us with a surprised 5-page research paper in the last few weeks in the semester. ",
            "\u00a0The course material was taught in a way that made me feel confused the entire time. I am walking away from the course with less confidence in Macroeconomics than when I started. ",
            "\u00a0This course covers a lot of Material which is important and interesting in economics. However, it covers the material in a rather unorganized fashion that leaves students quite confused as to the direction of where the course is heading. Its not until after the final do the students understand what they learned and how it all ties together. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course was the TAs. Everything else needed to be improved. ",
            "\u00a0Course mainly goes along with the textbook, but skips quite a bit of the material or adds topics not aligned with the textbook. It became hard to keep track of what was required of us going into exams. ",
            "\u00a0It is well taught; I understood the majority of the information well through lectures and readings, although I though the problem sets were often a bit cumbersome. ",
            "\u00a0This course did not have enough outlets to have my questions answered. Yes, our professor won the Nobel Prize this year. He also had office hours maybe 3 times in the semester, and one of those times he announced them the morning of. TAs tended to respond to questions like, I havent thought about it like that, instead of providing real economic insight. The textbook was another weakness, as it was the same textbook from Intro Macro?? Even though more math was supposed to be incorporated, the math on the slides were often wrong, and we never talked about it much. It would have helped me personally to at least know the mathematical intuition behind somethings but as Mankiws book is intro level and very wishy-washy with the math, as was Professor Nordhaus, I was left even more confused. I also did not get my midterm grade back by the end of term. And I reported an instance of cheating on a quiz which was never addressed by the professor. The class had a confusing set up where none of my issues, whether economics- or administration-related, were ever addressed. ",
            "\u00a0More problem work in class! Class only focuses on theoretical discussions which is valuable, but does very little to prepare you for problem sets and exams. Also Nordhaus please use a microphone, you are soft spoken and it is hard to hear you ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were dry and very rarely connected to the textbook/it was hard to understand the connections. It could be improved by talking about current events or historical events that are relevant to what we are learning. It could also be improved by providing practice problems that are reasonable and actually make us think about the content we are learning rather than just having us robotically generate answers. ",
            "\u00a0We should have had a different classroom -- I often had to sit on the floor in the beginning of the semester but overall lecture was pretty engaging (for an econ required course). Nordhaus does a great job of not going too fast and answering questions in lecture. The no electronics rule was a bit annoying but it helped keep me engaged. I wish they graded every pset question but understand with time that is not possible. The final paper was an anomaly this year b/c of Nordhaus winning the Nobel Prize but I definitely felt like we didn't need that extra work. ",

            "\u00a0The strengths are that the content in the class is clearly tied to the real world in well-explained and understandable ways, meaning it, by and large, feels relevant. One area for improvement is that some of the content could be better explained, especially with regards to how different equations within a model affect one another. ",
            "\u00a0The primary strength of this course is its subject material, which is extremely interesting.  The primary weakness of this course is that there is so much material that students (and TAs) can get lost. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - you need to take this course for an Econ degree, so that you can get a high-paying job on Wall Street (let's not kid ourselves on this). Ahyan was a really good and fair TA, if he's back next year definitely go for him. Weaknesses - oh boy, so many. The problems sets were hard (literally dozens of people would show up for Ahyan's office hours), the professor just mumbled half the time in lecture and spoke very quietly (so going to class was just such a pain), the slides are terrible and you're expected to go beyond them basically by yourself (especially with the stuff on consumption), the textbook totally sucks (sometimes the models you learn in class and the ones that are in the textbook are not even called the same thing, so everything gets muddled up). The quizzes by the way are so hard, many people do badly but then they curve it so it mostly comes out as 8/10 points for a lot of students. Also one of the worst things was the paper we had to write! It was announced super last minute and it was just the worst thing, no one knew what to write about and so many people gave it in like within the hour before it was due because they were struggling.

The weekly sections, office hours, and review sessions were helpful in cementing my understanding of the course. In terms of weaknesses, sometimes the structure of the course wasn't clear, and dates on the schedule for quizzes or problem sets were often changed. ",
            "\u00a0Good and interesting lectures along with a fantastic textbook. Section was also pretty good and the Teaching Assistants seemed pretty available. However, exam review sessions seemed nonexistent, quiz grading and questions were at times unpredictable, lecture material often deviated from the textbook and left gaps in understanding certain topics, and quite a few things in the class seemed disorganized (numerous typos and confusing phrasing and questions in the problem sets, random schedule changes on the syllabus, surprise final paper, etc).

The final is 50% of your grade, which sucks but also is a great grade redeemer if you can get things together and do well on it. ",

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Especially to non-Econ majors (I'm poli sci).\r\nThis course teaches really important concepts about macroeconomics. It's hard to convey how important those concepts are by just listing them, but they really are. You'll learn why protectionist policies are ineffective and why financial flows are primary to trade flows. You'll learn how the Fed works and how monetary policy is general is used to address economic shocks. You'll learn about how economies grow in the long run (e.g. where savings comes into play). I feel like the class could go deeper in some of these topics but it's still a really good class. ",
            "\u00a0Not unless they plan on being Economics majors. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to economics majors. It will teach you much more than intro macro, and you will really know what you are talking about after leaving. Definitely try to attend Ahyan's sections and office hours for more help. ",

I personally learned a lot about monetary and fiscal policy, as well as international finance, which are topics I didn't know much about before ",

            "\u00a0If you're an economics major, the course isn't as bad as many make it sound. I would only take this course if you are highly interested in economics though, as it does get a bit dense at times and you do need to be motivated to learn and understand the material well to perform well on tests and psets.

It gives you a good idea of what's going on in the world, but there is a lot of room for improvement. Definitely wouldn't take this course unless it's a major requirement. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - take it with Nordhaus if you have to take this class. He has been teaching this course was years and knows so much about the subject (he won a nobel prize this year). He also runs the course pretty well, and the lectures are easy to follow. The grading is also fair, and there are no unexpected questions on the midterm or final. ",

Otherwise, if there is any specific aspect of macro that appeals to you (finance, economic growth etc.) then you are probably better off taking a specialized class in that topic. Having said that, this is not a super tough course and is a good opportunity to spend a semester with an economics legend like Nordhaus. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, take it if you need to for the Econ major. It's not a terrible class per se, and if you have a good TF like I was lucky enough to have it can even be enjoyable at times. But at the end of the day, if you're not an econ major you'll walk away with a bunch of forgettable graphs and few transferable skills. ",

            "\u00a0I would really only recommend this class if students have to take it for the economics major. It covers important content for the major, but there are likely other more engaging ways to access the material in other classes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think the material is very pertinent to anyone going into business in terms of gaining an understanding of how the economy flows. However, I recommend you take it when Nordhaus isnt teaching it since he often gets distracted during class causing him to not cover all of the material. Also, he gave us a surprised 5 page paper. ",

            "\u00a0I mean you have to take it at some point, but Professor Nordhaus felt disengaged and there were so many errors in the lecture slides. Given that these slides were the primary study material for exams, it made taking these tests even more anxiety-inducing. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely not. You take this class because you have to. It isnt overly difficult. I was just left incredibly frustrated by the lack of chances to get my questions answered. The class had no Piazza, the TAs were exceedingly unhelpful in answering questions, and the professor was completely inaccessible. So frustrating when you have a conceptual question or need help but are left with no outlet to get that help. ",
            "\u00a0Its a good class, million times better than intermediate micro hell. But that being said, probably don't take it unless you have to ",
            "\u00a0Unfortunately it is a major requirement--but if you don't have to take this course then DON'T it is one of the worst courses I have taken at this school. ",

            "\u00a0Yes.  The material is super engaging, and I actually thought Nordhaus was a pretty decent teacher.  The workload is not crazy, and the exams, while difficult at times, are not unfair in the slightest.  The only problem I had with the course this year was the fact that we had to write an additional final paper because the last week of class was cancelled (apparently Nordhaus was too busy receiving a Nobel prize in Sweden or something like that...). ",
            "\u00a0ONLY TAKE THIS COURSE IF YOU HAVE TO, in order to get your Econ degree and to work on Wall Street and make a ton of money. The material is really a step up from what you would have done in intro micro, it gets very VERY complex (don't let people fool you with their \"oh it was so easy!\" comments) and you're often expected to go beyond what is done in lecture. The textbook was really terrible, it was quite unclear what we had to know from the readings and what was just extra info (I still have no idea if we had to know the information related to say the gold standard and the fed funds rate). The problem sets were a huge pain, people would literally flock in dozens to Ahyan's office hours and review sessions, to the point that we had to move room in Bass to accommodate everyone. Students would literally end up sitting on the floor or standing for like 1-2 hours coz there were just so many people and no space. The quizzes were absolutely awful, very hard and also very difficult to distinguish what grade you would ultimately get. Going to class was so boring, the professor talked very quietly and mumbled a lot and i'd see people falling asleep all the time (btw we're not allowed phones in class, and this is quite strictly enforced). One thing that really annoyed me was the paper that constituted 10% of our grade. It was announced quite last minute into the semester after Professor Nordhaus won the Noble Prize. No one had a clue what to write about for the assignment, and the guidelines were in my opinion extremely unclear and vague. A lot of students I talked with were totally clueless about it, I even saw one guy cry before giving it in. Anyway, if you do HAVE to take this course, I have two pieces of advice: 1) Get Ahyan as your TA: you NEED to get Ahyan, he's the best TA I've ever had for econ. He's so funny (he really is, trust me!!) and so knowledgeable, and without him I would probably have not liked Econ 122 at all. All the smart/most capable students came to his section and to his office hours, because he explained things so well (WAYY better than how things were explained in lecture). 2) Get a good study group: this is so important for this class, especially when it comes to studying and to doing the problem sets. Some Econ 122 students are actually really cool/ambitious and you can also exchange info on finance internships #networking ;p ",
            "\u00a0Macroeconomics is an incredibly useful subject for understanding the world. If you are interested in working in global affairs, public health, or event a field like finance, this subject will help you analyze what motivates governments around the world to enact a certain policy, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Sure, why not. I have no clue what the spring semester version of this class looks like, so it might be preferable. If you are majoring in econ, there is good reason to eventually take such a course. You learn a lot about the world from this class regardless, so maybe it is even an okay option for non-econ students. It won't be too hard nor too easy, but you will get very annoyed at times. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you want to major in economics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely. Take it with Professor Nordhaus if you can (after all, how many chances will you have to take a class with a Nobel laureate). I came out of this class being able to contribute much more meaningfully to discussions and debates surrounding current policies in the news (interest rate hikes, Trumps tariffs, etc) "
