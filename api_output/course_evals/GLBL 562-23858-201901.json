            "\u00a0Tremendous insights into the intersection of technological development, intelligence gathering, and the subsequent political ramifications. ",
            "\u00a0This was my favorite course i've taken at Yale. The professor is fantastic and clearly very invested and knowledgeable about the material taught. I learned how to evaluate intelligence successes and failures and look at intelligence situations critically. I also learned how critical organizational design is to building an effective intelligence agency. Most importantly, I learned some new interest areas for myself and, through the mentoring of the professor in and out of class, built a plan for myself post graduation. "

            "\u00a0Pros- Great professor, engaging content, students brought a lot of personal experiences to the course. Readings were fair.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- Multimedia support throughout the course would have been nice, only seen on the first day. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the subject matter of the class.  Sometimes the readings were posted very last minute or conversations in class took a different turn and so I did not always feel very inclined to spend a lot of time reading. ",
            "\u00a0Progressed linearly through historical cases which could vary from incredible depth to less so due to nature of the subject matter. Some of the more recent events in the field could be explored further. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is the interesting nature of the course material and the professor itself. Nat Raymond is by far my favorite professor at Jackson and clearly cares about his students and his course far beyond the normal lecturer.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness of this course was the lack of prompt, written feedback on the writing I submitted. It would have been nice to have a record of the feedback given and comments on my papers to understand where I could have done better. "

            "\u00a0Yes. The course serves to open your eyes to the sometimes dark underbelly of foreign policy. ",
            "\u00a0Yes if interested in the subject matter.  I got a LOT out of writing the mid-term and the final paper.  The research that I did I think was crucial to my development over the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. The subject matter is incredibly fascinating regardless of level of engagement with that sphere. Understanding the intersection of technology, privacy, and policy will shape how culture and governance evolves moving forward. ",
            "\u00a0I think the class is great to learn different methods of intelligence collection and different decision-making frameworks through case studies of intelligence failures throughout history. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Best course i've taken at Yale. I wish I had discovered Nat Raymond's classes earlier in my tenure at Yale. "
