            "\u00a0I learned how to write creative nonfiction and improve my own writing. I improved my skills of establishing rhythm, pace, and style throughout a work. It also helped me develop my own voice as a writer. I also learned skills like the \"ladder of abstraction,\" \"perhapsing,\" and several other useful literary skills. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a more personalized writing style from examining the techniques of skilled essayists. I grew more comfortable writing about myself, my experiences, and my views. I learned how to skirt certain writing norms while adhering to others to really refine my essays. ",
            "\u00a0This really helped me for writing future op-ed stories and enhanced my journalism techniques. We read from a variety of short essays and novels that showed how one can master using the first person narrative, a type of story we all were told to stray away from in high school. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how I can be more creative with writing essays ",
            "\u00a0This course greatly improved my writing and gave me better insight to my own writing style and areas of interest. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write creative nonfiction essays. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the components to a good non-fiction essay and how to evaluate one. ",
            "\u00a0Read a lot of nice essays, discussed them with intelligent people and tried my hand at writing some too. The craft of personal essays is free form and creative, so I had a lot of fun with that, and wrote some out-of-the-box essays I probably would never have written otherwise. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Strengths-\r\n-Clear focus on literary nonfiction\r\n- A lot of one-on-one help with writing\r\n-Writing workshops are very useful\r\n- Gives students a lot of freedom to be creative with their writing\r\nWeaknesses-\r\n- Honestly, none that I can think of ",
            "\u00a0The reading list was very diverse and instructive, on top of being enjoyable. The small class size facilitated discussion, which was often constructive and insightful,  but at times it felt forced or stagnantlike we were trying to fill the allotted time. Workshopping was incredibly constructive and Professor Jones gave clear and direct feedback, but the expectations weren't always communicated. ",
            "\u00a0I thoroughly enjoyed the structure of the class. There was a draft due one week and then a final essay due the next week. The drafts were given back from our professor with a lot of useful critiques. ",
            "\u00a0I got good feedback on essays ",
            "\u00a0One of the greatest strengths of this class was the clear feedback that students received. It allowed me to really work on my writing and evaluate the underlying patterns in my writing style. I also think class dialogue was really well facilitated -- everyone was engaged and eager to contribute in class. This may be conditional on the professor and class though. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed how much freedom we had in terms of prompts and subject matter. I also really enjoyed many of the readings. ",
            "\u00a0This course allows students to examine the nuts and bolts of good writing through discussions, online and in class. The online discussion board was especially helpful because it made me stop and analyze what techniques gave the essay its strengths and how I could incorporate that into my own writing. Without this kind of space I would end up not doing much except enjoy the piece, so I really liked how we were strongly encouraged to reverse-engineer our favorite essays.\r\nThe one weakness of this course wold be the constantly changing syllabus, but this part was manageable as long as I was able to remind myself of these changes. ",
            "\u00a0Course benefits greatly from being a small seminar. Readings are usually great, and even reading bad essays is insightful. The topics are broad enough to allow scope for creativity without being too vague that anything goes. "

        [
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course. I loved it. It gives a student a lot of room to be creative and to develop their own voice as an author. You also get a lot of clear feedback from both the instructor and peers which is nice. The readings are also very relevant to the course. ",
            "\u00a0I feel neutral about this course--it wasn't the best, and it wasn't horrible. I don't think it necessarily made me a better writer, it just forced me to write tons. It was nice to get feedback and submit each essay twice, and I think Ms. Jones is great. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students interesting in examining various nonfiction essay writing styles and experimenting with their own writing style. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend it. You learn so much about the first person narrative and a lot of introspection about yourself. ",
            "\u00a0Yes it was a very good basic course for learning to better your essay writing. ",
            "\u00a0I would really recommend this course, especially if you're looking for a course that will teach you how to improve your nonfiction writing and let you explore various styles. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I think it really helps develop you as a writer and thinker. ",
            "\u00a0I'd definitely recommend this course to people who are looking for creative freedom in their writing. I assume a lot of courses that aren't ENGL 120 require students to write about a topic so they have the chance to summarize and evaluate information related to the topic of the lecture/ topic, but on the other hand, this course offers the opportunity to write for the sake of writing. It's a great way to look for our unique writerly voice. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. If you are interested in doing creative writing, this is a good class to start with. This is also a good class to take if you want to meet one of your writing requirements but don't want to write a ton of analytical essays. "
