            "\u00a0This course introduced me to a few notable philosophies of morality, and used psychological evidence and studies to examine how they may or may not align with human moral psychology. We looked at concepts such as moral emotion (empathy, disgust), altruism, moral/psychological universals, economics, and in-group behavior, among others, to discuss the psychology behind aspects of the human moral sense. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the very broad approach taken to explore moral psychology. From basic ethics to economic games, every study or concept was very well articulated and interesting. As a Psychology major, I was not exposed to such a teaching methodology prior to the course. It has been a most enriching time - one of the best courses I have taken thus far. ",
            "\u00a0Background on approaches in moral psychology, as well as insight into a few relevant topics/debates (empathy, morality and religion, etc.) "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The seminar format of the course was extremely helpful to dealing with course material. I personally benefited from discussing the big ideas of the course in addition to watching the lectures and reading the material, for it allowed us to see some differing moral perspectives in action. The material itself is incredibly interesting and applicable to daily situations, and it was well-taught by both the professor and the teaching fellow. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed this thoroughly and honestly find it quite hard to find fault with the proceedings. The reading load was heavy, but carefully curated and flawlessly thought through. \r\n\r\nI would've liked slightly more timely feedback regarding the weekly responses, since that was the only mode of feedback we received throughout the 5 week course. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the readings and video conference sections a lot. I felt we had a lot of interesting discussions, though sometimes I found the video lectures a bit disconnected from the rest of the course (not really covered/emphasized). "

        [
            "\u00a0Yes. This course is interesting and widely applicable to daily life. Stay on top of your readings and responses! 5 weeks is a very short time, so work can pile up if you allow it to. Overall, this class is an invaluable forum for discussion about morality that offers a unique blend between philosophical and psychological perspective. You will benefit most from it if you truly give it your all. Take time to reflect on the material, what you think of the different perspectives you read and hear in lectures, and how it can all be applied in your own life and in society as a whole. I would take this course every semester if I could. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It concerns issues that anyone would be concerned about - how to live a 'good' life. The great teaching and facilitation helps tremendously. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It touches on an interesting intersection of psychology and philosophy, focusing on the domain of morality (i.e. there's no way you don't feel strongly about at least one of the topics covered) "
