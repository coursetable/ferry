            "\u00a0I developed a better ability to read carefully and savor poetic language. Between Prof. Wiman and my peers, I also learned a lot about myself and my own convictions relating to faith in light of the poems we read for class. ",
            "\u00a0This class taught me how to combine critical readings of poetry--more than just \"I like this\" or, \"I don't like this\"--with my personal ideas about faith. It was amazing to be able to read and write with an eye on more than just academics, and made me think about the world through this poetry in ways I'll think about probably for the rest of my life. ",
            "\u00a0How to read poetry; how to look at poetry in light of faith-- as a reflection of it, expression of it, revealer of it, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Wiman is an amazing curator of poetry. At first, I was bummed about having to pay for a course packet, but now, after taking the class, I think I'd be willing to pay twice what I was charged for this amazing collection of poetry. I've created relationships with dozens of amazing poets and essayists that will last for years, and I've already started to dive deeper into some of these new favorites!\r\n\r\nThere is a large component of the course that involves writing about poetry, whether in weekly journal assignments or in the final essay. But this is so different from your standard academic writing. Wiman will remind you that we're not supposed to engage with poetry (much less, our world, or our spirituality) with our brain alone, so the written work you do in the class will have a very different flavor than the rest of the essays you produce at Yale.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, you'll learn how to enjoy literature again, how to let your soul and senses experience it, instead of just your mind. In fact, we did entire exercises that revolved simply around listening to poetry and enjoying the sound of it! What a rare and cool experience from a Yale seminar. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course will turn out to have had a lasting, lifelong impact on me. (I know that may sound melodramatic, but I mean it quite seriously.) I can't point to concrete knowledge or skills that I gained from the course, but it has absolutely shown me new ways to engage with poetry and words and meaning, and it has given me new ways to understand my own relationship with my faith and/or lack thereof. It's been really special to spend time sitting deeply and closely with wonderful and varied poetry, along with a small group of smart classmates with fascinating perspectives and such a grounded and unpretentiously brilliant teacher who knows poetry so well. ",
            "\u00a0The ability to read and analyze poetry, exposure to modern voices in poetry about faith, how to blend discussion of poetic technique with discussion of spiritual themes. ",
            "\u00a0Wonderful to have the opportunity to think about faith in a classroom setting with so many people w/ so many faith backgrounds. ",
            "\u00a0I read a lot of new poems and was exposed to many new poets, several of whom I will read more extensively outside of this class. I practiced speaking and writing from a perspective that was both academic and personal, a perspective that no other class at Yale has engaged thus far. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a fantastic exploration of the intersection of poetry and faith. Through the readings, weekly writing assignments, class discussions, and larger assignments, I developed many insights regarding both poetry and faith, which have been quite meaningful for me in a personal sense. I developed a much stronger appreciation for the value and possibilities of poetry, and a more robust understanding of faith. I gained an appreciation for many different forms that faith can take, different ways in which faith may be expressed, and what faith may look like in the modern world. I had the opportunity to learn how to read, approach, and talk and write about poetry. With the final paper, I also had the opportunity to explore new forms of essay writing, and find ways to express ideas more creatively in this form. "

            "\u00a0The course strength is, namely, Professor Wiman. He grounds everything we read in context: the poet's life, the stylistic of formal elements, or the sonic qualities of a particular poem. I also think he perfectly enables great discussion by creating an inviting tone and atmosphere during seminar.\r\n\r\nThe course could be improved by clearer connections between each week's themes and the poems contained within that week's reading. There could also be greater discussion about those themes, themselves, in the abstract. ",
            "\u00a0It has an amazing syllabus and professor. The only weakness is that it can be hard to get used to a class that pushes you in a direction other than purely academic. But if you let yourself go there, it can be amazingly fruitful. ",
            "\u00a0I think the class was a little bit too large-- the size impeded a more fluid and organic class discussion. \r\n\r\nAlso, I would've appreciated if Prof. Wiman sent the journal assignments out earlier so that we could complete them earlier (it was difficult for me to schedule other work when I knew I'd only have two days to write my journal). \r\n\r\nOther than that, this class was truly wonderful. ",
            "\u00a0For anyone jaded and disillusioned by academia (not to mention, by religion), this class is like balm to the wounds. It's so different from the typical Yale class. You'll think deeply, of course, but about things of deeper and more abiding relevance to your inner life than what we study in most courses here. In fact, what Wiman looks for in our writing and our class discussion is deep personal engagement with the poetry.\r\n\r\nThis class has many entry-points; the poetry and discussions represent a wide range of perspectives and experiences. Of course, some of the poems are infused with joy and meaning, but you'll also read poetry that deals with rejection and redefinition of religion, the death of faith, the experience of God's absence, spirituality in light of suffering. There's also a lot of range in terms of the type of assignments given. You'll get to do short presentations on poetry, memorize poems of your choice, submit 400-600-word journal assignments, and write a longer essay merging personal narrative with poem commentaries. So whether you're a hardcore poetry geek, a devout practitioner of a religion, an artist, a philosopher, or none of these things, you can engage with the course material in a wide variety of ways. ",
            "\u00a0Very excellent format. The course reader is fascinating and comprehensive. Class sessions always felt engaged. If anything, more class bonding early in the semester would be great-- partner pair-and-share times, small groups, more introductions. We did a lot of this, which was helpful, but since we get to know each other on a somewhat deep spiritual level, even more community-building would be welcome. ",
            "\u00a0The weekly responses were invaluable. I think most of my learning happened in that space. I wish we'd gotten more feedback on them!\r\n\r\nI honestly was a bit disappointed in the collection of poems in the reader; they often didn't seem to cohere around the stated theme, and sometimes just...weren't that good? (Some were of course breathtaking and I will keep them with me forever)\r\n\r\nI also was sometimes disappointed in the conversation. It often just felt like: \"ok, what poem should we talk about now? What do we think about it? ...Next!\" Rarely were we tugging at each other's ideas, or building something new beyond scattered comments about individual poems. Sometimes we broke out of those patterns (the times when all of us were more prepared and winging it less, incl. our professor), and in those moments it was exciting! ",
            "\u00a0This course has the capacity to be transformative, I think, but it wasn't, quite, for me, although it had extraordinary moments. I think I was often let down by the routine discussions that we had, and felt like they were muddy and not precise enough to be productive, but then was constantly surprised and inspired by the thoughtfulness and insight of projects and questions my classmates came up with when we had more specific assignments (writing questions for a visiting poet, our final projects, etc.) I think this class could have been improved by more structure within the seminar. I also had my most exciting intellectual moments when working on my journal, but we didn't really get any feedback on these journals throughout the semester, and so those moments often felt one-off. Upon reflection, maybe the expectation was that we would come in independently to speak to Professor Wiman to get feedback, but if so, I wish that expectation had been made more clear. ",
            "\u00a0I do not believe that this class should be changed in any way. I believe all aspects of this course would count as strengths. The only thing that ever frustrated me about this course was that we did not have the time to give each poem the attention it deserved. I felt this way on a personal level as I did the weekly readings (I often felt I could've spent a whole week on two or three poems), and also on a class level, given our limited weekly meeting times. However, I am happy to have the beautiful collection of poems contained in the coursepacket now in my possession for future perusing and engagement. I sense that the wealth of poems contained therein may continue to offer new and exciting things for years to come. "

            "\u00a0TAKE THIS CLASS. Professor Wiman is a phenomenal human being with so much wisdom and compassion for others. You need to hear him talk about poetry and guide your own thinking about poems. He shapes this class with so much attention and deliberate planning, so just enjoy the ride. It's a fair amount of work, but it never feels like a pain. Class was always a pleasure. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. It's worth it even if just to read the poems and hear Professor Wiman talk about them. The fact that you can explore things that are personally important to you as well just puts it over the top. ",
            "\u00a0A Yale gem. Don't miss this opportunity. Every week you'll leave class leaving enlightened and rejuvenated. Wiman is a legend-- he's the type of person you just want to listen to for hours (he has personal anecdotes about his friendships with almost all of the poets you'll read). \r\n\r\nJust a weekly reading response (about 650 words), a few recitations (you just memorize poems and say them in class), and a final essay (about 3000 words). Super manageable workload. I took this credit/d but didn't need to. Wiman may seem intimidating at first, but it's really not too hard to do well. \r\n\r\nIf you enjoy reading poetry and you often consider personal issues of faith; if religion impacts your life; even if you're \"spiritual but not religious,\" take this course. It is so refreshing to have a Yale class deal with stuff that actually matters in the grand scheme of our lives. You'll wrestle with pretty provocative ideas that you have a stake in. \r\n\r\nAlso, my classmates were really cool. I think this class is self-selecting for cool people. ",
            "\u00a0In my opinion, this is among the most important and most accessible classes offered at Yale. It will change your life if you let it. \r\n\r\nIf you don't identify as a person of faith, or if you have an unsure/bitter/estranged orientation towards spirituality right now, don't self-disqualify from this course: You will be in good company, and you will find language that encapsulates, honors, and  dare I say it  maybe even comes close to sanctifying your experience. If you do engage with life through a spiritual and/or religious lens, the class will contribute depth, acuity, and important nuance to your understanding. And if you're someone who can't quite see how spiritual or religious (or even creative) practices could have real relevance to a person's life, this class will similarly help you engage with this position in a meaningful way and maybe get an idea of why it is that others sometimes find such practices worthwhile.\r\n\r\nIn other words: Yes, this class is probably for everyone. Whatever your worldview is, Poetry and Faith will re-infuse it with mystery and awe, and give you language you didn't know you needed. It's challenging in the right ways, and you'll also likely find that asking these questions within the \"scaffold\" of poetic language lends your exploration a loose structure of security and groundedness. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This course will allow you to gain an understanding of the current voices in poetry. It helps you discern your own thoughts about the role of written expression in faith. It is a fulfilling, challenging, and empowering course. ",
            "\u00a0It's exciting to think about faith (in a very personal way) in a seminar space. The level of discussion re: the poetry we read was a bit disappointing to mebut I think this is very dependent on the group and could change easily year to year. Wonderful writing opportunities (especially the final essay), but somewhat disappointing discussion. Still, I looked forward to it each week! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to another student wanting to read some good poems with a really smart professor, as well as spend time with questions that are personal as well as \"academic.\" Based on reviews from previous years, I think I went in expecting this class to \"change my life,\" and it didn't do that, exactly, but it did get me to ask new sorts of questions of myself, of my faith, of poetry, of the world. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. If you are fortunate enough to have the opportunity to take this course, I would strongly recommend that you take it. This class is among the very best that I have taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely definitely take this course. And if you take this course, really give it the attention it deserves. The poems we read were moving, challenging, thought-provoking, etc., and I don't think I've ever experienced better classroom discussions. The other students in this course were one of the best parts of it. Professor Wiman is a wonderful discussion leader and encouraged an incredibly thoughtful, intellectually intense, and friendly atmosphere in the classroom. I don't think that I'll forget this class any time soon  it has already influenced and will definitely continue to influence the way that I think about faith. "
