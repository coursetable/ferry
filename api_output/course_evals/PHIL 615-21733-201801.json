            "\u00a0I thoroughly enjoyed the reading and class discussion. I had not read much in Reid prior to the course and this was a terrific introduction to his thought. "

            "\u00a0The reading was very good and Dr. Winkler did a great job of getting us to think about it by looking at it alongside other thinkers in the period and contemporary philosophy. He was also very good at leading discussion. I would like to have gotten more details about what we were discussing a few days before class so I could know what to focus on in the reading. Dr. Winkler sometimes did this, but it would be helpful to have more up front. There was quite a bit of reading and I did not always get to process the sections we discussed in class as fully as I would have wanted. Knowing what to really think about in the reading would have been helpful, even if class discussion occasionally went in other directions. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course was both its depth and its breadth. By focusing on David Hume and his correlate, Thomas Reid, I found their thought increasingly less difficult to navigate. Despite its focus on just two thinkers, the course covered a wide range of philosophical topics. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes! If you are interested in Hume and Reid, this was a great overview of their thought and contributions to philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to any student interested in philosophy or the history of Western thought. "
