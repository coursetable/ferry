            "\u00a0I now have a much better grasp of various streams of theory related to gender, sex, and race, and, broadly speaking, of how they developed over time. I can more adequately name the major thinkers writing on particular topics, and speak with some authority on their basic arguments, conversation partners, and theoretical lineages. I also have a much better sense of how certain topics and questions grow and come to be (ie., how thinkers are not asking their questions, or coming to their insights, out of thin air). \r\n\r\nI also really appreciate the time we took in class to think about various writers' strategies and approaches to research and writing, as well as to talk openly about our own development as scholars. \r\n\r\nIn short, I developed a better sense of the field and its arguments, and I also feel I received a higher degree of professional development than I often have in graduate courses.

            "\u00a0The course offered a good breadth of topics, writers, and time periods. I really appreciate Jill Richards' intentional work to demystify theory and immediately defuse some of the competitive tendencies that can develop in some seminars. Both enabled really good and constructive conversation. The assignments were all very useful/personally productive, and struck just the right balance between challenging and still do-able. (The assignment in which we read through and presented on a journal special issue was particularly useful.) It would have been helpful to have a little less reading toward the end of the semester to allow more time to work on final papers. "
