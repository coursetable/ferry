            "\u00a0More than anything else, this course was helpful in showing me the work that my peers in the major are doing. I don't get to see a ton of other work from the majors, so that really helped my art practice to have a little perspective of where the others are and what they are thinking about. Also, Nic (our TA) was super helpful in giving individualized and specific feedback for every student. ",

            "\u00a0Practice Presenting Skills\r\nPractice Research \r\nProject Development \r\nExtensive Pier Review through presentation of ideas and worshipping  (Somewhat unique to my experience in School of Art) "

            "\u00a0I think there needed to be more strict assessment of attendance as many people often did not show up at all. It felt very lax at times and I don't know if that's the vibe this class was supposed to have. ",
            "\u00a0The course is structured in a presentation-only format. Every class is presentations given by students, and each student presents twice over the course of the class. Because of that, the course is very self-directed in terms of making work. I wish each student could have had more time for individual discussion, and that the other students had been more invested in each others' making processes (though that's not really a weakness of the course itself). ",
            "\u00a0Henk was a great Professor and gave us close attention on our projects. The group discussion also brought up interesting components we may not have thought of on our own. I thought the class format was a strength. ",
            "\u00a0Some Strengths: unique within the courses available, artist's voice being developed, practice in areas listed as skills, Instruction was good. \r\n\r\nWeekness: having an advisor on board at the beginning of the first semester would be useful as much of what an advisor can offer in the way of research guidance is not possible late in the first semester. This may leave the advisor feeling less invested in the process? Also the student may feel less connected to the guidance process if the advisor is unable to understand directions chosen during the research stage? "

            "\u00a0The course is and should be required. \r\n\r\nI think it would be an interesting course as well for any student who wants to develop a project for their art practice. I'm not sure if it is allowed for students outside the major? "
