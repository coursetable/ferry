            "\u00a0It was very interesting to take a course that was centered around a specific clinical issue. Lectures covered a lot of different topics at a broad level, but they all very clearly contributed to my understanding of this issue. I think that this is one of the few classes I have taken where the real-world application of the information I was learning was very clear the entire semester. ",
            "\u00a0The class is fast-paced and pretty comprehensive. By the end of the semester, we had learned about pharmacokinetics and immunology, tissue engineering and electrospinning. Having said that, the class is what you make of it, and you can learn as much or as little as you want. You will learn a lot just from lecture, but can learn infinitely more by looking up interesting terms, something that the professors both stress and encourage. ",
            "\u00a0This class was an amazing approach to various congenital heart defects through mechanobiology and biomedical technology. I learned about CHDs, the response of cells to mechanical stimuli (mainly stresses) and to immuno stimuli. I learned about the structure of heart vessels and their response to these stimuli. I learned about collagen and chemokines and cytokines. I also learned about the advantage of using tissue engineered vascular grafts to help patients with CHDs. So we learned about biodegradable graft materials, graft synthesis techniques, and culturing cells to be seeded onto the graphs. We also learned how to use SimVascular which simulates blood flow in the heart.\r\nThese are just some of the biology concepts we learned in class, but the big takeaway from the class were the general concepts we learned. The class emphasized the \"design\" process and this helped my problem solving skills and helped me to come up with solutions as well as to think about how those solutions could be improved. ",
            "\u00a0A great course considering this was its first year being taught. It covered a vast span of material all centered on congenital heart defects. I learned about nanotechnology, cell growth, fabrication techniques, and essentially, how to design an optimal tissue engineered vascular graft. I also learned how to culture cells and even how to create polymer grafts. ",
            "\u00a0before taking this class, I had no idea what the field of biomedical engineering actually was.  This class provided a really great overview using a specific case study as an example.  /Microbiology "

            "\u00a0A little shorter lecture section at the beginning and a more extended hands-on experience towards the end of the semester ",
            "\u00a0I think that this course was taught very well, despite being a new class. I believe that because it was a new course, there are some organizational/scheduling things that can be improved in the future. For example, we were only given two days between when we learned about the topics of our presentations and giving the presentations. Especially since these were assigned at busy times in the semester, I didn't feel like I had enough time to fully commit to the research and preparation necessary for a presentation like that. In the future, it would be great to give students more of a heads up and a clearer understanding of what the goals of the presentations are. ",
            "\u00a0The class was absolutely fascinating. The lectures were entertaining and informative. The assignments were also, for the most part, both fun and intellectually stimulating. I just wish that the course were more structured and a little bit more organized. Especially towards the end of the semester, it was not easy to understand what was expected of us. I also wish that we had spent more time in the lab doing hands-on experiments. The class was great, however, and I would recommend it to anyone looking to have a good time and learn a lot about an exciting field. ",
            "\u00a0I think there could be more of a focus on the project portion and trying to really create something. There could also be a little more feedback from the professors in performance, focusing on how you can improve. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nEngaging \r\nWhat you learn feels meaningful\r\nEverything you learn builds on each other\r\nThe professors are amazing! \r\nWeaknesses:\r\nDisorganized sometimes ",
            "\u00a0The class was structured really well introducing us to the structure of the heart, and how congenital heart defects could affect that structure. The following weeks were lectures that helped us to think about ways we could use tissue engineered vascular grafts as a solution to these CHDs which really fascinating. We were welcomed to ask many questions so that class was also a conversation and not just a lecture. This also helped the students to be more comfortable with asking important questions to help clarify a concept. \r\nThe only weakness I can think of is that I wish we had a little more time for the hands-on part of class, rather than just 3 days. ",
            "\u00a0Covered a broad range of topic at a reasonable level of depth. The lectures were some of the most engaging and novel I have had in the engineering department. Great class. The course was a little disorganized at times, with homeworks being assigned later than expected. The final project at the end of the course was interesting but a little repetitive between the two iterations of presentations. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: I feel the class provided a good balance between broad overview and details, since we focused on many aspects of a particular case study\r\n\r\nweaknesses: the class did not deliver as promised, enough lab time to complete meaningful experiments.  I understand that timing is an issue with any new class and the instructors seem to be aware of this and working to fix it for the future. "

            "\u00a0This class is a great introduction to tissue engineering and vascular grafts. The material is fascinating, Humphrey and Siefert are great lecturers, and the small class size makes for good discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is a well-taught, interesting course. You will not be disappointed. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, interesting to dive into a topic you knew nothing about and feel knowledgeable about it after the course having applied some of the material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Take this course! It is the best STEM course I have taken so far at Yale. The whole class is centered around a problem and you spend the whole semester learning about how you could go about solving it. You learn so much in this course and because there is a hands on part , what you are learning actually means something to you. The professors are also amazing and really passionate about the topic. I will say that because this was the first time the course was offered there was some disorganization. For example, we did not go into actually trying to solve the problem as much as I thought. But if you are considering this course... take it! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to any engineer. The class goes through a lot of biology concepts but in a clear manner. It also helps you develop skills applicable to engineers as well as everyday life. We learned how to use Google Scholar and PubMed to find scientific articles. We learned about the different types of experiments, how to design an experiment, how to run a simulation, how to perform linear regression, and how to culture cells. Some more generals skills I learned and developed were how to problem-solve, how to create/design something, and how to present.\r\nA student with little or no engineering background would enjoy this class as well. It might be a little tough in the beginning, but questions were welcomed by professors co-teaching the class, and they were very eager to teach and help.\r\nThe class has various easy and interesting homework assignments. The midterm and final were a great way to bring together concepts that were taught in class. And the final project was extremely fun to do. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course is fascinating and very interdisciplinary. I'm a MechE and learned a ton about the immune response of the body and the integration of nanoparticles in medicine along with responses to mechanical stimuli. Professors Humphrey and Siefert are both excellent as well! ",
            "\u00a0yes! this is a great course to take especially as a freshman or sophomore if you are interested in learning more about the field of biomedical engineering.  it's intellectually accessible to non-majors, and very interesting as well "
