            "\u00a0Besides the basic electronics background developed in EENG 200, we gained many new skills. This was the first time I coded in Arduino or used Arduino hardware. Further, I was introduced to concepts of control strategies and feedback systems on an interesting and exciting platform. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about feedback control systems, laplace transforms, and circuits. ",

            "\u00a0In taking this course, I gained a much better sense of how to build controllers and control systems, using motors, the Arduino, and other peripheral components. This course did a great job in outlining both the theory and the practice of control systems, through lecture and the labs, respectively. ",
            "\u00a0Insight into the cross between mechanical, electrical and software systems and how they can be confimed to form a fully functioning mechatronic system. ",
            "\u00a0This class chiefly provides experience with Arduino and utilizing electronic components to accomplish mechanical things (motors, sensors). We also get an introduction to systems theory as well as systems control but without explicitly focusing on this for the whole semester it is hard to grasp onto ",

            "\u00a0The strengths are that the lectures were very informative, and the labs really helped us confirm what we had learned in lecture. The weaknesses are that a lot of previous knowledge is needed, and sometimes things were not fully explained in class. ",
            "\u00a0This was an excellent course overall, perhaps one thing that could be implemented would be more practice for the homework using things such as Matlab. We practiced often in Arduino during the labs but we had one homework assignment in Matlab and I feel as if we did not fully go over the useful techniques of Matlab coding. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were really great, but the labs were a little too simple. That's not to say that the labs were easy, but it would have been nice if we had actually had labs on control systems instead of on other random stuff. ",
            "\u00a0I can only say good things about this course, I genuinely was interested in the topic, and that is mainly thanks to our Prof. Madhu and our amazing TAs Khoi and Ali ",
            "\u00a0This class had a heavier workload than most other engineering classes, but the professor and TAs made sure that the work was still manageable. I enjoyed how the labs were extremely helpful in helping us prepare for the final project. ",
            "\u00a0Both the lab and lecture are interesting, but it's hard to keep up with the lecture material due to the lack of regular problem sets. I'd be weary of increasing the workload of the class, but it did seem to be an issue ",
            "\u00a0Good labs, but the theoretical stuff in class was sometimes hard to connect to real applications. ",
            "\u00a0This course does a very good job at teaching towards the final project, which is to build a system that can track a light source. Therefore, while the labs aim to teach general concepts, such as programming in assembly code, building circuits, and operating the Arduino system, it does so through the lens of the final project. While this does make the final project easier and offer greater potential to exceed expectations, it does limit the overall possibilities of the labs themselves. The lecture does not follow the same approach, and is therefore more general. However, this could lead to concepts being covered in lecture that are never touched in practice, thus leaving for holes in practical knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0Some lectures are really boring and unnecessary while others are fantastic. Otherwise, this course is extremely well organized, taught, and helped by some truly amazing and patient TA's. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this was a great course, though I wish there was more time to better understand the topics. In the latter portion of the semester, some of the circuit theory was difficult to comprehend, especially because it was so abstract. I did appreciate however that the professor tried to highlight the significance of why we were delving into a complicated derivation. I also wished we had more time to work on the final project as it seemed like a quick turnaround from the last lab, especially considering the project was to be completed at the beginning of Reading Week. ",
            "\u00a0The class is very interesting, but is largely focused on a lab attached. The coursework in class and the lab work are largely separated, and dont have too much to do with one another except in optional ways. Furthermore, the overall grading was very ambiguous. There were tons of extra credit stuff but the class was curved as a whole so it wasnt really optional. People ended the class with a 95 and had a B+, but there was no indication that this would be the case until it was done. Seems pretty absurd and unfair ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was very well balanced, the pace was pretty consistent, the lectures were mostly useful, and the quizzes were very fair ",
            "\u00a0Very organized. very good notes, very helpful TAs. Labs that actually teach us something and we can actually apply the knowledge to the final project. Our feedback actually mattered in this class. This is my favorite course and I am not even MechE ( I am an EE major). "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0If Madhu is teaching and you are taking the class because it's required, not because you care, you probably don't need to go to class except for the day before each quiz and the quiz days themselves. Read up before lab and you'll be fine. There was a strong disconnect between lab work and class work. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, I think every engineer should take this course. While a MENG course, the topics we learn are applicable to EE, CS, and even biomedical engineering based on what the final project is. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to another student because we literally got to build a robot that simulated tracking the sun. It was one of the coolest things I've done at Yale. The only draw back is that this class is both a lab and lecture (and only 1 credit) so it can be very time consuming. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in control systems. This course provides a nice introduction to many fundamental topics in control technology, and is really fun as well! ",
            "\u00a0For sure. For both Electricla engineering and mechanical students alike! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any engineering major who wants to learn the basics of circuit design and implementation. ",
            "\u00a0I think the class needs to be reworked a little bit. Particularly because it's difficult to keep up with the lecture material. It has a lot of potential though ",
            "\u00a0If you are taking this course for the Mechanical Engineering degree, I would absolutely recommend it. It is a great way to integrate practice of mechanical engineering theory with practical implementation, especially with more advanced work like building circuits and systems, and programming new devices. Overall, I think that if you want to get more engineering experience, this is a class that can do that well. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! My favorite class at Yale and I'm not even a MechE major. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to any engineer at yale. I'ts been one of my favorite courses I've ever taken and I wish I could take it again. ",
            "\u00a0This is the class that lets you put together your knowledge of dynamics, electronics, and programming to build a cool device. Would definitely recommend if you like making things! ",
            "\u00a0Not unless you have to do it. The grading was ridiculous ",
            "\u00a0If you're taking it, it's because you have to. But with that being said, it's a pretty good class, way better than everyone said it would be. Definitely a lot of work, so pony up. But super rewarding when you plug in that final project and everything works. Also, have a lab partner. I didn't have one and it made my life a living hell. ",
            "\u00a0PLEASE TAKE THIS COURSE IF YOU ARE EE OR MECHE. Loved it, so organized, learn so much, actually cool final projects and labs, and a professor that actually cares for his students and appreciates feedback. Couldn't have asked for a better course "
