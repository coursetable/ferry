            "\u00a0A practical and theoretical understanding to the various jobs and duties that can fall under the wide umbrella of dramaturgy. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about Dramaturgy and theater. I developed my writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0This class first explains the role of the dramaturg in a more specific way, defining how it is more than just someone who does historic research. The course, in the following weeks, uses devising, performing, research, writing, and other activities to explore the multi-faceted role of the dramaturg. ",
            "\u00a0I learned: what dramaturgy is, what dramaturgs do, who dramaturgy is for, why dramaturgy exists, and finally, how to be a dramaturg. Considering my idea of what a dramaturg is, like most everyone else, was pretty hazy, I have left the class not just confident in the theatrical importance of the practice, but also confident that I could step into the role of dramaturg in the future. ",
            "\u00a0What is dramaturgy? And then exploring this topic through a survey of plays, theater theory, and even Aristotle! ",
            "\u00a0We learned a lot of extremely useful, specific tools for writing in different disciplines while working on our case books. We also got to look at very interesting plays and other readings in areas that we were not familiar with, and Lynda brought in a lot of very experienced and well-spoken professionals to talk about aspects of theater and dramaturgy in the real world that we had mostly never though of before. Overall, everything we learned in the class was pretty new information that I hadn't encountered before ",
            "\u00a0Coming in as a theater-lover who had many preconceptions, misconceptions, and general ignorance about dramaturgy, this was a phenomenal introduction to the wide array of topics and tasks that the work of dramaturgy covers. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: CLEAR feedback on all written assignements, the students were actually able to apply their skills in real-world applications including partnerships with a musical concert, all of the guest speakers/lecturers, and of course--Lynda Paul herself. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Heavy workload and it often times felt like an egregious amount of readings assigned each week. The printing of each weeks reading or the purchase of a course packet can be expensive and make the course feel partially cost-prohibitive as these issues were not brought up in the initial class. ",
            "\u00a0This course was good. It would be really interesting to read more of the famous plays rather than new works. Since they're so well known, it would be cool to dive into the analysis as we have heard so much about them for so long. \r\n\r\nLynda is also a pretty harsh grader.\r\n\r\nThe class was very long. It would be better is it could be pushed earlier in the day. ",
            "\u00a0The class is very well-put together, and in several weeks is able to cover a lot of material, looking at plays from the Greeks to the present in many exciting and interesting ways. The best way to learn is to do it, so this class in many ways asks you to do things--to devise a piece, to read something out loud, to put together a presentation, to do a bit of research and share it, to pretend to be the playwright--as a way of learning first-hand about how we work with and interact with a play. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Awesome class, and lots of product for what you put in. Weakness: There's a bit of work -- but! It's very worth it and was not something I dreaded doing. ",
            "\u00a0Really excellent course; the three hour block is sometimes rough. ",
            "\u00a0My only feedback would be about the class period. Instead of once a week for 3 hours, a different format with a shorter class time could be employed, as the class requires a lot of attention and energy and it is hard to maintain such a rigorous engagement for 3 hours straight. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - we were exposed to learning in so many different ways - through in class exercises, challenging assignments (but with clear expectations and clear feedback), meeting with professionals in the field, interesting readings... The classes were always super well structured and engaging. At times I felt like I was not only learning, but learning how to teach. "

            "\u00a0Yes. This course is wonderful. It is a difficult course and you will work hard in the course to complete all of the assignments on time, but even when under stress, Lynda makes sure her students see the reasons why every assignment was assigned. And it becomes much more fulfilling to work on an essay when you see the practical applications of your writing it ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The course is very interesting. There is sometimes a lull, but overall a quality class. ",
            "\u00a0The skills acquired in this class are so useful and important. Anyone interested in writing, creating, theater, storytelling, etc. should take this class, as the material applies not only to dramatic work but to so many other fields and walks of life. It leaves an impact that brings itself everywhere, even to the movie theater, when you're asking yourself about the structure of the movie, for example. ",
            "\u00a0Any student interested in writing, directing, acting, or all of the above should take this course. Yale encourages multi-hyphenates, so become one! ",
            "\u00a0I'd definitely recommend. It should be a required course for all Theater Studies majors. ",
            "\u00a0Yesyesyesyesyes Lynda Paul is amazing and she gives such good feedback on your writing -- I really felt like my writing improved throughout the semester as I went through this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This is a highlight Yale College course; Lynda is truly the best. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if they are interested in theater and want to learn more about the whole process of theater-making. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - but be committed to doing a lot of work! "
