            "\u00a0I developed my skills in writing long-form journalism pieces that relate to complex environmental and social issues.  This course helped me to analyse the writing techniques that journalists use in writing long-form narrative pieces. One important insight from this course is just to start writing. If you don't like the eventual tone of a piece, you can go back and edit it. ",
            "\u00a0Ive never taken a writing course like this before. It was great to get so much feedback on my piece through both Stephanies feedback and that of my classmates. "

            "\u00a0It surpassed my expectations. I am leaving this class with a written piece of my own work that I am extremely proud of and excited to get out into the world and I have read and learned so much, both personally and academically, along the way. ",
            "\u00a0This class aligned very well with my expectations for the course as outlined in the syllabus.  I knew I was going to enjoy this class but it surprised me how much I loved it - it was a great group of students and teachers.  In addition to my own writing, it was great to hear about everyone else's stories and see how they developed. ",

            "\u00a0There were so many strengths: Stephanie is an incredible professor and her work has been so valuable to my learning experience. The readings she picked were extremely thoughtful and provocative. The structure of the class and the small class size were essential to my positive learning experience. Since there were only 7 of us in class, we each had a lot of opportunities to workshop our pieces as a group and learn from each other. It was incredible to hear what everyone else was writing about and be invested in everyone's stories. Also, we got a lot of experience doing group editing, brainstorming, and restructuring. Stephanie also always gave amazing feedback to the drafts that we submitted that helped improve my writing for the future. The class was occasionally disorganized, but could be easily solved with time and perhaps a TF to help Stephanie keep everything in order. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength of this course is Stephanie as a teacher - she creates a really welcoming class environment, gives good advice and selected great writing for us to read.  It would actually be good to read some of Stephanie's work in class and hear her discuss why she made the choices she made. I would recommend keeping this class small so that everyone can workshop the pieces together. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Small class size, so much feedback on our pieces, instructor was amazing, reading assignments were really interesting, flexibility in structuring/using class time.\r\nI dont have much in the way of weaknesses or ways to improve. "

            "\u00a0Take this course if you want to learn how to think about writing environmental stories with a narrative.  Also don't worry if your story isn't a classic \"environmental\" story - there was a wide range of topics in the class and they all related to environmental and social complexity. ",
            "\u00a0Take it!!! You will improve immensely as a writer, and learn so much from your classmates and Stephanie. "
