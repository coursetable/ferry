But course is poorly organized, class is not engaging, we barely learnt anything beyond L1, and we are constantly unaware of our grades or where we stand in class. We barely get any feedback on how we are doing in class, and class material is almost never returned. ",
            "\u00a0The professors brought in a diverse repository of knowledge about everything Indonesian, and always made it a point to make lessons interesting. However, I personally feel like the learning curve could be steeper and perhaps more grammar/ vocabulary introduced! Having more tests along the way might be helpful too. "
