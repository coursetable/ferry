            "\u00a0Similar to other language courses at Yale, I have expanded my ability to communicate outside of English. We also learned more about the culture of Indonesia, as well as other pressing issues within the country. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the interesting cultural dynamic within Indonesia. It is a very complex nation full of complex ethnicities and complex relationships within and between those ethnicities. There is no media attention about southeast asia and it is not taught in American universities besides in a military historical lens. I think there is a lot that can be learned from studying Indonesia in depth. I learned not about the religious plurality of Indonesia, instead I learned how that affects the people, the politics, and the minorities. I learned about the interesting dynamic between Sultan and President and Bu fostered individual growth. "

            "\u00a0Bu is a great teacher and cares about her students more than I have ever experienced at Yale. She gives us all opportunities to succeed. The only weakness is that sometimes students can get away with slacking. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to learn then you can and will learn. Its an amazing setting and an even better professor. I would love to meet more than just once a week. Maybe the independent research project could be more involved? Maybe we could do a poster presentation? "

            "\u00a0Absolutely. Learned a lot off of L4 knowledge and feel much more comfortable with the language now. ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely if you are interested in southeast Asia and immersing yourself in a language and a world that is different from your own. If you don;t put any time or energy into the course then you will only fail yourself. It is a gift and privilege to learn from Bu not a throw away class. "
