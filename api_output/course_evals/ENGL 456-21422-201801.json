            "\u00a0This course was truly wonderful. I learned so much about the interesting, thorny, centuries-old (delightful) dilemma that is literary translation. I learned a lot about poetry generally, that hard-to-teach art. I learned to read and write differently. It was such a pleasure to finally have a classroom in which literature was considered sensually as well as analytically. And a pleasure to do both intellectual and creative work together, inseparably and in tandem. ",
            "\u00a0This class developed a lot of skills and knowledge for me:\r\n1) Knowledge of theory of translation, especially Romantic German and modern American theory\r\n2) Familiarity with sacred texts, such as the Bible and the Quran\r\n3) Workshop skills\r\n4) And above all, literary translation skills. Incredibly improved. ",
            "\u00a0You learn to listen to a text's breath, to assess what distinguishes a live sparrow from a dead one, to discover how earlier translators dealt with questions of foreignness. Your close reading, criticism, and writing improves on a weekly basis. ",
            "\u00a0A strong understanding of translation in history and a diversity of approaches to the craft/art--very useful for the practice of writing in general. ",
            "\u00a0This course was one of the most comprehensive and demanding I've taken at Yale  a study of translation that called on all of the skills I've built up as a critical thinker, reader, and writer over the past few years. Profs. Cole and Creswell were spectacular, giving us a deep dive into translation theory and history while simultaneously building one of the closest things I've had to a community around the seminar table. And to make sure that we were always approaching the subject material from new angles, they gave us a dizzying constellation of assignments: from close analyses of individual translations to brief exercises in different translation methods to the final project itself, which was one of the more rewarding assignments I've ever done for a class. I couldn't have asked for a better seminar experience, or better professors to guide me through this material. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: Classmates, QUALITY OF WORKSHOP FEEDBACK PROVIDED BY THE TA AND THE PROFESSORS, syllabus, discussion, assignments, everything.\r\nWeaknesses: None. ",
            "\u00a0This is the most inspiring course I've taken at Yale since Directed Studies. I am so grateful for Prof. Cole's (and Prof. Creswell's) guidance, the high engagement and intelligence of the students, the organic dialogue between literary criticism and poetic craft. Weaknesses are out of the question here. ",
            "\u00a0The format and flow of the course were phenomenal. The discussions were the most productive I've ever had at Yale. No substantive criticisms. ",
            "\u00a0I honestly can't think of any major weaknesses, but the strengths of this class are legion  consistent, detailed, and thoughtful feedback; a passionate and truly friendly group of students who give productive criticism; professors who approach the material with rigor and a sense of humor; an atmosphere that feels collaborative rather than competitive; and so, so many opportunities for outside-of-class enrichment, from CompLit talks to the Journal of Literary Translation, that I would never have known about were it not for this course. This course isn't legendary for nothing. "

            "\u00a0Wonderful wonderful course. It will open your eyes to a whole new realm of reading and writing. Totally change your perspective. This one's for the language-nerd-poet hybrids. You'll find your people. Highly recommend. ",
            "\u00a0This is a must-take class. The Professors had a knack of picking students that gave amazing writing feedback-way better than any other creative writing class I've been in. On top of that Prof. Creswell and Cole are always open to meet and help you really elevate your translation skills. I learned an incredible amount about translation theory, practice, history, and some of the world's most important texts. The assignments were fun. The reading was heavy. Take take take. ",
            "\u00a0Have you ever wondered what it might feel like to have your favorite author's ghost enter your body through the ribs and throat? To work with one of the best poets of our time as you craft a translation that has a distinct voice in English? Do yourself a huge favor. Take this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! All writers and lovers of language should take this course--the skills and readings are invaluable in application to any kind of work in art or humanities. ",
            "\u00a0YES.The professors will kick your ass from time to time, the start of the semester especially will be quite demanding, and actually putting together a translation is hard, hard work  but it's the kind of work that you'll love doing if you put your heart into it. And oh my god does it ever pay off. I've grown so much as a writer, as a student of literature, and as a person through taking this class; if you get in, you'd be doing yourself a disservice to pass this opportunity up. "
