            "\u00a0Lots of quantitative information. Very useful course for Engineers. ",
            "\u00a0Learned how water is treated in drinking water and waste water treatment plants. Learned specifically about coagulation, disinfection, aerobic and anaerobic treatments, and much more. Learned how to set up and solve mass transfer problems for several different reactor types. ",
            "\u00a0I feel like I have much deeper understanding of water treatment as a whole and the scene behind it. ",
            "\u00a0I became very familiar with mass balance techniques that heightened my understanding of quantitative problems in this and other required courses for ENVE. The course walks you through an entire water and waste water treatment plant and teaches you to mathematically represent the processes that allow us to remove organic matter and pathogens from source and waste waters. ",
            "\u00a0I got a great overview of water treatment systems building on what Id learned in past courses. Great broad overview as well as introduction to the math behind it all. ",
            "\u00a0The process of water treatment until distribution. Knowledge of the current technology being developed to clean water. Knowledge about the kind of research that is being conducted at Yale on water treatment "

            "\u00a0I struggled at the beginning with the conceptual information. It seemed like lots of math with nothing to attach it to. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Kim is a wonderful lecturer and the best part of this class. He's an extremely approachable and helpful professor and seems to really enjoy teaching his students. The mini-lectures on more applicable topics were extremely interesting and a great way to keep the class engaging ",
            "\u00a0The course is well taught, and gives ample opportunities for questions, review sessions, and meetings with the instructor. ",
            "\u00a0I this overall this is a wonderful course, Professor Kim does a great job of focusing on the math while also discussing why its all relevant. I have no complaints. ",
            "\u00a0This course was one of the best engineering classes I ever taken at Yale. It was well taught and very well organized. In addition to the class material, Professor Jaehong also shared a little bit about his research and really made want to learn more in-depht about water treatment ",
            "\u00a0Over all this course was very strong. Professor Kim was a great teacher and very effectively explained the material to us. the material was interesting and very applicable. The only change that I would make is to bring in more of the significance and application throughout the class. In the beginning we learned about all the water purification processes then through out the class we learned how to perform each step, but sometimes that reasoning could be forgotten, and it just felt like tedious work. I believe that if the examples were constantly brought back in each section then the class could have been a bit more enjoyable. "

            "\u00a0Yes! The professor is amazing and very good at explaining the concepts clearly, and it was a very enjoyable course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course as an elective to any engineering students. It is useful knowledge and Professor Kim makes the class very fun and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this has definitely been my favorite STEM course I have taken at Yale so far. ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely. If you are en engineering major and looking for an elective. I would definetely recommend checking this out. You walk out with a solid understanding of how water treatment works and the class is so well organized too. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this class. It is a great engineering elective for any type of engineer. The material is very interesting and challenging but not extremely difficult, and professor Kim is great! "
