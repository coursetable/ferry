Also the more hands off approach of the instructors helped me in my problem solving as I had to be able to find solutions if I made mistakes, but also knew that I would have assistance if I needed it.

            "\u00a0Some of the writing/reports was really tedious and just wasted time. Grading was also arbitrary, especially in post-labs: points taken off for not answering questions that weren't even asked. Actual lab time was a good experience. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course can be improved by giving it a little more relevance. While I enjoyed synthesizing materials, by the end of it, I still didn't really understand why we were doing it. I think better explaining the relevance of such experiments would improve the class. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Predictability--every week is the same even if the lab exercise might change. Do the EP, do the readings and do the lab. \r\n\r\nWeakness: None I can think of! ",

            "\u00a0I loved the labs and the atmosphere as well as the level of work. I wish some of the labs would have more concrete outputs; for example, creating luminol could be fun! Making a banana fragrance and making Tylenol were both great labs. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course is by far the best lab course at Yale. It is very straightforward, and this allowed me to learn more, because new ideas were introduced with a consistent format and framework. Not having quizzes etc. meant it wasn't stressful, but the EPs still forced you to understand what was going on before getting to lab. Some aspects of the work outside of class were kind of stressful  for example, some of the prompts were very vague but required super specific responses, and some of the questions on the final exam really did not make sense given what we learned in lab + the course packet. Still, this was by far the best/least stressful lab course I've taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0The labs become painfully boring after 4 or 5. The vast majority consist of letting a reflux sit for 30-75 minutes, then running TLC, IR, and meltpoint analysis, then being happy you get to go home early. The prelab preparation is marginally more engaging, if only because you have to think about the mechanisms a little bit more, which are what actually change from experiment to experiment. The TLC, IR, and mp analysis are all essentially the same as what is covered in the first semester lab. I'm genuinely unclear on how to fix this, but maybe using NMR earlier in the semester to change things up a bit would help, or taking the time to explicitly go through mechanisms and why they happen the way they do. ",
            "\u00a0Dr DiMeglio wrote up some really neat labs and a really helpful lab manual for this course. However, I felt that I didn't learn that many new lab techniques, and at a certain point we were just doing syntheses under reflux for every day of the lab. I would have liked more practice with NMR and different types of data analysis (besides TLC and IR). ",
            "\u00a0Dr. DiMeglio is very clear about expectations for the course, responds quickly and fairly to student concerns, and her course manual is incredibly comprehensive. She puts learning first and makes it fun. It's always a pleasure when she comes over to speak with us in lab, making sure we're understanding the point of the experiments and engaging with us. Assignments are very reasonable, and I felt like the questions on the post-labs facilitated us processing the important concepts. ",
            "\u00a0Love DiMeglio, but very varying quality of TAs. ",
            "\u00a0One strength is conducting syntheses that involve the utilization of familiar lab techniques. Most of the syntheses involved reflux and recrystallization, which particularly allowed students to improve their technique in these areas, which is something I appreciated. It was also amazing to synthesize vital pharmaceuticals, namely Dilantin, in this course. ",
            "\u00a0The course was great, although it was a bit repetitive ",
            "\u00a0For a lab, this course was very forgiving. The workload was very manageable, and being in lab itself was not so stressful because we were never hugely pressed for time, which was a strength. There were also a few dead weeks built into the semester for written assignments instead of lab work, which provided a much needed break. There were no glaring weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0One of the strengths of this course is that we really reinforced a lot of common lab techniques with each experiment; if I were put into a lab and asked to perform one of the techniques we learned this semester, I would feel very comfortable with doing that technique because many of them were part of each experiment we did throughout the semester. One of the weaknesses is that almost every experiment was a variation of the same procedure, so we didn't learn any new techniques and I often didn't feel very engaged while doing the preparation before lab or even during lab because I was so used to what we were doing. However, I think this course is very well supported by Dr. DiMeglio and the Teaching Fellows, and they are very accessible whenever anyone has a question, in or out of the lab. This semester was also very interesting, and many of the labs were fun to do and to see what would happen! ",

            "\u00a0I felt that this course was good in giving an introduction to what lab work is like, but we don't do much critical thinking during the labs. We learn some stuff through our experiments, but you don't need to know anything to actually get through the labs. You do need knowledge for the final though, which is kind of interesting. ",
            "\u00a0The labs are generally interesting, and the assignments are manageable. I did feel that the labs could sometimes get repetitive and that we would do similar procedures multiple times, but for the most part I felt engaged. I liked that the lab was hands-on and usually individual. ",
            "\u00a0All depends on the TA you get. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very nicely organized and probably the best an intro organic chem lab course could be taught. A lot of the work (like the weekly EPs) felt a bit useless. The grading rubrics seem to emphasize format more than content, which is often frustrating. Overall, Dr. DiMeglio is a wonderful instructor. ",
            "\u00a0Well organized, engaging, relaxed learning environment ",
            "\u00a0I think that this course is very well structured and well taught. I dont really have any negative things to say about it. I had a lot of fun! ",
            "\u00a0This course could be improved by either adding more new techniques to be covered or having more focused practice of new techniques. The labs in this course were mostly using techniques that we had covered in the first semester but there was little opportunity or encouragement to refine them. We were able to practice the techniques but without guidance on how they could be done more efficiently or effectively. The only real feedback we got was our percent yield, which was complicated by too many factors to be informative on the success of any particular technique. I personally did not like preparing the chemical tables for several labs at once. While this used a lab day effectively, it made boring work even worse by piling all together, making mistakes more likely. I am glad that we covered NMR, as it is a crucial technique for identifying organic compounds. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the instructor. Dr. D is one of the kindest, intelligent, most helpful and caring professors that I have ever had. She genuinely cares about her students and really encourages us to learn (basically she is the antithesis of Dr. G; she is the angel and Dr. G is the devil, etc.). I like how she designs the labs and generally her attitude about lab class at Yale.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the TAs. Your grade is solely dependent on how strict your TA is and how helpful/engaged they are in the lab. Because of this, the course is significantly easier for some students and significantly harder for others. I wish that there was more standardization on what the TAs were expected to do. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is that the experiments were interesting and far more useful than titrations.  Also, most weeks, the lab does not require 4 hours. ",
            "\u00a0I very much enjoyed this course! ",
            "\u00a0You learn how to do lab techniques but its repetitive, you end up doing the same things every lab ",
            "\u00a0I think that the weakest part of the course is that it isn't always lined up with the lecture, so we are doing things in lab that we haven't learned about in lecture. ",
            "\u00a0This was the first lab I've ever taken at Yale that I didn't feel was a hostile environment. Coming from Prof Ganapathi's lab had all but dissuaded me from hard sciences in it's entirety, but the clear focus in this lab on mentorship and learning has made all the difference. I'm thankful for this lab for redeeming the fun, joy, and worth of hard science learning for me. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths is that the labs are laid out very nicely. You know what you need to know and also the course packet provides all the information you need. A weakness of the class is that the tests and quizzes are pretty tricky and it was hard to prepare for them. ",

My TA did a great job of giving a short synopsis of the chemical concepts we would implement in lab at the start of each lab day, and I occasionally found those summaries to be pertinent and helpful in explaining ideas introduced in the corresponding lecture course. In all honesty, there weren't that many weaknesses, except maybe for the fact that grading could be a little variable among the TAs: it was a great, well-executed course. ",

Also, Dr. DiMeglio always checks in with everyone during lab, which makes all the students feel like they are cared about. A weakness of this course is that it depends almost entirely on the teaching fellows; some teaching fellows encourage learning and offer support more than others. ",

I think the course could be improved by incorporating a larger number of experimental techniques. It felt like we really only did reflux all semester, and it would have been nice to mix it up a little bit. ",
            "\u00a0A strength was being able to work with partners on some labs because it allowed us to share strategies and tips. A weakness was sometimes having to wait to use equipment like IR. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very well-organized (a vast improvement from the general chemistry labs). I felt like I was learning a lot but never felt overwhelmed. If something went wrong in an experiment, we were trained on how to safely deal with the problem, and TAs and staff members were always available to help. ",

If help is ever needed it's always right there because sections are small and the professors are constantly roaming the lab.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Every lab felt the same this semester. Mix stuff in a round bottom flask, heat at reflux, collect, purify, and analyze. It was very repetitive. ",
            "\u00a0Well organizes. TA's not super helpful ",
            "\u00a0The course helps students develop laboratory skills and practice techniques for conducting important chemical reactions. It also helps students learn how to write clearly, concisely, and effectively in scientific writing. We learn about safety and learn how to operate in the lab to optimize safety, sustainability, and productivity.\r\n\r\nI think there is a large degree of repetitiveness in the course. The middle 5 or so experiments largely all follow the same pattern of: prep materials, reflux, purify (through recrystallization or something) and characterize with TLC / IR / MP. This makes it easy for the student to get away with not understanding the actual mechanism or reaction at hand since the only thing they need to focus on is conducting the reaction and yielding product, which becomes second nature after so much practice. I think varying the purification methods would be helpful in learning more techniques and making lab less repetitive. I also think it would be nice to have a tour of actual chemistry labs so we can learn what kinds of tools and techniques our professors and TAs use in real life. We could write a report or a response on this. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is that the labs we did were really interesting and DiMeglio is wonderful. The weakness in this course is the way that it is graded. The grading is insanely nitpicky, and, depending on your TA, your grade could widely differ. The majority of the grade again falls on the final and the PLs, and the PLs are super subjectively graded by different TAs. The final required an intense amount of studying in order to do well. The grading made the course very stressful because, otherwise, the course was very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Chill course, but overly repetitive. The second semester of Orgo Lab only repeats techniques that they learned in the first semester without exploring more techniques and teaching something new (yes, NMR is an important exception to this). Teach something new, please! The products, esp. toward the end, are neat, but the course as a whole could be diversified. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: direct application of theory learned in class. Interesting and enjoyable to perform syntheses.\r\n\r\nWeakness: very similar to first semester - very few new skills required ",

When it does supplement the lecture course, I learn the topics considerably better. One weakness is that assignments are oddly weighted. The grade on each assignment rarely reflects the amount of work on the assignment, and it would be nice if it did. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: well organized, good length if experiments, interesting variety of techniques and experiments\r\nWeaknesses: could use more transparency with what reports and lab notes are specifically graded on ",

The only improvement I would suggest is removing some of the more repetitive aspects of the course such as requiring the procedure in each lab notes. ",
            "\u00a0There was very little I learned in this course that I did not already learn in 222L.  I feel like this course exists only because it needs to, but it is largely a waste of time. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n1) Lab is short, doesn't take the full 4 hours\r\n2) Only 2 lab reports per semester\r\n3) Well organized, although there are many grammatical errors in the lab manual\r\n4) The EPs are helpful in preparing for lab\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n1) The final is an unfair representation of the course. I found the course to be very skills-based and practical, which I loved, but the final was 35 multiple choice questions that were confusing and poorly worded, and I don't see how a 1 hour exam reflects the skills learned in a lab course. I would prefer a practical final.\r\n2) Discrepancy in grading among TAs. Not sure how you could change this, but some TAs definitely graded more harshly than others on the EPs and post-lab reports. ",
            "\u00a0The TAs and Dr. Dimeglio deserve alot of praise for making this a successful course. There is alot of demand from premed students, and the instruction team makes the course accessible to these students by making labs that relate to medicine or pharmacy. They are great at answering questions and are very approachable. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: amazingly engaged director, kind TA's, clean/organized environment, fun 'classroom' atmosphere\r\nWeaknesses: none ",
            "\u00a0By far, the greatest strength of this course is the supportive, welcoming, and exciting environment that Dr. DiMeglio, her lab staff Teresa and Elisa, and the teaching fellows go out of their way to create in the laboratory. I will elaborate on some of this information in the instructor and teaching fellow evaluations, but starting with Dr. DiMeglio, her passion for helping students learn practical organic chemistry skills is vibrant, pervasive, and tireless. She goes above and beyond to create an environment in lab that is conducive to student learning and engagement, and I have found that myself and all of my peers are able to focus more on learning than fear of mistakes as a result. Dr. DiMeglio and her staff do not create this environment at the expense of high standards, however; students are often reminded or corrected about how to improve their techniques, but the comments are always constructive, meant to guide and cultivate student learning. Especially as a first-year who occasionally has felt lost with the year of transition, I have found this environment to be extremely important and encouraging in my desire to pursue a career in science. Though I am surely biased, of all my friends ranging from first-years to seniors who are enrolled in or have been enrolled in a variety of laboratory courses, I have on average heard the most positive feedback and enthusiasm for Chem 222L/223L than any other laboratory course. Granted, I realize that not all laboratory courses can be compared next to one another, but I do think that the pro-curiosity environment that Dr. DiMeglio should be recognized as an exemplary model of how to encourage future scientists.\r\n\r\nOne potential weakness of this course is that second semester (223L) we seem to do a lot of similar syntheses. I don't know how big of a weakness this is since synthesis is obviously incredible important in organic chemistry and it's important to not only learn it, but for the procedures to almost become second nature, but I do think there was room for learning other techniques if the instructors want to squeeze something else in. Maybe spending longer on NMR or introducing it earlier before the one NMR day at the end of the semester could be considered. But then again it was very effective as is, so doesn't necessarily need to be changed. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course is really well organized with the different labs and reports. They follow the format of organic chemistry II pretty closely so it's usually easy to follow along with the theory of the course. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are how involved Dr. DiMeglio was with this course. Every lab, she would walk around and talk to each individual person and ask them if they had any questions with the lab. She was also very available and happy to meet with you outside of lab. The weaknesses are that the TAs do not always grade the same way and some seem harsher than others. ",
            "\u00a0The course teaches students a lot of skills and it is very informative. Honestly, I don't think anything can really be changed. Improvement isn't needed. ",
            "\u00a0The course is clearly organized and adjusted so to fit the schedule of students, which I greatly appreciated. However, the final exam is difficult because it requires us to suddenly learn all of the theory of the experiments which was barely discussed throughout the course. Improvements could include changing the structure to more fully analyze the theory or having the final be more of a lab practical. ",
            "\u00a0It gave a lot of independence to each student to manage their time wisely and be responsible for their procedure. However, perhaps one weakness is we didn't really go over any exam questions/review material for the exam at all. All studying was done entirely on our own. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I love Prof DiMeglio and how she gets to know all the students and consistently checks in on us.  It is the highlight of Orgo 2\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: large focus on procedural knowledge that feels irrelevant.  Repetitive analysis of TLC and MP every time does not add to my knowledge or experience.  In fact, nearly all of the procedures are quite repetitive and the labs seem to have no focus. ",
            "\u00a0This course was really great. The lab that we do were fun and informative, and I sometimes even looked forward to getting to go in and work. I do feel that the exam was a bit too challenging, or the course was not demanding enough through the semester to help students properly obtain the information necessary for the final. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very chill until the final exam, Dr. DiMeglio is kind and so helpful\r\nWeakness: the final exam is multiple choice based and about 35 questions, so getting a couple of questions wrong could tank your final grade. ",
            "\u00a0Extremely well run course, especially for such a large lab class. Structure of the pre- and post-lab work was great, and experiments were worthwhile without being monotonous. The only criticism I have is that much of the grading was done by the TA's, and was therefore inconsistent across lab groups. ",

The vast majority consist of letting a reflux sit for 30-75 minutes, then running TLC, IR, and meltpoint analysis, then being happy you get to go home early. The prelab preparation is marginally more engaging, if only because you have to think about the mechanisms a little bit more, which are what actually change from experiment to experiment. The TLC, IR, and mp analysis are all essentially the same as what is covered in the first semester lab. I'm genuinely unclear on how to fix this, but maybe using NMR earlier in the semester to change things up a bit would help, or taking the time to explicitly go through mechanisms and why they happen the way they do.

            "\u00a0Yes, I loved Organic Chemistry Lab. It was efficient and interesting. Most people who take it are pre-med and need the requirement, but it's a great class. I hope you like your TA, though, because you work with them a lot. ",
            "\u00a0I took this as a premed requirement, as many students will. This is a necessary course for many students, but at least it is not a bad one. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only for chemistry/biology majors. This course provides an in-depth understanding of chemical lab techniques. It is a skill primarily used in the chemistry and pre-med communities. The director and TA's are incredibly engaged, which inspires the students to learn and work hard. The effort one puts in (studying, following directions, etc.) seems to actually produce results, unlike in other courses ",
            "\u00a0Yes. See previous comment on strengths and weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0It's one of those classes you have to take, but it's not that bad. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because Dr. DiMeglio is great and makes lab a much better experience than gen chem lab. ",
            "\u00a0Yes but only if it is necessary for them or if they are interested in the subject. Though the course is great, spending 4 hours in one class even if it is only once a week can become time consuming if you have a super busy schedule. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a very engaging and interesting lab, especially when taken with a fun TA and friends. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. It's a fair amount of work, and it's challenging but at a level that is manageable and still interesting. The class is very well organized by the course manual, and you are always given warning far in advance about assignments and what is expected. ",
            "\u00a0You're probably only taking this course if you're required to, since it's neither interesting nor easy. ",
            "\u00a0If you're premed/MCDB, then you have to take this class. But it's a good way to consolidate what you learn from orgo lecture ",
            "\u00a0Yes, extremely well-run and worthwhile lab course if you're interested in organic chemistry. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, Orgo lab is really fun and not too much work.  The professor wants students to learn and is great at answering questions! "
