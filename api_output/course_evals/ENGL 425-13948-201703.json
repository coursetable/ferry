            "\u00a0This class genuinely looked at the history and cultural legacy of the city of New Orleans from many different academic lenses: from the perspective of literary and dramatic history and analysis, the perspective of social, political, and racial history of this country, the perspective of architecture and city planning as it relates to culture and social geography, the perspective of cultural histories of art, music, dance, and poetry, and so much more. It is cross-listed between many departments, and justifiably so. We emphasized looking at the city of New Orleans through the lens of The African-American experience in this country, the lens of representative (and not just canonical) works of literature/poetry/drama, the lens of performance practice and history, and the lens of humanistic study and historical record--a look into the real people of the city through time, their culture, their stories, and their perspectives. We learned to write about a city through a specific \"keyword\" (ranging from \"jazz\" to \"whore\" to \"bubble\" and all the implications of such words as they relate to the city's culture and history), and to look at texts not just in dialogue with other texts but with history and the physical landscape of the city that inspired them or enriched their symbolic power. We always had discussions that were challenging and engaging, for Professor Roach made an active effort to get everyone talking, even though the students in seminar came from such varying academic and personal backgrounds. In a class about a city of mixture that's so hard to classify, it made sense to employ a variety of academic disciplines with a diverse group of students--it wouldn't be a study of New Orleans if it weren't this way. I am leaving this course with a deeper understanding of this city, but, more broadly, a knowledge of how to connect place and people, text and ideas, academic histories and political histories, and more, in a more profound way. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about New Orleans! I think reading the literature of a place is such a great insight into its culture. I learned about Mardi Gras Indians and about the music and racial history of this city that I am so fascinated by. ",
            "\u00a0The skills of reading a city as literature. The course also developed my critical thinking and reading skills. ",
            "\u00a0This was the first time I've taken a class based on a specific location, so it was interesting to look at the same subject through a huge variety of lenses. Since a lot of the emphasis was on the final project, I felt like the class challenged me to be more proactive in terms of figuring out what I'm interested in, doing my own research, and narrowing down a topic. I enjoyed our class discussions because everyone had a different area of expertise. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n\r\n-Diverse set of assignments and sources for research and close study on the syllabus--Novels, short stories, articles, poetry, documentaries, artistic artifacts to name a few. \r\n-Professor Roach is a master teacher who facilitates a thoroughly engaging, guided discussion each class. I would say his classes are 40% lecture, 60% discussion, which to me is a perfect balance for a course where some basic background and expertise beyond the texts we read can be pre-requisites to meaningful conversation. \r\n-There is something here for everyone. Whether you're interested in American literature, political history, listening to jazz music, eating southern food, understanding the diversity of the nation of America and the roots of this diversity, you will find something here. You can steer the conversation towards your interests, and Professor Roach will masterfully connect everything with some beautiful rhetorical flourish towards the end of each discussion. \r\n-Assignments are challenging and meaningful, yet not overwhelming. Professor Roach was open to creative approaches (e.g., for theatre students, writing a play instead of a paper for one assignment.) \r\n-The topics are simply fun. You can't talk about this stuff without getting excited, angry, riled up, passionate, or something that makes you feel alive. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n\r\n-I wish there was time for more readings! (not a criticism though--the reading list was the perfect balance for the course--not too much, not too little. More would be overwhelming, less disappointing.) ",
            "\u00a0The course is very strong and the syllabus could be switched up term to term to highlight more works.  The level of subscription during shopping period leads me to think that the class could be brought back, perhaps every other year. ",
            "\u00a0Joe Roach is such an incredible source of knowledge and a beautiful speaker/thinker/professor. Some of the things he says are so artful and profound that I just want to remember them forever. He is clearly incredibly compassionate. He just knows about EVERYTHING related to New Orleans. That said, this class was sometimes all over the place. I was kind of just riding it wherever the discussion went, and I was cool with that, but discussion sometimes wandered as JR would go off on some tangent. Granted, it was usually interesting, but could seem disorganized. That said, the literature was great. What a fantastic and unique collection of books and a variety of perspectives. It was clear that people didn't always do the readings so discussions were not always the best but JR tried to get everyone to participate. This course is a pretty standard literature seminar I'd say. I really enjoyed it overall. JR's idea of the course is to have you pick a \"keyword\" and focus on it throughout the semester. This was sometimes also confusing because a lot of the assignments had very little guidance and were self-guided. I get that this is the point of the assignment but it could be stressful when you didn't know exactly what he expected and maybe he could've guided us a little better. Also, I think the potential to do a creative project for the class could really have been explored more--he didn't really announce it, and it was kind of only for seniors doing their theses (it seemed?) but it would've been cool if he'd explained that anyone could do a creative project if they wanted to! ",
            "\u00a0Professor Roach is amazing both at leading class discussion and at lecturing/storytelling. Everyone's contributions were valued and expected. \r\nI only wish I got some feedback on how I was doing grade-wise at some point in the term. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent discussions. Excellent syllabus. ",
            "\u00a0This was a great survey course in the literature associated with New Orleans, and Professor Roach is simply wonderful. \r\n\r\nThere was not a lot of feedback in the course, so more of that could be helpful! ",
            "\u00a0This was the first time I've taken a class based on a specific location, so it was interesting to look at the same subject through a huge variety of lenses. A lot of the emphasis was on the final project, so I felt like the class challenged me to be more proactive in terms of figuring out what I'm interested in, doing my own research, and narrowing down a topic. The more excited you are about your project, the better it will be in the end. \r\n\r\nI enjoyed our class discussions because everyone had a different area of expertise. Everyone picks a \"keyword\" near the beginning of the semester and then dives into whatever that subject is. Professor Roach is really engaging, helpful, and enthusiastic. Definitely go to office hours! ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course is the interesting subject material and Professor Roach's knowledge passion for it, as well as his skill as an instructor. "

            "\u00a0100%, no questions asked, definitely, without a doubt take this class if you have any interest in the history of race, jazz, literature, poetry, drama, food, architecture, city planning, and much more in this country. It is my favorite course that I've ever taken at Yale, and the only one for which I've come home from class each day itching to begin the reading assignments, which were incredibly fun and enriching. Professor Roach is absolutely brilliant and unlike any other professor I've ever had--he seemingly has memorized (and contextualized) everything about every field of study, every text ever written, every important cultural artifact...Everything that comes out of his mouth feels magical and calls to be written down (and....I don't regret writing basically everything he said down--I will be reading these notes for years and years to come.) In this class, assignments range from novels to poetry to short stories to documentaries/movies to articles to viewings of pieces of silver. Discussions ranged from the history of jazz music to voodoo to prostitution to colonization's racial legacy to the relationship between city planning and political tools of oppression to the structure of a novel to the history of absurdist thought to classical influences in 20th century American drama, and so much more. You will likely walk away with a tremendous love for (or at least love of the study of) the city of New Orleans, and a deeper knowledge of how to understand and appreciate the always-evolving relationships between place, history, and cultural artifacts. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would: and it would be applicable to a vast array of students (given the number of departments the class is listed under). There's a lot to be said about the New Orleans community, and themes arising in the course have implications across much of the human experience. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah! If anything, take it to get to know Joe Roach, an incredible man, and to read some really amazing literature that is not part of the traditional canon but is still so important. Don't have expectations regarding discussion--it can go anywhere--but I'm so glad I got to take a class with professor Roach! ",
            "\u00a0I loved this class! If you can take a course with Professor Roach, do! ",
            "\u00a0yes ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. ",
            "\u00a0In this class, you definitely get out of it what you put in. The reading list is excellent and Professor Roach is a great lecturer, but he always leaves space for students to speak up. Make sure you're really interested in your final topic...give it some serious thought before you commit. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course; the readings and discussions allow students to learn about a truly fascinating and unique local culture. Professor Roach's knowledge and passion further strengthen the course. "
