            "\u00a0A thorough review of the fundamental elements of life history evolution. A practical knowledge of how to combine quantitative genetic predictions with age-structured demographic theory, and conceptual tools to apply that knowledge to the study of phenotypic adaptation and constraint.

            "\u00a0Of the many strengths of this course, the strongest is the ability to work through a classic textbook with the help of the professor who wrote it. Once we learn the fundamental from this older textbook, we also had the opportunity to turn to more recent literature which helped supplement a conceptual approach with a better knowledge of more recent empirical methods. Although I didn't always look forward to answering every reading question for every class meeting, the weekly assignments were undoubtedly a strength to the course as well. These assignments meant that everyone was ready and willing for discussion in class, and obviously helped up understand the material better. I greatly appreciated the looser, \"big picture\" grading scheme of the writing assignments, which helped ease most my anxiety and allowed me to focus on engaging with the questions each week.\r\n\r\nMore a struggle than a weakness was the distribution of the workload throughout the week. Questions due Wednesday at midnight only seemed available after Monday at midnight. This timing meant that the workload was much more heavily distributed to the latter class meeting each week. Either the ability to work ahead on Thursday questions over the weekend, or shifting some number of questions from Thursday to Tuesday, would help fix this struggle. "
