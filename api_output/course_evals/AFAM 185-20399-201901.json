Professor Reed's lectures always added to the discussions that would otherwise have surrounded the readings. He usually brings in extra materials to give you an expanded sense of the cultural and political context of the works that we read, which I think is very helpful. He's also very straightforward and helpful in his essay assignments, and will help you get better at these kinds of argumentative essays, if that's something you feel less confident about. ",

I really enjoyed our ability to read so much primary source material through books, as well as the opportunity to go in the Beinecke Archives. ",

I found it hard to pay attention to what Dr. Reed was saying even though he said very interesting things. He was just not very exciting. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n-Professor Reed is really passionate and funny\r\n-The readings and course material is very interesting and takes from a wide range of unique authors\r\n-The essay assignments are very thought provoking\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-Classes and sections are better when attendance is high. I noticed many lectures were missing quite a few students\r\n-Sometimes the readings for the week were heavy and it was hard to get them done (especially with poetry books, since they take a long time to interpret) ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Interesting readings (well curated), important course for understanding black american history (through the lens of literature + art)\r\n\r\nWeakness: Sadly, students were not very engaged in the course. While Reed is clearly brilliant and delivers wonderful commentary, the delivery wasn't always the most successful. \r\n\r\nImprovement: I appreciate the focus on the literature/art, but I think it would have been more effective to start each class with a little more history to contextual the era, movement, and literature of focus for the day. ",
            "\u00a0A strength could be the lectures - they weren't very engaging and considering how I did in the class they weren't essential to get a good grade. ",

            "\u00a0lecture was not engaging and very difficult to follow. Slides were not informative so there was no clear direction to the lecture. I never quite understood the context of what he was talking about. \r\nSection was great and I learned a lot there. ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus of the course is great. ",

            "\u00a0In my opinion, the course should be converted to a seminar format. The lecture was poorly attended because the majority of students in the class were only there for an easy credit. In a seminar format, only students who genuinely want to be there would be there. ",

            "\u00a0The best strength was Professor Reed's understanding of the material, synthesizing it in lecture, and the creative room he provided in our essay assignments to choose what novels and poems we most wanted to analyze.  The best improvement would be to make lecture attendance and section attendance mandatory. ",

I also really enjoyed the 1920s music that Prof. Reed played in class. The biggest weakness was that the vast majority of students skipped lecture. ",

            "\u00a0The class has really great material as assigned reading, however the lectures were not worth going to. The lectures were not necessarily informative and werent engaging. The professor just read off of his page and went into deep literary analysis of a paragraph or two from the peice or book assigned for that days reading. I wouldve liked to have seen some history context, background etc. on the book or author to give us a better understanding of why/how the piece was relevant, influential, etc. instead of just going into P.h.D. level analysis of a single sentence which no one could keep up with. Often it seemed like the lectures were rambling and didnt help me understand any of the works better. The writing credit option was incredibly easy, but the hardest part about it was understanding what the prompt even wanted. The second assignment where we had to go to the Beinecke to look at old works to help us understand a work better was awesome, but he first paper was so difficult to figure out what he expected us to write. ",

            "\u00a0This course covered really interesting material and topics but was not condensed in a way that was coherent. It seemed like there was no common theme throughout. In the lecture there was not room to get in depth with the material. I think this would have made a better seminar. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: cool materials, easy workload, chill TAs\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures had little structure and by the end of the semester weren't worth going to, material has so much potential that its kind of sad this was just reduced to a gut ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were OUTSTANDING. I learned much about \"the folk,\" publishing and patronage, literary magazines circulating at the time, visual art and music of the period. Professor Reed incorporated into his lectures a wealth of primary sources (for example, the music of Bessie Smith) to draw connections between the literary works and other contemporaneous art forms. Lectures, unfortunately, were poorly attended; and, while this didn't in any way detract from Professor Reed's delivery of material, it did make for a rather sparse learning environment. Perhaps slightly more interaction between lecturer and students could be added in--a few Q and As interspersed throughout the lectures. The essay assignments were engaging, and I especially enjoyed the second assignment, in which we were prompted to conduct primary source research in the Beinecke's prominent Harlem Renaissance collection.

This course is an ideal course to take because of those reasons. Additionally, showing up to lecture does not determine your grade, so just put a lot of effort into section to ensure a high grade. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, for those interested in developing their writing skills in a non-seminar setting. I also recommend it to people interested in the works of James Weldon Johnson, Zora Neale Hurston and other writers of the Harlem Renaissance, since their understanding of them developed greatly over the course of the semester.

He's not as flashy as some professors, but he is really great at actually making an interesting argument in his lectures - while also teaching you how to read the texts within new historical and ideological contexts. He always brings in magazine covers, other visual art, or music to supplement his discussion of the literature. ",

            "\u00a0Not in its current form. They had trouble finding TFs, and quite a few of them were, to say the least, unmotivated and unprepared to teach. The lectures were rather dry, but that wasn't the course's weakest aspect. ",
            "\u00a0Unless its taught as a seminar, dont take it unless you want an easy writing credit and a lottery of what TA youre going to have  could be a great AfAm/English TA or a random TA they hired to fill spots. If you truly want a deep-dive into the history and literature of the Harlem Renaissance, opt for a seminar version of this class because I got nothing out of the lecture-style. ",

            "\u00a0Gut. Books are actually interesting and worth reading on your own, but the course load for this (especially for the non-writing sections) was light as hell and you could manage without attending lectures ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend, but with caveats. Lectures are outstanding; sections are far less so. My TA was a graduate student in the global health program, and was not at all equipped to TA the course. I got a lot out of the lectures and my independent readings of the works. But the second element of the course--small discussions lead by a knowledgeable graduate student--was entirely lacking. Take the course for Professor Reed's lectures and the great works of literature; try to get a qualified TA. ",
