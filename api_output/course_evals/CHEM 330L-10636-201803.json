            "\u00a0The lab topics included Electronics, Phase Equilibria, Heat Capacity ratios, the Joule-Thomson coefficient, Bomb calorimetry, and NMR. Each lab presented so much material that you truly had to understand in order to generate a well-written report. The information was generally interesting and lectures clearly explained concepts from the instruction packets. In addition, I learned how to make real non-Excel graphs, intro to code writing, how to organize a large amount of data, and how to be as efficient as possible in writing ~40 page lab reports. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I would claim you learn the very rigorous process of starting with simple measurements like temperature, pressure, distance... and convert them using extenstive values. You also learn how to assess assumptions made about data. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely nothing. This class teaches you essentially nothing besides \"insight\" onto how sadistic the chemistry department is for making this a required course. It would be one thing if taking this horrendous course actually taught you anything, but no. Instead you will spend the hardest semester of your entire life learning absolutely nothing. Any chemistry major learns how to write lab reports in other classes; since that it all you do in this class, this is a waste of time. It is clear and obvious that the department views this class as a necessary punishment for its students when there is no justification for it.\r\nThings I actually learned from this class:\r\n-How many spaces it takes to center an equation on a line in a Word document \r\n-How long it takes for yourself and your friends to have a mental breakdown\r\n-How many meals and sleep a student can skip before physically shutting down\r\n-How to skip all your other classes (@p chem lecture) to do stuff for this class\r\n-How to use Excel mindlessly for 10+ hours on end ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me absolutely nothing about chemistry and I can guarantee it will not be valuable to me in the future. The only thing I can say I got out of this class was the ability to write 30-50 pages in a span of 48 hours and not care at all about it. I have learned how to effectively use my time to minimize the suffering this class brings. ",

            "\u00a0Honestly, I think I might have learned anything but physical chemistry while taking this course. I have a new, extensive knowledge of Excel and using Excel to crunch numbers. I learned how to use IgorPro in order to make graphs and whatnot for the lab reports and I, surprisingly, learned a little bit about how to code using Chipmunk BASIC. These definitely are not the skills I expected to get from this course at all, but I am sort of glad that I got them. I wish that I could say I understood more about physical chemistry coming out of this course but that's just completely false and not at all what happened. But yes, I learned some other skills, I can say that much. ",

            "\u00a0The course was very, very well organized and Prof Vaccaro was always accessible after lecture. There were several times that he helped me make sense of my data, and I appreciate how the lab structures facilitated learning. The TAs were helpful and knowledgable, and labs were thoroughly explained. \r\n\r\nThis class is a large amount of work, but I would not consider that a weakness. I don't see how the class (as it is) could be redone so as to have less work -- for the long lab reports had meaningful components. Basically, you get out what you put into it. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n1) Vaccaro is stellar. His notes are detailed (sometimes too much so) and he knows exactly what is important. Its sad he won't be doing this anymore.\r\n2) TFs were great and willing to help you if you got in trouble in lab, especially with electronics or NMR.\r\n3) Lab grading is fair. If you have portions done 4+ days in advance, they will look at it and provide feedback. This can help spot egregious errors. People will complain that you don't know what you need to write, but no one knows. They tell you grade distrubtions so you always have an idea of relative position in the class throughout the term.\r\n4)  Experiments were really cool principles and using your hands was exciting, as well as using a lot of equipment you seldom see in orgo/gen chem lab. 5) Lecture was neat and helpful \r\n6) Reports made you think about lots of things like experimental design, literature values, sources of uncertainty, assumptions... a lot of novel things compared to previous years. I really enjoyed them in  that sense. It helped my work ethic and real research as well. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n1) I'd rather mow a football field with toenail clippers than write some of the lab reports because I'd be done faster. I'm exaggerating, but they were very tedious and a lot of busy work. Easily 2/3 of the work was just styling on data using excel. Figure preparation and caption writing on 9 identical runs gets numb fast. Error propagation is also really painful at first if you haven't taken physics lab. The equations are long and its hard to know how imprecise your final values will end up being if you don't have experience. Part of the class is learning what values are important, and you can spend a ton of time mulling over what you need to include, which should be in tables, etc... and including it all takes forever. Discussion and conclusions are open ended and it can be hard to figure out what to say.  \r\n2) Some of the lab packets are really dense and take a while to understand, especially electronics (since most people aren't electrical engineers) and NMR (since many people didn't take diff EQ, linear, Quantum, etc... and because NMR is hard) \r\n3) Lab report turnaround can be pretty slow so if you made a mistake with one lab, you might get double- or triple-counted because you don't find out until later\r\n4) The final was overall fair, but felt like a gut blow after essentially eating away reading period doing lab reports (I clocked over 100 pages writing between reports 5 and 6). It is over application of concepts from labs and requires memorization of tiny details and most equations (few provided!) which are in lab packets but never used in either class or on reports. The questions weren't bad if you knew that particular fact. ",
            "\u00a0There is nothing strong about this course. Vaccaro is a very organized and friendly professor, but this class still should not exist in the form it does. There are many, many, many weaknesses about this course. The lab reports are horrendously long and should be shortened. NOTHING is gained from doing the same thing over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again and showing the calculations every single step of the way. The actual \"thing\" that Vaccaro wants each student to accomplish is supplemented by a bunch of other \"things,\" he wants you to do (compare to literature values, do the whole procedure again for a different compound, calculate something using a different method, etc.) that exponentially adds time to finishing the lab reports. The lab packets are incredibly dense and make no sense as to what you are doing in lab, how to calculate the thing you are looking for, or how to do the report. The \"late days\" are a joke considering that you must use them to get the last few lab reports done, so if you need to use the late days before then for a serious reason (like having other classes or a job, gee what a surprise), you are completely screwed. The grading is arbitrarily harsh for very specific and stupid things. The quizzes are a way to waste our time and make students be stressed out, cramming for the quiz seconds before lab starts because they spent all night staying up to do the report. The general attitude that your life should revolve around this course is also a major weakness. Don't even get me started on the atrocious final, which is literally and obviously just a way for Vaccaro to punish students who he thinks are just focused on getting lab reports done (re: everyone) rather than understanding the \"concepts.\" The final is so specific and difficult that there's no point in even trying. Did I forget anything else? Everything was bad; literally everything. This course could be improved by literally destroying it and finding someone else that is not Vaccaro to run this class. Or just leave it not existent, that would be great as well. The sad thing is that it is very obvious from years and years of reviews like mine that no one, whether it be the teaching staff, Vaccaro, Hazari (or any other DUS), and the chem department at large, cares even one bit about the physical, mental, and emotional trauma this class causes students. This review is useless in terms of changing the course, but hopefully it will help students taking the course to know the truth. ",
            "\u00a0\"How could this class be improved?\" I think the question should be, \"Why does this class exist in the first place?\". The lab reports should not be this long, the final exam should be based on the level of instruction given, and the TAs should be expected to treat their students with respect. I love a challenging course, but only when the resources exist to support students. This class is rid of any resources and strives to destroy the lives of its students rather than teach them anything of value. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The course packets, how the concepts are laid out, and the experiments themselves are designed very well.\r\nWeaknesses: The report writing. Once you \"figure out\" the lab (which does take some time and is intellectually challenging), the write up becomes just painful, boring, and frustrating. I don't feel like we have to do that much write up to learn the art of scientific writing. I don't mind the workload staying the same, but I feel like I would've learned more if we could do more theoretical analysis and data workups for more experiments in chemistry, instead of writing so much and worrying about formatting for just six experiments (with one not-so related to chemistry). ",
            "\u00a0The course was extremely rigorous, and developed my skills especially in preparing a technical lab report with figures and tables. Every aspect of the course is very well-planned and designed to expose the student to new skills. Key skills (linear regression, error propagation) were required for almost every lab report, ensuring that every student left this course with a command of those skills. However, the emphasis on electronics (even including op-amps and counters) was somewhat disconnected from the rest of the course, and to some it was not clear what the connection was to the rest of the course. ",
            "\u00a0The class is very difficult for no reason. The class puts a large emphasis on number analysis but all the numbers could be wrong and there is no way for the TAs to see that. The class is very hard to get through without a friend. A strength of this course is that it teaches you discipline. ",
            "\u00a0strengths= well organized, well taught (thanks phv) like all the materials are there and very very very well thought out\r\n\r\nweaknesses= i sometimes had nightmares about the lab\r\ntakes a long time to do the labs ",
            "\u00a0The reputation of the course precedes, but IT IS DOABLE! This course can be managed if you plan correctly. The lab reports are so much work, so you have to start early. Each one increases in difficultly, but you will learn a lot in the previous ones to help you going forward. There will be some late nights, but it does not need to ruin your life at all. This course is more time heavy than intellectually challenging, so ask for help! You do not need to lost time doing the procedure the wrong way, only to need to redo it. Use the peer tutors! \r\nThe TAs are great. Lecture is not all that helpful. The final is a lot to study, but also doable! The course is very pedagogically sound, it never feels that you are doing something without a point. The reports lead you on a good path. The 15 page report limit means nothing, though.  \r\nYou can tackle this course and come out in one piece! You can still keep your weekends and your sanity! ",
            "\u00a0Literally, this was the worst course I have ever taken in my Yale career. I cannot stress how useless and terrible this course was. First, you'll enter the class and have a few lectures with Vaccaro and realize that he's a pretty clear lecturer and a very nice man. You might even wonder how the reviews on CourseTable could possibly be so bad. Then, you go into the first lab and realize that you were so naive. The first lab is already just so terrible and it literally gets so much worse from there. The lab reports get successively longer and more challenging to complete as the semester goes on. If you're like me, you might find yourself making an error in one of your calculations and then realizing that this error has impacted every calculation you have made since that erroneous one. And then you will spend like an hour or two trying to fix your mistakes, or maybe even give up a little and just accept your fate. Don't even get me started on the sample calculations too. Something I wish I had done was just write out the sample calculations as I went through the lab because instead I just did the calculations in Excel and then had to handwrite the sample calculations after I was done. It just added salt to my already throbbing, large wounds. The workload is just too high and Vaccaro has these crazy standards for each lab report that just make it so challenging to focus on the content. The lab manuals are so dense with content that it makes it really difficult to figure out what you are supposed to get out of the lab each week and what you are supposed to do in the lab. Everyone tells you to make sure to start early on the lab reports. But even when you do start early, you'll probably spend a decent amount of your time not writing or calculating anything because you are trying to figure out what the fuck you need to do. It's certainly how I spent a lot of my time. I feel like I was never sure what I was doing in the lab until I got out of there and slaved away at my lab report for hours upon hours. Each report I submitted was at least 20 pages. Studying for the final in this class was an absolute joke. You'll spend your time sifting through all of the lab manuals trying to figure out what you even did and why it was relevant. Also, you'll need to have some stuff memorized that you don't even need to have memorized in the regular physical chemistry lecture? I don't know why we didn't have a slightly more detailed reference sheet, but I mean I guess with this class it's just whatever adds to the torture, you know? Also, doing better on the lab reports each week was extremely challenging considering that it took forever to get the graded lab reports back. And I mean, I understand that the TAs have their own research and lives to focus on, and I respect that, but maybe - JUST MAYBE - that says something about how the workload is even rough for the people that know what they are doing. By the time I got the first lab report back and graded, I think I had already submitted 2 other reports so I literally couldn't do anything about the mistakes that I had made in all of those reports. This is literally the only lab course at Yale where the TAs need to spend so much time grading that the students can't effectively learn from their mistakes. Every other lab course I have taken, the TAs were capable of handing your work back within 1 to 2 weeks. And honestly, I think that the TAs for this course are maybe the one strength this course has? They knew what they were doing and really did the most by guiding us through the labs that no one understood each week. So no, it's not that the TAs that were at fault here, literally this course needs a better structure to promote the learning and sanity of the students that are taking it because it just doesn't work. And obviously, no one at Yale seems to give much of a fuck because it's been this way for years and years of reviews. This class shouldn't have to be the \"rite of passage\" class in the major. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Vaccaro is an incredible professor, and the TAs are great. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nToo much work for a 1 credit class. Its often difficult to understand what is desired for a lab report. It would be nice for there to have been a checklist of things to be calculated and what exactly required comparison to literature values for because sometimes the way it was presented textually made it difficult to understand. Some things in the appendices such as using oscilloscope, making pellets, using regulator would be much more easily understood by adding a video hyperlink. ",
            "\u00a0STREWTH: you will learn to write and cry and write and cry but it will be ok. WRITE STRONGER AND CRY STRONGER.\r\n\r\nWEak: too much write. too much cry. ",
            "\u00a0I hope you are strong enough to plow through the darkness. \r\nRage, rage against the dying of the delta(G). ",
            "\u00a0The Friday lectures were generally very helpful. However, the electronics lectures were not really helpfulmore time needed to be devoted to the electronics concepts covered in the first lab, with more emphasis given to the more important topics relevant to that report. Also, there were not enough course-coordinated review sessions/practice problems prior to the final exam. The laboratory reports were graded too harshly. ",
            "\u00a0I think the class could be improved by reducing the length of lab reports, as they were really really long. But, I did learn a ton and I do think my scientific writing has improved, so this might just be one of those classes that is a beast and can't really be tamed that much. ",
            "\u00a0I know you must get so many responses to this question, but I would like to focus on the things I think this course could REALLY use, which is to cut down the number of lab reports from 7 to 5 (or even 4) and to introduce a workshop and drafting process. There are so many moving parts to P. Chem Lab; there's the conceptual knowledge, data collection, data manipulation, construction of appendices to justify the way the data is manipulated, error propagation, construction of graphs and tables, increasing familiarity with Excel and Word formatting, CODING (???), and the actual lab report construction.  I know that I for one knew little to nothing about these skills. Topics are diverse but don't build naturally on top of one another; each new topic requires a new way of thinking. There is really no reason all of these required skills to suddenly come simmer up with maddening acceleration with lab report 2, simmer down for a bit with lab reports 3 and 4, and then come SWELLING back up again for lab reports 5 and 6. There is also no reason that all these skills and processes can't build more slowly on top of each other. I truly believe that the people who constructed this course had honest intentions in creating a rigorous and challenging class that would teach its students about the rigor and challenge of physical chemistry, and I also know there have been recent efforts to cut down on the workload (with only partial lab reports, 5 late-days, etc). And as a student, I want to say that despite these honest intention, the course quite simply has not been cut down enough! This course imagines a student with few other academic or extra-curricular responsibilities and the mental health required to sacrifice all free-time, social life time, and self-care time to the creation of lab reports. It's quite absurd and needs to be addressed. One option is to increase the number of credits this class gives from 1 to 1.5, more accurately showing students and deans the TIME that is required for this course, and allowing for a smaller courseload overall for the semester. The other option is to simply cut down the number of experiments and make use of a drafting process that sees students submit what they can and then have time to rewrite, reformulate, and fix errors in their work. This will make for better scientific writing and the encouragement of QUESTIONS (which I often felt I had no time to ask). \r\n\r\nIn short, these are the changes I would recommend:\r\n1. The class-time that goes into electronics, speed of sound, and JT effect could be going to workshops that go over how to code (which many many students had absolutely no experience with, and either copied code with small variation or stared in futility at tutorials until eventually copying code with small variations), how to use Excel, how to present equation in Word, how to graph, how to propagate error, etc. These are skills and ARE NOT INNATE. They need time to develop, but they also need guidance. Allow students to help each other and allow TAs to help students. \r\n2. The electronics section could be cut down to two weeks and feature greater focus on a smaller number of illustrative principles, not running through a half-semester of electrical engineering in three weeks. \r\n3. Experiment 3 or 4 could be cut. \r\n4. The lab guidelines and the questions that are expected to be answered could and should be more clearly stated. Also, splurge on the paper for printing; no more or this two sheets to one side of paper nonsense. I so often found my vision going blurry trying to read the tiny text and find all the questions I might have missed.\r\n5. We're not snowflakes but we are people. We're all doing our best, even if we procrastinate a little. Introduce more deadlines for sections of lab reports (maybe the data section will be due a week ahead of time); it will nudge students in the right direction to start early and plan ahead. It also wouldn't hurt to ask for another TA for faster feedback. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths? Idk. Maybe after you take this course, you will feel like you can conquer anything else this major will throw at you... assuming you haven't been crushed in every way possible by this course. Weaknesses? The amount of analysis in the lab reports are objectively exorbitant and unnecessary. For example, we did not need to do 9 bomb calorimetry trials and then do the data analysis for each and every one. Four trials would have sufficed. Six, even. At one point, the lab reports felt repetitive and I wasn't actually learning anything because I was so focused on trying to get all the actual work done. This is the narcissist of all course. It expects you to plan your entire semester, no, LIFE, around it, in order to get a good grade. Was it worth it? Not really. "

            "\u00a0Its like a roller coaster: really enjoyed it and absolutely hated it at the same time. \r\n\r\nLet me express frustration this way: you need to adopt a \"PCHEM State of Mind\" [NY State of Mind by Nas Parody]\r\n\r\nAyo, its time, word /\r\nIts time, man /\r\nYeah, straight out the darkest dungeons of Bass /\r\nWhere \"don't-know\" students dont make it back \r\nI dont know how to start this report yo\r\n\r\nPapers, I barely finish em with the funky digits I be takin\r\nPHV inflictin compositions of pain \r\nA sunken face, chuggin caffeine\r\nHoldin a B, see with Excel Im extreme- now\r\nBullet hole, my GPA new low, all out of hope \r\nBut Oscill-yo-scope and I still get volts\r\n\r\nAll new lingo, but just so you know \r\nvide infra just means see below\r\nI keep some sigma, getting bent up in the right math\r\nShooting craps, hoping the packet led me on the easy path\r\nGetting laughed at as bama boy up to save my as\r\nThis class gets off quick, forever I talk 'n spit \r\nReminiscin about the last time I slept for six\r\n\r\nHours be runnin by this year, losin\r\nTime to start enjoying life, take a snooze, read the news\r\nOnce they caught us off guard, say on sig figs falls the curtain\r\nwe grindin through these calcs, our values now uncertain\r\n\r\nPicked class up, most told itll sck  the class spit\r\nLead bricks on our digs, some ran, fast to quit\r\nHeard some few kids dude, you should stay! who would\r\nwhen you got no time to even eat food\r\n\r\nNow Im sprinting into SCL lobby\r\nIts full of \"children,\" Gen Chem lab, only thing to fear was Dr. G\r\nThe system insane, got reason to complain\r\nGot younger kids barely adding up grams, learn that hard ... later\r\nOnly log jam they handed gets stuck on their calculator\r\n\r\nHere I am, yo gotta work during vacation\r\nInside information be sayin 5 days gracin and you barely makin\r\nI never sleep- cause charts dont plot themselves\r\nBeyond the walls of 188, life undefined\r\nFigyas till I die in a P Chem State of Mind.\"\r\n**END***\r\n\r\nAnd now for the good stuff. \r\n\r\nI actually enjoyed writing a lot of the reports and watching my information get converted from random numbers to 40+ pages of analysis, figures, charts, tables and uncertainties.

I would be very wary to recommend this class to a varsity athlete, serious musician, YDN writer, etc... you will step away from those commitments a lot. You will fall behind in all your other classes except this one if around report deadlines. You will have trouble studying for other finals up through reading period. It was quite an experience. That being said, it isn't worth taking the loss of the BS to BA just for this one class. You have to learn this grind some time: all fields of chemistry their version of it. ",
            "\u00a0No one taking this course has a choice, so instead I will frame this response around the question you are wondering. Is the Chemistry major at Yale worth taking this class? Here is my honest answer: no. Not at all. This is the worst class at Yale, and there is nothing that comes even close to the amount of suffering you will endure in this course. However, I, as I'm sure many of you as well, want/must/need to get the chemistry degree, so this class is a requirement. Let me go into details/experiences that will give you info about what you are about to get into in this class. I can't be too specific because this class is very small and it would be obvious which student I am if I gave a lot of info, so you should ask older chemistry majors in person about this class if you want more specific answers. \r\nThe lab reports are the longest assignments you will ever have at Yale. You will spend countless hours doing essentially endless number manipulation, graph formatting, and captioning for Vaccaro's very specific and detailed lab report instructions. Each lab report will take a small piece of your soul, and each one gets slighter longer/harder than the last. The last two lab reports are done mostly during the beginning of reading week and you will spend every waking moment trying to get them done, meaning you will have absolutely no time to study for your other finals or do your other assignments. My recommendation is that you find a friend, preferably one that will have the same schedule as you, and figure out how to do each lab report together. Trying to do this class alone is signing yourself for doom; you can not do it, so don't try.\r\nThe final at the end of the semester is just a slap to the face for all the students. There is no need for it to exist. It is an extremely specific final that you have almost no hope in preparing yourself for. Most students do very poorly on the final. \r\nIf you have good TAs, that can really change how difficult this class is for you. For anonymity, I won't say more about this besides I hope you have a understanding and nice set of TAs.\r\nApparently this class is also being taught in the spring with a different professor. I don't know if that will be any better, but there is nothing that could be as bad as this class, so the spring version might be better.\r\nI want to leave the end of this review to talk about the general feeling and mindset you will have in this course.\r\nFirst of all, you will witness yourself and every single one of your friends taking this course deteriorate over the course of the semester physically, mentally, and emotionally. I don't want to get too specific on here, but I saw myself nearly enter a depression because of this course, and I saw very similar effects on my friends. You will skip all your other classes. You will not sleep. You will not eat. The people who minimize the catastrophic effect this class has on their life are people who bend over backwards to plan their schedule to be as light as possible for the semester. If anyone tells you this class is \"doable,\" ask them how many other classes/jobs/clubs they did the semester they took this class. This class demands that you drop every other thing in your life to devote all of your time to it; this is inherently targeted against first-gen, low-income students who must have jobs and other responsibilities for the semester (another example at Yale of the privilege rich white men have here). If you have to take any other hard or difficult classes with p. chem lab, accept the fact that you will do bad in them. One of the most difficult and stressful things for me to deal with this semester was not dealing with my grade in p chem lab, but rather having to watch every single one of my grades in my other classes sequentially fall. You will feel so defeated and so stupid at the end of this course. Do not give up. This course is not a reflection on you and is in every way a reflection upon the people who run/made it. Good luck ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely not! Yale students will add more to their college experience by taking a different class that seeks to better them as an academic, encourages critical thinking, expands their understanding, and values their education. This class dominates all of your time for an entire semester. It is almost impossible to balance it with anything in a healthy manner. This class is the exact opposite of what it means to attend Yale. ",
            "\u00a0It's a good class, but AVOID IT AT ALL COSTS. ",
            "\u00a0The venerable CHEM 330L will prove to be one of the most formative experiences in your time at Yale. The skills you gain from this course (vide infra), especially viz. thorough data analysis and organization of a full technical lab report, will be useful in a scientific career. I would highly recommend this course! ",
            "\u00a0Caffeine, nicotine or both. This class is very difficult for no reason. Make sure to take it with a friend. The numbers amount to nothing and it can be very disheartening when you work for 40 hours on a report and receive a bad grade. You do a bunch of number analysis to only regurgitate what was on the instruction packet. This class was very stressful and I will emphasis starting early. I waited to do reports last minute and it was the worst decision of my life. Do not take this class early in the week as you will spend your weekend doing a lab report. I did not learn anything. I did not gain anything. ",
            "\u00a0if you're taking this course you are a BS or BS intensive chem major, an idiot or into BDSM. instead of a recommendation here is how to survive the class!\r\n\r\n1- make a best friend! then do your labs with the support of this person. Just having another person around while you work is great. Also its good to check your errors (read uncertainty calculations) against theirs. it is MUCH easier to figure out data analysis with a friend. Really i cannot say how much having a good friend to work through it all changes the lab experience. I thought it was an insane amount of work, but realistically it will be nowhere close to as grueling if you have a bestie!\r\n\r\n2- work ahead of time!! work work work and do not wait until the last moments to write a lab! i got through this class by working on the labs slowly over many days- i think this is the best way to go, it keeps things low stress and will prevent you from being up all night and also using late days\r\n\r\n3- save your late days! until the end, trust me it is worth it\r\n\r\n4- take it in the fall semester and use BOTH fall break and thanksgiving break to work on lab, trust me, this will be very much worth it!!!!\r\n\r\n5- lab 2 is a HUGE jump from lab 1- go to the peer tutor to learn about how to do errors, OR figure it out on your own with many days to spare\r\nbut whatever you do, DO NOT procrastinate on this lab or others! \r\n\r\n6- see above, do NOT procrastinate\r\n\r\n7- i didnt do this but im positive some people got burned out and wrecked because they did not spread their work out and work on the labs- honestly, each one is like sprinting a marathon- if you get anything from this review, just work work work and do not procrastinate! if you kinda plan around blocks of time to work on this lab then you can still have fun!!! seriously\r\n\r\n8- learn to use igor pro, do not use chipmunk basic to calculate your least squares regressions, use igor, it will be far faster, once you learn to manipulate graphs on igor you will work much faster!\r\n\r\n9- the tas are your friends, so is the peer tutor/loneliness is your number 1 enemy\r\n\r\n10- hmm i cant think of that much more to say, other than itll be ok, honestly as long as you are on top of your work and find a POSITIVE bestie\r\n\r\ngood luck ",
            "\u00a0This course will be okay! You will get through it in one piece and can keep your sanity and weekends if you plan correctly. Please ask for help because the biggest time sink is needing to redo things (ask the Peer Tutors!!). Please start the reports with at least 5 days (better a week or more) before they are due. Each report increases in difficultly, but many things will begin to feel like second nature. Try to do as many things correctly the first time around (formatting graphs, writing out the names of things, doing error correctly), so you can save time by not going through the reports a million more times.   \r\nThe course is very pedagogically sound, it never feels that you are doing something without a point. The 15 page report limit means nothing, though. The later reports will end up being MUCH longer because of graphs and tables. \r\nThe grading is not terribly harsh, so you will be rewarded by good work that follows the rules (answer the questions in the packets and follow the formatting guidelines). Please study for the final! You will do fine if you study. \r\nAgain, you can do this!! Its really a bonding experience with your classmates. ",
            "\u00a0Don't take this course unless you need to, don't take this course unless you need to, don't take this course unless you need to. I cannot stress that enough. If you are reading this and for some unbelievable reason you just want to be in the class for the \"intellectual stimulation,\" you are going to severely play yourself and generations of Yale Chem Majors are laughing profusely at you. I suggest you re-evaluate your life if you are one of those people. If you need to take this course for the major though, I am so sorry that you are here reading this. Because you are definitely in for a world of hurt and I wouldn't wish the pain of this class on anyone. If you want to do well in this class along with the other difficult courses you are probably taking, good fucking luck honestly. It might be easier to just accept that this semester is going to be shitty and that you are going to see your grades fall in your other classes as a result of the stress of this class. It's either that, or you slave away this semester and set aside no time for yourself. I know that I wasn't going to give up the time that I needed for myself. Even with that resolve, I still managed to give up a lot of routines and time I had in place for self-care and that really destroyed me this semester. Obviously, I want to maintain my anonymity, but I will go as far as to say that my mental health took quite a turn this semester. I started feeling very depressed this semester, the trigger being the sheer amount of stress and self-doubt that this class gave me. The stress made me irritable, and that really caused me to lash out against the people I cared the most about. I couldn't really see what was happening too clearly until I finished the final. A weight was lifted off of my shoulders and I started to feel so much better. The self-doubt that I got from this class was that I began to constantly question my intelligence. As you can imagine, this did not do much for my self-esteem and mental health this semester. But you need to remember that you are smart. You go to Yale!! Sometimes you really aren't the problem and courses here are just shitty. It definitely took me a long time to remember that again, and I wish I reminded myself of this a little more this semester. Because I've taken some pretty bad courses at Yale, but never one like this. I obviously cannot guarantee that you will feel the same way too if you take the course, but I'm letting you know the reality of how things were this semester. I know that I definitely lost a bit of my soul every single week that I had to go into this lab. And you'll see your friends in the course feeling the same way too. I know I'm not the only one that took the course this semester that can speak to the issues of mental health this course incites. I just hope that the people who decide to take the course know themselves well enough to know what is going on with themselves. I would honestly say your goal for this class should not be to get an A. It should really be to just pass with as much of your happiness as possible. Please make sure to take care of yourself, take care of your friends, get sleep, live life. Because no class should make you feel as terrible as this one will, especially if you are an over-achiever. I know this review has been so negative and I would like to try y best to end on a slightly positive note. So I will say that maybe this course will be different next semester. There will be a new professor and maybe he'll take into account the reviews of the class that have been this way for years and change the structure of the course. But of course, I don't want to promise anything since this new professor could just as easily run the course the same exact way. And that would really suck since the professor change is a huge change. Maybe the chemistry department will eventually see that this course needs to be changed even if the professor change doesn't do much. Please just remember to focus on self-care. ",
            "\u00a0I wouldnt- Unless you're training to run an ultra marathon. This course will give you the mental strength required to complete one. There are far better ways to spend a semester at Yale and far more engaging classes that you can take that offer a better ratio of work put in to what is actually gained from the class- this class probably has the worst ratio of this made up quantity of any Yale class. The entire time youre in lab, youre just trying to get done as quickly as possible so that you can get back to working on the lab reports which surely will keep you up to the early hours regardless of when you start. Yes I heeded Vaccaros advice by starting early. A week or more for each lab. Several weeks for some labs- as soon as I finished the lab in just about every case, but it didnt matter. After hours of typing data into some program and analyzing it, you will find that you made some mistake near the beginning and will have to decide whether to start from the beginning or just be content with what you have. Or youll reach some part of the lab write up that you have no idea how to do and if youre wise youll just stop working on the lab until you receive help, but either way youll wish you didnt waste that much time when youre up at 4am the day the lab is due. When you finally reach Thanksgiving break, you have two labs left, and their lab reports are the longest. Either you work hours each day of break to get part of one lab write up done- which youll likely do incorrectly if its the nuclear magnetic resonance lab- or youre not going to have a chance to study for an exam during reading week which you probably wont even if you get started over break. Did I mention this class has a written, comprehensive exam thats 3.5 hours. Half of what it covers is the theoretical grounds underlying each lab, which was decently explained in each lab instruction packet, but you never had the chance to fully understand even as a conscientious student because who has time to read and understand 30-60 pgs of lab instruction before each weeks experiment and finish the report? And if youre taking pchem lecture this semester their exams are less than 24 hours apart. If you are brilliant, you will make it through this lab, if you are brilliant and hardworking, you will do well in this lab. If you are neither, this lab is probably not for you. ",
            "\u00a0You poor, poor little soul. My deepest condolences. You may be weak now, unsure of how an oscilloscope works or how to perform a linear least squares regression or proper error propagation analyses, but you, my dear friend, shall soon become strong, forged in the fires of the hell that is pchem lab. The 200+ pages you will write over the course of this semester shall harden you. You may have taken advanced labs before or worked for other professors, but NOTHING  can truly prepare you for this experience. You will have less than an hour a night for the work for all your other classes combined because every waking moment will be consumed with pchem data analysis, reading extensively detailed packets, and writing more than anyone will ever want to read ever. I wrote 71 pages for this class in one week. Finals week. and my reports tended to be shorter than those of my friends. Have fun not sleeping for the entire semester. Welcome to your chemistry baptism in the fires of hell. ",
            "\u00a0This is the dark of winter.\r\nThis is the last semester of Vaccaro 330L. \r\nThis is the dawn of spring. \r\n\r\nIf you wish this course onto someone else, I would consider taking a class on empathy. \r\n\r\nTo imagine how much work this class takes, I would think of the most work-intensive class you took and multiply by at least 7 times. This is because you will be spending every day of the week working on Pchem lab. Your work, however, will be deeper than a dark hole. Your emotion energy will be spaghettified, and coffee will not save you. Your other grades will suffer, as will your friends from dealing with your negativity. You will, however, be slightly consoled by the fact there are several others whose souls are being ripped to shreds. This is coming from someone who did well in the course and emerged less scarred than other people but still damaged. \r\n\r\nI would hope you enjoy Excel and Word Processing. I spent an estimated 300+ hrs on it. I typed up a non-estimated 201 pages. I made too too many graphs to count. I did learn some pchem but at the pain of 1000 habaneros down my esophagus. I am only slightly slightly salty I didn't get a writing credit. \r\n\r\nI was only saved by the absurdly high niceness and helpfulness of Clay and Zach. Clay I would say was like bad cop - always looking out for you in the best possible way but also ready to roast you at a moments notice. Zach was like good cop - there's nothing really bad to say here. They both put an unbelievable amount of energy and time into helping with experiments, grading the lab reports, and joking around and lightening up the atmosphere. Through at the bottom of the Mariana Trench, admittedly, reducing the pressure is both difficult and an act of genius. \r\n\r\nThere are many people who changed their major (or just didn't even consider majoring in chemistry) to avoid taking this course, including my suitemate. I sincerely hope that you are one of them. ",
            "\u00a0I would only take this course if you are taking a lighter-than-average courseload otherwise. It is easily the hardest course I have ever taken, AND gives the most work of any course Ive ever taken in my life. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend it only if it's required. It's too much work to do as a non-required class. ",
            "\u00a0If you are taking this class it is because it is required of you. I'm not going to tell you to change majors to avoid it; it's a gauntlet that all chem majors have to go through and I get it. But take caution. Believe what you hear about the difficulty and the tedium of the lab reports. Some will take 10-20 hours. Soem will take 40. Finishing it will be like working a full time job, in addition to whatever other classes and responsibilities you have. Take 4 credits, MAXIMUM; consider talking to your dean about taking 3 or 3.5. Don't expect too much in terms of a good grade. I know people who did well or fine in this class, in terms of grades, although this was not the case for myself, no matter what I tried. Be ready for both possibilities. Also PLAN IN ADVANCE. Start your lab reports as soon as the data is collected, so you know exactly what you have to do and can budget time for what all these processes will take you. Best of luck. ",
            "\u00a0The Office, Season 7, episode 19, Minute 14:45\r\n\r\nI'm going to start off with some advice and words of wisdom for the chem majors who are required to take this course. First off, this course does NOT  define your intelligence or your competence in any way. Know this. There will be times when you will literally feel so stupid, upset, FRUSTRATED, and tired of everything is course has to offer. But you will power through this because I believe in you. Don't forget to eat and take care of your health the best you can. This is literally just one course and is not important in the grad scheme of things. The lab reports get hard once you reach phase equilibrium (report 3) ... GIVE YOURSELF AT LEAST 3 DAYS MINIMUM TO DO THIS LAB.\r\n\r\nOn another note. lol. lol. Literally one of the most difficult and frustrating courses I have taken at Yale. Probably one of the hardest things I've gone through in my life so far, maybe on equal footing, viscerally, to my first heartbreak. I am someone who is usually pretty good at managing my time and working under stress, but for the first time in my life, there was a course that almost broke me. It consumed by social life, all my time, and mentally drained me to many points of exhaustion. Take this with a light courseload if you can. it's doable and manageable... but at a cost. The learning curve is like climbing Mt. Everest with flip flops on. Goodspeed. "
