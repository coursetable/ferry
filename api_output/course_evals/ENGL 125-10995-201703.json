            "\u00a0I became much more familiar with canonical English poetry. I also improved my analytical essay skills. ",
            "\u00a0Sharpened my writing; developed a degree of critical patience and a readiness to approach texts that -- on first face -- might not be the most inviting or exciting ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to close read texts in order to pull out and find interesting details which make the works much more meaningful. My writing skills increased tremendously! ",
            "\u00a0I suppose what this course's analysis hinged on was the interpretation of single words in the context of the story; how their meanings were changed and shaped by the author. This narrow-sighted view of a single word standing out and being part of the evolving narrative as a whole is the main take-away from this course.\r\nBeyond that, the pace forced one to read quickly, while also taking important notes and being able to make meaningful observations about the text. ",
            "\u00a0Learning how to construct a clear, specific, and arguable point. I thought I knew how to do this at the beginning, but this class really forced me to refine this skill. Also exposure to a survey of poets, some well known some less well known. ",
            "\u00a0A substantial overview of English texts from 1350-1700; techniques for reading these texts; and different methods of approach. ",
            "\u00a0I read early English poetry, which was something I'd never been exposed to, and learned how to read Middle English. I also learned new strategies for writing effective introductions and conclusions to a paper. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to analyse poetry in greater depth than i did in high school, to the extent that I could actually extract meaningful philosophical insight, as well. I also developed knowledge about the foundations of English literature and poetry. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to sharpen my skills of critical reading and essay writing, as well as a broader understanding of early English poetry, and more specific understandings of a wide selection of authors. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely learned to write better pointed essays and introductions of essays specifically. I also learned that background knowledge of works are great to understanding the work better, but you can definitely still gain so much insight with just your own analysis independent of research. I also learned to use the OED to facilitate my understanding of certain works! "

            "\u00a0In general, I think our discussions were weightier when we worked with one author for a sustained period of time (Chaucer, Shakespeare, Milton), and could chart stylistic, thematic, and figural turns over an extended body of work. (-- As well as apprehend the ambitions and anxieties of the poet as poet, and apply them to the text itself.) With the lyric section, I think, it was a bit harder to find points of entry -- to find meaningful ways of reading individual poems, and of putting constituent poems in dialogue. In the end, that unit felt a bit less ambitious than the other two. We did some good close readings of individual poems in class, but I felt that the discussions didn't really build -- didn't really accumulate, interact, gather towards a conclusion -- as satisfyingly as they did earlier and later in the term. In theory, the significance of \"anonymity\" and \"identity\" provided a (unifying) conceptual vocabulary, but I'm not quite sure we really took advantage of them as a framework -- a \"way in\" to the poems, and a way to motivate reading them alongside one another. I also have mixed feelings on the inclusion of As You Like It. While I do think it's a productive opportunity to step back and mull over the sonnet, our discussion felt a bit unfocused and general (-- undoubtedly because there's so much else to talk about: gender play, dramatics, et al.) In the future, I think it would be more generative -- for aim and project of the course -- to do a compressed sweep through the play, allocating a day to it, and anchoring conversation on the status of lyric forms. This day could then be used to expand discussion on a poet that syllabus gave short shrift. Donne and the Holy Sonnets, in particular, could have used more time and more attention -- or perhaps we could have given proper care to Amelia Lanyer, who was (mostly) elided into Milton. ",
            "\u00a0We spent a lot of time talking about general themes of the texts, rather than going in depth in specific passages. But this also was good, because it allowed us to relate what we read to other texts in the course and make surprising connections. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course, as described earlier, was the ability to focus on a single aspect of the text for the entire section period; and be able to delve into its specific meaning. The problem here is that much of the other information in the text is lost; and the course could do well from a more expansive view of the text. Oftentimes, reading 100 pages would focus on one word said over 3-4 pages and much of the other interesting and meaningful conversation would not be discussed.\r\n\r\nAnother thing which surprised me was how 'English Poetry I' is a rather misleading title for the course. For the literary layman, such as myself, from 'English Poetry' one might expect a greater focus on short-form poems like the Sonnets of Shakespeare, Browning, or even Kipling. This allows one to focus on one aspect of the poem, and still encompass the entire narrative, because of its nature. What one receives while taking this class, however is Epic Poetry, Chaucer, Milton (whose prose can hardly be thought to be poetry at all) and As You Like it, a play. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I loved the different pieces of early English literature I was exposed to. I think the balance between longer works and shorter collections of poems was great, and the types of assignments we received were well balanced and always varied enough to be interesting, but similar enough to improve upon the same type of critical thinking/writing skills \r\nWeaknesses: I wish we would have read maybe one less canterbruy tale and focused more on individual poems in the lyric unit -- that felt a bit rushed. ",
            "\u00a0As any of the professors will tell you, English Poetry I is both a very old course and a very new course: very old in that it is the revamped permutation of Major English Poets I, which is truly an old course; and very new in that the course has been revamped in rather important, substantial ways. The absence of the word \"Major\" is, of course, part of a general effort to divest from the canon, which has empowered the syllabus to move into new territory in often interesting ways. However, the course is still unstable because it is so new and because so much of the new territory is tempting; but it is simply unfeasible to cover everything that used to go ignored, and it is still incumbent on the department to find a suitable middle ground. This partly means that the strongest parts of the course are the parts that haven't been changed. Given the strength of the team, however, I feel that this course will soon become extremely strong in its own right. ",
            "\u00a0Writing Canvas posts and reading others' posts was a helpful and enriching supplement to the class discussion. I also really enjoyed the field trip to the Beineckethe chance to hold manuscripts of some of the works we were reading was a memorable experience. I also liked reading a play interspersed with the poetry but wish we had less time reading Medieval poetry and/or had focused on fewer poets. I felt that I didn't get a good grounding in any of the poets, so I think focusing on just a few would have helped with that. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were the quality of engagement in both the students and professor. The weakness was the lack of clarity for students not at the same level as others. ",
            "\u00a0The course was fantastic, and I only wish we'd had more time to spend on each of the authors we read. ",
            "\u00a0The online forum was definitely helpful to encouraging engagement with texts that you may have a hard time with. It helps with increasing participation in class as well, and I think that the professor was really great with getting everyone to feel comfortable sharing their thoughts in class. The syllabus was also not too overwhelming and the sequence of it was definitely interesting to understanding all the texts in relation with each other. "

            "\u00a0Very much so take this course if you're at all interested in the material! Especially with Catherine Nicholson, she is the most intelligent, responsive, encouraging, positive instructor who never fails to keep you engaged and is so knowledgeable and gives excellent, constructive feedback on your writing. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to students who might want to be English majors because it is one of the prereqs. There were some non-English majors in my class who seemed to enjoy it, but you have to really like English poetry. If you just happen to like English poetry, you might want to take a higher level class on the type of poetry you're interested in because this class is a survey. Professor Nicholson  is very helpful, offers really good essay feedback, and is a good discussion leader. I would take this class with her if you can! The 5 writing assignments increase in complexity and weight, which is good because if your first assignments aren't amazing it won't hurt your grade too much and you'll know you need to improve before it's too late. The reading is pretty evenly distributed too. ",
            "\u00a0Take it! The poems are rich (Chaucer, in particular, re: construals of authorship and all, is an unexpected delight) and the essays are rewarding to write. Can't speak authoritatively, but having conferred with some friends in other sections, I'd say Prof. Nicholson is the person to take it with. She does a wonderful job of guiding discussion towards the relevant and rigorous (without ever scripting it), and of encouraging students to put their insights in dialogue with each others' -- towards greater insights. Class was almost always lively and students were almost always excited. -- Which says a lot, because, well, let's face it: Chaucer and co. aren't exactly the most enticing bunch.\r\n\r\nIf you're feeling wary because it's an intro class: While there were sometimes depths left unplumbed, office hours and essays were great places to wrestle with threads that didn't feel fully explored. You really can go as far into the poems as you want to go. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student who wishes to gain a more in-depth familiarity with poetry. I didn't know much about English poetry coming into the class, but I found myself invested in the Canterbury Tales and Paradise Lost more than I thought I would have. The seminar classes are mostly lead by the students, so the discussions can go wherever you want them to. Professor Nicholson is incredibly engaging and passionate about the texts, which makes reading them so much more exciting! ",
            "\u00a0This would depend on what the student desires from the course. If the student is looking for \"English Poetry\" in any common sense of the word, i would not recommend it, since clearly much of the focus is not on what normal people would call 'Poetry,' and they would be disappointed to find that 70% of their reading is put to waste, since it's never brought up in class.\r\n\r\nIf a student is, however, looking to fulfill the requirement of the major, and can do a reasonable job in focusing on a single aspect of the text without analyzing its entirety, i would wholeheartedly not object to them taking the course. ",
            "\u00a0YES! Whether or not you're an english major, you will get a lot out of this course -- and a real appreciation for the evolution of the English language. ",
            "\u00a0Well, it's a requirement, but I think it's a very good one. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! We read interesting poetry, had great discussions, and professor Nicholson was fabulous. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of the things we read in this course were a little difficult to get through, and the Middle English was definitely an adjustment, so I would recommend this course only to prospective English majors or people who really love early English poetry. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, to gain a strong grasp of foundational literature as a basis for further study ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely.  The class was engaging, stimulating, and pushed me as both a reader and a writer. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! The syllabus was always engaging and the insight (and how we moved towards the insight) we gained together as a class from the readings will continue to stick with me. "
