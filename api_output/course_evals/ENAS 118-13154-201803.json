            "\u00a0If you are wanting to explore engineering in a hands on way, this is the class for you! They teach you a variety of skills and types of engineering, and the final project is so applicable to life! ",
            "\u00a0I learned real life problem solving for a legitimate issue a client brought us. I learned how to present test results, how to plan for the future, and how to approach real world problems step by step. More explicitly, I learned coding with Arduino and became comfortable with solid works and 3D printing, as well as machine shopping. ",
            "\u00a0I learned much more about mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and computer science. It was very helpful it learning how to build circuits and create objects out of raw materials. You also learn how to work with a group on a project, so problem solving and delegating tasks are skills you develop as well. ",
            "\u00a0I learned all of the basic engineering skills, ranging from Arduino programming, to breadboard wiring, to making use of various sensors. ",
            "\u00a0I gained knowledge in different types of engineering like chemical, software, mechanical and biomedical. I learned how to use different machines in the CEID such as the 3D printer and laser cutter. I also learned more about the build design process when making a product. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the very basic levels of many different types of engineering and what an engineer in each of these fields might do. More importantly, I learned project skills such as teamwork, planning, taking input from the client, and working together to create a final product. More specifically, skills I learned for our product included arduino code, soldering, and electronics details. ",
            "\u00a0I think that I learned basic information about the various fields of engineering. However, I felt that the majority of that information taught in the class I had a grasp on before taking the class. The main things that I learned where the basics of coding, arduinos, and CAD. I also think I learned about the ideation and engineering process. ",
            "\u00a0This course allowed me to significantly  develop my problem solving skills. During our six week long project, we would constantly run into problems that needed to be solved, encouraging us to find creative solutions. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt may skills taking this course. I became CEID trained and learned how to operate many of the machines in the CEID. I also became exposed to coding and circuit building. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about various different types of engineering (mechanical, chemical, electrical, cs, etc) as well as the design process by working with real clients on campus to complete a project. I was also familiarized with the CEID. ",
            "\u00a0I learned what different types of engineering were as well as basic skills that each type uses. I learned how to code, laser cut, use the MakerBot, use an Arduino, etc. On top of this, I learned how to communicate with a client and create a product that solves their problem and consists of elements that they would like. ",
            "\u00a0Introductory coding, Solidworks, Machining, Laser Cutting ",
            "\u00a0First and foremost, I became trained and proficient on just about every tool or machine in the CEID as a result of this class. Furthermore, I developed base knowledge of and skills in every engineering discipline. that being said, most of my time in the class was spent on the final design project so most of the skills and knowledge I developed were in design thinking and the design/build process. I have never had such an in-depth experience before going from a problem to fully implemented solution. I gained a huge amount of experience in design thinking--always looking towards the next iteration of a component and synthesizing multiple group member's individual assignments into a larger product. I gained useful experience working with real clients, learning how to partner with them to work towards the best possible solution to their problem. Most importantly, I learned how to work on a real team of engineers, how to compromise and push back. To sum up, I learned what it is like to be a real engineer. ",
            "\u00a0Because the course content was so broad and taught at such a fast pace it was hard to retain much of the information we were presented. However, the course was extremely helpful in helping me decide (or eliminate) a major. Because we were presented with so many branches of engineering it helped me  decide which branches and areas I was truly interested in. ",

            "\u00a0I learned about many useful technologies from 3D printing to laser cutting to soldering. We were also trained to use many of the tools at CEID ranging from the handsaw to the drill. We also learned about the design thinking and project management as we worked on our 6-week client projects. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: project-based, manageable workload, gained valuable skills, real-world application\r\nWeaknesses: some of the lectures were boring, could have emphasized the design process more ",
            "\u00a0The project for this class was incredible. I learned a lot, and they were legitimate issues that I didnt think I could solve but ended up tackling it with a group of people I had never prior. However, I think the projects should be presented a few weeks earlier. We needed more time and this definitely could have been an issue that was solved if we started the projects earlier (concurrently with the class teachings). ",
            "\u00a0This course is very good at introducing students to engineering and helping them to apply this new knowledge to very real and very helpful projects. A weakness is that there's not a lot of time for the final project because the lecture part of the class and the project part are split evenly. It could be improved by limiting the amount of lecture time in the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I would say that the major strength of the course was the final project. The timeframe we had to complete the project and the execution went very well, and it was a satisfying and fun experience. Overall, I also think the lectures were well done, but for people learning this information for the first time, the class being first thing in the morning wasn't helpful. I also would say that for people that have never taken any CS before, the processing and Arduino programming is jumping into the deep end very fast. Because of this, it was unavoidable that the CS lectures focused more on how to program rather than the logic behind the programming and why it works. I would say that the largest weakness was the lectures on chemical, bio, and environmental engineering. There was only one lecture on each subject and it didn't feel like an overview of what it would be like to major in the subject. Maybe adding a little more emphasis on these subjects would be beneficial. ",
            "\u00a0The final project is very time consuming. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: learned so many applicable skills to engineering and groupwork. Teachers are engaged and class is interesting. \r\nWeaknesses: very little work in the beginning but by the end the work was a lot heavier. This is kind of unavoidable for this course though, since the projects need to be finished. ",
            "\u00a0I think the strengths of the course is the breadth of the course. I think the weakness was the depth of the information. I think that the areas that are focused on should be condensed (maybe only three types of engineering). I think this will enable the instructors to give more detailed lectures. However, I think the biggest weakness in the course is the final projects. I think the professors should screen the potential projects better so that they are all engineering focused, interesting and relatively similar. Additionally, I think that students should have some say in the projects that they spend half a semester and hundreds of hours working on. ",
            "\u00a0This has been a very good course, which is both able to convey what goes into the major engineering fields while also being very engaging and hands on. The only aspect I would consider a weakness is the limited amount of time we have to cover everything, with the topic of environmental engineering suffering the most as a result. ",
            "\u00a0I feel that this course taught many different skills and was broad. This is a good thing becasue it gave me exposure to many different fields of engineeirng. I do think that the final project was very fast paced. The first two weeks of the final project felt rushed and I was not ready for how fast paced the class became. ",
            "\u00a0I think the overall format of the course was good. We spent the first half of the semester learning about the different types of engineering and the second half working on our group projects. I enjoyed the labs and thought they did a good job relating to the course material. The only weakness was that the last few weeks of the semester were very hectic and stressful. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths include learning basic engineering skills and about each type of engineering. This course allows students who are unsure about engineering decide whether they want to pursue it any further. \r\nThe weakness of this course is that the environmental engineering lecture was more geared toward green engineering, so I felt like we did not cover environmental engineering. Thus, we didn't really have a lab that made us explore this type of engineering. It would be beneficial to hear about what environmental engineers do and have a corresponding lab during the time period before we start our projects. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: A good introduction to the design process, great teaching of various skills\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Last six weeks of the class depend on the project you're assigned to ",
            "\u00a0This course is extremely well thought out and taught. The teaching staff worked as a true team to move us through every engineering discipline in the first half of the course and then in the second half, as incredible mentors. I was given the space and resources I needed to thrive but was never left to struggle on my own. The only possible fault I can find is that the variety in the projects distributed amongst the students leads to drastically different experiences amongst teams. I think as the course becomes even more well-known, more projects will be available and the professors can be more selective though. ",
            "\u00a0I really think this course could offer a Science credit or a QR because it is such a heavy workload and time commitment that it feels deserving of more requirements being fulfilled by taking it. ",
            "\u00a0The course introduced me to the many disciplines of engineering and provided concrete labs that followed along with the lesson plan. I can't really pinpoint a weakness. But, I feel like if we were introduced to the projects in the beginning of the course - learning the skillsets along the way - the final product would have felt more meaningful. ",
            "\u00a0If you were put in a group project in the second half that you didn't like, you were stuck with it. If your group members didn't like it, you were stuck with people who didn't care about your project and took every opportunity to complain. I wish there had been something in place so everyone was a bit happier about what groups they were assigned to. Overall though, this class taught a lot about different skills and engineering practices. ",
            "\u00a0I think the hands-on working opportunity we get in this class is extremely useful and rewarding. I think the class was amazing in almost every single aspect.\r\nIt might have been better if we were given the chance to indicate our preferences for the client projects, so that everyone could be placed into the projects they liked better.  \r\nThe workload is very heavy right before and during the reading week. "

            "\u00a0Yes! This class was fun and I gained valuable skills. I learned how to use different resources at the CEID and got to work with a client on a real issue in the New Haven community. ",
            "\u00a0It the best hands on intro to engineering available at year! I implore you to try it! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. As a sophomore in mechanical engineering, this has been the most beneficial and real world class thus far. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because it was very interesting and very thorough in putting our skills to practice. Students may be hesitant because it doesn't count as a distributional requirement, but it is worth taking because it's really interesting and you get real world experience. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to any student, regardless of your previous experience. I came into this class from a STEM high school where I took a class very similar to this in my freshman year, so I knew most of the information that we learned already. For people with a lot of experience, this class will certainly be easy during the lecture period, but the experience of doing the final project and working closely with Dean Wilczynski and Dr Wilen makes it worth it. For someone that has no experience in engineering, the class might be on the tougher side because you are learning CS in the quickest and most surface level way. However, this class provides you with the crucial information necessary for engineering, and it is an excellent intro course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes it is a very good introductory course to engineering ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! This is an incredible course for anyone who is interested in engineering! You will learn so much about the different kinds of engineering and do an awesome final project that is super rewarding ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend the course if you could be guaranteed to get a project you want. If you end up with a project that is not interesting, the class becomes miserable. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who considers taking it. Despite the amount of time that needs to be put towards the class, every minute experiencing what it is like to work on a project such as the ones we did is very valuable. It is a very fun and fulfilling class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would. This lets a student know whether or not they will like engineering and which field of engineering. Plus it is very hands on which is something I enjoyed. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course covers a broad range of topics, which is good for a student considering engineering as a major. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student who is considering engineering but is unsure if they want to pursue it. This class is a way to find out if engineering is for them or not. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially if you want to be an engineer. Just know that the workload of the project phase is REAL ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to any student--engineering major or not. The design thinking skills gained over the semester are invaluable and the opportunities ENAS 118 offers are unmatched. If you have the time, take this class. ",
            "\u00a0Depends on the person, but for most I would say no (though it is with dismay). The amount of work was excessive for a class that only offered a normal credit. However, if the person is interested in engineering and knows they want to do some type of engineering this course would really help them decide  where they would like to focus. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! I can't recommend this course enough.You get really familiar with the tools and space at the CEID while having a great time. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to someone who was willing to put in the group work and they did not know what they wanted to major in yet knew they enjoyed engineering. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this to any student even with the slightest interest in hands-on working. It is by far the most interesting and rewarding class I have ever taken. It was really satisfying to build something from scratch every week in our labs and eventually through our 6-week client project. We got to use and get trained on many of the cool technologies available at CEID including 3D printers and the laser cutter. I think it is a great opportunity that such a class is offered where one can get a fully hands-on project experience in contrast to simple classroom learning. "
