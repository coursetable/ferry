            "\u00a0The class is clearly designed to teach the fundamentals of linear algebra and multivariable calculus to economics and other socials science major students. As a result, the content was not too difficult but still supplied us with important basics that will be useful in the future. A lot of class time was devoted to working example problems, which was good for preparing for quizzes. However, it would have perhaps been helpful to spend more time understanding concepts and the derivation of equations and methods. ",
            "\u00a0The weekly quizzes really help you not get too behind in the course. However, I did not like how the material we were learning in class was the material on a quiz two weeks later. This was not really an issue at the beginning of the school year, but as the course dragged on, the quiz and the material learned seemed to drift further apart. ",
            "\u00a0The course is fairly well-structured. The first half of the class is linear algebra, which is fairly straightforward, and the second half of the class is Calc 3, which is much faster paced and complex. ",
            "\u00a0The class moves at a pretty solid rate and, on the whole, makes sense ",
            "\u00a0Some of the final and midterm questions were not accurate to what we had learned and been tested on during quizzes ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of this course is its structure - the weekly homeworks and quizzes ensure that students stay on top of the material and practice it enough to learn it. The course is also very straightforward, in that the material assigned for the homework matches what is on the quizzes which matches what is on the exams. I found that this made the course very fair, and made studying relatively straightforward. Prof. Rosenthal is also generous enough to hold weekly review sessions to ensure students can ask questions and clear up difficulties. ",

            "\u00a0The course is structured very very well. No psets, just quizzes every week. The weakness is the Professor. He is a smart guy but does not know how to teach concepts. Or explain anything. When someone asks a question he kind of just puts it off. But the textbooks are helpful so thats how youll learn. And he takes off points for the silliest things. Ugh. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Rosenthal has structured classes (in my view) in a perfect way. The schedule of quizzes and review sessions was extremely beneficial. ",
            "\u00a0This course provides a very cursory overlook into linear algebra and multivariable calculus. The course does not make any direct reference to applications within the social sciences. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n-the review sessions on Wednesdays Prof Rosenthal holds are technically optional, but most people agree that it was the most helpful class each week. You basically go over the questions he selects from the homework as important the day before the weekly quizzes. They are almost like class, and I think almost everybody came because they were so helpful\r\n-professor is a fun guy, I think he liked our class, was friendly in a teasing way\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n-sometimes in lesson I felt like the material could have been explained more clearly; oftentimes a concept wasn't hard but the way he explained it was a little confusing, but you have the textbook if you really can't understand\r\n-the textbook is overpriced for this class, and make sure you get the right one because you need two (one linear algebra, one multivariable) and a bunch of people bought the wrong edition at the beginning of the year and it was a hassle to return it once they realized, halfway into the class ",
            "\u00a0Very, very straightforward class where the quiz material is covered by our weekly homeworks. I liked how it was much easier than 120 or 223 but you get the basics for both. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students interested in social science who are not great fans of difficult math. I found this class useful in learning the essentials of linear and multivariable, and now feel that I will have the necessary fundamental knowledge for future economics courses. However, if students are searching for in-depth and super-challenging math, I would suggest another class. ",
            "\u00a0I took this class because I was hoping it would be an easier version of 120. It was, and if you are trying to fulfill a math requirement for a major like Econ, then I think this is a good choice. However, if you are trying to be an Econ/Math major or another major that requires more math, you may want to take 120 and then 222 (or another linear algebra course). ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to most students. The material is not incredibly difficult, but for an Econ major, the class doesnt focus on Econ-relevant topics until the very end the term. The course does have some advantages in its structure because there are weekly quizzes and review sessions. ",
            "\u00a0I would if you're interested in Econ/some other social science. Or if you enjoyed calc BC in high school and want to learn more, but don't want to take it all the way up to 120. ",
            "\u00a0Maybe if you're willing to put extra effort in to learning the material on your own time and have a strong command of the material so you can handle questions on the midterms/final that were not reviewed during the quizzes ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend this course to a student who needs calculus for their economics (or other) degree, but doesn't feel comfortable taking a more advanced multivariable class. This course would probably not be suitable for a math or engineering major, as it does not cover all the material they need. ",

            "\u00a0Yes! take it. ",
            "\u00a0It is a good ending math for Econ majors. Good overview of concepts. But thats if you want to deal with the weaknesses of the professors teaching. ",
            "\u00a0It is a good course for gaining the fundamental skills needed for mathematics in economics. However, the math often felt a bit simplistic, which may not be satisfying for those seeking a challenge. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student if they are not seeking to take any further math classes. ",
            "\u00a0It says it's for econ majors, and I think basically everybody in the class wanted to do econ so if that's not the major you want to take, I wouldn't recommend this course. But it was pretty straightforward material, the weekly quizzes kept you on track, and the pace was pretty slow. The only weird thing was that he would teach material that would then be quizzed the week after, so the material was always a week ahead/ quizzes were always a week behind. ",
