            "\u00a0I developed a fundamental knowledge of playwriting, by reading at least two plays and writing at least one scene every week. I learned a lot about how a play is not a story, and how you have to deliberately disguise information. I learned about the importance of stakes, and why they are crucial for drama. I learned about exposition and how not to have too much nor too little about it. I learned about myself, by being forced to write dramatic personal scenes. I learned about playwrights' methods, by studying their work and their introductions. I learned about America, by reading its seminal plays. ",
            "\u00a0This course transformed the way I think about playwriting. Exposure to so many great plays revealed to me how powerful a play can be, as well as the artistic techniques and methods of writing that contribute to a play's overall impact. ",
            "\u00a0We learned about the structure of stories, particularly plays. We studied Playwriting through case studies of plays and playwrights in the 20th century (mostly). ",
            "\u00a0A better understanding of playwriting ",
            "\u00a0We studied a variety of Professor Margulie's favorite plays as well as learning how to generate ideas and write our own one-act plays. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a vastly increased ability to write plays (and other kinds of fiction, notably screenplays) well, and a much greater appreciation for and understanding of theater as an art form. ",
            "\u00a0The art of dramatic writing, read numerous wonderful, beautiful, funny, sad plays - experimenting with a variety of different forms, premises, etc. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Amazing course. The one weakness is you discuss the content of each play for at least half an hour but there is no follow through once you have said what you said. What I mean by this is that there is no final exam so you feel like what you say is kind of pointless. Still fun to talk about though. ",
            "\u00a0Class time is divided between analysis of assigned plays and workshopping of student work. While this is an effective way of dividing up the class, we often fell behind with reading student work, and thus had to cut short our discussions of the assigned plays. The course could be improved simply by being longer, or maybe having a section in which we share work we didn't get to share during class. Office hours helped make up for the lack of class time, however. ",
            "\u00a0This is a really wonderful crash course in playwrighting. The course teaches you how to write, what it's like to be in a writers' group, and how to talk about plays. \r\n\r\nThe course is only as diverse as its members - our members were almost entirely white men, so we didn't always have the most inclusive discussions/viewpoints. ",
            "\u00a0The reading material is of very high quality; professor Margulies is, as one would imagine, very knowledgeable about the craft of playwriting ",
            "\u00a0I loved this course.  Every week we would read at least two plays, and we would work on our final projects and/or write mini-scenes inspired by the week's topic.  The in-class discussions were interesting and helpful.  We would take time at the end for discussion of each other's works.  Sometimes I wish we spent a little more time on this portion and less on discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Most of what made up the course were strengths: the quality of the plays that Professor Margulies selected, the articulate and highly helpful lessons in playwriting techniques that Professor Margulies gave us through our weekly exercises and crafted around the content of the play(s) that we read each week, and the relatively productive in-class workshop format. If there were any weaknesses, I would say they were the lack of broader feedback, and especially actual grades, that Professor Margulies gave us over the course of the semester, and the somewhat cramped time for in-class readings of each student's work, particularly their final projects. I'm not sure what the solution might be for the latter problem, beyond simply having more class time, but as to the first problem, I think that it would be immensely helpful for future students if Professor Margulies emailed each student with some occasional feedback on the weekly exercises but especially on the final project, so that students didn't have to scramble to write down his extemporaneous notes during class, and actually gave at least some of the regular assignments a letter grade, so that students weren't simply swimming in the dark, grade-wise, for most of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Sharing and reading eachother's work out loud, being able to discuss the material we've read in a very equal, safe, and engaging atmosphere with the professor guiding not dominating.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There were so many assignments and sad we didn't have the time to share them all. ",
            "\u00a0This course does a great job at both expanding your knowledge of existing plays and playwrights, and using the plays read each week to strategically show the different possibilities for structuring and writing a play. The format of each seminar meeting is both effective and engaging with a mix of discussion and reading of student work. More often than not, the 2.5 hour meeting period flew by and I found myself wishing the class was even longer. The only thing is that there is not a lot of time to both discuss and read all work, so in order to really get everything you can from the class I would recommend that you go to office hours as often as possible!

            "\u00a0You learn concrete skills that make you a better playwright. Take it. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Margulies is dope. My favorite part of the class was his office hours, reviewing my work and chatting with him about life. Take this class for Prof M. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, absolutely take this class if you get in. Professor Margulies is a genius, and the class will expose you to so many different styles of writing (both from the plays we read and the student work we share in class). This class was instrumental in refining my voice as a playwright. Discussing your writing with Professor Margulies and the rest of the class will force you to think about it in new ways that will challenge you to improve in ways you never knew you could. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely!! Take this course if you're at all interested in theater, but especially if you like to write for the theater. ",
            "\u00a0For the aspiring writer, the course teaches invaluable skills about creating a narrative. ",
            "\u00a0If a student has any interest in playwriting, this class is amazing.  It exposed me to so many new works of theatre as well as really improving my skills as a writer. ",
            "\u00a0Cool course but we warned: you'll have (long) readings each week as well as weekly assignments, ON TOP of your 45-page final project (which you will be expected to work on the whole time.) Proff Margulies is cool and really approachable, and the readings and excersizes are interesting. BUT this workload is no joke - do not take during a semester when you are taking 5 classes. ",
            "\u00a0You should take this course if you are at all interested in playwriting, and probably if you are at all interested in screenwriting as well (the two forms are definitely very different, but the basics of creating conflict and drama on both a micro and macro level are more similar than even Professor Margulies, who is accomplished in both areas, might like to admit). You will learn a great deal about how to write a play, and how great playwrights, mostly recent Anglo-American ones, have written plays. Margulies is incredibly bright, a very good teacher, and a lovely guy. And the plays he selects for class readings are really, really good. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, Prof. Margulies is great, and it is an opportunity to read great plays and focus on your own writing. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely would recommend to other students! I have always loved writing and theater, but I have never ever considered myself a playwright. Through this course, I realized both how much I enjoy it and how much the craft of playwriting can inform my other work. Professor Margulies is so organized and brilliant; if you have the chance to take the course, do! "
