            "\u00a0The professor is very knowledgeable of the topic and field in general. She always made sure to draw from diverse sources and over a wide range of viewpoints. ",
            "\u00a0The main improvement necessary is that more scholarship of the interdisciplinary/biographical/religious nature should be written about composers other than the household names (John Cage and Steve Reich) so that this class can improve its scope. It was wonderful to learn about Meredith Monk, Ruth Crawford Seeger, etc., and I hope the opportunities to discuss such composers in music departments only increase in the future. I realize that this is not a complaint about the course per se. "

            "\u00a0I highly recommend the course to other students who are interested in musical narratives that are not saturated with musical analysis but rather steeped in forms of spiritual practices. ",
            "\u00a0Kerry is a phenomenal scholar in multiple respects. Taking this course was a way to acess the rigorous, quilt-like assemblage of her critical process. "
