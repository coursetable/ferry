            "\u00a0I think the strengths of this course were the teachers. I think they did a very good job at making material engaging and manageable.\r\n\r\nI think one weakness of this course is having the class 3 days a week instead of 5 days a week. The workload would be more difficult to manage, but I think constant exposure is important to maintaining oral fluency. I also think that some of the vocabulary seemed scattered. It would be nice for us to learn vocabulary in a more organized and sensible order. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, this class does a good job of introducing more advanced topics and vocabulary in Chinese. However, while I appreciated the lighter workload compared to lower-level Chinese courses, I do not feel as though my Chinese ability has improved nearly as much as in semesters past. Overall, I do not think class three days a week works for Advanced Chinese - it is not fair to the students who do not have the ability to practice their speaking abilities much in class, nor is it fair to the instructors who have to rush through lessons to finish in a single day. This semester, I have multiple close friends who personally choose not to take L5 Chinese because they did not believe attending class 3 days a week would allow them to improve the way they wanted to. I know that with other language departments L5 courses meet three days a week, however, I feel this is unreasonable to properly learn Chinese. Overall, I feel that the department should at least offer one 5-day a week section so students who want the opportunity to improve even more upon their Chinese can do so. Overall, aside from this I think the semester was fine and the course was very good. ",
            "\u00a0Spoken practice was good, but not enough. We wrote essays but didn't learn how first. ",
            "\u00a0I believe the greatest strength of any Chinese course at Yale is always the teaching staff. They are always of great help and are very good at teaching. My experience with the weekly tutorials has also always been great. For some, a weakness might be that the class is taught three days a week instead of five. For others, this is a great improvement over the lower level Chinese courses. For me personally, I enjoyed a more relaxed approach to learning Chinese. I believe that the way the grading is structured is also a major strength. You are given many ways to improve a grade and the exams do not count for as much as in other courses. This allowed me to not stress as much. There are also many office hours one can attend that even if you do not have a question, will allow you to practice speaking. The fun conversations are an added bonus. "
