            "\u00a0This course taught me a lot in the sense of being able to relate larger themes to modern life. I think that it did a great job of making me think outside of the box in terms of essays, and it also had a very well thought out syllabus that made the class enjoyable to be in. It helped me organize and develop thoughts that I may have had in the past into fuller, more in depth arguments and analytical points, and made me think more consciously about my day to day interactions in life. ",
            "\u00a0A great combination of academic literary analysis and more digestible genre lit/film. I'm not sure I learned anything concrete, but it was great experience writing analytically, not that there's any shortage of that in the English department. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a set of analytic tools for dealing with modern genre fiction and understanding connections and common themes among the most influential apocalyptic fiction. ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus pulled from a variety of popular apocalyptic texts from plays to novels to movies. I developed a new framework to look at these popular texts, and I think the questions we asked in this class will be incredibly relevant to the texts I will encounter in my future academic classes and personal interests! "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I enjoyed this course just as it was. I thought that the syllabus was nicely thought out and since it is a small seminar, the amount of attention that the professor was able to give to me as a student, an intellectual, and a writer made me feel like I was enrolled in a class in which the goal was for me to leave the semester with a deeper understanding, rather than leave the semester feeling as though I had wasted every Tuesday morning of the last 12 weeks. ",
            "\u00a0While many of our readings and films were interesting, I wish Professor Berger did a better job engaging us in a discussion. I also wish he had picked more diverse works to read; only two were written by women, I believe, and I think all of them were written by white people. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting material, but poorly run class sessions. Maybe it was the small class size or the 9:25am slot, but there was generally very little motivation to participate. Prof. Berger often had us sit in silence for up to 15 minutes to \"gather our thoughts\" but this really didn't accomplish much. He would also end class up to 15 minutes early if he ran out of out things to ask us. However, the substitution of the final creative project for the final paper was greatit more or less redeemed the class for me. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Berger was responsive to the students interests, and brought analysis in class discussion to a high level\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Discussion tended to fall flat, and some weeks' readings/viewings had no real connection or theme to explore. ",
            "\u00a0I think I would have done better during class discussions if there were questions given to us to use to prepare and think about. ",
            "\u00a0The class could meet twice instead of once, and the syllabus could be condensed because some of the texts seemed too similar to another. Sometimes we ended up spending only 15-20 minutes on a whole movie that we had to watch, and it would have been better if we could have just focused our time on one longer text and have more thorough discussions about that text. "

            "\u00a0Yes! I would recommend this course. The work is laid-back (participation and three essays spread across the semester), and the fact that the syllabus is so lenient allows for really interesting conversation to begin during class, which, as a result, produces more interesting and well-thought out papers. I am glad that I ended up taking this class and, honestly, would take it again if I could. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course only if you have some anomalous interest in apocalyptic fiction. If not, it's probably not worth it. Readings are often one novel a week, but the good news is Prof. Berger is a pretty easy grader, so it's really not too exhausting of a class. ",
            "\u00a0Other students considering this class should be very interested in the content on the syllabus, and I think the class requires a critical mass of engaged students for discussion to work. Shop it, see what discussion is like, and look down the syllabus before you sign up. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to people that have the time and are willing to read a book on a weekly basis. The reads are not overly difficult to get through but are time-consuming. "
