            "\u00a0This is probably the best course I've taken at Yale. Dr Roberts is an actual angel and a fantastically gifted professor who makes every one of her lectures engaging, relevant and cohesive. The course had a very clear narrative arc that linked historical realities and patterns to current events. I would highly recommend this course to everyone regardless of their background, as it will illuminate a really important aspect of American history that is often overlooked and/or whitewashed. ",
            "\u00a0PLEASE TAKE THIS COURSE, YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT. I am now a senior and this course was one of the best-taught courses I have ever encountered while at Yale. Dr. Roberts is not only brilliant but is a professor who truly cares about her students, and is highly invested in whether or not students are absorbing the material. Each lecture that she gave was delivered in a poignant fashion, causing students to grapple with medicinal history in a way that encourages a consciousness towards the abuses of Black bodies for the sake of medical advancements. Each lecture uncovers the true history behind white medical heroism and our current medical system by highlight the foundational racist structures of that system. If I had to describe Dr. Roberts in terms of popular culture references, I would say that she is a Black Ms. Honey from the movie Matilda. She is so incredibly thoughtful while delivering gruesome stories about experimentation on enslaved people's bodies and ghastly theories of Black people as a separate species within medical ideologies. I spoke with Dr. Roberts in her office and she intentionally designed the course so that people will leave with lessons that they will remember for a lifetime. The readings for the course were so carefully picked by Dr. Roberts and aligned perfectly with her lectures. The assignments that Dr. Roberts gave weren't your typical essays, but were involved projects that really cause you as a student to engage with the material. I loved this course and I'm so grateful that I took it. ",
            "\u00a0Understanding how socioeconomic and health disparities developed, the history of racial science and how these problems continue into present-day in terms of public health issues (police violence, underserved communities, etc.)... it was literally a life-changing course. ",
            "\u00a0This is one of the few classes at Yale that I can say truly changed my entire perspective on how I think about life and medicine. As someone who is STEM/pre-med this perhaps the most important class that I took during my time at Yale. You learn so much about how medicine has been used as a force of repression against black and brown bodies throughout history, how racist history of medicine continues to this day, and how black communities have expressed resistance through their own medicine. It is history that is often not told and it is so important. ",
            "\u00a0An in-depth look at African American history in a medical context from the trans-Atlantic slave trade to the present. We looked at the histories of experimentation and dissection, African medical knowledge and Black people in the medical practice, Black resistance to exploitation, etc. ",
            "\u00a0This course was one of the best I'd taken this semester. I gained so much knowledge about the history of medical racism against African Americans as well their responses and resistance to racial science. The assignments also broadened my writing skills as the op-ed assignment and the workshop lesson plan allowed me to think about additional methods of historical writing. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a completely new historical framework to understand how medicine, in particular, how medicine has harmed marginalized groups and what effects are still being seen today. ",

            "\u00a0How to link a difficult history to the present. I gained insight into the deep roots of American racism as well black resistance. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a better understanding of the history of African American medical abuse throughout history. ",
            "\u00a0While this class was not the most challenging workload class I've ever taken, I think it pushed me to do more personal work than I've ever done in a classroom, definitely in a lecture, before. Wow I learned so much history, but also learned so much about how to process traumatic history. ",
            "\u00a0I can't even begin to tell you the knowledge I have learned in this class. We traveled almost 500 years over the course of the semester and it was one of the most transformative bodies of knowledge I have ever learned. Truly, everyone should take this course. ",

            "\u00a0I learned how to more critically analyze the histories that have been given to me and taught to me as \"true.\" I learned that science, while often viewed as an objective field, is actually quite subjective when regarding who defines science, especially with its relationship to race. ",
            "\u00a0You learn how to do various writing types - secondary source analysis, op ed, lesson planning, etc. This class shows how the information we learn in the class can be applied via various formats, which is important. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much taking this class. Though primarily about health care disparity throughout African American history, I learned that ideas about race and health are not separable-- one affects the other in powerful ways. I really cannot look at the world in the way I did before. ",
            "\u00a0Was a really good course to learn about unknown history. Even though I am not pre med I think some of the things learned about medicine and the medical field are necessary for living. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to be more critical and holistic about my approach to analyzing history. ",
            "\u00a0SO MUCH! This class was incredible. I learned so many eye-opening things about African American History as it related to medicine and medical institutions. Through section and readings, I learned to develop ideas and arguments that blended opinion, interest and fact into a single writing. ",
            "\u00a0This was the best course I've taken so far at Yale. I learned crucial information about the history of black people in America that was never taught to me before college. I feel like everyone, especially people pursuing careers in healthcare, should know this history, because it directly impacts the health disparities seen today in the black community. I gained insight and knowledge that I can use to better educate others with. No class has blown my mind as much as this one. ",
            "\u00a0This class opened my eyes to the history of racism that is built into the medical field and how that manifests currently. I don't know that I've ever taken a class that has given me more useful and important life information, especially as it pertains to my career interests. ",
            "\u00a0Learned so much about the history of sickness and health in afam history ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think critically about historical foundations of trusted institutions. I learned how medicine has been used to oppress racial minorities through history in the US and how collective movements have worked to subvert that system. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me a new way of viewing American history, public health, and current issues of inequality. I learned so much in this class that I would have never learned in a typical American history course. ",
            "\u00a0This is an amazing class! I never knew how deeply intertwined the history of race and medicine were, which Professor Roberts does an incredible job of helping us understand through her lectures and course readings that I actually looked forward to reading. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me to think critically about the impact of medicine and public health on marginalized communities. I learned to evaluate these histories through their perspectives in order to see the complexities of history in detail. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the history of slavery and its impact of Medicine in the United State in different time periods. I also learned to synthesize my ideas and write with a new perspective on topics involving race and medicine. ",
            "\u00a0I learned clear factual historical fact based on rigorous academic research about the history of sickness and health for African Americans. These historical facts clearly connect with the present, and it has been immensely rewarding to learn about and form these connections for myself. I learned about how to write a critical analysis of a secondary source, how to construct a lesson plan, and how to write an op-ed. This course also taught me some of the more vivid details of the atrocities that have been committed against African and African American people in American history, but also has taught me about the resilience of Black people and their ability to fight for their own health rights and other rights. I learned how my own self connects with this history. I learned how an amazing professor address the challenge of relative larger lecture course and brings a personal touch to that from seeing how Professor Carolyn Roberts taught as well as my TA, Camille Owens. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about the intersection between race and health throughout American history as well as the way that historical attitudes towards medicine and healing impact our society today. The assignments allowed for creativity. Instead of straightforward essay, we had the chance to write a lesson plan and an op-ed, so I developed writing skills that I haven't used in other classes. ",
            "\u00a0I received a great deal of knowledge about the relationship between Black Americans and public health. ",
            "\u00a0This class has been one of my favorite classes at Yale! Not only was it incredibly informative and well-taught, but the material and readings were so rich and interesting. The course truly opened my eyes. ",
            "\u00a0This class gave me the skills to critically evaluate the racist ideals that shaped medicine, and to see the accomplishments of black people in medicine. ",
            "\u00a0This course connected the ideology behind racialized science to the events that deal with race relations throughout the course of American history. It told the story of African Americans in this country. ",
            "\u00a0I discovered a lot of new ways to approach assignments. Not all of our assignments were traditional papers or exams but op-eds and community workshop lesson plans. It was really fascinating to approach the class from so many different ways. Also, learning about how the American medical system was built on the experimentation and dehumanization of black bodies was hard but interesting to learn about considering my mom and aunts who raised me (all of us are Black) are nurses. It gave me a newfound appreciation for them and all other Black medical professionals. ",
            "\u00a0I developed knowledge about the experiences of African Americans in the United States, specifically about experiences regarding sickness and health. I developed knowledge about many of the black contributors to the field of medicine and medical innovation as well as the history of horrifying black experiences that were suffered in order to achieve the medical advancement that we have today. Much of this knowledge is so specific and hidden so it is important that Dr. Roberts is sharing this information with her students. ",
            "\u00a0Learned to appreciate history as it is important to know when addressing present day problems in America, particularly pertaining to the experiences of people of color. ",
            "\u00a0There are too many to list. \r\nI regained my love for history and for writing. I was reminded why I am passionate about racial justice in health. What I learned in class will remain with me for the rest of my life and I will share what I learned with as many people as will listen. ",
            "\u00a0This course was amazing. It should be required as class for anyone even remotely interested in healthcare in the US. It allows for the intelligent discussion of black history and medicine and you learn so so so much. I felt like I was given the language to discuss the issues that mean a lot to me concerning healthcare ",
            "\u00a0Taking this course made me realize that I have a real interest in public health and also in African American studies, two areas I had never before had the chance to explore. This class prompted me to place a lot of value and validity in my own ideas and perspectives, as well. As an African American female, I learned a lot about the past of my own culture, and I realized the depth of information that I never even touched the surface of before coming to Yale. ",
            "\u00a0One of my favorite courses at Yale. I learned so much from this course, things I had never heard of before. Looking at African American history from a health lens was truly eye opening. ",
            "\u00a0To address the deep rooted history of racial discrimination in the US healthcare system, and how it has bled into the future with implications beyond public health. ",
            "\u00a0I gained so much of modern day medicine is based on the abuse of black bodies at the hands of white physicians. I was shocked at how little I knew about the centuries of neglectful and abusive treatment of black bodies and this class made me realize how we need to recognize people who suffered at the hands of white doctors as significant contributors to modern medicine. We also learned how racism actually came into  practice (15th century explorers encountering different racial groups) and how the establish racial hierarchy (placing whites at the top) has persisted over centuries and black people remain marginalized and continue to have to fight for their rights, health, and lives. ",
            "\u00a0An incredible depth of knowledge about how seemingly \"objective\" fields like medicine and science have impacted the black community ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me so much about a topic I knew little to nothing about. I'm grateful for having taken this course because it has opened my eyes to a history between African Americans and the medical field that I never knew existed. This history continues to this day. I plan to enter medical school after graduating from Yale and I am certain that the knowledge I gained from this class will follow me and inform my thinking as a future physician. ",
            "\u00a0In this class I learned about the often hidden history of medicine in relation to race. We discussed medicine and race from the time of early exploration in Africa to the modern day. "

            "\u00a0This class is so so good! There is nothing coming to mind in ways that it could be improved--it is perfect. The only thing would be that I wish that we were able to go more in depth to certain topics, however that is just a byproduct of it being a lecture class. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were the professor (Professor Roberts is absolutely amazing), the teaching fellows who were there to provide important insight and context to our section discussions, and the course material which broadened my knowledge on a variety of topics relating to the course's themes. I also loved having the guest speakers that we had during the second half of the semester. The fact that we got to talk to Linda Villarosa about her journalistic and activist work was amazing! ",
            "\u00a0This is a wonderful class. I recommend anyone who is interested in entering medicine take this course to fully understand a potential patient population. Dr. Roberts is an amazing professor in all ways, and the teaching staff clearly has a high level of engagement/ care with the material and their students. ",
            "\u00a0this class had great readings that were then followed by outstanding lectures in class. the discussion sections were sometimes repetitive but the information we were learning was so important and fascinating. ",

            "\u00a0Only strengths! This course is designed for you to LEARN. It's also designed for you to follow your interests in African American history. Dr. Roberts is, of course, a key strength. She's absolutely brilliant. ",
            "\u00a0The incredible dedication of Dr. Roberts is the strongest part of the course. This makes section some times a bit of a let down in comparison to lecture. ",
            "\u00a0There is absolutely no way this course could be improved. It is the best course I have ever taken at Yale and there were absolutely no weaknesses. From engaging and informative lectures to assignments that we could actually carry out of the class, Sickness and Health in African American History should be a model class at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Robert's lectures were always so engaging. And, she was always willing to hear from students in the class during lecture. I especially valued Professor Roberts' ability to present such a harrowing, complicated history to us in a compelling manner and always tying history to modern-day issues for more clarity. The guest lectures were also quite profound and impactful. Also, Professor Roberts allowing access to the slides which she presented in class via Canvas was a huge plus for notetaking, especially if you couldn't see the slides depending on where you were seated. ",
            "\u00a0There were no weaknesses to this class. I wanted to read all the assigned texts. Lecture was engaging emotionally and intellectually, and discussion sections matched while allowing students to voice their processing of the information. ",

            "\u00a0This is the best class I have taken at Yale so far. Professor Roberts is an incredible professor that clearly cares about her students and the materials. Every lecture was engaging and well executed. I always wanted to go to this class. This class made me feel like the things I was learning were so important and relevant. The 3 assignments were all interesting and self-driven and the final and midterm were clearly structured for students to succeed. Take this class. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Amazing slideshows that perfectly use combination of facts, evidence, and media to give a nuanced approach to the topics discussed in class. Assignments were interesting and helped give me a greater appreciation for this sordid history. Very pensive discussion sections. ",

(incredibly passionate and well-informed)\r\n-Interesting and eye-opening course material\r\n-well-organized\r\n-informative readings and interesting writing assignments\r\n-section was utilized to discuss tough and disturbing material\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-Honestly, I can't think of any... ",

The assignments were formatted so that students chose topics that interested them, which made the assignments even more fun and meaningful. Every lecture was engaging and informative thanks to Professor Roberts. The essays and workshop assignments were all enjoyable to do. The only thing I would change would be making the midterm exam a little shorter because the time constraints made it hard to finish in time. ",

She really cares about her students, making every lesson interesting and engaging. I think everyone in this class worshipped Professor Roberts. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n-the reading wasn't overwhelming & was very interesting\r\n-the course covered an expansive period of time\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n-we really focused on the Black experience of health throughout American History, it would be really interesting the Black health experience outside of American History. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were the teachers teaching. Professor Roberts was so passionate when she did her lecture that the class was full until the last day of class. She didn't just summarize the readings she gave us, she brought new ideas and points in lecture (and guests). It could improve by being a little longer (maybe 10 or 15 more minutes). ",
            "\u00a0TLDR: \r\nStrengths; professor, subject matter, assignments, several awesome special guests. \r\nWeaknesses; still developing syllabus (although it's already good and getting better), maybe a little too much structure in assignments (although I appreciated it a lot).\r\n\r\nThis course's strength are certainly its professor and subject matter. Professor Roberts could not be better about engaging with her students and lecturing in a focused (yet somehow still broad) and meaningful (and entertaining) way. The course is still relatively new, so some of its weaknesses are that the syllabus is still developing and being honed to perfection by Professor Roberts; however, it was already pretty great, and it will only get better. I really appreciated the amount of guidance in writing assignments in the information provided and grading rubrics, especially being a first year and still learning to write at a college level and also being a person who generally appreciates and benefits from that. However, at times it might have been a little too structured. Also, there were lots of great special guests who were experts in relevant fields who came to speak with us, and it was so interesting. ",
            "\u00a0The only weakness of this course that I can think of is that sometimes Professor Roberts ran out of time towards the end of the lectures. Other than that very small detail, everything about this course - from the lecture, to the reading, and the discussion section - was excellent. ",
            "\u00a0The course is strong all around. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths - structure of midterm, unconventional assignments like the workshop lesson plan and op-ed, dedication and genuine care of the professor and TAs, lecture slides, guest speakers\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - sometimes unfocused sections, couldn't always get through the lecture material, wish we had the plan for the final exam set earlier but it seems like there were a lot of moving parts in that decision so I don't know if that could've been avoided ",
            "\u00a0There were a lot of students that took this course in a small classroom. I think that given the large interest in the course, it would be better to move this class to a more accommodating space. Besides the space issue, Dr. Roberts did an amazing job with teaching this material to her students. Much of the material was emotionally difficult to process, but Dr. Roberts treated this material with the utmost respect and in such a way that left a powerful mark on her students. This course deeply touches everyone who takes it and is crucial to the understanding of medicine and of the history of the United States. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- the organization of the course and the assignments contributed to the overall understanding and positive experience. I truly enjoyed the course and wish it was a year long class. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses- I wish lectures were longer. 50 minutes flew by and we were not left with much time to discuss and debrief after learning about tough and disturbing moments in American history ",
            "\u00a0The professor and TAs were amazing ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Lecture-style, reading material and speakers. All fantastic.\r\nWeaknesses:The only thing that I can mention is taking more space for processing. We read, grapple with, and view some very disturbing material in our nation's history and I think we need to take more time to let people be in silence for a bit. It would have been nice for things to be a little more interactive (but I know that is hard for such a big class). ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course was the wide definition of achievement provided by the professor. The class was relatively easy, but it was not a gut. Everyone was allowed to engage with material that interested them and all perspectives were valued. The professor understood that it was not really helpful to assess this type of content. Learning the content was motivated by your own engagement and Dr. Roberts stellar teaching style. ",
            "\u00a0The work load of this class is great; the content was at times mind-blowing; the professor is amazing; discussion sections and Teaching Fellows were great; assignments were meaningful and allowed deep exploration of topics I was actually interested in. The grading policy also made the class something that I was able to purely enjoy and focus on learning rather than stressing about a perfect grade. There were plenty of opportunities outside of class to connect with authorities in the field and continue learning. The guest speakers were a huge plus, and I truly enjoyed all of them. I feel like I actually LEARNED in this class. I honestly can't think of any weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0S: very interesting, lectures were superb and presented in an engaging/easy-to-follow manner, taught is a very humanizing way, readings assignments were fair in length and related to the material, test and written assignments were fair\r\nW: midterm was a little long for the time allotted ",
            "\u00a0Perhaps more time for lecture, or have videos (albeit short) be assigned to be watch prior to class so it does not not take time from lecturer speech. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: facilitated student learning, lectures and section were engaging, amazing professor, valuable content that every student should learn ",
            "\u00a0So many strengths. Dr Roberts is so kind, and such an engaging professor. ",
            "\u00a0This course was really enjoyable. We covered a broad range of topics, each of which could have its own class. We read a good mix of secondary and primary sources. Section was good and we actually discussed the topics we went over in lecture. The writing assignments were not long, but they all added to the overall experience. I cant really think of anything that could have made this class better than it was. "

            "\u00a0I would most definitely recommend this course to another student. If you want to learn about race and medicinal history that will inform how you view our current medical system, please take this course. The work was definitely manageable and well worth it.

            "\u00a0Yes! One of the best classes I've taken at Yale! ",
            "\u00a0YES!!! Carolyn Roberts is one of the most amazing academics, as well as one of the most inspiring female role models, on this campus. She and this class are utterly amazing and unlike anything else. ",
            "\u00a0This course completely reframed my perspective in most facets of my life as a Black American. I am now able to better articulate the way historical and ongoing exploitation and abuse of Black people is embodied, how foundational our suffering is to the historical and current social organization of this country, and why we must continue to resist this oppression. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Not only did I just learn so much about a history that I knew relatively little about (the specifics of medical racism and medical resistance as these concepts related to the African American experience) but I also learned from a fabulous professor and amazing teaching fellows. ",
            "\u00a0YES! This is a must take. Every lecture was completely engaging and informational. There are also plenty of out of course opportunities for students to apply what they are learning. Take this class, you will not be disappointed. It does the impossible of making a lecture course feel as engaging and connected as a seminar. Yale needs more courses like these. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Very important information we learned that impacts our lives today in America. It is amazing the wide array of topics the you learn about African-American history and professor Roberts is outstanding. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I think this course, which teaches the history of medicine and healthcare, should be a required course for EVERY pre-med student. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Take this course. It's an incredible history lecture for those in the major, and it's an accessible course for those not in the major too. ",
            "\u00a0I would. The course was an amazing way to discover newfound insight. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I feel like this course should be mandatory for everyone but even if it isn't everybody should jump at the opportunity to learn from Dr. Roberts. She is truly one of the kindest most dedicated professors I have ever met. ",
            "\u00a0YES. Honestly anyone in any major should take this course. This should also be a required course for all pre-med students. This is such a low stress, interesting, and relevant class that every Yalie should take. Professor Roberts' lectures literally sounds like poetry, and everyone should give themselves the opportunity to listen to them. The material contained with within them in also material everyone should know, and though we went through the gruesome history of racism and racial science, Professor Roberts always made sure to handle the topics with care and grace. ",
            "\u00a0YES! Carolyn Roberts is fantastic and is truly passionate about the material. Soon, you will be too. By far the best and most moving class I've taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this class if you can. Light workload and you still learn a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Anyone thinking they want to be in a medical profession should take this course to understand the past that informs the current culture and climate of medical institutions. ",
            "\u00a0I think everyone should take this, no matter if you're not humanities or if you don't think you need to learn about sickness and health. Fun fact: You do! This class definitely allowed me to see how science and humanities could intersect and how what we take for granted can easily change depending on who the subject is. I'll definitely be thinking more about my patient-doctor relationship in all scenarios more so than I have before, because of this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Yes! This class is great if you are especially interested in the intersections of race and health. It's a great survey course that shows how the African American health and health activism changed over time. Dr.Roberts is a phenomenal professor and cares deeply about the topic. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class: Professor Roberts is a gem. The course is a gem. Try to take at least one of her classes while she's here. ",
            "\u00a0Take it! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I would say this should be a required course for everyone at Yale. We grappled with difficult histories of black people and medicine, but Professor Roberts guided us through it thoughtfully, insightfully and patiently. It was incredible to get to see someone that cared so much about every student as individuals. I was so excited to come to class each time we met because I knew class would be so interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would. This is a necessary history for everyone to learn that is rarely if ever taught in any other classroom setting. The professor's cadence during the lectures leave the class wanting more and wondering what is in store for the next lecture. ",
            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY! This course is one of the best that I have taken at Yale. Quite honestly, it is a course that changes your vision of the world and history. It will make you personally invested in being a part of change. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It is truly an amazing course full of meaningful information that everyone should have knowledge of. Anybody that is pre-med or wants to go into healthcare should take this class. The workload is manageable and extremely interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to any student who wants to know the historical bases for a lot of the racism that we see today, especially in the medical field. The readings are genuinely interesting, and the lectures will leave you stunned (although they can be quite heavy and sad at times). ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0YES this class is a GEM. Professor Roberts is the best professor I've ever had at Yale, if only for her passion for the subject and kindness/genuine interest in her students. I was blown away. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Such a good course. Very important topic that we dont get to learn about in normal history classes. Definitely a great class for pre-med students. Professor is a amazing and so enthusiastic; makes the class very interesting. Not a lot of work, and the assignments are different (& more fun) than your typical essay. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I went in thinking it would be a light workload, low-engagement class. While it wasn't difficult, I ended up feeling deeply moved by the material and engaged in and out of class with the material. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! This course is super engaging and relevant to people in all fields. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I have already recommended it to literally every person I know. I would especially recommend this class to anyone who is premed, because I strongly believe you cannot be premed without knowing this important history. However, this class is 100% for anyone and everyone. For myself, a humanities major without a very good understanding of African American history, every class left me pondering an issue and thinking more deeply about some of my preconceptualized biases and notions. Beyond the content of the course, there isn't too much work and Professor Roberts's lectures are amazing. There is no reason to not take this course! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to everyone! It's without a doubt a class everyone should take. ",
            "\u00a0I came upon this class by spontaneously following a friend in the beginning of the school year and I did not regret it. You learn so much in the class and the lectures are dynamic. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. If you are interested the history of science and medicine, race in the US, and/or learning from an amazing professor, this is the course for you. It isn't too heavy a work load, there are lots of interesting topics to get invested in and many opportunities to write in different ways and to explore different topics. ",
            "\u00a0Every student should take this class if they are able. The content is so important, especially for students who are interested in pursuing a career in medicine. No matter the background knowledge and experience that you bring to this class, you will leave with a new, complex understanding of the way that race and health operate in our world. Professor Roberts is a remarkable teacher, and I felt lucky just to be in the presence of someone so intelligent and passionate about what she does and the difference it makes. She also works very hard to minimize student stress, so students have the opportunity to focus on the material rather than stressing over getting a certain grade. That's not the say it's an easy class; the content was extremely difficult and painful at times, and lead to a degree of introspection that I haven't experienced in another class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this because it is a great course. ",
            "\u00a0YES! This class was INCREDIBLE! I am so grateful to have been able to take it before graduating. ",
            "\u00a0Yes -- Professor Roberts is an amazing professor and the course material is so interesting and important. This is definitely the best lecture I have ever taken at Yale, and one of the best classes overall. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course provided much needed insight to race relations and challenged students to think critically. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Carolyn Roberts is an incredible professor that any student would be lucky to have at some point. The class is also illuminating in how it debunks the way the American medical system has worked against black people and black bodies in the U.S. from slavery until now. ",
            "\u00a0This course is excellent. I recommend this course to everyone that I can. The information that Dr. Roberts is sharing is so specific that it is hard to come by outside of the course, but also incredibly important to know and to understand the history of medicine in the United States. Everyone should take this course. ",
            "\u00a0YES! YES! YES! this class thoroughly goes into the way in which black bodies contributed to the medicine of the past, the medicine of the present, and the medicine of the future. It tells the stories that are intentionally left out of textbooks and medical school curriculums. Its thoughtful design allowed for students to engage in primary and secondary text, while also connecting it to current media and movements. It is a very timely class as we are living through the #BlackLivesMatter movement ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It's a class with good, interesting content and evaluations that ensure learning as they're driven by the student. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Take this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, without a shadow of a doubt. This class opened my eyes up to how deep racism runs through our country especially through the lens of health. I would recommend this class to anyone passionate about racial justice and the health professions, or if you want to simply become a more informed citizen. ",
            "\u00a0yes a million times. take this course if you remotely care about healthcare, black people, any people, research, etc ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I actually already have recommended it to most students I know. ",
            "\u00a0YES. This is a fantastic course that puts more emphasis on actually absorbing and sitting with the content that simply memorization. ",
            "\u00a0Without a doubt, must take to access the world that has been shadowed for many centuries.  I would love to take another course offered by C. Roberts. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to anyone seeking to learn more about the complex history of race and medicine, specifically African Americans' contributions and relationships with the medical sphere over various centuries. ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely!!!!! These are histories than everyone needs to know ",
            "\u00a0Yes, though there was a lot of reading for this class, the knowledge gained through those readings and through the lectures is well worth it. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to another student. We discussed topics that are not only relevant to African American or black students; the information we learned is important and should be taught to all students considering a career in medicine. I also think its necessary to acknowledge the lives that were changed for the worse with the development of modern medicine. "
