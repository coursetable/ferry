            "\u00a0This class did not really fit my learning style. I was hoping to spend more time with primary sources. I found it difficult to learn anything meaningful about those sources from only reading secondary sources. I appreciate the instructor's desire to try a new format, but I did not find the course materials informative. I was disappointed that the second half of the semester was spent on student projects. There is so much important theory to learn from the past three centuries and I would have enjoyed a semester devoted to reading this literature in detail. I enjoyed the online responses. It was nice to learn about other students' interests, but I wish it had not been at the expense of learning the historical material I had anticipated the class would cover. "
