            "\u00a0In this course, we read a broad array of articles and chapters of famous novels related to environmental issues and philosophy. It was a good introduction to writing an essay at college, and especially helpful when it came to our largest assignment: the research paper. ",
            "\u00a0There were a lot of topics covered in this course and each was taught in a very engaging manner. The overarching skill for this course was critical reading as it was used in every lesson. ",
            "\u00a0Learned to write clearly and efficiently while developing a cohesive argument. Also learned some art history and environmental philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0I developed the ability to analyze art academically, have informed conversations about climate change, and write more persuasively in a variety of formats. ",
            "\u00a0Learned how to become a more competent and analytical writer. ",
            "\u00a0I developed my critical reading skills and discussion skills. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about various types of writing, including personal and research papers. I also learned about different perspectives that humans have about the environment, what is considered to even be the environment, and our future in it. ",
            "\u00a0How to write essays in American ",
            "\u00a0By taking this course, I broadened my knowledge on 18th century landscape painting, the state of the environment, and nature writing (with writers like Cronon and Thoreau). I think that one of the most valuable lessons that this course brought was the fact that it opened my eyes to the true danger of global warming through literature, and helped me overcome the fear that I previously had on reading about global warming. "

            "\u00a0The greatest strength of this course is that the assigned readings are designed to be interesting, which makes class conversations more exciting. We also had the opportunity to visit an art gallery -- a field trip that all the students seemed to enjoy. I think it would have been nice if the grading of the papers was a bit more clear, because sometimes grades had a lot of explanation attached while other times there seemed to be less feedback. ",
            "\u00a0The small amount of students in the course is a huge benefit to the lessons, as the opinions of each student can be heard. The lessons operated more like conversations and the students had a lot of influence over directions which the lessons took. ",
            "\u00a0Overall a great course. The readings were very engaging and fascinating. I think it would have sometimes been helpful if we had more shorter writing assignments throughout the course that asked us to give our thoughts about a reading or asked us to talk about how we thought multiple readings related to each other. Our class discussions were not always the best, in part I think because some didn't do the readings or skimmed them too quickly. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength was the instructor (Jakub is amazing), but the inconsistency across other English 114 classes is a major weakness (some are much easier than others and many are much less engaging than others). ",
            "\u00a0Strength was that the course was very engaging, and it had a very interesting take on the landscape and environment-something I had never learned before. ",
            "\u00a0One of the strengths of this class was its flexibility and how Jakub structured it around what interested us. Also, letting the students guide discussions was useful. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very strong in its directions. I never felt lost in this class. My teacher was very good at providing feedback and keeping me on track. This course could be improved by discussing the technical aspects of writing more, such as how to vary sentence and paragraph structure. ",
            "\u00a0Reading topics varied throughout the weeks but some were irrelevant to homework essays ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the conversational flow of the classes, which made them engaging and interesting, sometimes even funny. The readings I always found to be interesting and discussing them was always incredibly constructive. However, I think that the course lacked a bit of cohesion, since I found it hard to find a connection between 18th century landscape painting and global warming. Making some of the readings more connected, as well as the themes taught in class, could be a good way to improve it. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because it teaches you how to write a essay about something that is interesting, all in a way that is not stressful and very straightforward. I enjoyed seminars because the topic allowed us to share personal experiences and opinions. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to other students because of how interactive the course is and how familiar students become with the material. There was always something new to discuss and every student was constantly engaged. ",
            "\u00a0yes. A good english seminar topic! ",
            "\u00a0Yes.  I absolutely loved this course, and I would recommend it to anyone at Yale, regardless of major or interests.  It is a phenomenal class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is a very great introduction to writing at Yale, and it gives you a better perspective of what is expected from you as a college student writer. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would because I enjoyed the material while learning some useful skills about reading academic papers. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I learned so much about the environment and really enjoyed our class discussions. The different writers that we studied were very interesting and provided great writing material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes for students wanting to learn about essay writing ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This is a great way to improve your writing and at the same time learn about 18th century landscape painting and the effects of global warming. It's a course that makes you aware of your surroundings in so many ways. "
