            "\u00a0This course is extremely well-organized, much more so than ECON 115, Introductory Microeconomics. William Hawkins and the TFs spent a lot of time making sure that the review sessions were taught well and helpful, that we knew what topics were going to be covered on the exam, and that Piazza was always available for quick answers to questions about the problem sets. They also sought student feedback halfway through the term, something that not a lot of large lecture courses do. The topics are also clear cut and easy to understand, Tsyvinski is also an engaging lecturer. \r\n\r\nThe weakness of this course is that Tsyvinski does lecture a bit quickly. It's difficult to keep up with note-taking at times because he moves quickly through slides, so I spent a lot of time catching up by looking at slides on my phone as he lectured. ",
            "\u00a0this course was not at all well organized. In lecture, we do not cover any actual problems and examples of the material, rather, the teacher focuses on telling us irrelevant fun facts to jockey favor among students and on very hypothetical, far removed definitions. I honestly felt like i was learning the material relevant to exams in section. They need to make the lecture more applied. Moreover, the course is set up, so that people in lecture will always be the bottom of the curve that props up the seminar people. We have the same curve, yet they learn more, are exposed to the material more, and have more actual practice problems. Lastly, the problem sets are so far removed from the material we learn in class that they are ridiculously trying. ",

            "\u00a0The course has a a good standing because the topics that it covers are engaging and relatable. This is a strength of the course in itself. In addition to that, the course does well in discussing topics more in detail in section so that the students have a complete understanding of what is being taught.\r\nOne of the weaknesses of this course is that during lecture, there would be a lot of times when the teaching was rushed because we were running out of time. Thus, we would spend a lot of time on small concepts that we would not later use, but the more important concepts were taught in a rushed manner, leading to confusion. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures could be less monotonous. More variation would entice the student body. ",

Additionally, Piazza and TF office hours were ubiquitous, allowing for help at nearly any time. \r\n\r\nThe only weakness I can identify is the grade distribution. This course is likely going to be curved down, so I probably would've liked for the exams to be a bit harder so that there would be more leeway. ",
            "\u00a0The course ensured personal engagement with the material through section participation. ",

            "\u00a0Lecture was good and the class was very well run. My advice would be to perhaps bring more theory and economic models into the course in place of some of the historical information and case examples. ",
            "\u00a0I think the strength of this course is the emphasis on real-world application, because it makes the course more interesting. But I also think this is the weakness -- a lot of times in class, we go over data that is hard to understand, abstract, and we never talk about it again, so it seems somewhat irrelevant. ",
            "\u00a0The content of this course is valuable and interesting; however, I think it could have been structured much better if it went directly off of the intro micro class. While there are a few key new models, many of the topics of macroeconomics are essentially microeconomics set within a more complex, more realistic context, and I think they should have been presented as such. However, there seemed to be an assumption that we would e familiar with the basics of macroeconomic infrastructure, and so very little time was spent defining the new context for the micro concepts we learned last semester. For example, I think it would be valuable to spend time explicitly discussing the definitions of simple things like markets, banks, interest, etc. Instead, this time was spent on details of the global economy. This is valuable information, but should not take so much time to convey at the cost of teaching a true intro class to macro novices. ",
            "\u00a0My TA was extremely helpful and knew the material well and could explain the stuff taught in lectures in section. The lectures were interesting because Aleh always included data and graphs to supplement materials.\r\n\r\nThe lectures were long and were held in the afternoon and so many students would stop paying attention after a while or could not concentrate throughout. ",
            "\u00a0The course provided a lot of resources to help with study and understanding. Lots of TA office hours and online materials, fast response time on Piazza. The content was interesting. However, the order that the material was taught in could have been much improved. Much of the material in macro is just micro in a new setting. Thus, we should have started by defining the macroeconomic infrastructure (for example, taking the time to explicitly define things like markets, banks, interest, as we did with GDP at the beginning) and then built upon the models we learned in micro. In addition, a lot of time was spent on real-world data. This is interesting and valuable, but not worth the trade-off of clearer definitions/background info for the concepts. ",
            "\u00a0what was taught in lecture was the exact same material as what was in the textbook so didn't really have to go to lecture could just read the textbook and go to section and get the same out of it. Also the econ department curve ended up curving a lot of students down because the exams were too easy ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were really really bad. 1/2 of the class didn't show up to them, and 1/2 of the people who did show up slept through them or didn't pay attention. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: It was well-structured and well put together. I appreciated that there were no questions about what we needed to know, and I liked how actively committed to Piazza the TFs were. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It moved too slowly at times. I wish the class was a bit more theoretical and less example driven (the examples were interesting, but often took up too much time). ",
            "\u00a0This class is, without a doubt, the most well-coordinated class at Yale. Everything is super well organized, from the psets to the exam information to the lectures. Also, lectures were incredible once I learned to understand Prof. Tsyvinski's accent. He's brilliant and always knows how to crack a funny joke and relate the core concepts of intro macro (like comparative advantage) to simpler examples that expand understanding. ",
            "\u00a0This class gives you a basic understanding of a lot of topics that are very applicable to the real world. Problem sets are doable, exams are almost too easy (to the point where a silly mistake screws you over), but it is good knowledge for everyone to have. Sometimes it seems as though there is a large disconnect between lecture and section. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that it was a very well planned course ",
            "\u00a0I liked that the class was very organized and very structured, so there were never any surprises about what would be on the psets or the exams. Dr. Hawkins was very on top of answering piazza questions and sending announcements out about exam topics and times, and grading of assignments was relatively prompt for such a large class.\r\nOne of the weaknesses I would say is that the quality of TAs is inconsistent, with some sections being much better than others. Also, there were times when I felt like the questions were not discussed in lecture to the depth that the psets asked for. ",

            "\u00a0The exams and problem sets are good at testing what was taught in class and I never felt like I was being tested on something random or irrelevant. The lecture slides are a bit dense especially with a lot of examples and graphs. Looking back at the slides without having gone to the class is hard because the slides aren't always self explanatory. Also, while the textbook was great because it was much more condensed than a regular one, it was confusing having a lot of math and derivations that werent really pertinent. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes the material is very broad and it's hard to understand what is required for the course and sometimes it's very specific material. A balance between the two would make this course greater. ",
            "\u00a0I wish that the professors assigned readings and had online reading quizzes because it would be much easier to keep up with the material. I also feel that this class was not intro enough, in that it didn't give basic definitions that I needed, for example what is a bank?. I liked piazza. ",
            "\u00a0One of the biggest strengths of the course was the use of Piazza, where students could ask questions that would be answered by either the TAs or peers. The textbook was written by Professor Tsyvinski and Dr. Hawkins, which made it tailored specifically to the class. During Psets, I found myself bouncing back between the slides and the textbook for support, and Piazza as well when I needed it. ",

            "\u00a0Strength: I think the topics covered are fairly interesting, and lecture examples were interesting enough to me\r\n\r\nWeakness: the class is graded way too easily, which is a problem since it is graded on a curve, which makes it rather difficult to differentiate between students, so each small mistake on an exam is very costly ",

            "\u00a0The main strength of this course, particularly as it compares to Intro Micro, is how immediately relevant the material is to the real world. However, in practice, much of the real-world analysis and examples we went over in lecture felt irrelevant and distracting from the fundamentals we needed to know. Generally, this class could often feel scattered and all-over-the-place, as lecture and lecture notes were not concise or focused. Also, I think exams should be made more difficult in order to increase the spread of scores. As they were, the midterms were very straightforward, but that actually made the curve much worse, since the exam average was extremely high and small deviations in scores corresponded to large changes in letter grade.

I suggest that we try to change this to have normal grade cut-offs that aren't based on distributions. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of this course was how well they tied in everything to real world examples; it made the concepts feel much less abstract. I also think the class did a really good job of using Piazza, where all the questions were answered thoroughly and promptly. I think the main way the course could be improved is if there were a stronger textbook / the textbook that the instructors made went at least as in depth as the lectures did; it could be frustrating when you didn't understand a topic in lecture, and then the textbook gave only a cursory overview of the topic. ",

The head TF (William Hawkins) did a fantastic job of making clear what we did and did not need to know for each exam by putting together a comprehensive list of each topic, idea, and fact that we needed to be familiar with for every lecture. The class could be improved with a little more grading transparency ",

            "\u00a0I believe that the strengths of this course are the abundant amount of resources available to students to study the material of this class and to prepare for exams. The instructors provided notes from each lecture, section review, chapter notes, additional questions, office hours, and exam review sessions. The weaknesses of this course are the sections. The questions taught during section didn't always reflect material covered during that week's lectures and the section TA's weren't always able to explain the questions clearly. This could be improved by encouraging attendance to section so more people attend section so the room isn't as silent as it was in my section and to ensure that the section TA's understand the material well and can instruct students about this information. ",
            "\u00a0William Hawkins is the greatest asset to this course. The range in TA quality was shocking - some were very uncomfortable teaching and did not know the material well. From what I can tell, Hawkins was working around the clock answering Piazza questions, organizing people and schedules, and generally knowing his sh**. ",
            "\u00a0Concepts were very innteresting, but the curve was very hard, to the point where students received lower grades from the curve than they got on the tests percentage-wise. Either the tests should be made more difficult, or the curve shohld be made more friendly. ",

There were accurate review sessions, and the new Section format with students solving relevant questions was effective. That being said, the Exams had no skill-separation; negative curving is expected. You're not getting an A if you miss one multiple choice question and suffer some petty deductions on a writing problem. This was very frustrating. In Microeconomics, the spread on Exams were better. Also, some Math was introduced during lectures, but students just had to memorize results without having to prove them like in Microeconomics. ",

            "\u00a0Great course.  The tests were way too easy which made it hard to stand out in the curve.  Make the tests harder so the students who really put the effort in to learn the material are the ones that get As. ",
            "\u00a0The course could be more challenging and there are many overlapping topics with microeconomics that when taught in Macroeconomics could have been expedited. ",
            "\u00a0More time on Midterm 2.  That was ridiculous.  Also just get rid of the curve.\r\n\r\nAllow laptops.  I like to take notes electronically for easy future reference and to change slides at my own pace. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that the lectures and problem sets were well designed. I really liked the online quiz portion of the problem sets because I was able to test my comprehension and learn from my mistakes without suffering consequences. I know the course was being restructured, but I wish there had been more practice problems or tests online that were relevant to the current material. For intro micro, there were also office hours in the CTL before a pset was due and that would have also been helpful. ",
            "\u00a0First off, this class was pretty much restructured for this semester, based on a lot of feedback they had received about it in previous semesters. You can tell that the course director, William Hawkins, and Professor Tsyvinski really tried to redo the course so that the content was more applicable to what students need to know about introductory macroeconomics, and it also seems like it was a lot easier than when it was taught in previous semesters. Another strength is that pretty much everything you need to do well in the course is on the Canvas website and Piazza- those two resources are pretty well-organized and I probably wouldnt have survived without Piazza (huge shoutout to Dr. Hawkins for answering basically every question in a really timely manner!). Since the course was pretty different than how it was taught in previous semesters, it was a little confusing to estimate what material you did and didnt need to know for exams based on old exams. However, the homework problem sets and the section practice problems were really good guides to the kinds of things that would be on exams. I would say one weakness is that lecture wasnt really the most helpful for understanding the material. ",

            "\u00a0Id say a strength was Professor Tsyvinskis organization, as well as very organized sections and piazza boards.\r\n\r\nSome weaknesses - way too much material covered in notes that wasnt included in tests and some TFs couldnt properly teach the material. ",

            "\u00a0The lecture can be very slow ",
            "\u00a0This course was overall a very good primer on macroeconomics, but I think harder tests would be useful. The curve was extremely competitive, with an A grade being in the mid 90% range. A harder test would give a more reasonable curve. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was strong every aspect. The powerpoints were detailed but easily comprehensible. The lectures were great discussions of the powerpoints, and it covered many different aspects of the economy--a complete course. The problem sets were reasonable and very helpful for putting together the course material. Section also was great for review. It would have been nice analyze each topic from the consumer's perspective since we will all see have to look at macroeconomic policies and analyze them as consumers. ",
            "\u00a0Liked the online quizzes.  Sections were not helpful. My TA was not good.  Went to a different section when I did attend ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: microphone troubles. Having a clear, loud microphone in that auditorium would make a world of difference in terms of getting everyone to pay attention and making sure that we started class on time. ",

            "\u00a0It is a good course if you had the right TA.  Otherwise, your learning and retention will be greatly inhibited.  The TAs that did know what they were doing were amazing, those who didnt were a lot less than amazing.  A strength of the course was that the Professor posted slides of every lecture on Canvas without hesitation, allowing me to more effectively go back and review any material I might have missed in lecture.
