            "\u00a0How to discuss philosophy in a professional setting; I learned and improved my ability to connect different sources of knowledge to arrive at philosophical questions or agreements. I also became more accustomed to various philosophers, namely Friedrich Nietzsche and John Stuart Mill. A new concept, relational happiness, how we affect and are affected by the external world with regard to happiness, was also introduced to me through the class. ",
            "\u00a0I developed my general understanding of the field of philosophy, and how it feels like to be a philosophy student. The course helps me reflect on my own life and how my search for happiness should be. It makes me aspire to major in philosophy later in college. ",
            "\u00a0to think about questions in our life in a philosophical way\r\nto take a step back \r\nto try to be happy ",
            "\u00a0The course introduced some theories about Happiness that proposed by several famous philosophers, which helped me a lot in getting a broad understanding of the development of western ethics and developing the skill of critical thinking when encountering some theoretical dilemma and practical problems. ",
            "\u00a0Reflecting life experiences in a philosophical way, and making clear arguments out of our own thoughts. ",
            "\u00a0Throughout the class, we learned and discussed about different definitions and perspective on pursuing happiness. This course have exceed my exceptions on helping me to develop my own philosophy. Being able to discuss about the big questions among a small group of people who have totally different backgrounds really helps to view questions from different perspectives. Therefore, I was able to have a well-rounded view rather than having to hear single stories. ",
            "\u00a0Philosophical theory, different viewpoint  about the way to happiness. Hard to tell what theory I agree with most, but I truly become more grateful and tolerant. ",
            "\u00a0By taking this course I got a better understanding of how the perception of happiness changed throughout the last centuries. By comparing different philosophers and highlighting their differences and similarities I got a better understanding of the various ways people live and reflect on their life. Furthermore I got an in depth view of how fellow students relate and work with the topics we discussed. By getting to know their opinion I got the chance to challenge my own. Therefore my own perception of happiness changed throughout this course. This is significant because it shows that the work we did in class has widely influenced me and my attitude in general.\r\nSkill wise I improved on focusing on a specific topic or argument and the structure of my essays. I developed better writing skills by improving in how to develop an argument and how to write an essay which is clear and convincing. "

            "\u00a0The range of texts covered was just precise enough to touch on different issues but broad enough to cover time period and the breadth of ideas on the topic. \r\n\r\nThere could have been more structure to the discussions and bi-weekly assignments. Added direction would have, I think, given more precision to the philosophical questions we discussed. On a more structural level, giving students the option to decompress thoughts after class, rather than posting assignments before class, would help. Many times I felt the ideas developed in class were either forgotten or abandoned because there was no other outlet besides discussion to 'keep them alive'. ",
            "\u00a0I don't notice any major weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0everything is wonderful ",
            "\u00a0The class atmosphere was active yet the content of discussions somewhat lacked focus and professional analysis. Hope the course can concentrate more on reading materials instead of simply sharing personal experiences. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very good for beginners of philosophy, which can provide a general sense of what philosophical questions and arguments are like, meanwhile introducing the most central topic of ethics throughout history of philosophy. It has more to do with everyones life experiences than ethical theories in the texts, so it could not dive too deep into every thinker, since every historical period or school has to be condensed into one seminar. On the other hand, sometimes the discussions will go astray from the topic and cannot probe into all the points in the readings. ",
            "\u00a0The only thing that the course could be improved is to have an extended course period! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include the professor, who is a very knowledgable, understanding and experienced person. He could always figure out the shining points from our answer, and base his class on this. Also, the class is also composed of fantastic student, sharing their stories and confuse in class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- lively discussions\r\n- supports learning by oneself\r\n- creation of a save and trustful environment which gives everybody the chance open up and speak\r\n- interesting content and arrangement of texts\r\n- clear structure and overview "

            "\u00a0Yes, I would. Happiness is a profoundly interesting philosophical topic. Although no one will ever find any answers to the question \"how do we find happiness\", in my relatively nihilistic worldview, the study of this topic broadens worldviews and opens up new avenues of thought and reflection. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, regardless of their major/intended major. This is a very inspiring course that does not only help one build a stronger understanding of philosophy in general but also drive one to reflect more on their lives. This is a course that everyone should take. ",
            "\u00a0Of course. Very wise and kind professor, patient, knowledgeable, and showed great care for the class.\r\nGreat reading materials to help develop better understanding\r\nIndependent thinking encouraged\r\nfruitful in-class discussion ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially if he or she has some doubt in life and wish to seek a thorough examination of the possibilities of happiness. This course can open up a new intellectual dimension of life. ",
            "\u00a0This is a good class for students who perhaps haven't been exposed to a lot of philosophy before. It's very useful as a refresher. The class also provides an avenue for students to reflect on what happiness means to them and how that will shape the way they live their lives. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely. Not only this course talks about history of philosophy, it also provides a space for students to develop their world view. This course largely encourages people to share their ideas and speak up about their positions. The class, classmates, and professor provides a comfortable environment to speak openly about personal perspectives on life. This course is definitely worth taking. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, of course. it is a course which no matter which country you are from, what language base you have and whivh subject you are majoring in, you can all find yourselves some juicy thought in the process of learning. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely.\r\nHappiness is a topic which relates to all of us. In my opinion engaging with the topic and getting to know different views and opinions not only helps you to find your personal 'key to happiness' but also to better understand actions and decisions of people around you. \r\nFurthermore, learning more about the various perceptions of happiness in the past helps to better understand history and the current situation in this world.
