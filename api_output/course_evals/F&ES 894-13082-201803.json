            "\u00a0This was a subject matter I was completely unfamiliar with and now I feel like I have a great foundational knowledge in it. And I really enjoyed it. Environmentally sustainable building is not just about design but also about how operations of the building play a part in building performance and how occupants of the building engage to make it high performance.

            "\u00a0Breadth of content gives you a chance to really appreciate all there is to think about in this area. I like the once a week meeting format and the mix of types of assignments. Sometimes we didn't get to go into a given topic in depth due to time constraints. I liked the guest speakers and think including a field trip is a very good idea. ",
            "\u00a0The class was described by Peter as teach future building occupants as being able to interact with and understand green buildings. I feel like this is an undersell of student's ambitions and interest. The course should be taught as a preparatory course for people to become active participants in the green building discourse, whether or not that is a student's trajectory. In short, it lacked rigor. To that point, I would like to read more primary literature and less buildinggreen reports. ",
            "\u00a0This class was disappointing from multiple points of view. \r\n\r\nThe field trip that peter organizes is pretty informative - although presents some questionable case studies.The reading material for the first part of the class is interesting and selected from multiple sources. The second part of the class assigns most of the readings from a single publication, that is not an academic journal or a canonical publication. I do not think this is enough for a grad school class that claims to look at different \"perspectives\" on the topic. \r\n\r\nThe assignments and the grading are extremely poorly designed. Instead of focusing on encouraging dialogue, or discussions based on readings, which you would expect from a class that tries to bring together people from multiple fields, the \"teaching strategy\" is a checklist. There are readings assigned are very rarely discussed in class. Most of the time you are expected to complete a poorly designed online quizz that test very specific information which most of the participants will never remember/use afterwards. Needless to say, everyone completes the quizzes searching for and then copy/pasting answers from the reading. I think all of us expected to engage a lot more with the readings and have better quality reading materials. \r\n\r\nA lot of time is lost during class time because the course is very disorganized. About 15 minutes were lost at the beginning of each session discussing \"bookkeeping\", moving deadlines and assignments around, or voting on unimportant issues (often only find out later that the result of the vote was irrelevant since the professor decided to change it anyways). \r\n\r\nSome speakers were knowledgeable and presented the material in a critical way. However, a lot of lectures were very poor. In some cases, the level of discourse was way lower than what you would expected in an academic environment like Yale (with speakers unable to answer questions or explain their argument in a coherent way or without getting defensive when prompted). In a particularly bad lecture, about biophilic design, none of us felt like they understood what the conversation was about (although most of us are very used to following complex arguments) . There was so little critical thinking in that lecture and the argument of the speaker was so poorly formulated that she was unable to answer any question clearly or without getting defensive. Moreover, there were some extremely questionable claims in the discourse of the speaker (out of context and superficial claims about the \"design quality\" of canonical works by Frank Lloyd Wright or Frank Gehry) that we could barely dare to bring up at some point because of how uncomfortable the speaker was. It was very hard to have any kind of healthy debate in the class. \r\n\r\nOverall, definitely a poor class, thought in an extremely unprofessional way. I have no doubt that Peter is very good at what he is doing outside Yale. However, this class is not doing what it claims to do, because the level of discourse is very low in anything that is not what he specializes in. This has a lot to do with the choice of speakers, the reading material, and the structure of the assignments and the discussions. There are extremely qualified professors and even phd students at Yale in the departments that topics in this class address, who would be a great source for this course as guest speakers. There are also extremely good publications on the topic that would engage a much better level of discourse that the reading materials selected for this class. This class can use a lot of improvement. \r\n\r\nLastly, there are issues with the way in which the class policies are applied. The class claims to have a no-electronics policy, which I get the feeling that is not applied impartially. A lot of personal emails and personal remarks are made. At times it felt like it was unclear who the \"client\" was and what the goal of the entire class is and some of the emails were, frankly, offensive. "

            "\u00a0Even if a topic doesn't get treated in depth in class due to time constraints, take the time to dig into it on your own. The materials allow for this. Spend the time to think about the details of some of the topics because there are a lot of details to consider. ",
            "\u00a0Use the final project to achieve your aims in this course. ",
