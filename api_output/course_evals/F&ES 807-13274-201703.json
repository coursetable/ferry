It seemed particularly useful in exposing some of the students to a range of topics they had never considered before. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I was not one of the students who benefited from broad exposure, as I was already familiar with most of the subject matter and hoping to dive deeper. The material we covered was high-level and super theoretical. We did not go into enough detail on specific cases. Course organization was poor, even though this course has been offered several times before. Overall, the weaknesses vastly outweighed the strengths. ",

The expectations from the course for the project didn't really align with the clients, and it was difficult to balance expectations from two sides.\r\n\r\nThe weakness is breadth of the topics that this class tried to cover. It's too broad. ",

I think we could have spent a little less time in how to \"sell\" the sustainability strategies to stakeholder and more on how to actually design them (Supply chain, BoP, CSV, etc). Also at the beginning there was not much feedback on the grades of the study cases, which was improved by the end of the course but the feedback did not come in a timely way (i.e. having the feedback before the next study case was due).\r\n\r\nIn general the class environment was a little more tense than the regular FES class. Which can be a product of the classroom distribution, the fact that as an SOM class it was a little more competititve or the fact that some times one of the professors didn't let the students finish their questions. ",

            "\u00a0The course instructors have plenty of firsthand experience with the subject and are able to apply their knowledge to current examples of business-related environmental topics. However, many of the lectures were repetitive and common sense by the end of the semester. The course could have been strengthened by using a wider variety of examples in the class discussions and diving more into the ethics of environmental-related business decisions. In addition, the professors could have given us more thorough feedback on our assignments and final projects. ",

            "\u00a01. The lectures are very repetitive. \r\n2. the interactions between lecturers is awkward, stilted, and sometimes downright unfriendly. This was especially evident in the midterm exam, where all of the questions came from one lecturer's lectures (Dan's) and none from the other instructor's lectures (Marian's). This was a shame as Marian's lectures were very interesting. \r\n3. Honestly, the main thing this course needs is a total overhaul with updated information from people who have actually worked in CSR in the last twenty years. Most of the class readings were stale and felt largely out of touch with CSR today. \r\n4. A number of times in this course, the instructors stopped class compelling and interesting class discussions. This has to stop as the people in the class often had more interesting things to say than the profs. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Good case studies for environmental and business problems. Green to gold is good, (but also a weakness, class should supplement the readings, not be a repeat of the book throughout the entire semester...). \r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class is extremely basic and very repetitive. The class teaches to the student with the least experience, leaving anyone with working knowledge of environmental / business issues in a slow moving class that doesn't teach to new ideas. \r\n\r\nImprovements: More new content please. Also, please teach to students with experience, or offer an advanced class. ",
            "\u00a0The first couple of weeks are very insightful. But afterwards it became a rehashing of the same few concepts. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- Large breadth of knowledge\r\n- Projects were practical and interesting\r\n- Interim deadlines for project were appreciated\r\n- Speakers were very interesting! It would have been great to even have more.\r\n- Lots of great case studies to examine\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Grading seemed arbitrary and I never really knew what was expected of me for the assignments throughout the semester\r\n- More in class activities or small group discussions would have been appreciated, a little too much lecture\r\n- Some readings seemed a little out dated, some updating would be helpful ",
            "\u00a0More focus on some of the cases! We put a lot of work into them and then don't really use them.\r\n\r\nAlso: we have a midterm and project and the essays. It's a lot of work, which is fine, but maybe look at cutting back on one or the expectations of the client project. ",
            "\u00a0The final project presentation rubric seemed to focus on the slides themselves, not the overall presentation when it did not take into account volume, diction, pace, word choice, and flow.  We received a lot of comments on our power point picture selection--yet learning power point was not covered in the class.  It seemed unusual to grade an oral presentation mostly on the presentation aid and not the presentation itself. ",
            "\u00a0Overall great course and I loved the range of topics. Three criticisms though. 1. A bit too basic on some topics that the students are really invested in. For example, about a third of the class went to the COP meeting in Bonn, so obviously everone is pretty keyed in on these topics, but the actual lectures relating to them were very prosaic and backward-looking. 2. We could have really gained from having more discussion of NEGATIVE cases too, businesses that tried and failed in this ESG space, such as Clorox, Chipotle, Volkswagen, Solyndra, etc. Too much focus in the lectures readings and assignments on the success stories, plus framing ambivalent stories to make them appear to be true successes. We could have learned a lot from looking at companies that try and fail to meet their goals. 3. Course organization issues surrounding assignment grading and TAs. there were three TAs in the course but it took forever to get anything graded. This meant that we were done with the second and third homeworks before we got any idea if our approach was correct, because we still hadnt gotten graded on the first. One of the TAs didnt actually have time to sit in on the course, so her grading was super harsh because she had no idea what we were actually learning. And how can there be three TAs and none of them are ever holding office hours?? Also, the assignment topics were completely detached from the course material in almost every respect, with only the most cursory attempt to address the content or expectations. Really a missed opportunity to use the assignments to complement our learning. ",
            "\u00a0- The course was interesting, and a survey of the challenges of incorporating sustainability into business\r\n- The assignments were graded very late, and had poor or no feedback. It would have been helpful to receive the grade and constructive feedback in time to be able to improve and learn from our previous assignments. Since we received the grades after all four of the assignments were handed in there was no room to know how we were doing or on what we should be improving.\r\n- The communication for assignments, deadlines, differences between deliverables for final project, format and content expected,  etc could be improved.\r\n- It would have been valuable for our TA to have attended our final presentation and received feedback on the presentation to be able to incorporate it to our final project.\r\n- The team project evaluations were very binary, just regarding quantity and quality of work, leaving out space to comment on other important group team dynamics that can affect teamwork. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are the professor lectures, the homework exercises, the readings, and Marian's power-points. The weaknesses were the strict limitation to discussion. Students expressed interest in discussing the reading and homework assignments, but discussion was cut-off. I believe this restricted our education as it prevented students from a deeper level of examination. \r\n\r\nAnother limitation was that many of the business examples or case studies were repeated (about Whole Foods and Interface carpet) and were relatively old. It would have been better to have more current examples. ",
            "\u00a0More clearly articulate the long-term goals and expectations with client projects at the start of the semester. There seemed to be some surprises for some of the teams regarding meetings with Dan/Marian and meetings with TFs. ",
            "\u00a0The TAs were not great\r\nDan's lectures did not add to the readings\r\nMaterial and ideas covered was good\r\nPoor class culture and dynamic ",
            "\u00a0The client assignment was great, I'd recommend making this a larger focus of the class. ",
            "\u00a0Very bland reading. Courses were for the most part very broad so I can't say I learned much that I didn't already know. It was kind of like \"it is very important for you to build a metrics strategy for your company\" and then there was no explanation of how to do an effective one for different types of companies. ",
            "\u00a0please make the final project clear before the second to last week of class. We had no idea what the actual deliverable was until then. ",
            "\u00a0One major weakness was that a LOT of the material was clearly recycled from previous semesters, which usually isn't an issue, however it was apparent that the material had been recycled so many times that a lot of it was extremely dated. This is especially true for the homework case studies.\r\n\r\nAlso, feedback and grades for the homework assignments was EXTREMELY late. Homework feedback should be returned before the subsequent homework assignment so that issues/deficiencies can be corrected and not repeated. ",
            "\u00a0The instructors provided a lot of great discussion points for an engaging class. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the wide swath of topics was incredible. I definitively learned how to implement a sustainability strategy. I also really enjoyed the writing assignments which required an deep dive into some very interesting case studies. I would like to have discussed the case studies more in class, perhaps using the case studies as a lens to uncovering the class themes as opposed to going down an outline of topics. I also thought the teachers could have challenged the students more - it seemed pretty easy to skirt by without participating too much. I would consider taking out some topics on policy and sustainability investing - simply acknowledging that both ESG and global climate negotiations would have been enough. But devoting an entire lecture, equating each topic with supply chain management or other key principles, does not seem to add up. ",
            "\u00a0Didn't receive feedback from TAs for a long time, so was not sure how I was doing or how to improve.\r\n\r\nGood introduction to important concepts at the nexus of business and sustainability. ",
            "\u00a0Enjoyed the dynamic between Marian and Dan - both brought great insight and experience to the classroom and had informative lectures. There were several times during the semester when the class got into a lively discussion and had to be cut off for the sake of time. Perhaps it would be worth considering adding a 1-hour discussion section for the class each week, where students could continue the debates, share their sustainability experiences from the real world, or use the time for collaborating on class assignments. \r\n\r\nVery much enjoyed my group project, though I know other groups had challenges with their clients or group mates. ",
            "\u00a0Areas for improvement: could reference the readings in class more (not just \"Green to Gold\"--we were assigned plenty of other material that was informative and engaging and never discussed). When class discussions get out of hand, you gotta monitor that--and not just to cut women off when they're talking. I felt that the class kept cycling through to the same few themes (when can sustainability command a premium? how do we make a business case for sustainability?? shareholders and stakeholders and social responsibility--what are we to do???) without much development or even any especially convincing or relevant case studies. So, a greater sense of direction and building towards specific insights would have been helpful. Finally, a more thoughtfully-spaced timeline for assignments coupled with *timely feedback* on our submissions would have greatly enhanced student learning. Just realized there's no spot to evaluate the TF's here, so doubling back here to double down on that point--TFs were not helpful.\r\n\r\nStrengths: occasionally, the class discussions would be informative and stimulating. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were the consistency of the strategic framework, derived from Prof Esty's book, as well as the complementing perspectives of Prof Chertow and Prof Esty. Prof Chertows more technical focus was valuable. It could be be strengthened through modernization. Most of the low-hanging fruit of CSR efforts have already been accomplished and understanding how to go green in a world in which green is the norm is now more important. ",
