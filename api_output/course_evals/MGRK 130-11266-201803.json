            "\u00a0Maria structures this course very well for learning and feedback. We practice the grammar and vocabulary until it becomes natural (and it helps that the class is every day). It would help if there were more oral practice/assessment. ",
            "\u00a0I think that all students could benefit from more frequent oral interviewing, perhaps included into part of the grade. ",
            "\u00a0I loved almost everything about this class. It was consistently the part of my day I looked forward to and there's very little about this experience that I'd want to change. "

            "\u00a0If you are interested in learning modern Greek, yes! Maria is a wonderful professor. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Modern Greek classes are typically small class sizes, so you get to form a very close-knit community.The classroom is a comfortable environment to learn, which makes it enjoyable to come to class. We participate in a variety of classroom activities during each class period and each activity sharpens a different aspect of our language learning skills (e.g. listening, speaking, writing, reading). ",
            "\u00a0For sure. Anybody who wants to learn Modern Greek will find it to be a delightful series of language classes. "
