            "\u00a0Throughout the lecture portion of the course, we were exposed to the great array of research going on in the biomedical engineering department and in collaboration with the biomedical engineering department at Yale. The senior-only portion of the course reinforced some skills about presentations and proposals. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the different research going on at Yale. Also learned presentation skills. ",
            "\u00a0I felt I came away with a broader understanding of the  wide array of research happening at Yale. I also have a better idea of how to write a proposal. ",

            "\u00a0Overview of different labs, their research and basic presentation/writing skills ",
            "\u00a0I definitely gained a better sense of what Biomedical Engineering faculty are researching. I also learned a ton about entrepreneurship and Yale through the many speakers that came in to talk about opportunities and what previous students had done. ",
            "\u00a0From the guest lectures, I learned about interesting research being conducted across a variety of disciplines, as well as how to think about research with a human-centered design approach and through an entrepreneurial lens. Although we also had a group presentation project and wrote NIH-style proposals, I didnt feel like I gained any new skills related to scientific presentations or writing. ",
            "\u00a0This course gives a decent overview of some of the research that is going on in the BENG department. ",
            "\u00a0This course is still in development, but it was a good overview to the work that some Yale BME faculty are doing. Also a soft introduction to proposal writing. ",
            "\u00a0Not much ",
            "\u00a0We learned about NIH grants and other professors research ",

            "\u00a0This course did well in introducing important people doing significant work in biomedical engineering, but that was more successful in the first half of this course. It was actually pretty cool to research and present possible solutions to health problems and see everyone else present their ideas as well. This class could have a more pre-professional nature in prepping students interested in pursuing higher education in biomedical engineering or applying to industry jobs. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the movement toward making this a sophomore course will solve any shortcomings of this class. For seniors, introducing the research of faculty and giving us exercises meant to strengthen proposals and presentations comes a little late as we have all already gotten to know many of the professors--many of us already conducting research with a PI--and have written proposals and presentations for other classes, for jobs, or for our labs. ",
            "\u00a0Strength is the large amount of interesting research that is presented on. It is also a low commitment which is great for senior year when a lot of other things are going on. This is a great class to learn about biomedical engineering in a lower pressure environment. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed that it felt less intense than other BME classes and really allowed us to dive into issues that we cared about in more practical manner. The Tuesday lectures were a great way to meet sophomores and I thought the open discussions was a good format. To improve, I think there could definitely be more clarity about the course plan, deadlines, and what is expected in the projects. ",
            "\u00a0This entire class was a mess, but I would expect nothing more of Andre Levchenko. The class was pretty useless, especially since we are seniors, most of us have a lab, and we didn't have quizzes on the material like the sophomores. It should not be for seniors, it should not be taught by Levchenko (but nothing should be), and it should be a more useful class. ",
            "\u00a0It would have been nice to write the proposal about about something more focused and BME related. The freedom to do just about anything was cool, but not super realistic as far as the assignment could have gone.\r\nAlso, would have been waaaay helpful to have the presentations as a sophomore to actually help choose a lab early. ",
            "\u00a0This course was great in that it was not very stressful and did not have many assignments. It really felt like its main purpose was to show us students what research in the field looks like and I believe that it achieved its goal. It was a bit disappointing that some guest lecturers had to cancel and couldn't give us their perspective, but I still enjoyed the presentations from Yale faculty. A key strength of their presentations was that they took a convoluted scientific paper (that they published) and made it easy (or easier) to understand. ",
            "\u00a0The weekly guest lectures, which were well-organized and smoothly run by Prof. Kathryn Miller-Jensen, were a great way to hear about cool research from experts across multiple fields. However, I felt that this type of exposure, while interesting, was much more useful to the sophomores, who are still exploring different interests and deciding on labs to join; for us seniors, it was a little late in the game and supports why the department should transition the senior seminar into a sophomore seminar instead. On the other hand, the Thursday classes, run by Prof. Levchenko, were poorly organized. Deadlines posted on Canvas were consistently inconsistent with those announced in class (to Prof. Levchenkos credit, he was flexible about granting extensions in light of these miscommunications). The group presentation and individual proposal seemed promising, but asking us to come up with novel solutions to unmet medical needs within one week was unreasonable, especially since we were given very little helpful direction on how to do this in the first place. We also received zero grades on any assignments throughout the semester, despite multiple requests by students for feedback on our group presentations. I hope the BME department reflects on what the purpose of a senior seminar should be and reconsiders whether it needs to be part of the curriculum. I think it would be a much better use of our time to replace this class with an additional BME elective or a full-year senior project requirement. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Gives an overview of research in the department.   Would be helpful if you were looking to join a lab, but since this is a senior class, most of us are already in a lab.\r\nWeaknesses: Many of the lecturers were not engaging.  There was very little continuity from class day to class day.  The TEAL classroom was not good for this lecture class; it promoted distraction.  Even when I wanted to be engaged I often found it hard to pay attention since I always seemed to be sitting at a weird angle and surrounded by people on computers.  Also, the mission of the class was unfocused.  It said that we were going to learn about presentation and writing skills, but we only did one presentation and one writing assignment.  The presentation was graded on a 0/1 scale which made it almost impossible to get any feedback.  The writing was peer reviewed but we never received an instructor or TA evaluation.\r\n\r\nThis class could be improved by:\r\n- Don't try to split the class between a research overview and a scientific writing/presentation class.  We ended up breezing through everything, and I don't feel that I improved my writing or presentation skills at all.  Please pick one.\r\n- If there are going to be lectures, please pick a more conventional lecture hall. \r\n- Please give us better/more detailed feedback on presentations and writing.\r\n- Please choose another instructor for the class or have it be more TA-led.  Professor Levchenko is clearly a brilliant engineer, but his presentation skills are not the best, and it struck me as odd to have him teaching a class focused on presentation skills. ",
            "\u00a0Strength is that you get to read primary literature and then hear about it from the original authors. It is a little scattered because the research at Yale is so diverse. ",
            "\u00a0The guest lectures were pretty interesting but the actual senior seminar part of the course was pretty much a bunch of busy work. The innovation presentation and the proposal had very little guidance that made it seem very non-constructive as a learning experience. There was very little help for the proposal which was pretty difficult to do and had barely any guidelines, which made me feel lost. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is that there was not too much work and there was a good amount of exposure to relevant BME careers. The weaknesses are that the course often felt a bit contrived and the final lecture was a bit disturbing ",
            "\u00a0It was really cool how we gained exposure to so many different labs at Yale. Maybe it would've been good if there was more discussion time at round tables post lecture ",
            "\u00a0Honestly I don't really know why we had to take this class, we didn't really do anything. If anything I guess the guidelines could have been clearer for the few assignments we had (there was some confusion about due dates and formatting). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: breadth, collaborative nature, great to have a class with the whole major\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not as organized, but will get better with repeated iterations of the class "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0If you're in this class, it's because you're a senior BME major. You'll get through it. ",
            "\u00a0It's a fine class to take, also it's necessary for BME majors. It's a fun time to see everyone in the major in one room, but you're not going to be doing too much besides a lot of work for the group presentations and the project proposal, but otherwise not bad. ",
            "\u00a0As this will transition into a sophomore course, I would recommend it! It's a good overview of the research going on in the department and a good way to start a conversation with faculty that you might want to work with if you're interested in research. It's also a class with relaxed assignments on the presentation/proposal side--a group presentation and one proposal although the expectations for the types of ideas that the professor is looking for are vague and often unclear. I'm not sure if the structure of assignments will change drastically once it's a sophomore class, but I imagine it'll remain required anyway for the major so you gotta do what you gotta do. Overall, it's a painless and often interesting class! KMJ is awesome if she's still running the lectures. ",
            "\u00a0This is the required BME senior seminar so you'll have to take it. But do not worry about it, it is a great class with little work. You have to do a group presentation on a topic of your choice and then later on there is a write up project proposal that is individual. It is a nice easy, low pressure class. Different Yale faculty present on their reserach each week and you just have to show up and listen. Enjoy this class. It is a great break from all the intensive BME classes that we are usually drowning in. ",
            "\u00a0Only for BME majors. ",
            "\u00a0No. But you have to take it for BME. Thankfully, they're transitioning it for sophomores and KMJ is running it, GOD BLESS HER. ",
            "\u00a0Sure, you'll probably have to take it though ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to a student in biomedical engineering as it is not very stressful and is engaging. However, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone outside the major. ",
            "\u00a0No, though you might have to take it as a BME senior. This class had a good deal of potential to sharpen our skills in scientific presentations and proposal writing, but it was poorly planned and executed. It was not a lot of work but was mostly a waste of time outside of the guest lectures, which were with the sophomores and organized by Prof. Miller-Jensen, not Prof. Levchenko. ",
            "\u00a0No.  If you pay close attention during the lectures you can get a good overview of the research going on in the department.  But the lectures are almost never engaging, and most people don't pay attention and learn nothing. ",
            "\u00a0This is a good class to take if you'd like to familiarize yourself with the BME research at Yale. This was the first year that it was offered in its current form, so the workload was quite light. The course instructors (Miller-Jensen and Levchenko) were very receptive to feedback. ",
            "\u00a0I would not take it if you don't have to but if you do, its not bad! ",
            "\u00a0It's required, but it's a cool class to take as one of your last requirements for BME as a senior ",
            "\u00a0Meh, you have to take it but there's literally two assignments so it's more annoying than difficult. ",
            "\u00a0It was interesting, but you dont really know how you are doing in the course. But I had a fun time with the assignments ",
            "\u00a0Great overview course for the major and a nice way to cap off senior year "
