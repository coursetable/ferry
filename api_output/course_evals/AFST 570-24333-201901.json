My only suggestion is a little more structure on the instructions for assignments. Sometimes I felt like I wasn't sure what I need to be doing for some of the homeworks and projects. ",

The experience of more countries in Africa could be presented in such literature. They could also be more closer working with students to ensure they development the relevant text mining skills "
