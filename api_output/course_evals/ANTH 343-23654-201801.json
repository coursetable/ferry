The syllabus was inherently brilliant, rich and full of different modes of engaging with the Maghreb and with feminist theories. The small class size and Prof. Newman's superb leading of section pulled so much out of these texts, and helped us engage our own positionality, experiences, and interests with the class material. "

Brilliant readings - will always be grateful for my introduction to Bouteldja - and really fantastic instruction that guided us through the intricacies and disparities of the region, its pre-, colonial, and dubiously post-colonial histories, and its knowledge production. A superb grounding in classic Orientalism that equipped us to contend with its multitudinous modern manifestations. "
