            "\u00a0This course was great for analyzing non-academic essays, and then writing our own. Many first-years assume that college essays will all be research-based, but this course is a completely different path and provides a lot of insight into the different type of writing. ",
            "\u00a0I learned skills and techniques on how to improve my nonfiction writing. I learned that writing does not have to be what was taught in high school but is a way through which I can be myself and have my own unique voice. This class helped me to also analyze the writing of famous authors and to ask myself the purpose of why they did what they did in their pieces. After taking these thoughts into consideration, I was able to use these essays as models for my own. Also, the seminar setting helped me to voice my thoughts and have discussions with others on an intellectual topic. ",
            "\u00a0Through this course,  I was able to improve my writing skills in creative ways. This class explores essays across a variety of authors, then allows you discuss what these professionals do (or don't do) well, what strategies they use in writing, etc. Then through the series of five essays, you get to directly apply what you learned. I loved getting to play with creative structures and topics for the essays. I also learned how to use Chicago style footnotes/citations, which is a very beneficial skill. I think I have a new mindset when it comes to life because of this class; I often find myself thinking about something in terms of how I might write an ENGL120 essay about it. This class helps you find new perspectives on everyday things. Never before have I taken a class that has changed my outlook on life as much as ENGL120 has. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely a good class for writing credit. Helps with your writing without slamming you with work. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to use techniques to subtly introduce conflict and public points. ",
            "\u00a0I gained better close reading skills, learned better writing strategies/skills through reading and analyzing well-written essays (and some not so well-written, in my opinion). I think the biggest skills/tools I took away from this class were developing my writers voice and adapting it for different essay styles, and exploring different structural options in my writing. ",
            "\u00a0In English 120, I read, studied, and wrote modern essays. As a class, we read exceptional essays from famous authors, analyzed their messages, and learned how to integrate various literary techniques into our own writing. We wrote a total of five essays, ranging from writing about personal experiences to humor writing. The course was orientated more towards creative essay writing than traditional academic writing. Overall, English 120 is a great way to develop creative essay writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to emulate the writing of professionals and to read for style and craft. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to make personal writing interesting: I learned how to properly channel feedback into an interesting paper, figure out what other readers find enjoyable, and in particular, create a really enticing first paragraph that draws the readers into reading the rest of the piece. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Strengths lie in the structure of the course, which ensures study of a diverse amount of modern essays, as well as in the reading selections, which are each unique and interesting. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses lie in grading- an arbitrary scale that ensures that only already-accomplished writers will get As. While the idea of reserving As for award-worthy essays seems just, this really only serves to discourage non-writing majors from even attempting to move further in their writing careers. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that we are able to see how different writers write and what makes their writing a good piece. The overall theme of the course was \"what makes a good essay\" and each class added more to the bigger picture so that by the end, we learned a lot about writing. The weakness of the class is that the structure can become repetitive. Every class meeting was a seminar style discussion of the readings with no real variation. ",
            "\u00a0The discussions in class are definitely one of the strengths of this class; you get to work with other students to dissect an interesting or challenging text, looking at both the sentence-level work of authors and the bigger picture as well.\r\n\r\nThe only suggestion I have for improvement could be more peer editing beyond the workshop. Outside of the class, I would peer-edit with another classmate on our own, but it might be beneficial to have other assigned peer-editing. ",
            "\u00a0For the first half of the semester, we really didnt talk explictly about how we can apply the techniques used in the class readings to our own writing, but after we submitted our midterm evaluations the instructor adjusted and we began to discuss everything more concretely. Palmer was also very accessible for feedback on our essay drafts, which was very beneficial and was definitely a strength of the course. ",
            "\u00a0I do not have any critiques of any weaknesses.\r\n\r\nI believe that the greatest strength is the level of engagement the course offers. The seminar-style of the class helped me learn from my peers and grow as a writer. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this class was that I was engaged and looked forward to each class meeting. I thought the readings were well chosen and every student I talked to raved about his professor. \r\nI don't think this course had many weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength is the very small class size - it allows members of the class to become close and really trust each other. With the small size, each person had the ability to speak about the class texts and feel comfortable sharing their opinions. The biggest weakness was definitely the amount of texts we had to read in comparison to the meeting time of the class. We would oftentimes read 2 or 3 pieces and only have time to discuss one. "

            "\u00a0This is a great class for learning about non-research essays and for avoiding the typical pitfalls of a 114 or 115 course, but do NOT take if you expect an A. If youre happy with simply trying your best, reading weekly, and getting high Bs, then take this course by all means. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The style of writing taught in this class is very different than high school writing and I found it to be more enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would recommend ENGL120. I feel like I've been really inspired by this class, so much so that I want to continue writing essays like those you write for this class. The readings aren't too long, the essays you write for the class aren't too long, and the discussions in class are fantastic and fun. If you've already done a fair amount of academic writing like research papers, then branch out and try ENGL120 to get your creative juices flowing and write in a new style. ",
            "\u00a0Would recommend if you can't get into an easier writing seminar. Definitely less of a workload than 114 from what I can tell though. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this class will improve your writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! This course isnt necessarily focused on the type of writing youll commonly encounter in academia, but its a really great opportunity to gain appreciation for the versatility of language & build writing skills in general that can be extended to writing in all forms. And generally the class readings arent a drag, as Ive noticed they can be for other classes. (Some of them can be long, however  make sure you set aside a good hour or so to do the readings before class. This isnt a class you can skip reading for, but its also the kind of class where youd want to.) ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I actively recommend this course to my friends. I found creative essay writing extremely rewarding and enjoyable, and English 120 is the best place to start exploring the genre. After my positive experience in the course, it is only logical to recommend the course. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I think everyone could benefit from taking English 120. If you're not writing-minded, it might be better to start the class of Credit/D/Fail (as I did) just to take the pressure off at the beginning and let you feel the class out. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to someone who wants to improve as a writer, but not someone who wants to take a fun writing credit. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to someone that wants to become a better writer and discover new things about him or herself. I definitely got the chance to learn more about who I am as a person and what really matters to me and my writing significantly improved. However, this class should not be taken by anyone who simply wants to fulfill a writing credit. The grading scale is difficult and it is most definitely not an easy A. "
