            "\u00a0Swapna ji is a great instructor, and probably the most patient professor on campus. She would regularly let us get samosas and chai from SAS department events and was very understanding when it came to things like having to reschedule certain assignments. I think in terms of content, the course would have been better had there been more of an emphasis on reading Hindi literature, though I understand that it might have been difficult to implement given our class' tendency to not practice reading in our own time. ",
            "\u00a0Great course. You learn a little of everything: music, literature, history, film, and politics. I wish we read more Hindi diaspora writing. ",
            "\u00a0The course, at times, can be unclear and confusing. Perhaps a bit more structure would be helpful. \r\n\r\nThe class is like a family, though, and Swapna Ji and Wafa are incredible. You will be lucky to have such caring instructors! ",
            "\u00a0One of the only weaknesses is that the course was a little bit disorganized at times. Besides that the course was great. The instructor and teaching assistant were very accommodating and helpful, especially to those who did not have as strong of a background. "

            "\u00a0Definitely take this course. It was very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. This course is a great way to build on pre-existing Hindi knowledge that you have, even if you're only able to understand. The teacher and class guide you along beautifully to ensure you're on your way to success. "
