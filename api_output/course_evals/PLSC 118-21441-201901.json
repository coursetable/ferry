This course has a very clear and precise arc, beginning with the various types of enlightenment philosophers, moving onto the anti-enlightenment, and concluding with the democratic project. The readings may at times be of interest, though I do not believe that it is possible, with everything else going on, for a student to truly finish all the readings comprehensively. Some are relevant but others may sometimes be tangential to what is taught in class or discussed in section. ",

I thought the course was poorly advertised -- it felt like we (confusingly) walked through each thinker and their theory and very rarely considered their theory's applications to the present day.\r\n\r\nWe first covered the Enlightenment (utilitarianism, Marxism, and social contract theory) before getting to the anti-Enlightenment and democratic traditions. We focused on Locke, Hobbes, Bentham, Mill, Marx, Rawls, Nozick, Burke, MacIntyre, and Shapiro himself. ",

Hearing about Locke or Robert Nozick or Edmund Burke without having read their seminal works or discussed their ideas can be confusing or meaningless. This course provided an opportunity to learn about political philosophers of all stripes within the Western tradition, and it will serve me well in future studies. I also found myself surprised by the fact that many of the thinkers were thoroughly convincing despite providing the foundation for modern political traditions, like American conservatism, that I definitely reject.

Professor Shapiro places a refreshing emphasis on old ideas applied to modern political issues, as well as on twentieth and twenty-first century thinkers. This is really rare for most introduction to political philosophy courses. He is a highly original thinker who makes interesting connections between very different thinkers across time. In general, this course is great for recognizing patterns, a skill that any discipline requires. Moreover, my writing and critical thinking improved tremendously in this course. ",

Thanks to this course I also began to think more critically of the arguments made around me--of their logic, their effectiveness. ",
            "\u00a0The political philosophies we learned in this course mostly centered around the questions \"to what extent should we have government?\" and \"what role should the government play in a state?\" Since we examined the enlightenment and then the anti-enlightenment for most of the course, the most important topics were liberty/rights and equality/redistribution.

            "\u00a0I can say with confidence that I know how to approach political philosophy a lot more than I did at the beginning of the semester, especially the sort of thinking and analyses required. Political philosophy tries its hardest to hypothesize different forms of government without taking race and gender into serious consideration, and that makes the whole profession seem a bit fake. Capitalism is also always seen as the default and as inescapable, and there was not a lot of room in the course to imagine a society without it. "

On the downside, things were a bit hard to follow lectures aren't incredibly clear cut as to what the philosopher is arguing  sometimes it blurs into the critique. Also, review sessions for this course were a bit annoying because the TFs don't really answer the questions, they have other students answer but sometimes the other students don't make sense or are hard to hear but that's all there is.

With so much reading, I often felt like I had to skim the readings rather than spend enough time with them to really gain a deep grasp of the material.\r\n\r\nThe lectures were very informative and were useful because they went over the key points from the readings.\r\n\r\nDiscussion sections were also very useful for discussing complex material, although perhaps more time could have been reserved for Q&A. ",

As a newcomer to the complicated world of political philosopher, I was rarely lost in his lectures and he made political philosophy seem fascinating and approachable. There aren't any major weaknesses--except for the denseness of the readings. Definitely be prepared to read a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Good overview course that covers a lot of thinkers, Professor Shapiro is an engaging lecturer,Lot of interesting insights from all sides of the Western, mainstream, political spectrum.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The amount of reading was so great it was hard to keep up with them, and actually digest many of the readers for oneself. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Lectures were very engaging and discussion sections provided a medium to discuss the material at deeper depth.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Sometimes, it felt as though it might have been better served if the lectures were more geared to toward reanalyzing some of the more confusing parts of the lectures. ",
            "\u00a0The structure of the course is definitely a strong point.. The readings can be easily acquired. The course, though, is very specifically tailored to Professor Shapiro's particular views and analyses of the philosophers studied. This manifests itself in the form of Shapiro jargon like \"workmanship ideal\" and \"you can't wring the politics out of politics.\" ",
            "\u00a0I loved the lectures and thought that Ian did a great job of explaining the material and introducing the students to these authors and philosophers. However, I found the discussion sections to be less than productive. They took the form of an additional lecture rather than a discussion. ",
            "\u00a0interesting at times/usually, lectures were a little all over the place ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: A catchy title and a bold promise that tricked me and other friends into taking the class. If you're looking to pick up a WR credit without actually improving your writing, MoFoPo will allow you to accomplish that. Other than that, not much.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Where do I begin? I could start with the final exam, when the class was stuffed like pigs into our usual, cramped lecture hall for a 3.5-hour in-class essay exam that featured a hypothetical, frankly ridiculous essay question. Not enough exams were printed for the class, delaying the process and further ensuring that the open-note test wasn't an intellectual one but instead one that valued how fast you could write, how much you could write, and how much information you could take from your notes or an online study guide to the blue book. Or I could start with the fact that classmates and I still haven't been returned our second essay as students that opted into the WR-credit track. We wrote two 8 to 10-page essays and none of the comments I have received have been focused on improving my writing; instead, they're all concentrated on the philosophical theories students are expected to twist both ways to satisfy a thesis.\r\n\r\nReadings are dense and abstract, and Shapiro doesn't do a good job of illustrating how the material connects under the arc of the course or to current politics. Lectures often focus on the minute details of a theory without first giving students the broad overview necessary for engaging with the content. Throughout the semester, it felt like we grabbed at random ideas and theories without fully unifying them under concrete themes or progressions. MoFoPo is poorly organized and circuitous. My TA was replaced about 5 or 6 weeks into class, adding chaos to what was already a chaotic situation, and though my new TA was smart and helpful, I continually felt like I lacked a proper road map for the class that would have helped me contextualize the philosophical niblets that were hurled at me from all sides. \r\n\r\nThe class carries an inflated sense of self-importance and feels ridiculous sometimes (like the absurd hypothetical question and conditions during the final exam, which counted as 50% of the course for non-WR students and more than one of our 8 to 10-page essays as WR students), as if you can argue anything if using the right jargon and name-dropping enough key terms/key thinkers. Shapiro and course coordinators must abandon the notion that the class doesn't need to adapt to better serve its students or support its TAs. ",

            "\u00a0It had potential to be a great class, but in my opinion fell short. I thought the readings were too dense and long, professor Shapiros lectures were often boring, and section was not helpful.  I received only the grade for one paper, so I had no idea where I stood in the class even after finishing the course. The final exam I thought was a poor assessment of the knowledge learned in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Most aspects of the course are very strong: student engagement, teaching, intellectual challenge, and general class quality are superb. A more explicit description of the varied approaches the different thinkers read utilized would be instructive. It often seemed as though, despite some overlap, many thinkers, as they frequently pursued considerably differing teloi, seemed in some sense to be talking past one another. A deeper analysis of their backgrounds, aims, and points of commonality in this regard might help for overall situation of the different texts and their contained ideas. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths started and ended with Professor Shapiro: his lectures were outstanding and his mind is brilliant ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Shapiro is an engaging lecturer! Weaknesses: That textbook was not well organized (and unnecessary to ask everyone to purchase), sometimes readings were also a bit dry. ",
            "\u00a0The course does a good job of explaining more in depth with examples the philosophers' thoughts while in section. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were very well taught, and the sections supplemented our learning rather well. I believe the course could have been improved by a slightly greater emphasis on the reading materials in the context of the lecture. ",

            "\u00a0Professor Shapiro is a phenomenal lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0Its main strength is its main weakness. It covers a lot of material but doesn't go in depth always. Often, the readings will pile up. They are useful and help tie the course together. Attending lecture without reading makes it difficult to contextualize what is going on. Perhaps there could be a way to tie themes together throughout the course because at times the readings seem disconnected. ",
            "\u00a0The course lectures are tied very closely to the course readings. This was very helpful because it made sure that the readings complemented the lectures and vice versa so everything you did for the class was relevant and applicable. I felt like I was very engaged in the course and that my TF was very accessible and helpful in giving me feedback, however I do not know if this would have changed if I had not done Writing Intensive. Writing Intensive is the way to go. ",
            "\u00a0One weakness was there was a lot of text on each slide, particularly when quotes were used, which made it hard to write down all of the necessary information. One strength is that the professor, Ian Shapiro, knew what he was talking about and kept the class engaged. ",
            "\u00a0Shapiro is a great lecturer and my section classes were interesting. The writing prompts were very thought provoking. The weaknesses were that the lectures were sometimes hard to follow and not as in depth as necessary to create understanding. I did not feel as thought the section classes prepared us well for essays or exams, but they were enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course are the engagement with the political philosophies discussed and the level of detail arrived at. Instead of presenting a history of ideas, the professor and class actively evaluate the philosophies read about. Further, the philosophies presented were just the right level of complexity for an introductory course. The weaknesses of the course are the problems that could arise by missing one class, since the lecture notes were rather light and the material too difficult to comprehend individually. ",
            "\u00a0For anyone interested in filling in the gaps in their knowledge about political theory, this course covers a lot of ground. For people not familiar with political theory, this course demands a lot and requires a lot of reading, so it is important that people are aware of the challenges that this course presents. One of the weaknesses is the divide between individuals that are more comfortable with the material and those that are just starting out an interest in political theory. Gauging the levels of comprehension and prior knowledge of students in the course before the semester progresses might help those that feel that discussions might go over their head at times. ",
            "\u00a0Virtually every aspect of this class is top-notch. The lectures are interesting and well-prepared. The TFs are knowledgable and section conversations are intellectually demanding. One thing I would recommend is more structure for the weekly reading responses for non-writing students and more feedback. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Curriculum is very manageable and easy to digest; Shapiro's lectures make a lot of sense.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Unclear what the guidelines are by which our essays are evaluated. What is A-level work? ",
            "\u00a0I think Shapiro sometimes has trouble presenting the philosophical ideas, which are often not too complicated, in an understandable way. ",
            "\u00a0weakness is that is gives you only the white western cannon of thinkers-- but what else is new at yale? with that in mind, it does a good job of giving you an intro to important thinkers, the lectures are engaging, shapiro is interesting to listen to, and he does a good job of applying the philosophy to cases in the real world/analyzing the philosophy, which is super cool. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Shapiro is incredibly knowledgable on the subject, and he makes the thinkers easy to digest meanwhile being approachable, kind, and funny in lecture. My TF, Clara Picker, was also fantastic at leading discussion to develop our thinking.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the course reading wasn't very even, where some days would have just a few pages of reading while others may have 100+. Just be wary of that. ",
            "\u00a0I think it would help if Professor Shapiro went over the readings more in detail, then go on to the application side of the readings. Otherwise, this was a very well-taught course! ",
            "\u00a0The readings were interesting, but Shapiro often just read off of lecture slides. ",
            "\u00a0Ian Shapiro is a wonderful lecturer, and he mixes humor and academics in his slides in a very enjoyable way. This being said, it was difficult to study the slides in preparation for exams or essays because the slides themselves do not contain much information on the authors; I will not raise this comment to the level of a critique, for the best way to fresh up on an author's thoughts and theories is to read the author again, not copy information off of a power point. \r\nThe essay prompts, and the exams for this class, were outstandingly engaging and fun to write and take. The material that we read, additionally, gives a valuable overview of how different thinkers tackled the issue of morality in politics. \r\nThe greatest weakness of this course, I will have to say, and this may only pertain to my own personal experience, were the sections. I found that discussion in them was unproductive. I need to mention that this was not the fault of the TA, by any means: because many students simply do not have adequate time to read and think about an author's work, sections became, for me, a group of students who had not done the reading properly fumbling around in the dark in a glorified way. ",
            "\u00a0Ian Shapiro is extremely organized. He paces the course quite well and honestly it feels like he has this class is pretty much down to a T. The lectures were fun, challenging, and varied. My section with Sam was excellent and provided a great forum to debate the ideas we discussed in lecture. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures could be a lot more clear and understandable, but that doesn't mean they were impossible to understand. Shapiro didn't make clear enough slides. However, I really liked the sections and office hours, as they always helped clear up whatever misunderstandings formed from lecture. "

            "\u00a0No. This has been my least favorite class at Yale and since I gained the freedom to choose my classes in high school. \r\n\r\nI feel like I gained unconnected pieces of knowledge about certain thinkers and their ideas and don't feel like I am a better writer, thinker, or philosophy student. Throughout the semester I lacked the context and organization that would have helped me make the most of the material. Even as students reviewed for the final exam, instructors were hands-off in setting the agenda/structure, as many sections operated. TAs hosted a few final exam review sessions that required students in attendance to ask questions that would then spark review and be answered by other students in the crowd as part of a \"review discussion.\" The result? We touched on lot of material, moving through most thinkers in the course in a 90-minute session. But when you lack an authoritative force that helps to deliver the material in an organized, contextual way, all the key terms and ideas pool very unhelpfully. I left the review session reminded of a lot of snippets of ideas and theories but even more confused. Nothing seemed like it logically connected, and that fell on the instructors who are supposed to administer and control the flow of information in a class, especially when all of a course's readings are primary sources that don't thematically connect on the surface.

Moral Foundations of Politics has been one of my favorite courses at Yale: not only were the professor and TA incredibly knowledgeable, but the content itself was deeply interesting and has helped to shape my view of politics, structures of governmental power, and what it means to be an informed academic, thinker, and citizen.

I think grounding political and policy ideas in political philosophy is essential, though the last bit of the course perhaps debates that premise. All the same, students need to present arguments for policies beyond what is expedient or popular, and I think this class provides a good starting point for learning how to do so. I would encourage students not to dismiss thinkers immediately. Yes, it is hard to count utility in Benthams philosophy, but its still an incredibly monumental idea. ",

I would recommend this class if you are interested in politics, law, philosophy and state building. its overall pretty good, it definitely did not blow me away but i definitely had my fair share of fun and interesting debates after class with some peers! ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. This class is a great introduction to philosophy and political philosophy more specifically. I came in with next to no background, and left with a great understanding of thinkers like Rawls, Marx, Nozick, Mill, Bentham, and other impactful names. ",

Shapiro does an incredible job of picking out authors and texts to read, so that by the end of the class you really will have a decent overview of the moral foundations of politics. For me, the class was a ton of fun. \r\nI will warn the prospective student, however, not to take this class to lightly. Although you can get by in this class by not reading the texts super intensely, the student who really wishes to do well and gain a strong grasp on the thinkers in this class will need to recognize the hours that need to be put into readings. \r\nIn other words, if you want a fun class that's not too hard that will expose you to many different thinkers trying to answer problems of government interference, people's liberties, and more, you will have a good time taking this class. The beauty of this class is this: if you want to make this class more challenging, however, you can always do so by going even deeper into the arguments of all these authors. \r\nTake it, it will not disappoint you! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. For someone who has never taken any political philosophy courses before, at first this course may seem a bit difficult, but at the end of the semester you will realize that you have learned a lot. The intellectual challenge of this course is very valuable, and Ian Shapiro is an amazing professor for this course. ",

I was able to get through most of them and it felt like we hit most of the seminal works in the field without things feeling overwhelming. The exams were honestly pretty fun and gave me an opportunity to apply the ideas we discussed in lecture. ",
