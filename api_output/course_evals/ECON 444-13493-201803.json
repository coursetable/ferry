            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Pascutti is a lot of fun to have as lecturer.  He is incredibly passionate, and he makes the lectures very enjoyable.  If you are invested in the class, it is easy to develop a personal relationship with him, which is great.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the topics discussed in lecture are confusing and are not adequately explained.  Also, many of the readings that are required are never discussed in the lecture or are seemingly supplementary.  Also, there are no solutions posted for the quizzes, so you don't know what you did wrong. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Quite basic and a lot fun was brought by those interesting guest speakers.\r\nWeakness: Not case-oriented and the examples given by the professor were not always related to the content of the class.\r\nUmmm, I suggest that the professor choose a textbook for the students' reference. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Extremely informative, great selection of readings.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Largely unstructured lectures have value of their own due to the practical experience of the instructor in the field. However, some parts of the syllabus may not be covered in as much detail as one would like. ",
            "\u00a0The material could be confusing at times, and given that the reference for things was notes from class (ie no textbook, supplementary materials) that could be a little challenging. However, I thought it was a strong course overall. ",
            "\u00a0Quizzes are  agood way to test the material--much better than one midterm and one final. Problem sets are easy. Lectures are awesome. Readings, although they can be long and sometimes dry, are incredibly interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Knowledgeable instructor who offers a valuable perspective being a former investor with a wealth of experience and many engaging anecdotes. Only potential area for improvement concerns offering more consistent slide notes for each topic covered in classhowever, the in-class discussions sufficiently cover all necessary topics, and the notes arent entirely necessary. ",
            "\u00a0The instructor is a strength of the course. He brings a wealth of experience to the table and is extremely engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing professor, reasonable workload, and fair exams. ",
            "\u00a0The course (1) is very rich in content, (2) has a good balance of qualitative discussion and technical discussion (given that you attend the TA sessions where the technical materials are discussed in details), and (3) has a wonderful classroom dynamic as professor Pascutti is always highly exciting when he teaches. The course, however, does not have the clear structure of a textbook-based STEM class where every step of the learning process is laid out for you either by the progressive nature of the syllabus or the textbook. Therefore, it might be sometimes difficult to follow and do as well as you would like on quizzes/exams. Paying very close attention in class and attending each TA session are necessary for a newbie in practical finance (your summer internship in sales and trading won't help) to do well in this course. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this to another student who is passionate about the subject matter.  The class is a lot of fun to be a part of because of Professor Pascutti.  Additionally, you have to be willing to be attentive in lecture as you will often have to apply the discussions of lecture on the quizzes and build upon them in ways that prove your comprehension of the class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, covers academic as well as practical aspects of finance especially in the credit/arbitrage subjects. Good guest speakers. A good course to evaluate whether one is interested/would like to pursue a career in this kind of asset management. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0This is one of those classes in the Economics classes that attracts the type-A, finance bros like moths to a flame, which, depending on who you are, will make you feel right at home or sick to your stomach. Regardless of who you are, though, the material is quite interesting, and the math-related, formulaic parts of it are incredibly useful if you're thinking of entering finance. However, realize that Pascutti loves stories and will spend many lectures going over interesting trades that he'd encountered during his trading years (which, to be fair, are rather interesting), and realize that he will expect you to recall details of these trades in quizzes and tests, as well. So, in order to do well, attend class and take good notes. Overall, a decent class with a professor who really cares about the topic. The question you should ask yourself if whether or not you care about the topic as much as he does, or as much as the average kid in the class does. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend this course to anyone interested in derivatives, sales and trading, hedge funds, portfolio management, or the application of financial theory. I learned so much and Pascutti is an outstanding professor. He cares about students and cares about his material--what more could you ask for? ",
            "\u00a0Would certainly recommend! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anybody potentially interested in markets. You will learn a lot about a number of different markets (equity, credit, etc.). This will come from the papers you read and Prof. Pascutti's anecdotes. He's a great guy and his exams are very reasonable. Would highly recommend. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Good intro to hedge fund strategies and its fun to hear Pascutti tell stories ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the professor is amazing and super engaging in the classroom. It's exciting to come to class everyday and his real life experiences make for very interesting stories. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone interested in finance. ",
