            "\u00a0I expanded my repertoire and really worked on counting, rhythm, and taking steps to ensure music is learned correctly. I learned more about German pronunciation and how to interpret a song. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much in this course! I came in from a choir/a cappella background and had never sang art songs/operatic songs/classical music before. I learned so much about how to properly learn music, as well as about proper technique i.e. breathing and supporting sound. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my ability to perform classical art song repertoire. I also learned about composers who young singers do not encounter often. "

        [
            "\u00a0I loved having our small class and the ability to sing every week. I would have liked the class less if we hadn't gotten the opportunity to perform as often in class. The one-on-one meetings with Sara and Prof Lalli were super helpful and an amazing resource. Class was fun and relaxed, which was very enjoyable. The music was also stunning. I loved the composers we studied. It might be fun to do duets in the future. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nSuper engaging and fun.\r\nProfessor Lalli cares 1000% about his students and about the class.\r\nNot homework-intensive (though of course you still need to learn your music!).\r\nYou bond with the other students and get to see the entire class grow throughout the semester.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nSometimes a tiny bit disorganized /shrug ",
            "\u00a0I love this class so much! Professor Lalli and Sara Kohane are amazing, and it is just a great opportunity to practice singing really cool songs in front of your peers. This class gives students a lot of opportunities to perform and to improve, and in general it is just a really great learning experience. I can't think of a weakness! "

            "\u00a0Absolutely take it if you enjoy singing (especially classical singing) and want to explore new songs and get to work with very insightful professors. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to a student who enjoys SOLO singing and is interested in improving as a musician. Prof. Lalli and Sara (our amazing accompanist and vocal coach) are very supportive and knowledgeable and can give excellent feedback to people at all stages of singing experience.\r\nI stress that people should take this if they like solo singing because I have a friend who likes choral singing, but doesn't like solo singing, who took the course a few years ago and didn't enjoy it. Keep in mind that the course leads up to a final concert where you sing songs from the repertoire you learn in class, and that throughout the semester you will be repeatedly asked to sing your songs in class. While this can be fundamentally intimidating, this also drives people to improve as musicians and adds some pressure to make sure you're actually learning the music.\r\nIf you would feel extremely uncomfortable and would not at all enjoy what I described above, then the class may not be for you. However, if the aforementioned sounds fine, then I HIGHLY RECOMMEND taking this class before you graduate!!! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you are a singer you MUST take this class. There is no other class as valuable to young singers. You learn new repertoire, you get to work with an amazing vocal coach and an amazing voice professor, and you get a lot of practice performing. This class is amazing! "
