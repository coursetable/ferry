            "\u00a0I learned a huge amount about the history of Chinese literature and philosophy (with which I had no prior experience), and I also developed my essay writing skills, particularly with close textual analysis. ",
            "\u00a0I developed close reading and literary analysis skills. ",
            "\u00a0This class did a great job in crash-coursing literally 3000 years of the Chinese literary tradition, and I felt that doing so helped me better contextualize the vague idea of a lineage of impressions/ideas that I used to have in mind, marching through Chinese history. ",
            "\u00a0The Chinese Tradition gave me, as someone who had no previous experience reading Chinese philosophy, poetry, or literature, an introduction to these fields. It also developed my ability to apply hermeneutic methods learned elsewhere to unfamiliar texts, gleaning thereby an initial appreciation of them that I could hence after develop. "

            "\u00a0The course is a good summary of the Chinese tradition. I felt like some readings were glossed over, but it's hard to cover thousands of years of Chinese textual history in a semester. ",
            "\u00a0The leminar format was always positive but never particularly engaging; the approach of the class is particularly strong, featuring interesting and nuanced readings of the tradition. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the class, and most of its weaknesses couldn't be helped - obviously due to the vast scale of the course (almost all of Chinese history, philosophy and literature in one semester!) not everything could be covered in as much depth as I would have liked, but that wasn't Professor Lu's fault. I thought it was really well structured, and Professor Lu was an incredible lecturer. The essays were often challenging, but I felt like I got a lot out of them. My only complaint was that I felt that there was a lot right at the end, having us write an essay during reading period and then take a final exam at the end of the exam period - particularly for those students taking it for the WR whose essays had to be longer. I do wonder if it might be better to have a final essay due at the end of finals and more of a \"second midterm\" at the end of the semester, or make the WR students write even an even slightly longer final essay but not have to take the final exam. Either way, though, it was still a great class, and I'm really glad that I took it! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: a super helpful survey course that helps you dip your toes into the subject. Weaknesses: because we're speeding through the semester, there is very little time or opportunity to venture deeper into the thorny issues of the texts we were often dscussing ",
            "\u00a0The Chinese Tradition benefits from the diversity of texts that it discusses and the diversity of voices that it presents. Professor Lu emphasized that Chinese culture is not a monolithic entity, but is rather a polyphonous, ever-shifting field, receiving influence from foreign countries and peoples all the time. The only improvements that I would suggest would be to consider reducing the number of papers to two from three. Three papers, a midterm, and a final were a lot, and even though for the non-WR sections the requirements listed these papers as being only 3-4 pages, I found it difficult to condense a coherent and compelling argument into that length. On the thematic level, I would have liked to see one or two short pieces that examined China from the vantage point of a Chinese living in exile or from some other exterior perspective. Lu Xun's \"An Outsider's Chats about Language\" fulfilled this gap to an extent, but I think it would be interesting to develop it a little further. "

            "\u00a0Take this course if you want an overview of the Chinese tradition! It's well-taught and extremely interesting. The professor and TA also really want to help you succeed! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course would be a great gateway for whoever wants to further the study in Chinese classical culture and literature. ",
            "\u00a0I probably would not recommend this course. The lectures were not especially engaging, the readings were all very stilted and dry translations of Chinese texts; and the grading felt unnecessarily strict for what ought to be a relatively subjective area of discussion given the esoteric nature of the texts. Its like either you agree with Professor Lu and regurgitate exactly what she says (or manage to guess correctly the interpretation youre supposed to come up with, since she seemed averse to actually explaining her overall approach directly at any given point); or you do poorly. The guest lectures, by Professor Bender in particular, were probably the highlight of the course. Id recommend looking into courses by those/other profs if you want to study something in this area. ",
            "\u00a0This class not only teaches the Chinese tradition, but also showcases the unique historical construction of pre-modern Chinese culture and how the Six Classics were its paradigm to the end. Recommended to all, especially to students of the humanities. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to almost anyone as long as they are willing to put a good amount of work into it - the reading isn't overwhelming, but it is quite constant, and it does have three essays and two exams. You will learn a huge amount about Chinese history, literature, and philosophy, though, and I personally feel that this is a great class for anyone to take, regardless of major (I am a STEM major, and this class has no relevance to anything I study). You will both learn a huge amount and develop your critical thinking / essay-writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course as an excellent crash-course on the Chinese literary tradition, or honestly a useful counterpoint to the Western-centric DS reading list. The readings are all in translation and, while eclectic, very accessible in the course of the class. Be ready to read a lot.\r\nBai Yun was an incredibly smart, down-to-earth, and kind TA! She did her very best to get the section to actively discuss the readings and themes, and always offered very candid views on them. ",
            "\u00a0The Chinese Tradition is a great course; very interesting, well-paced, and well taught. Tina Lu is a wonderful lecturer, and amount of work is enough that you can really engage with the material without the workload being overwhelming. ",
            "\u00a0I would strongly recommend this course to students who have a desire to appreciate the breadth of the Chinese tradition and who have no prior experience with it. The course is definitely for beginners, and most of the interpretative work that we did centered around placing the texts in the scope of the larger canon and its major themes (Kongzi, the idea of a shi, etc.). Therefore, I suggest a different course for those who have prior experience with Chinese history and literature. For those who do not, however, this course is excellent and, in my opinion, essential to a well-balanced understanding of the world. "
