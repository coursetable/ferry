            "\u00a0This course really delved deep into the system of European politics and the institutions within the European Union that uphold the EU's entire founding mission. As someone who is incredibly interested in the EU and its current politics, this course challenged me to dig deeper into the underlying institutions and policy decisions that are reflected in the challenges or achievements surrounding the EU today. From the democratic deficit to the situation in Ukraine to the EMU, this course truly runs the gamut of the institutional history and policies that have directed the course of the EU for the past few decades. ",
            "\u00a0We learned a lot about recent European history, politics, and contemporary challenges facing the EU. Reading list is great, as are discussions- really recommend. ",
            "\u00a0This class gave a great basis of knowledge about the various institutions, roles and powers of the EU, discussed the criticisms the EU institutions have faced, and then delved into specific challenges such as the Euro Crisis, the refugee crisis and the rise of populist parties. it helped me understand the bigger picture and explained how the history and development of the EU affect current issued it faces.

            "\u00a0The reading list was superb, and Professor Cameron is a particularly knowledgable and qualified person to host/moderate class discussions. Some more direct analysis of the readings could be helpful, although, given that EU politics and affairs so rapidly develop, it is hard to not discuss them in class. Maybe turn this into a twice a week 1:15 hr. seminar? Again, a really big and complex topic, would have loved to have more time to analyze it. ",
            "\u00a0Solid course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the lecture style, with constant topic assistance from Professor Cameron. I feel the base-line required engagement for this course can be low. If you are interested in the material you will read it and have something to say in seminar about it, but this led to the same 5-7 people talking every day in seminar despite a class of about 20. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I thought this course was very strong. Obviously, Professor Cameron is incredibly knowledgeable about the material, making for a productive and fruitful seminar. The readings were a great mix of both secondary and primary materials, and provided a solid foundation and background for the week's topic--which was further challenged and explored in class. I also thought the format of the course, submitting brief reading responses each week, was productive for discussion. Not only did it challenge me to dig deeper into the readings and find potential gaps, but they were also well-incorporated into the class itself. Professor Cameron had a great knack at seamlessly integrating the opinions we voiced in our responses, having us share and discuss each other's perspectives. Really, this was just a fantastic course!

            "\u00a0Certainly; great professor, great discussion, great topic. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's a good overview of the institutions and politics of the European Union with some interesting case studies in right-wing nationalism and Brexit. ",
            "\u00a0Yah, good perspectives on Europe. Some classes do get a little dry if the discussion isn't going any where. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are an EU citizen trying to learn about the system you are part of, or you're a polisci type who wants to discuss Brexit and International Unions, David Cameron's the best person to talk to! ",
            "\u00a0If you don't write anything interesting the reading response, you won't get called on. Also, Professor Cameron is a nice guy. Not how any of your other seminars work but it is probably great if you know a lot about the EU or nothing at all. Worth taking. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is the slightest bit interested in European politics or the European Union. There was a wide diversity of students in my class who had all joined this class for different reasons and with different academic interests, but I am confident that we all came out learning something that we had previously not known or even considered to think about. This course challenged my preconceptions about the EU, extended them, and encouraged me to think further about the institutions that uphold the more salient policy issues of the day. Professor Cameron is a great instructor and is incredibly knowledgeable about all topics at hand. With his great moderating skills and thought-provoking questions, I found discussions to be very interesting and informative. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course because the readings are interesting and Professor Cameron is incredibly knowledgeable about all aspects of the EU. For anyone interested in this subject the class provides a great overview and also delves into a variety of interesting political and economic challenges the EU has faced. "
