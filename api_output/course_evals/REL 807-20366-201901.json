            "\u00a0Very friendly, supportive. He made us all feel welcome, and when there was tension he did a great job of defusing it. He sometimes let the conversations go on too long though, so we had little time to practice the actual scenarios. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated her guidance and feedback during and after our role plays, and the examples from her own ministry.\r\nWe never did more than one role play in a week so I guess one might say time management was a weakness? Except I don't think so, because spending more time on only one role play, even if unintentionally, let us go deeper and I appreciated that. ",
            "\u00a0Great instructor, made us feel comfortable in the role plays, he has a lot of practical wisdom to share. ",
            "\u00a0Julie is great. There were a couple of times I think she was obliquely insensitive to more conservative viewpoints, but in general I thought she did a great job fostering a positive environment and was a great instructor. ",
            "\u00a0Willis was willing and open to discuss whatever questions or subjects we needed to process during small groups which I sincerely appreciated and felt we all got a lot out of. He took his job and the case studies seriously but also could sensitively laugh with us when the time was right. He opened up the space and made me feel comfortable participating, making mistakes and saying \"I don't know.\" ",
            "\u00a0She gave excellent feedback that was both helpful and encouraging. She made the class an enjoyable learning experience. \r\n\r\nHowever, she did majorly struggle to get the trans student's pronouns and name correct. She made mistakes on their pronouns in nearly every single section. I think this threatened the safety of the group at certain points. ",
            "\u00a0Great practicum leader! Extremely sensitive to the vocational and personal needs students. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - she can really guide students into feeling comfortable and through what it is that they are dealing with. So many strengths how do I name them all - this small group was a delight. ",
            "\u00a0Julie is so, so sweet and kind. My favorite part of Pastoral Care was getting to hang out and learn from Julie every Thursday with my small group. I appreciated her nurturing and yet instructional teaching method. She let me know when I made mistakes, but she said it in a way that didn't embarrass me or discourage me to keep my role play alive. She is very encouraging. The one complaint I have with Julie is that she would often let our role plays go too long (we would walk back into Professor Moschella's class late) and would have a tendency to blame us students for tardiness rather than take responsibility of her job as timekeeper. Other than that, Julie is a doll and I am so thankful I had the opportunity to learn from her this semester. ",
            "\u00a0Joan was a great small group leader: kind, attentive, and incisive in her feedback. She was supportive, but also effectively critical. I'm very glad I got Joan in my group. "
