            "\u00a0An intense introduction to the Italian language, with emphasis on speaking, listening, reading, and writing. An absolutely fascinating class with a wonderful instructor. ",
            "\u00a0Basic Italian. ",
            "\u00a0I feel like I am able to hold a basic conversation with someone in Italian now. If the person is more patient, I may also be able to hold a slightly more detailed and advanced conversation. ",
            "\u00a0Basic knowledge of Italian grammar and vocabulary. ",
            "\u00a0I became more comfortable speaking my newly-learned Italian to other students in class and noticed my improving skills as the semester went along. ",
            "\u00a0I was able to develop the ability to read write and speak in basic Italian. I also was able to learn about the culture and history of Italy. ",
            "\u00a0I felt my language skills improved immensely. I went into this class not thinking that I would enjoy it. But now I'm looking into a study abroad opportunity this summer as I continue my studies. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to better speak italian by learning vocabulary and grammar and utilizing such skills through speaking. "

            "\u00a0This was the best class I took this semester. The material is extremely engaging, and assignments are all designed to help one grow as an Italian speaker. However, the pacing of the material could be better regulated. The beginning of the semester felt like a race, with us covering roughly a chapter per week. However, the end of the semester slowed drastically, covering only one chapter roughly every two weeks. I would have liked to have a more even distribution of workload. ",
            "\u00a0I think this class format is very good. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength and weakness of this course is the same thingthe fact that it was all in Italian. Once I got the hang of understanding what was being said it got better, but near the beginning I often spent more time just trying to decipher what we were saying than actually learning the material. This also was very difficult for students having a tough time in the class, as it meant they fell further and further behind. At the same time, talking only in Italian provided us with great exposure to the language, and definitely helped us learn it a lot faster, no question about it. I wouldn't suggest changing this, but maybe just be more cognizant of how it can affect the students in class. ",
            "\u00a0The course material was very appropriate for starting and learning a new language. Although the course moved along fairly quickly, having class everyday helped to continue progressing our new vocabulary and skills with the language. ",
            "\u00a0This course did a great job of keeping the class engaged while learning new chapter materials. I feel like a focus on Vocab more early on would help for students to be able to learn more quickly. ",
            "\u00a0It is very strong on the writing and reading side. I did not feel there was as much oral and listening practice as I would have liked. I felt like I would benefit from more listening activities. ",
            "\u00a0The teaching was thorough and the professor was kind and informative. If we did more speaking exercises the course wouldve been even better. "

            "\u00a0This class is amazing. I didn't realize how much I could fall in love with Italian language and culture before I actually started learning it! You will work hard and it will feel like you're doing busy work at times, but this class is very low stress and offers an excellent opportunity to learn about a new culture. Furthermore, Simona Lorenzini is an absolutely wonderful professor. Take it with her! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Italian is a very interesting language, and the culture is very cool as well. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! Learning a language is one of the most rewarding things you can do, and even though it was more work than I thought it would be it was such a nice break from all the other stresses of a busy schedule. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend Italian to another student at Yale because I felt more engaged with this language and this department than any of the other languages. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Take Italian. The Italian department is great. ",
            "\u00a0I would most definitely recommend this course to another student! If you want to start a new language, Italian is a great choice! ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in Italian culture and like learning Romance languages I would definitely recommend this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I think this most definitely is a great course that I would recommend to other students. I enjoyed myself in this class. ",
