            "\u00a0Sight-singing, history of Renaissance music, knowledge of Renaissance temperaments/compositional techniques/instruments ",
            "\u00a0I gained skills in playing baroque guitar and singing, and a lot of knowledge and insights about Renaissance music! ",
            "\u00a0Grant expects students to do quite a bit of sight singing. This course was worth it (for me) for the sight singing practice alone. I also got the opportunity to be immersed in ~15th-17th century music, and as someone who only sings modern music informally, it was a cool stretch. ",
            "\u00a0Learning about techniques of early western music. Musical enrichment. Early instruments. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to play the viola de gamba! And I get course credit for it! And I learned about hemiolas and temperaments! ",

            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the history of music, in the sense of what kinds of music were played in what kinds of events. I also believe I got a bit better at sight reading, and at working in long-lost tempos. ",
            "\u00a0I had never played this kind of music before, so I learned a whole lot about notation, musica ficta, performance methods, etc. Learning about the cultural context was also interesting (to be frank, I wish we'd spent more of the class about the cultural side of things.) ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to perform early music and play the harpsichord ",
            "\u00a0Very good class! It's fun and rewarding to sing with the whole class at the performances. Beautiful music as well! ",
            "\u00a0A larger grasp of early music - music during the renaissance - and understanding of history and music in general. ",
            "\u00a0We learned about different ways music was presented and written on the page in earlier music books from the Renaissance period.  We also learned about different tuning methods for the instruments that were used, intervals, and the concepts of consonance and dissonance.  Several other concepts came up as we learned music that we were then taught the basics of and how to apply them.  We performed several times throughout the semester. "

            "\u00a0The course is extremely fun and chill! I love the once-a-week rehearsals and the amount of excitement Professor Herreid brings to the classroom. Concerts were really fun to play in and it was super cool to get to hear professional early musicians as well. (Although sometimes concert prep felt a bit rushed to be honest.) I felt like he could have given us a better and more organized background on the history of early renaissance music, rather than the sporadic short lectures he gave, but I still learned a lot about music theory and early music nonetheless. ",
            "\u00a0The only weakness this semester was the imbalance of vocal parts. We need more Sopranos and Altos to try out! ",
            "\u00a0There are no weaknesses. Well maybe we should play in a space biggger than beinecke to fit the large crowd. And the strengths are the Professor/TA!  They are very inspirational with their talents and make you want to practice and play and learn! And its only once a week so you decide the commitment you want to give each week to practicing or not. But I recommend if you take this course you should put your effort into it to make the ensemble sound the best it can ",
            "\u00a0Concerts were fun but the final was shocking\r\n\r\nThe class had mostly consisted of learning songs, Grant talking a little bit about the history of each song, and then singing/playing them for the Beinecke concerts (twice).\r\n\r\nOur midterm was just like singing the song for Grant by ourself to make sure we've learned it\r\n\r\nHe had set the precedent of a low workload, then sent out a literal 7-page study guide full of music theory stuff for the final and we were all like umm excuse me what's happening.\r\n\r\nWe had covered a little of what was on the final but some of it had not been covered and we were all shook. ",
            "\u00a0This class is so well designed Grant does an amazing job of incorporating the ridiculous amount of knowledge he has into the class whether it be history, music theory, or even knowledge of different interests. The songs are fun, and the performance in the Beinecke is always a highlight. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very interesting and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a lot of fun, and the fact that we actually put on concerts made it all the more exciting. ",
            "\u00a0The course's strength are its immersion. Constant playing, practicing, and learning new music helps a lot to become acquainted with the musical styles and performance practices. ",
            "\u00a0We can have shorter meetings but on different days ",
            "\u00a0Beautiful Music! ",
            "\u00a0Being taught by Grant is so much fun and a little bit wild; you never really know what is going to happen.  The upside of this is that it keeps the class a very relaxed atmosphere.  The downside is that sometimes class is a little disorganized and inefficient, but somehow, things still end up sounding good, and we get a lot of praise from our audiences.  Grant chooses really good music for us to perform; most of the pieces I honestly really enjoyed singing.  At the end of the course, I think a bunch of us did feel a little taken aback by the things we were expected to know for the final, because most of our time in class is spent on rehearsing and it does not seem like we learn as much about early music as Grant expect.  I am sure that the music majors among us will have had a pretty substantial advantage on that evaluation. "

            "\u00a0yes definitely ",
            "\u00a0If you enjoy singing and making music in an ensemble, I highly recommend this class as an enjoyable, once-a-week stress relief from the rest of your classes (but it also gives you credits!). Grant is a charismatic, entertaining, knowledgable professor and conductor, and I found the rehearsals to be a fun break from my typical workload. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - if you enjoy singing and you're interested in gaining exposure to early music that you would otherwise have no outlet to engage with, definitely take this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, very much so! I would recommend it mainly to people who have a fair amount of experience with music because the amount of personal attention is small unless you specifically request it for some reason, and the rehearsal time is pretty short for the amount of music performed at each concert. But yes, it is a very relaxed and fun class that will brighten your Mondays and balance out any super hard classes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Great 5th/6th credit. The ideal gut in that it's low workload outside of class, but is also a fun opportunity to sing in a SATB+instrument ensemble. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutey. Its a fun class where you get to hear and perform music that you will get to interact with in no other place. Its cool to sing music thats 500 years old and learn the stories asaociated. Its not hard, but its interesting. ",
            "\u00a0. I would 110% recommend this to another student. You would not get this opportunity anywhere. This is literally my favorite thing at yale. I wouldnt even call it the workload less because its not even work because its so enjoyable. It is so cool. Youre playing reinassaince music that reinassaince people played. On a viol! Learn the viol! Or the lute. Or baroque guitar or recorder or whatever. Or sing but plz be a good singer. I didnt even play cello or guitar before I started but ya a string instrument. You are never going to have this opportunity again. Do it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This felt like a great class to tap into the liberal arts education aspect of Yale being a non-music major. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah it's a nice break in your routine to come in once a week and sing/play ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely this course is such an educational experience:getting to engage with music and history in such a fun way. The music is always so fun to learn, the class truly becomes relaxing rather than stressful, and it's an experience that you can hardly find anywhere else. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would. It was very interesting, and was not a huge time commitment. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you like music or singing, this is a nice low-key way to learn about music and get rid of some performance withdrawal, without taking up too much time. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Grant is an absolute legend and a wonderful human being. Take ANY AND EVERY CLASS YOU CAN with him. ",
            "\u00a0It is a really fun class if you're at all musically inclined. I had essentially zero formal music education, but I play a few instruments so it was totally do-able. It probably would have been more fun if I were better at playing music, but it was fun anyway. If you're looking for a super chill credit and enjoy music even in the slightest, this class is a blast. ",
            "\u00a0yes, particularly if the person is interested in early performance of music ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you like to make music it's wonderful. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend if you can sing/ sight read ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class.  It's a really fun, low-stress credit, and the performances are actually really rewarding because a lot of people end up coming to watch them and Grant always relays the audiences praise to us and tells us what a good job we did.  The pieces he picks are really fun, and he goes on really entertaining tangents, so class is usually not boring. "
