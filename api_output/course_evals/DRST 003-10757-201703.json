            "\u00a0I learnt how to evaluate philosophical arguments effectively and to write philosophical essays.\r\nI learnt to challenge the ideas of other people through in-class discussion, and to look at philosophical ideas in a way that was relevant to my own life, instead of solely as abstract concepts. ",
            "\u00a0This course was an excellent introduction to general Western philosophy, as well as to philosophical writing. ",
            "\u00a0I had never taken a phil course before, and so this provided an excellent grounding for exploring the ancient ideas in a clear and relatable way. ",
            "\u00a0This class taught me so much more than I can ever put into words. I learned to truly think long and hard before I spoke, I learned how to revel in my coursework and understand the hearts behind these philosophers, and I learned that while some of our texts are over a thousand years old, the message of philosophy is something undying, something that will last forever. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read a text quickly and still get the relevant information, how to write a philosophy paper, and how to engage in a philosophic discussion without it turning toward God (and if it did turn that way, we learned how to discuss God as a theory, as well as be respectful to those who saw Him as more or less than this) ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to engage critically with a philosophical text -- how to let it sit with me and how to productively disagree with it if necessary. I also learned how to write a really good philosophical essay. Professor Hare gives great and honest feedback on papers. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a general understanding of the trajectory of Western philosophical thought from ancient Greece until the early Renaissance, as well as increased familiarity with the genre of philosophical writing (both by reading other thinkers' works and by composing philosophical arguments myself based on these texts). My ability to articulate abstract thoughts both in writing and in verbal conversation with peers has expanded greatly, and I feel much more comfortable analyzing and critiquing such ideas that have been expressed by others. Most importantly, my own opinions regarding happiness, the value of knowledge/education, and what is truly good have begun to crystallize into a much more coherent worldview than I held prior to this class. ",
            "\u00a0This has been best class I have taken at Yale. I have learned so much about Philosohy. Not only have I learned the major ideologies and belief systems that have fundamentally shaped the western world, but I have also learned how to think. The strong grounding in coherent, logical arguments and evaluating them on soundness and validity has changed the way I think about different philosohers accounts.  On top of that, the mind-blowing concepts and questions posed by each of the philosophers is nothing short of consistently fascinating. Moreover, my philosophy writing skills, another practice in logical though, were birthed within the context of his class. I really feel like I can enout of the class with a newfound understanding of some of the most important beliefs that have defined our systems and ways to analyze, criticize, and build upon these beliefs. ",
            "\u00a0This class challenged me in more ways than I initially expected. I learned how to write an effective philosophy paper which outlines specific argumentation of a philosopher using justifications for each premise (like a Euclidean proof). Additionally, this class forced me to challenge my own beliefs and thoughts. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much- how to read carefully and understand the intricacies of a philosophers argument, how to think critically and articulate responses, how to live in a thoughtful and educated manner. I learned philosophy and I learned life. "

            "\u00a0At the end of the day, whether or not you will enjoy this course is subjective because it all depends on what you like. There's an extremely high workload, you will need to do 2 reading responses a week, plus an essay every 3 weeks. You will not be babysat through the essay writing process, and you are largely left to figure out how to write an essay by yourself (which is no bad thing). I personally disliked Plato and Aristotle (2/3rds of the course) but many of my friends loved them. This is a difficult course, but one I found rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0This course is how philosophy should be taught, with small class sizes and amazing professors, it makes things much clearer than they might otherwise be. The responses required by John Hare before each class made sure that everyone had at least a little understanding of the text and led to better discussions.\r\nThe seminar-style was great, with just enough guidance from John Hare to keep it flowing, but primarily discussion was among students. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: a wide variety of texts that are well-chosen, not too long of readings that were too much to handle, a great correlation between this class and the others in DS\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: if you had a bad teacher, it was a hard class to struggle through. This required a professor who had not only a strong grasp of the material but also a gift of being able to relay it to students. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths\r\nThe discussions were great, very engaging. \r\nProfessor Hare led the discussions in a way that every one got the chance to talk. He would let us finish our thought before affirming or refuting it, and whenever he did this, he always had reason or some theory to back it up. I felt like the class was made great, despite our obvious lack of philosophic knowledge, by Hare's clear abundance of it. \r\nI also felt like the exam was very fair, and I felt adequately prepared for it due to our class discussions. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\nThe only thing I did not like about the class was that some people talked A LOT more than others, and I felt like that almost forced them to be the center of every discussion, pushing anyone else out. I also would have preferred more time to discuss the works (though DS does prohibit that). ",
            "\u00a0Nothing, this class is incredible. If you can get John Hare, do! He is the best teacher I've ever had. ",
            "\u00a0This course's strengths lie in its seminar discussions, which allow students to voice their own opinions and listen to others' takes on the assigned readings. Philosophy, and the humanities in general, are concerned primarily with making sense of the human experience, which can only be done in conversation with other human beings - this is not a disciple which can be studied in isolation.\r\nI often felt that DS Philosophy lectures tended to summarize or rephrase the assigned readings rather than offer the speaker's own commentary on the text, and I wish this balance were skewed in the opposite direction. Though a professional recap of the readings was usually very helpful in comprehending the text, this often occurred both in lecture and seminar, leaving less time for professors to offer their own opinions on the readings. ",
            "\u00a0It is a very fast-paced course with a large reading and writing load. Seminar discussion periods are consistently fantastic and a great way to understand the texts read for how works. The lectures were all very informative and also seriously aided in the understanding of the works. I dont see any way that the course could be improved. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were that it improved my argumentation and critical analysis of argumentation of both philosophic and non-philosophic writings alike. It also forces the student to engage in class discussion by listening and responding to the conversation. The main downside is the pace of the course and the syllabus. In one particular week we attempted to cover four philosophers. This resulted in a somewhat shallow understanding of some thinkers. ",
            "\u00a0The course was fantastic all around, I feel like I gained a solid overview of ancient philosophy. I don't know enough about other philosophers to say wether or not the readings should be changed. "

            "\u00a0I really disliked philosophy initially as we dealt primarily with Aristotle and Plato. I suffered through half of the semester, wishing that I had dropped the course because I found it very difficult to decipher what concepts were being explored by these two philosophers (due to their obtuse and nebulous language). However, as the semester wore on, I began to enjoy philosophy more and more as I encountered other philosophers and philosophies, and I think you definitely get better as a writer of philosophy papers through practice. By the end of the semester it was my favourite course, but I do think that this was largely due to my instructor John Hare as opposed to the course material per se. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - it's a lot of work (reading) but it is so worth it. ",
            "\u00a0Very much so, I would recommend directed studies as a programme, but John Hare's philosophy class was a highlight. He is both incredibly knowledgeable and approachable, is really interested in teaching you as well as just being a good guy. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I will remember this class till the day I die, partly because my classmates were fabulous human beings, partly because the texts were so insightful and actually applicable to my life, but mostly because my teacher, John Hare, was able to bring truth out of his students and show how the issues we are dealing with now can actually be solved by looking back at age-old thinkers. Amazing. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. Though this course greatly challenged the way I read, the way I thought, the way I learned in a class, I feel like I'm a stronger thinker because of it. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely would recommend, even if a student is not interested in philosophy. Professor Hare is so dedicated and compelling. Watching him teach is an incredible experience. He can explain anything concept while also evaluating its strengths and weaknesses. He is a brilliant professor and makes everything interesting and exciting. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, without question. This has been the academic highlight of my semester - this class embodies the purpose of liberal arts education in that it teaches students to think in extreme detail as well as very broadly about the most relevant questions of our time (and of any time in history). I sincerely believe that if this class were mandatory for every young person in the world, a great many of humanity's problems would sort themselves out. ",
            "\u00a0I would DEFINTELY recommend this course to a fellow student. It changed be way I think about he works and about argumentative structures. It made me a much more clear and lucid writer as well as a more structured thinker. The questions and ideas that you will go over in each class are nothi short of mind-blowing and will leave you with many things to contemplate and to attempt to fathom. The best thing I can say about this course is that it leaves you with a newfound curiosity for big-world, life-changing questions you may have never even thought of before. The professors are all brilliant; the lectures are exceedingly helpful; and the comradely you will gain with your peers by discussing these works and some of lifes most important questions is unmatched. The reading is steep, but doable, and by doing it you will really help yourself in the long run. That said, if  you are a bit behind one week, dont sweat it. That happens to everybody. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, yes, and yes! Take with Professor John Hare, if possible! This class, while perhaps the most difficult of the Directed Studies sections, challenges students in every way imaginable. It will change the way you write, speak, and think. You will walk out of class every time with your mind blown and your thinking changed. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. It was amazing life training and philosophy education. "
