When I cared about the topic going into class (I'm thinking specifically of abortion), the environment was electric--Prof. Latham often told each unit as a story, and he was always well-prepared and had his talking points down.\r\nWeaknesses: In my opinion, the exams are not super fair. (This is coming from someone who admittedly didn't put a lot of effort into this class.) The questions were always somewhat open-ended and oftentimes left room for one's own ethics. I understand that there are certain themes and facts and cases from the course that the questions were meant to touch on, but I felt like one could give a complete, well-justified answer that left out one of the buzzwords, and in that case, the TFs' rubric would mark the response down. Also on that note, the TFs are wildly different both in terms of the way section is run and in terms of grading. I'm not sure how to standardize a class this size, but this much variation could likely be mitigated. ",

My TA (Samantha Godwin) was frequently late, was VERY late with grading, didn't respond to emails, posing confusing questions in section not really relevant to what we would be tested on, etc. I think the sections should be given more clear topics as to what MUST be discussed so it serves as a review time as well.

The entire grade is in-class essays, but the range of grades (mostly B to A-) is based more on your ability to write in an organized way under pressure than your knowledge of the course material. It felt like it made no difference whether someone put effort into learning the course material, as that is not what the exams are testing in practice.

I think they try to normalize grades across TAs, but some sections are full of try-hard pre-meds and some are full of athletes. So if they normalize then someone who's at the top of one section could be at the bottom of another. Therefore, don't take this class if you're depending on getting an A. The grades seem to be somewhat randomly distributed around B+, with only a moderate correlation to how much knowledge you had about the material. It depends way too much on your TA and how much they like your writing style.\r\n\r\nThe best way to test this material would be multiple choice. Then you can see what we know and have an objective (and much faster) way to grade the course. It is very possible to write multiple choice questions that are nontrivial and that test a good spectrum of the students' knowledge. I think this class would be perfect for multiple choice. ",

Sometimes it would be difficult to catch the names of the cases or what he said due to the large lecture hall. Additionally, better TA grading standardization would be much appreciated. I know different TAs had different grading rubrics, and it was a bit varied throughout the sections. ",
            "\u00a0The class size is too big. The overall experience is highly dependent on the TA.\r\nIt would be best if there are specific case studies for DS, because most of the DS is spent on summarising the lecture contents.\r\nSome of the topics are highly US-oriented e.g. surrogacy, Obamacare. It would be best if additional resources could be provided to international students.\r\nThere are a lot of course readings ",
            "\u00a0If you're thinking about taking this course just know that Professor Latham found out that some students took his course as a gut and this past semester has made the grading much more difficult to prevent kids from thinking it's an easy course in the future. ",
            "\u00a0Stephen Latham is a great lecturer, its a 400 person class so its not engaging, but his lectures are interesting \r\nDiscussion sections are so boring, I would rather watch paint dry ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - you don't really have to do the readings for the class, so it is not too much work. Latham is a great lecturer so the lectures go by pretty quickly. Some of the topics (for me, assisted reproduction) can be interesting and even freaky. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - I really didn't like the grading in the class. There's a rubric for each midterm, which are short essays for different questions. However, the rubric is set up in a way that has a pretty rigid expectation of what the right answer should be, which I felt was unfair since the questions asked in the midterms felt much more open-ended than the rubric allowed. In some respects, I felt like this humanities-esque class was being graded like a STEM class, where questions with multiple right answers were treated like there was only one correct answer. What this grading structure incentivizes is basically throwing everything you know about a topic on the wall and hoping that something sticks (so to speak), instead of actually answering the question. I also think the curve applied to the grading overly penalized wrong answers. For example, in the second midterm, I didn't mention one part of the case law, which to me meant that I missed an eighth of a question, but my grade dropped all the way to a B+ for that one \"wrong answer\" (even though not much explanation was given for why not mentioning this one part of the case law was such a large mistake that it justified a B+.)\r\n\r\nAlso, I took this class because I had heard a lot of hype around some of the futuristic topics covered in the class. There are about two weeks where we learn about some truly wild things regarding assisted reproduction, but to be quite honest, most of the topics felt much more mundane. i.e. One class was on the ethical issues surrounding vaccines, a debate that I feel most people know a lot about. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Lectures were very engaging and discussion section helped hone in on the more confusing parts and clear them up.\r\n\r\nWeakness: It might have been helpful to dive into more of the ethical considerations for each issue instead of focusing mainly on the law surrounding each issue. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were very engaging, and the topics covered provided both breadth and depth across several different areas of bioethics. Professor Latham was great about emphasizing how different topics fit together or built on one another, which both helped contextualize each new topic within the broader questions of bioethics and also helped prepare us for the final exam along the way. I appreciated that the expectations of us were made very clear - there was little ambiguity about what material we really needed to know. The course is also extremely accessible to students of different areas of academic interest. One area of improvement might be that currently, comparative policy between other nations of the world is given only glancing reference at certain points of the course. Incorporating more awareness of how these issues look different around the world could be really interesting. Also, it wasn't until the end of the course when we had a lecture on global health that it was ever really mentioned that \"bioethics\" as a whole is an issue arising from great privilege. I think global health warranted more than one lecture. Alternatively, or additionally, we could have had more of a zoomed-out awareness from time to time throughout the course of how the very existence of these debates fits into the global positionality of the US.

But literally the only con of this course. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest weakness of this course is the way it assesses student knowledge.  Based on the two midterms it seems that the course aggressively curves towards a B+, making it hard to do badly or very well.  Both midterms and finals required writing full essays, each in 25 minutes, and in order to get an A they had to essentially be perfect essays--organization and clarity of argument, as well as hitting on the course information on the rubric (that may have not been explicitly asked for) were both part of the grade.  No matter how well I knew the material and how good of a writer I am in normal circumstances, I simply could not write the quality of essay expected of me to get an A by hand in 25 minutes.  A take home test or short paper would have been a much better way to assess student knowledge. ",

I also think that Professor Latham should stop worrying about this class being a gut and just give people the grades they deserve instead of making the grading schemes more difficult for the sake of it. The class is not a gut, it is relatively easy but people take it not because of that but because it is interesting and applicable to many different majors. ",

Although the course material itself is incredible, the structure of the discussion sections varied by TA. Some Was taught completely different things than other TAs and some of the TAs were weak, which made it hard for students to get clear answers to the questions they had. Also, if you didn't understand the material in the textbook, there are limited resources available since the course is almost 100% reliant on the book and lectures. Finally, the way that the exams are structured does not necessarily test how engaged a student has been with the course material but rather rewards those who are good writers and good at spewing BS on a paper in a limited amount of time.

We had some very interesting theoretical discussions that I enjoyed, however, overall, I think section could have been organized better. For example, I think we should have had assigned readings specifically for section so that everyone actually did the readings for class, and I also think that our grade should have been partially based on section participation, because that would have encouraged everyone to take part in discussion. Also, in general, I think the assigned textbook readings for lecture were way too long; they often covered hundreds of pages for one week, so I often had to simply skim through and was never able to finish all of the assigned reading for the week, because there was simply too much to get through.

            "\u00a0Yes, I think this course was interesting and engaging and is a good choice especially for underclassmen. ",
            "\u00a0Great lecturer. Solid Credit/D class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely! Even if you do not want to go into law or bioethics, take this course!! It is extremely interesting and it helps you understand why modern law is the way it is today! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is a really interesting course that expands understanding of law and medicine. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially to those concerned with rights of abortion, end-of-life care, and doctor-patient relations, as well as those who want to have a glimpse of a law school course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course provided me with relevant knowledge about modern day issues. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It's a great course to learn very interesting topics while not taking over your life with readings. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is a great introduction to the general field and is a really interesting intersection of law and social issues as well as scientific issues. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's extremely important to at least gain exposure to some of the many bioethics issues. ",
            "\u00a0YES! I would recommend this class to any student because the medical system touches the lives of everyone. No matter what your interests are, you will be able to relate to these issues and gain a profound understanding for your rights and responsibilities as a patient. The lecture is really fascinating, and discussion section had rich conversation-- never dead. This is a gem of a class at Yale and not too heavy of a workload-- very accessible. ",

It was also a really interesting course that forced me to think about controversial topics beyond the moral or emotional approach I had used for my whole life. I had to think in terms of legality and constitutionality. ",

            "\u00a0If you're considering filling out your schedule with a lighter-workload but fun course I would highly recommend this one. There are not slides so you have to go to lecture, but the lectures are very interesting and engaging (and only 50 minutes). Make sure you pick a section quickly, however, as the fill up fast. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would. It is an interesting topic that opens a new subject that has so much impact that you wouldn't expect. Very interesting topics to learn. ",
            "\u00a0Yup. Not quite a gut, but not difficult either and pretty cool material/lectures ",
            "\u00a0Yes, you will learn amazing things ",
            "\u00a0I took this course Credit-D and would recommend it to anyone remotely interested in bioethics. I took the class basically because the topics covered sounded like the kinds of things I would enjoy reading about in the newspaper. The legal aspect was totally new to me, and I enjoyed it more than I expected. I found myself reading the casebook kind of like a story: the facts of the case, the arguments for and against, and the court's conclusion. \r\n\r\nAnd of course, Professor Latham's lectures were an absolute delight. It was a huge privilege to be able to sit in on those lectures twice a week and not have to worry about doing the nitty-gritty of the work for the course. I never, ever got bored during lecture: it was like listening to a bunch of really cool stories from the mouth of someone who has lived them and is incredibly familiar with them. Professor Latham just gets up there and talks, and somehow he manages to weave together the topics into a lecture that is at once entertaining and organized. I really do not know how he does it. If you have the chance to take this course, even to audit it, definitely do that! "
