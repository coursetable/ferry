            "\u00a0It's great to have colloquium as a requirement for the senior thesis, and to be able to work out ideas with other students. Karla helped a lot in guiding the process, but the real individual one on one work is done with your advisor once you find one. A weakness would be that with students from different concentrations in the major, there were different expectations from the professor and the DUS that were never really clarified in class (i.e. the difference between a senior project in design vs urban studies). ",
            "\u00a0Though the course was overall good, it was unclear at many times what was expected of us, and it often felt like we were jumping through hoops that often kept us from working on what was really important to us in our projects (such as presenting to grad students almost weekly, such that a lot of our time that could have gone into research went into making many presentations).

            "\u00a0Take this if you want to do a senior project/thesis (it can also be a one semester research project that isn't continued). It's good practice presenting your ideas and research and  being able to talk about them. Luckily with changes in the major the difference in expectations between concentrations should be cleared up. Karla is great and really helpful, but make sure you start searching for an advisor early. ",
            "\u00a0Only take this course if you have a clear idea of what you want to do in the course; expect it to be very self-directed and self-driven. "
