Professor Svolik is a great instructor, but there was a portion of the class who did not put in the effort and made the class altogether worse. For some reason, I kind of expected more out of this class in a way. I feel like a lot of class time was spent on these odd formulas with little pay-offs as to how it relates to the big picture. ",

There was a number of lectures that was missed earlier in the term that was never rescheduled even though Professor said it would be. It caused us to rush the entire last week of the course, which was heavily tested on the final.\r\nAnd during the final, certain exams had missing questions and cut parts from questions, which the TF's were not aware until someone pointed it out during the exam. The students had to wait over an hour to get proper copies of their exams, while they could only squint and try to solve the missing questions through the hastily setup projector. \r\nThe material in the course is very interesting but the course does need some restructuring to be recommended. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: N/A\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nJesus Christ. The course was unbelievably disorganized. Professor Svolik seems like a nice guy, but he missed 2x lectures during shopping period (so everyone committed based off of like one class). He said several times we'd make up the lectures but we never did. The problem sets weren't difficult but were worded EXCEEDINGLY confusingly. The midterm was also easy but felt like it was written in the most arcane, obscure form possible. And GOOD GOD. THE FINAL. The final was ~15 questions, ~4 pages. 4 questions had parts of them cut off due to printing errors! And we discovered this half way through the final! And they couldn't get more copies in time! We had to all wait for the TAs to operate some clunky projector and show the parts that were missing on the board so we could answer the questions. Oh, and there was a whole freaking question omitted -- it went straight from 5 to 7, no #6. The lectures just wander. Impossible to pay attention. Class had ~100 kids, 30-50 in lectures. ",
            "\u00a0The professor is an engaging lecturer and clearly finds the topic interesting and exciting. The material is interesting but often surface-level. The class can also sometimes be disorganized and the exams didn't necessarily reward deep knowledge of the material. However, as an introduction to political science for someone outside of the major, it served its purpose and wasn't overwhelming or too jargon-y. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the lectures were interesting and enjoyed the readings and problem sets, but sometimes the coursework could be intuitive and would have been more engaging if made more challenging. I think a discussion section could have made the course more engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: material is actually pretty interesting if you're into game theory; and it's presented in a digestible manner, not super hard like other game theory courses. Readings can be hard to understand but you just have to get the gist of them. Prof Svolik is great\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not much guidance as to what will be on exams or how to study, but you kind of just figure it out ",

            "\u00a0There was no clear direction about what to expect for exams. There were no practice problems for exams and there was no discussion of format. This class was really interesting, but many of the concepts were superficially covered. Many of the concepts were intuitive and we spent much longer on them than we should have. The lectures were not well-organized. The math was often rushed. There was a lot of reading and reading responses twice a week, but this only counted for 5% of our grade and the readings were not on exams. There is quite a bit of reading so the reading responses should count for a higher percentage of the grade. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Slovik is a passionate lecturer and a really nice guy. Sometimes it felt like he would reiterate the same ideas, even when they were pretty simple. This could get a bit boring at times, but it did help drive home the lectures. I felt like I learned things in this class that I won't just brain-dump after the final. The tests were both super easy, and there were only a few problem sets assigned, so you have to stay on top of your stuff and make sure you don't make silly mistakes. ",

We could have moved at twice the pace without issue, thereby covering twice the content. More incorporation of the outside readings into class, as began to occur at the end of the course, would have led to more learning. ",
            "\u00a0Quite disorganized - our readings and lectures did not always seem to connect. Our final was a bit of a mess (the professor wasn't there, and a printing mishap meant that everyone in the class had missing pages on their final). ",

I think that this class would do better as a QR because I'm not sure how game theory (a math-based field) can be taught comprehensively without math. ",
            "\u00a0This class is very easy. If you are looking for a fifth class that will fill a prerequisite for EP&E or political science it is helpful and clearly taught. The readings are often long and irrelevant to the class. It would be useful to cut down the readings or pick ones more relevant to what is discussed in class, or include test questions about the readings because it might encourage more students to be more engaged.

            "\u00a0This course was fun and engaging, but never went particularly in-depth with respect to the material taught. It was mostly a rehashing of the readings in a more game-theoretic framework, which was certainly interesting, but failed to provide any deeper understanding of game theory itself in any meaningful way.\r\n\r\nThe tests were very poorly worded, which made it incredibly difficult to understand what concept was even being tested.\r\n\r\nThe lectures were well-delivered, though I do think Prof. Svolik could have been more inventive and dynamic with his presentations, as by the end of the semester it began to feel a little more tedious. ",

            "\u00a0Weaknesses: unorganized, not very clear ",
            "\u00a0Organization was a clear weakness. The professor was often a few minutes late for class and would request things from us at the last minute. Slides were impossible to use for review. It wasn't clear what the professor wanted us to get out of the class. Even handing back problem sets took far too long. The final exam was a mis-printed fiasco. The professor didn't ask for participation in class as a component of the grade, but would often wait for long chunks of time in class for someone in the large lecture hall to answer a question that didn't further our learning. Participation wasn't valuable. He spent tremendous time exploring complex models in class that hadn't appeared in readings and would not be tested in homework or the exams, often without explaining clearly why the models were useful in understanding the subject matter. He used Greek letters when other variables would have sufficed and would have been less confusing. What were we supposed to learn? ",
            "\u00a0Milan is awesome, and he really helps to drive this class. Unfortunately not too many people participate. Might be better with more active students. ",
            "\u00a0I generally enjoyed the lectures, especially when Professor Svolik brought in current political dilemmas. However, I sometimes thought Professor Svolik rushed through the game theory involved in the course and did not explain the set-up of the equations or what the end result meant. I actually learned the most game theory during the PSETs and going to office hours. That said, the exams did not demand that much game theory and were structured as true/false statements. Although I would have appreciated some true/false questions, I actually wish the final had more game trees and problems resembling the PSETs. Instead, almost all of the questions were focused on the concepts in the lectures and the readings, which should have made them easy points, except for the wording, which was often unclear and hinged on a single word such as \"imply\" or \"assume.\" Overall, I thought the workload and material covered in the course was very fair, but I would have preferred more variety and even difficulty in the exam questions and more explanations of the game theory side of the course. ",
            "\u00a0This course is ambitious and has excellent subject matter. In terms of content, it was one of my favourite classes this semester. However, this course has room for improvement in terms of structure. There could be more guidance on what would be on exams before they are given, and lectures could have a larger overall theme. I also wish the difficulty was increased. ",
            "\u00a0The class employs a very reasonable homework schedule. Readings are effective and germane to class material. Problem sets did not consume several evenings worth of effort and tended to reflect past lectures. That being said, there is a fairly cut-and-dry grading scheme that privileges the results of only two exams. If you perform poorly (or even adequately) on the midterm, your grade may very well hang in the balance for the rest of the semester. The course is also taught as a large lecture and attendance was lackluster. Students were not rewarded for submitting reading summary assignments on-time nor were they for showing up to class; perhaps making those two amendments to the grading scheme would make the course more equitable. Also, this IS an EP&E course. Anticipate the crowd it's going to attract. If you take yourself very seriously, take this class. ",

            "\u00a0It seemed to only give a very basic and drawn out approach to game theory, there was not that much content for the course. In the future the professor could move through the topics quicker to address more content. ",

Lectures cover the same content as the readings, so if you go to lecture (or read someone else's notes), doing the readings is pretty unnecessary. The actual content of the course is kind of interesting, so overall, I would recommend it as a fifth (maybe a sixth) class. ",

If you are unfamiliar with the concepts and want to learn more about the social sciences, I definitely recommend taking the course. A lot of the conclusions seem like \"common sense,\" but are nonetheless extremely interesting. Readings are pretty light, and the problem sets and exams not especially difficult. Surprisingly, this turned out to be what I consider one of the most important classes I've taken at Yale for developing the perspective with which I view the world. ",

So it wasn't that the theme was a dud, just the way that it was taught. Only take it if you're desperate for an A, and even then, I advise you not to waste your time going to class.

            "\u00a0Yes, its a good way to dip your toe into game theory. ",
            "\u00a0If you need it as a requirement, it is the easiest way to satisfy game theory. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student looking to fill a prerequisite or interested in logic as it relates to politics. ",
            "\u00a0yes if you don;t know a lot about politics and you want light and easy class ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course as a fifth class. There were only a few Problem Sets and the required readings are not dense or difficult. The lectures are fun and interesting to contemplate. However, if you're looking for a deep introduction to Game Theory and strategy, this is not the class for you. It is intended to be as non-mathy as possible, so this makes it a great class for humanities kids, but even still it lacks some of the depth you might find elsewhere. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this if you need a Poly Sci Gut. The workload is super light, the material is objectively intriguing, and the grading is extremely lenient. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, provided they have some interesting in Game Theory and Politics.  The math wasnt extremely difficult, but it helped to have a basic understanding of strategic games and an interest in current events. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to take a gut lol. ",
            "\u00a0Its a good fifth class. I rarely went because lecture was boring and the concepts are easy to grasp if you go to a few lectures. Definitely not the most exciting/mind blowing class in the world though, especially because the theories we learn arent super applicable to the real world/complex. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because it enhances your knowledge on game theory ",
            "\u00a0No. The course needs clear restructuring. It started off promising, but never fulfilled any particular vision for a set of things we were to learn. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in politics and the basics of game theory. I also thought the workload was more than manageable and the PSETS were actually enjoyable. The lectures could get a bit long, especially with the dim lights of Sudler Hall, but the material was usually engaging especially for those interested in voting, cycles of government, and representation. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend in terms of the assigned readings. The course also has a nice and compassionate instructor. ",
            "\u00a0Great fifth class! The workload is very low but the topics are still really interesting! ",
            "\u00a0Maybe. If you're exploring the potential of pursuing a degree in EP&E or are looking to satisfy a political theory requirement, the class is a good introduction to the major and is very manageable. If you have any reason NOT to take the class, or can satisfy a credit elsewhere, DO THAT. The lecture is long and assuredly boring. Many students struggle to keep their eyes open in the warm darkness of Sudler Hall (and right after lunch, to boot). The material is very dry and very intuitive. Some readings will have you wondering \"why did someone need to write this out? Like, doesn't everyone know this already?\" Some lectures will have you wondering what the hell just happened. The course tends to be well-organized, though tests are worded notoriously poorly and can prove rather confusing. Problem sets sometimes consider scenarios we hadn't covered in class. In sum, I didn't particularly enjoy my time in this course and wish I hadn't taken it. ",
            "\u00a0It's definitely a good course to take if you want to gain a basic understanding of political theory and reduce your workload. ",
            "\u00a0This is a wonderful entry to game theory with light applications in politics. Funny, interesting, and strengthening the basic understanding of political interactions worldwide! ",
            "\u00a0Yes take this course; great especially for non-Econ majors to learn about game theory ",
            "\u00a0Definitely a gut, truly didn't learn much. Pretty chill class overall. Lectures are super slow. Pretty easy to catch up on content via slides without going to class. ",
            "\u00a0If you're looking to fulfill a game theory requirement, don't waste your time with anything else. This class is a no brainer workload wise, and is actually way more interesting because of the political applications. Seriously, save yourself some stress and take this class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you are looking for a very basic class or you want an easy A. I do not regret taking the class at all. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would. This class develops a very applicable foundation to other political science classes as well as history and economics. "
