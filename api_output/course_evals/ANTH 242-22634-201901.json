Valeggia is brilliant, kind, and sensitivegenuinely cares about her students, which is rarer than it should beand almost worth taking a science course to get a chance to know. TAs varied a lot in their level of expertise but overall were good. ",

",

This included studying epigenetics, stress and stress responses, human diversity, human energetics, human growth, and human reproductive biology, just to name a few topics from the class. I learned how to think about human evolution through an anthropological lens. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot in this course about the evolutionary mechanisms by which humans have formed into our modern-day forms. ",
            "\u00a0This was the first anthropology class I've ever taken, and I feel like, in some ways, I gained a worldview. Generally speaking, I learned how to view human evolution through a life history lens (particularly through the concept of trade-offs). Pretty much everything in the course comes back to this, and I often found myself learning things that then made a lot of things I'd observed out in the world make sense. ",
            "\u00a0This is a course that will make you relate everything you know about the human body to evolution in relation to systems of power. The first half of the semester begins with specific bodily functions: transcription, translation, etc. The second half of the semester zooms out to look more at human evolution as it intersects with culture. In every lesson, the information was traced back to cultural implications, biases, privilege, etc. so that students can begin to understand that science, just like anything, is a product of a hierarchical world. Also in this way, students are asked to draw connections to many things they see in every day life. Therefore, the information in this class feels incredibly applicable to the real world, making it the perfect class for non-STEM people like myself. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about human evolutionary processes and about the principles of life history. I also learned a significant amount about biological anthropology as a field, as well as the importance of applying ideals outside of western/industrialized mindsets when doing anthropological studies. ",
            "\u00a0Wow I learned so much: understanding human life history from an evolutionary standpoint, the evolutionary explanation for some diseases we have today, evolutionary explanations for just about everything from race, sex, reproduction, energy use and intake, and more! ",

This course also helped me develop an ability to consider the \"big picture\" when studying or taking a test: instead of simply memorizing many minute details, we were encouraged to synthesize our knowledge and apply it to difficult questions. Finally, I learned that for every human phenomenon, there are usually many explanations, sometimes based in evolution and sometimes not. I learned to critically evaluate \"paradoxes\" or improbable situations and consider all the possible factors that could have led to their development in humans. ",

Even as an English major, I found all 13 weeks of the course exciting, engaging, and relevant to my field of study. Highlights included examining race from the perspective of biological anthropology (which we conclude is not a scientific category), as well as the paleo-diet and paleo-sleep patterns. It was engaging and extremely well-taught. ",

Both contribute to a very positive learning environment where a diverse array of information and opinions are shared. I also LOVE the 5-minute meditations at the beginning of every class. They're very cathartic. I can't think of any weaknesses of this course. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very much geared towards non-science majors. With that being said, I think sometimes Professor Valeggia is confusing and the actual structure of the course is not the most intuitive at times. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: meditation before class helped me focus for the rest of lecture. Interesting information that was easy to learn. Good preparation for exams.\r\nWeaknesses: Lack of variety in assignments; they were only readings and reading questions. Maybe it could be spiced up with some interesting projects or fun interactive activities. ",
            "\u00a0Connected material to real world and our lives pretty well. ",
            "\u00a0I think the material in the course had the potential to be very interesting. However, I found the lectures very dry and overall pretty uninteresting. It was difficult to really pay attention and the weekly topics were all so different. It would have been better if there was a more cohesive structure. Moreover, the grading in this class is very subjective. Everything is based on two tests and the discussion questions. Anything covered in class could show up on the exam, and I never felt like the exam truly captured how much I learned. Furthermore, the grading on the exams could be so subjective because everything is essay-based. Overall, I felt like this class did not intellectually stimulate me at all. There was so much rote memorization. ",

In lectures, weekly assignments, and exams, the liberal interpretation was always the right answer. It felt that political ideologies affected her teaching (and I agree with most of her stances, but I still felt this way). ",
            "\u00a0I thought this course was very engaging and well-planned. I really enjoyed Professor Valeggia's 5 minutes of meditation at the beginning of each class, and I thought the material was always presented in a very understandable way. I think there needs to be more consistency across different sections, because it seems like some sections talked about certain topics a lot more than others, but we were all tested on the same things. ",
            "\u00a0meditation is fun! lectures are interesting but sometimes move a little slow ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the day we went to the TEAL and had to brainstorm our own study as it allowed us to apply the skills we learned in lecture. I wish we had more days with interactive activities like that. The lectures sometimes were repetitive and slow, but it was never too bad.\r\n\r\nI think this course was strong in that the material was captivating and never too abstract. As a non-science major, the topics were digestible.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot of reading for this course that isn't really helpful or relevant, so I think the reading should be narrowed to what is really relevant to class material. Section was sometimes just a repeat of the readings we did and could have been more engaging, but on the whole not too bad. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nMeditating before every class! Claudia is a phenomenal teacher and person; taking the class just for her would be a smart move. The assignments were very fair, and the two exams were likewise extremely doable while still requiring legitimate learning on the part of the student. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nNot many! Sometimes certain weeks would be very heavy on readings, but other than that this was a great class. ",

            "\u00a0Professor Valeggia gave a lecture that was anti-low income people, basically intimating that they have a lot of children and cant care for them properly in her lecture on life history strategy. As a person on heavy financial aid it was extremely disturbing and alienating for me to hear. ",
            "\u00a0This course can be a little dry in lecture sometimes because occasionally, things will be repeated. Overall, it was very interesting and I learned a lot of things that I didn't know before. ",
            "\u00a0The course provides a good science credit for non-science majors. It is well organized so that students know what is being expected of them. That being said, the material at the end of the course is much more engaging than that of the beginning. ",
            "\u00a0Prof Valeggia begins each class with 5 minutes of meditation, and it became a really important part of my day. It helps refocus everyone for class. I also love how much she loves what she teaches, so lectures are really engaging- she also asks the class questions, which is very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The material is delivered in a digestible way and the lectures a fairly engaging. The required section was a bit of a waste of time sometimes though and I wish that they had been more guided by the TF as opposed to left up to students to talk. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I liked how this course was organized by very clear topics; my favorite units were post-midterm, such as life history theory and male and female reproductive ecology. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The exams were definitely stressful to study for given how much material was covered on each. However, I appreciated that the final was not cumulative by topic ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are that it covers a broad range of topics that are interesting. Weaknesses are that the first half of the semester is less engaging and interesting than the second half. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were interesting. Its was easy to figure out what material to study for exams. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: This course was stimulating, interesting, and engaging. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: certain complex processes that were difficult to understand were not fully explained and it was difficult to find accurate explanations of them. ",
            "\u00a0I wish we had linked more of the readings to class discussions. ",
            "\u00a0One strength was how the course was structured--I think the weekly DQs kept me accountable and sections helped clarify more difficult scientific papers. Professor Valeggia's lectures were also extremely helpful in leading us through complicated concepts. One weakness was the denseness of the readings--it was almost impossible for me to do all of the readings before each lecture because they were so long. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength is that Professor Valeggia is a phenomenal professor, and at least for Spring 2019, the lectures were recorded and posted online, allowing one to (theoretically) stay in the comfort of one's bed while lecture went on in the relatively-far Luce Hall. The class was extremely well organized: at the beginning of the semester, the a Course Schedule excel file is posted, and it details what classes cover what topics/readings, and what sections cover what readings. Surprisingly, though, the lecture slides themselves weren't organized as much as I'd expect, but this was a minor inconvenience. ",
            "\u00a0I found the course well organized for student learning, and I think the course's greatest strength is its compelling and talented instructor, Professor Valeggia. The course also made me think critically about the disciplines of biology and anthropology, which I really appreciated. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The content is, generally speaking, pretty fascinating. Professor Valeggia is a very good lecturer, and the guest lecturers she brought in were great as well (particularly Bribiescas) I felt that I learned a lot  and a lot about things that really affect all of us day-to-day. Exams are in general very fair, and are structured, I think, in a way that does aim for thematic understanding rather than minutiae (do study, and study very thoroughly, but don't stress too much). Many of the readings are very interesting and well-written, so this is a plus as well. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sections were not particularly engaging (it's clear that people don't really do the reading) and not particularly well-led. Obviously, these problems are interrelated. I understand the desire to have non-STEM students learn how to read scientific papers, and I do feel less daunted by these now, but I think the conversations we had in section that were the most interesting were those that came from more journalistic articles; perhaps more of these in the future? It's also my understanding that there were pretty big discrepancies in expectations/grading between TFs, so that might be something to address as well. Sometimes what we needed to know was unclear  we needed to know mechanisms for some processes and not others, for example, and that was often not clear. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more than I thought! The class is mostly all strengths. I only wish that it was clearer which of the claims made in lecture was agreed upon broadly and which were more controversial in the scientific and medical communities, because I have shared some things I learned with friends in STEM who are very skeptical of them, and others that seem to be widely accepted. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of information is covered in this course, but it never feels too overwhelming. When a student finishes this class, they will have a really robust knowledge of evolution and its current implications as well as its history. The structure of the course is incredibly organized, and there is never a question about what is due when. Professor Valeggia and the TA team make the course flow seamlessly, and the once a week sections help students digest the material in lecture in an effective manner. \r\nI do not have a lot to say in terms of weaknesses. The only thing that comes to mind are the differences in the TAs. For example, we have weekly response questions and some TAs grade more harshly than others. But other than that, honestly nothing. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Valeggia was an engaging and informed professor who clearly wanted to facilitate student learning as much as possible. Lecture was engaging and always taught me something new, informative, and interesting. Because section was always a student presentation on one reading for the entire time, though, it sometimes felt like this aspect of the course didn't help student learning as much as it could have. ",
            "\u00a0All of the material was extremely interesting and Claudia is a great lecturer, caring professor, and warm person.  I would have liked to have assignments that involved more meaningful engagement with the material than just a midterm, final, and reading responses. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: well-organized, and you knew exactly what was expected of you. \r\nWeaknesses: sections weren't that great and grading wasn't very standardized. ",
            "\u00a0I rarely found sections useful. I think that having students present wasn't that helpful because I would rather learn from a TF who is experienced in the material, and I think that students (myself included) just fumbled through presentations. \r\nDQs were also unnecessarily long (would take 3-4 hours in addition to lengthy readings) and often made me more confused about the material than less. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Valeggia is a strength of the course for sure and definitely added to the class. The TFs were helpful as well. The course was straightforward and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Valeggia is a wonderful professor. She cares a lot about her students and cares about their learning. The readings are interesting. The class was a bit too big though and the Section felt a bit useless. ",
            "\u00a0Better organization, more guidance on work, clearer assignments for discussion questions and deedback ",
            "\u00a0I like that the classes were recorded because it made it very helpful to go back over topics I wasnt sure about when studying. ",
            "\u00a0The professor emphasizes not to memorize or stress but then gives us memorization heavy exams which can be really stressful :( ",
            "\u00a0Clearer expectations ",
            "\u00a0There's not a section to review this, so I'll put it here: I found my section with Kyle to be quite hostile. His volatility and response to students put everyone on edge. At times, our discussions went over articles really well, and others the passive and overt aggression could be overwhelming. ",
            "\u00a0The course gave an introduction to very insightful topics at a level that is approachable, no matter your previous science background. Claudia Valeggia is an amazing professor and is extremely passionate about course topics. She does a very good job of explaining everything. ",
            "\u00a0The course was well taught and covered interesting course material. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: slides posted, no need to buy textbooks, lectures recorded, topics explained thoroughly and accessible for those outside the field of study, discussion questions were manageable and good, collaborative, meditation\r\nWeaknesses: some topics (ex. ethics) didn't seem to fit well, midterm and final being such a large part of the grade, too many case studies for evolutionary medicine, seemed like a return to high school biology plus fun facts ",
            "\u00a0Strength: I enjoyed this course's weekly homework discussion questions. Answering them always gave me a better understanding of that week's lecture topic and specific readings, and they served as helpful study tools for the midterm and final. I also felt that the material was constantly interesting: we were presented with many specific examples of every topic, most of which were directly applicable to everyday life. So much of what we learned surprised me!\r\n\r\nWeakness: Sometimes, section for this course left something to be desired. We would discuss one article each week, presented by a different group of students each time. These presentations were interesting, but if the presenters finished before the 50-minute period was up, I often felt that we weren't encouraged to talk about other, related, topics and therefore ran out of things to say. I wish my TF had come more prepared with ways to effectively use extra section time. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are too long and I'd find myself writhing in my seat waiting to be free. Some parts of some lectures were interesting, but I thought that much of it was nonessential. The twice-a-week lectures were one hour and fifteen minutes, as opposed to 50 minutes, but still had weekly sections for fifty minutes. I thought this was way too much.\r\n\r\nLectures could also stand to be a little clearer. All of the screenshots and images distract from the main points. The professor did have some slides a the beginning of the lectures outlining some main points, but I would have liked to see more of those throughout. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the lectures and appreciated that the professor also put them on canvas so that we could follow along. I think the discussion questions helped us get a better sense of what to expect on the mid terms and finals. I really enjoyed that the class started with meditation. The workload was not too much at all. I think it could be improved by going into each of the readings in a bit more depth rather than just choosing one to focus on. ",

            "\u00a0The lectures were well-organized and Prof. Valeggia was very engaging and spoke passionately about the material. The syllabus for the first half of the semester was more disorganized and there didn't seem to be a clear rationale for the material that was grouped together for the midterm. The second half of the course was much easier to follow. I think section participation and presentations should be worth more, just because so much of the overall grade for the course was determined by the two exams. I thought all the readings supplemented the lectures really well -- especially the more scientific, research-based studies that we read. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the subject itself is interesting if you're not that into science. Weaknesses: the lectures were less interesting than I thought they'd be, the TFs are not great so section is pretty uncomfortable and boring, the only grades are basically the final/midterm so be careful. ",
            "\u00a0Weekly reading responses were very constructive. They helped direct my reading each week toward a specific goal, and develop my thoughts on major topics of the week. Lectures were delivered at a good pace, and student participation with the lecturer and each other was an essential component. ",

As a second semester senior, and a history major, this class was a godsend when I realized that I needed one last SC credit in order to graduate. It's neither extremely difficult nor extremely easy, which I really appreciated. As someone that's had terrible experiences in other Yale science courses, this class was a breath of fresh air. Professor Valeggia is an engaging lecturer who is truly invested in the success of her students. Readings and lectures were fair and did not overwhelm me with information. The midterm was relatively straightforward and I personally thought the questions were fair-- just make sure to attend lecture, take detailed notes, and actually study for the exams! ",

Material is generally quite interesting but weekly \"discussion questions\" are just reading responses, and the readings themselves aren't really necessary besides; section is onerous, as the TAs are supposed to have you discuss but most of the time nobody understands the material (immediately after the preceding lectures) to respond well. Claudia is very nice and has an interesting philosophy regarding learning, which includes meditation before lectures (would recommend), but tests are weighted way too highly and it wasn't very easily to establish a strong synthetic grasp of course material. It seemed to have some trouble navigating the divide between popular science and hard science. All that being said, I learned some really interesting things about humans and human evolution. It's just that the process getting there wasn't always fun. ",

There are much better classes out there to be one of your 36. ",

Professor Valeggia does this in her lecture by focusing on the ethics of science above all else, but she also makes a point to get students in conversation with each other, even during lecture. The reading can seem like a lot, but it is not always necessary (although I always complete them). More than anything, the readings for the weekly section a must.\r\nThe grades are heavily determined by two exams, but they were fair and the majority of students did super well on them. Plus, the TAs lead review sessions to help students prepare. Seriously, take this class. ",

Maybe if I were a first-year in this course I would've changed my major. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, although it was more challenging than I thought it would be. I am not a science major, I was taking it more for a credit. But if you are ready to work hard and learn a lot, I do recommend it. ",

Once you get into it, though, youd find the content fairly interesting. Keep in mind that theres a lot of readings to do and by a lot I mean a lot - more than some of my HU and WR classes. It can be unclear what material would be tested on so you would feel kind of pressured to do all the readings carefully. The review sessions were not especially helpful.

Take from this what you will.\r\n\r\nA good grade is possible if you do well on the tests and consistently on the weekly responses (which are not too bad). If you take the class, I'd advise you not to go to lecture as I did.

It can be quite frustrating when everyone is offering their two cents on epigenetics (for example) when no one really has any foundational understanding of the biological bases. That being said, I think everyone will come away having learned *something.* It's really important to understand female and male reproductive biology and how much of medicine and our understanding of disease ecologies is shaped by culture.
