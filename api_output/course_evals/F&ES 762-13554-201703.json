Teaches you how to read a \"word problem\" out in the world!\r\n- \r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n- unclear early in the semester how quickly the material would move. I thought I would be fine without a calculus background, but the class got tough quickly in late September. ",
            "\u00a0The class was too broad in scope, it might be more feasible and beneficial to trim down the topics and focus on a fewer areas with more practical and applied examples. ",
            "\u00a0The course works to give context to math and share practical uses of seemingly theoretical concepts. ",
            "\u00a0I wish the course didn't dedicate two full class periods to the book club. This seemed like poor use of class time. It was also a bit frustrating that the lectures were often overly simplistic, and covered material I already knew and could follow easily. The problem sets would then be much more challenging, and there was an unspoken expectation that students would effectively attend a second lecture through office hours to cover the material needed to solve the problems on assignments. I wish Eli began classes with the expectation that students had read the assigned chapters beforehand, and progressed more rapidly into the more challenging material in lecture. The structure of grading for problem sets was also a bit strange. Solving problems alone but using the short-hand solutions would result in half credit for questions, while essentially getting the answers in office hours could result in full credit, which doesn't seem like quite the right incentive structure. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- Great insight into how and why we do math the way we do\r\n- Very applicable examples and problem sets\r\n- Learned some R coding which is helpful for other courses\r\n- Prepared me for future courses\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Class time offered little time to do examples making problem sets and R problems very difficult to tackle\r\n- Book was time consuming and not useful enough to warrant taking valuable time out of learning the math itself ",
            "\u00a0I wish there had been more instruction in R. I felt lost a lot of the time with that component of the class. However, overall a very well constructed class. Homework problems could be confusing - Eli clearly had a vision of what he wanted you to say but it could be difficult to tell what he was after. He is a great lecturer overall, and pretty good at explaining difficult concepts. Reading the book E didn't seem necessary, especially the second half. Maybe instead of \"book club\" we could have done more R lessons. Overall it's an ambitious course and one worth taking. ",
            "\u00a0A strength is the great lectures and the fact that we learn a lot about a lot of different subjects. A weakness is that sometimes we didn't go very deep into a subject and only skimmed it ",
            "\u00a0There could be an opportunity to offer a more advanced version of the course for students with a greater math background. If there was one thing I would have changed to improve my own experience in the class, it would have been to spend less time on the material from the first half of the class that I knew better (particularly calculus) and spend more time digging into the material that was newer to my (particularly differential equations). However, I think the material fit the \"bell curve\" of student math backgrounds very well. ",
            "\u00a0Great academic learning objectives. ",
            "\u00a0It would have been nice to have weekly problem sets that addressed fewer topic areas per problem set. It would have been helpful for me to have a few extra practice questions relating to each topic per problem set. \r\n\r\nI appreciated the amount of information that we covered and was happy to have briefly touched on all of the material covered though, at times, we did move very quickly. I understand that is the nature of this type of survey course however. ",
            "\u00a0Generally very good lectures. Very good homework, very thoughtfully written exams. Professor and TF were available to answer questions. \r\n\r\nReally, the weaknesses are due to limited time. I could have used more time on ODEs and constrained optimization. \r\n\r\nI did not enjoy reading or discussing e, although I appreciate it's importance to the course. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the course as it was, overall. The Canvas site could be improved. It was poorly organized with resources all over the place in various folders and with hyperlinks in random hard to find places. ",
            "\u00a0So much jammed into one semester. Not only learning the mathematical concepts, but then learning how to solve challenging problems, and then learning how to identify real life situations that can be captured by the newly learned concepts, and then learning how to be able to write an equation that represents a solution to real-life issue, and then learning how to solve using computer programming skills.\r\n\r\nTo fully get what you want out of this class, I think you need to either come in with college level calculus or split the class in two - or have more class time with TA session.\r\n\r\nA flipped class would be beneficial. Working out problems with TA was very useful, but only one hour a weak was insufficient. ",
            "\u00a0Fast paced, which was expected. Lots of support from Eli and TF, which was really crucial to me. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of the course are its creativity, its level of interesting material, the fact that I felt it really improved my math skills, it was challenging, but I really learned a lot. \r\nWeakness is that for those who need more basic help it can feel like class time is a little advanced, and there are not a ton of office hours to turn to for help. Some of the homeworks (cough differential equations cough) were quite tough, and I felt that they could have benefited from more preparation in class ahead of time. Stability analysis on a number line needs a little more explanation too. ",
            "\u00a0Strength- AMES covers a lot of ground really well. Moving through parts of several semesters worth of college math is not easy to do and I was surprised at how much we were able to cover.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- The pacing of the course was not always great. The time spent laying the foundations was valuable but it left some of the more difficult concepts life differential equations feeling rushed. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I liked the class and the space created for asking questions and \"playing\" with math problem. I think clarity and attention to detail with writing on the board would have helped (labeling accesses, and accuracy). "
