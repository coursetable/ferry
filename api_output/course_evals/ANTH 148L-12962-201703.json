            "\u00a0I definitely got a lot from this course, from basic micropipetting skills and running assays, to working for an entire semester with a group on a project and doing statistical analysis. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a great introduction to laboratory science. I really learned how to perform in a lab, and I learned the necessary skills for future lab work. ",
            "\u00a0How to develop a research question and project, collect saliva samples, run ELISA assays for steroid hormones, analyze data, understand the nuance between hypotheses and predictions, collaborate with a team ",
            "\u00a0Great course to begin your laboratory experience at the university level. You will learn the basics of lab and the basics of biological anthropology. You will also learn about the theory of laboratories and the theory of education more generally. ",
            "\u00a0I wanted to experience what it is like to work in a team of students to conduct research. I was also interested in the course's student to instructor ratio, which allows me to get personal feedbacks that were very helpful. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This course has many strengths: the small size made it very easy to communicate with the professors and participate in class, everyone learned with and from one another, conducting an actual research project in a group was a great experience, and learning the science behind the protocols as opposed to just following them was also great. The only weakness, I would say, is that I wish we had more time for lectures or labs on certain days. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength for this class was the focus on learning. With such a low student-teacher ratio, I really learned all of the necessary information and felt like all of my answers and needs were met. All of the professors are super caring and helpful, and they really care about helping the students. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are small class size and professor to student ratio, the incredible and thorough feedback you receive on assignments, the excitement of and ability to develop your own research question and use the class as an opportunity to learn how to investigate something you care about. Another major strength was that the class was very conducive to learning and growing and was a wonderful environment for anyone to learn science in. Weaknesses are small time given for data collection and also that the first half of the course seemed a bit repetitive/not that helpful -- as most of the concepts had to be relearned while doing the research project so maybe it could be a learn as you go kind of thing and start off with the project development from the start. ",
            "\u00a0The combination of theoretical and practical learning of laboratories is wonderful. The combination of doing seminar and lab in the same day was difficult. Feedback from educators is excellent. ",
            "\u00a0The course's strength includes its instructors' application of a new teaching technique, which focuses on granting students the opportunity to learn through heuristic approaches. \r\nThe course's weaknesses include the lack of clear instructions on the expectation of the final project. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student! The discussions we had in class with our peers and professors as well as actual lab time were all enjoyable for me. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this class if youre at all interested in learning how to work in a lab. You get to design your own study, collect samples, and analyze the samples all on your own. Its an amazing idea! Youll learn a lot and itll be a great time. Not a lot of work either. Weekly reading responses for the first part of the semester, and then the second half focuses on running your study. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! ",
            "\u00a0You will become a better scholar and laboratory scientist, so yes I would. Also for any anthropology student, this will likely broaden your understanding of the anthropological field generally. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student because it is one of the rare chances that allow students to perform research in a professional environment. The project-based learning style allows students to maximize their level of creativity while learning how to cope with unexpected challenges. "
