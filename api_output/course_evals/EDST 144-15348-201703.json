            "\u00a0I learned about immigration and education, as well as the criminal justice system and larger trends in the twentieth century. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the different racial identities and immigrant migration and immigrant experiences. ",
            "\u00a0This class teaches you something new every single class period. I didn't come in thinking I was very knowledgeable in all things race and immigration related, but this class made me realize how much I don't know about the country and its demographic makeup. The material is essential knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0Through this course I was exposed to aspects of sociology and race, ethnicity, and migration, that are highly relevant and interesting. I also gained experience in analyzing sources and conducting literary reviews, by critically looking at published articles. ",
            "\u00a0A general understanding of the way race, ethnicity and immigration affect American public policy and population trends. Very important and necessary knowledge for every American. ",
            "\u00a0It was a great intro to sociology course. ",
            "\u00a0I got insight into some of the sociological problems that we exists around race, ethnicity, and immigration. Much more than that, I believe the class helped us critically think as to how some of the issues that we discussed were intertwined or stemmed from other problems. ",
            "\u00a0The course provides a very thorough survey of important topics related to race/ethnicity, immigration, and education. While topics like racial segregation and educational trends along race/ethnicity are covered in other courses, the course also touches on other topics that were new to me despite having taken ER&M courses. Part of this is the quantitative focus that is constantly maintained and sometimes isn't considered in other courses. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about race theory and explicit ways in which minorities are disadvantaged today ",
            "\u00a0I learned necessary information about race, ethnicity and immigration in the U.S. that I believe every student should be exposed to regardless of their major. ",
            "\u00a0I gained skills in writing literature reviews and reading complex texts. ",
            "\u00a0I learned some basic info about the demographics of the United States and some interesting facts about the history of U.S. immigration. Basically, exactly what one would expect: a smattering of interesting facts about a wide range of topics related to Ethnicity, Race, and Immigration. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Kao was a wonderful professor. Her class had a unique interdisciplinary approach to sociology and ER&M. It was the perfect balance of both. She tackled on a wide breadth of topics and the readings chosen were iconic. One of my favorite classes at Yale. "

            "\u00a0Great class! The only suggest would be for the lectures to touch on things that the readings do not mention. ",
            "\u00a0Great use of videos and media to portray ideas! And use of actual statistical data to demonstrate concepts. ",
            "\u00a0Though the material is great, the presentation of the material is the same day-in and day-out. It's a lecture, so that's to be expected, but Dr. Kao is not the best lecturer, which can make a 50 minute class feel like it's dragging. She also has a no computer policy, but speeds through notes to quickly for them to be written down. Furthermore, in the first half of the class, she posted only a fraction of the notes online. ",
            "\u00a0The course was interesting, relevant, and engaging. Our class size was smaller than usual, but it allowed for a more personal take and feedback. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Good introduction to sociological course for people who have no background in sociology. Good, clear presentation of information. Demanding coursework in reading, but manageable.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: late timing during the day, (4:30-5:20). ",
            "\u00a0I believe the strengths of this course was that it really is based on solely exploring issues so that students can discuss them. The class is not based on memorization, instead it is meant for us to formulate our open ideas and opinions on modern issues. As for weaknesses, I believe if the class had more of a seminar style it could be more effective in getting us to think critically. ",
            "\u00a0I wish it was more discussion-based ",
            "\u00a0I loved the wide range of material covered that was always paired with some sort of visual support (i.e. films, charts, graphs) ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: helps to develop skills for literature reviews\r\nWeaknesses: a lot of difficult readings ",
            "\u00a0The readings for this class were interesting (or at least, their content was-- as a non-sociology major, I found actually getting through the papers to be a slog, but ultimately worth it.) However, this class was missing the next level of analysis. Lectures were often a regurgitation of the readings, so that you didn't really have to do the readings to get the pertinent information. The class didn't ask students to make critical connections across readings and felt very surface level. "

            "\u00a0Yes! It's an intro course to many contemporary challenges that face the U.S., from immigration to education and the criminal justice system. It draws on history, sociology, and the law. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I learned about the immigrant experience in ways that, even as a child of immigrants, I'd never thought about before. I have a greater understanding of how the U.S. population is made up of the immigrants it currently has. I also learned more about the different facets of the Asian identity, which I was grateful for since, even as an Asian-American, I'd never studied it before. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah I would. The material itself is the class' biggest selling point, and in an ideal world, all Yale students would know these things. But as a class, it's pretty average. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course. Even if you don't plan on majoring in Sociology, ER&M, or Education Studies, it is an interesting and useful subject matter. The workload is manageable and you get valuable feedback when necessary. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I found this course both interesting and I recieced a lot from this class. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely would recommend this class because it is a class based on the student worrying about exploring ideas and opinions rather than worrying about concrete details. ",
            "\u00a0YES. Professor Kao is an amazing teacher; she is an obvious expert in her field, yet she makes learning accessible and interesting. Learning about issues and challenges affecting immigrant populations can be difficult, but it can simultaneously be intriguing and fulfilling. It covers a wide range of topics but the readings are kept focused on key questions rather than being too ambitious or heavy. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, sort of a gut, still interesting though ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course - it gives a very accurate description of the immigration and race patterns in America throughout history, helping me to understand how the current state of the country in those areas came to be. ",
            "\u00a0Yes because it teaches you about how the fields of race, ethnicity and immigration intersect with one another. ",
            "\u00a0I wouldn't recommend this class to students who don't need it for a requirement. I think you would be served just as well by doing some of the readings on your own. "
