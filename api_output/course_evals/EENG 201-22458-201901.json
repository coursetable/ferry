            "\u00a0Its pretty tough to answer this question when I learned so little in this class. I think the class was about computer engineering, but I can only know for certain because thats what the name of the class is. You know, I try to be a really good student and attend all the lectures (which I did), but I honestly think attending lectures somehow made me understand the material less. Its something about the way that Jakub teaches that your ears will register that words are coming out of his mouth, but when youre rushing to write whatever gibberish hes scribbling, your brain just refuses to accept anything. One skill I did develop in this class was refining my youtube search engine skills because I soon realized that the only way Id possibly survive in the class was through the gods on youtube who somehow teach computer engineering better than a paid professor who runs an electrical engineering at Yale, a supposedly elite research institute. \r\n\r\nIf this class is meant to smother the dreams of yale engineers and make them change majors, then I think it could be considered a success. If, I dont know just throwing this out there, this class was supposed to be an intro class to get people excited about engineering majors, than it whiffed harder than a 3rd grader playing T-ball. ",

            "\u00a0This course was really enjoyable. I thought labs were super fun and interesting except for the credit card lab which was monotonous for no reason. The only critique I have of the course is that it moved really slow in lecture. Often Jakub would look for class participation when class participation wasn't really necessary and it took up a lot of class time because people didn't want to answer despite knowing the answer. Also our psets wouldn't be sent out until Monday night but were due on Fridays instead of Monday. This odd schedule caused students to ask for an extension on like every single assignment for the whole semester and those extensions were almost always granted to the entire class instead of just having psets due weekly on Monday (a week after they are assigned). ",
            "\u00a0The lectures did not really help me learn the material. They were sometimes hard to follow. I learned more from doing the problem sets and from the weekly labs (which I enjoyed a lot). ",
            "\u00a0The lab sessions were very fun and I learnt a lot from them. However, some of the course material was not well explained in class, and it took me a significant amount of work outside the class to fully understand what was going on. ",
            "\u00a0Some of the lectures were boring and the professor did not teach us how to use the coding languages which made the assignments much harder. ",
            "\u00a0We definitely needed more time than planned for the LED cube lab and the soda machine lab. Also, one TA was unhelpful for the LED cube and kept us behind for a week or two by giving us wrong information. The PSETs were okay, but occasionally felt long and tedious. The first take home midterm was VERY long and tedious, the second one was better but still long. With the first one, I basically gave up my entire weekend doing it and it got me behind on my other classes. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: ULAs and TAs were verily helpful, plenty of opportunities to finish labs outside of lab section if not done, Professor was flexible and provided the class more than enough time to complete assignments.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: labs could be time consuming, lecture notes were not very descriptive (did not contain thorough instructions or step by step examples well explained in writing), professor office hours only by request ",
            "\u00a0It was a great course.  I would only suggest that certain aspects of labs (such as manually reading credit card data) be eliminated because they added no educational value and took a great deal of time. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course is Mr. Szefer and the accessibility of the course material. One weakness of this course was the lack of help during labs with the projects. ",
            "\u00a0Im just going to be blunt. There are no strengths of this course. Maybe the one strength was the community of peers that was built out of utter hatred of the weekly problem sets and labs that were just ridiculous. It wasnt even the type of hard that helps you learn it was the type of hard that basically meant you had to beg the ULAs to help you step by step with the questions. \r\n\r\nTheres certainly a treasure trove of weaknesses, so buckle up. Lets start with the lectures: utterly useless, didnt learn a single thing. Next, the homeworks: a third of the questions were copied from the lecture slides so you wouldnt learn anything, the other third would literally take 2 hours of writing 0s and 1s over and over, and the other third were so hard that once the ULA showed us Jakubs old answers and then Jakub literally said they were wrong. Perhaps worst of all are the GOD AWFUL LABS. Theres literally nothing more depressing than having to go in weekly to lab for 2.5 hours at 7pm on a Tuesday (actually maybe the class as a whole was worse but). Our first lab consisted of copying zeros and ones by hand for 4 hours, the next lab featured equipment that didnt work thanks to the incompetence of the TAs, and the following 3 were all done in Verilog, the worst programming in the language that was taught in one of the worst fashions possible (i.e. not at all, we were thrown in the deep end with our hands tied to our feet and expected to survive) ",
            "\u00a0The course was okay; it could have gone into more about how computers. ",
            "\u00a0This course is awful. The lectures are useless, as are the TAs. What we learn is taught so terribly that even if it had been on the stuff we actually needed to know for the problem sets it wouldnt have helped. The Psets are long tedious and unhelpful, and Jakub never even remotely taught us how to do them. Had he not had ULAs to teach the class for him his students would have all dropped it. Far too much was expected of us for an intro level class, and Jakub often referenced concepts we hadn't learned yet when trying to teach us those very same concepts. This course sucks. ",
            "\u00a0The material for the labs was super interesting. Unfortunately, I found that the actual lab work was rather busy work (such as reading the hundreds of 1s and 0s for the credit card reader). I really enjoyed the content I learned from lab, just shorten the amount of busy work required. The Verilog tutorial was super helpful, but add more intermediate projects before jumping right to the soda machine. I needed more practice before doing such a large project. Finally, the first take home midterm was incredibly long (25+ hrs). The second take home midterm was more manageable. The final was manageable in the time allotted. Consider having 2 hour in person midterms on a Tuesday night instead of lab. This would enhance learning and I think you can consolidate the same learning material into a 2-3 hour slot. This would then require studying and internalization of the material. ",
            "\u00a0Verilog was a big issue for me, personally, because I didn't have the time to teach it to myself the hardware description language. The psets asked us to Google a lot, which some people seemed to enjoy, but I personally did not. I would have preferred if the prof would have taught the material. Some of the questions on the pset were also bizarre - like the time we had to hand-draw a multiplier. ",
            "\u00a0I feel that if there were more examples of the topics in the lecture notes it would have made homework assignments easier to complete outside of going to office hours. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Szefer often just went over the slides at rapid speed, and did little to pause or clarify the many, many concepts he covered. I wish either less topics were covered, or the professor could have made sure to connect every concept together. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a MESS. I don't understand how Szefer has been teaching it for several years and still hasn't figured out the right way to teach it. ",
            "\u00a0It's a solid intro course, if a little mechanical at times (although I suppose you need to do those things to get them out of the way) "

            "\u00a0Yeah I really enjoyed this class. I thought lab was the best part because we got to make some really cool hands on projects. I also learned a ton about digital systems and learned that that is what I want to focus on in EE. The class is pretty slow moving in lecture and kind of poorly organized (we always got extensions because assignments never quite worked right/were assigned right) and it was a pretty easy A -- not sure what that means as far as the quality of the course, but something to consider. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I learned a lot and the labs are very interesting ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I learnt a lot about the basic components of computers, and it helped fill in some knowledge gaps I had. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would, keep up with all the information and youll be fine! ",
            "\u00a0If youre interested in the material, take it. The labs are the best/coolest part of the course. Also required for EE/EECS, so if youre thinking about the major take it. But if youre not a fan of the class, please dont let it scare you away, the upper division electives are interesting ",
            "\u00a0YES! It's Amazing ",
            "\u00a0Labs were very interesting and out of the box, interesting content covered in the classes. Due to how time consuming the class is, I wouldnt recommend to people if outside their major. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course because the professor and the material were both great. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is a great start in computer hardware. ",
            "\u00a0Haha. No. But it doesnt matter because if you think youre interested in EE youre going to take it no matter how badly I review this class, arent you? Well I was just the same way, so buckle up for the worst class of your life. Im so sorry. ",
            "\u00a0No. Looking at the description of this course four months ago I was genuinely confused at the low reviews of this course, because the subject material seemed so interesting. Now I know better. Yale takes fascinating science and turns it to shit. Do not take this course unless you absolutely have to. ",

            "\u00a0If you have to take it, then I guess you have no other choice. I say this because I knew some people who tried taking this class for fun, but did not find it fun by any means. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student to study the basics of computer engineering. Even though the course workload could be improved, it is still a decent class to learn about logic and processors. ",
            "\u00a0No, unless you're majoring in EE. I thought I'd enjoy it as a CS major, but it turned me off to EE so quickly. ",
            "\u00a0If you like computers or engineering or both, and want to check out some EE, give it a shot. "
