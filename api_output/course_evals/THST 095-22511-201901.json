            "\u00a0I learned so much about the pragmatic and theoretical questions faced when writing and producing a new play in contemporary American theaters! After speaking with professionals who were brought to this class, and after really engaging with my peers on a deep level, I feel much more equipped to be a theatre-maker going forward. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the process of developing new plays in America. Specifically, I learned about the where (i.e. new play incubators, writers' residencies, off-Broadway programs), the when (i.e. how long the process is and what happens when), and the how (i.e. how plays change via talkbacks, director's feedback, etc.). I learned about the core elements of dramatic writing and what it takes to create a successful play, and I developed the skills for how to analyze plays with the creative process and potential changes in mind. ",
            "\u00a0I gained insight into a very niche creative industry and I got to read some great plays and talk to awesome people! ",
            "\u00a0This class can be split into three main categories or skills. \r\nFirst, we have a weekly presentation where students present on a topic related to theatre. This includes different companies around the US, play development festivals, prominent fellowship programs, etc. With this information, students can see the mechanisms behind play development and how they function and intersect around the country.\r\nSecond, we read out of the book The Art of Dramatic Writing, which provides information on breaking plays down into their internal mechanisms. It teaches students how to write a play by focusing on character, plot structure, conflict, premise, etc. As we read each play, we put all of the play's information into these terms to understand what is successful about the play's structure and what has room for development.\r\nLastly, we read plays, often in their early drafts and then in completed drafts. Conversations usually stem around what changed between the pieces, what we liked/didn't like, and where we see the play going. We often compare week to week between plays, trying to understand how one play succeeds in comparison to another. \r\nAnother really amazing thing this class entails are visits from artists attached to the plays we read and trips to New York to see the shows we read. We met several playwrights, actors, directors, among others who could provide insight into the development process and the piece as a whole. And, by seeing the shows live, we could see further development from page to stage. ",
            "\u00a0I gained the skills to analyze new plays from a lot of different perspectives- director, playwright, and actor. ",
            "\u00a0This course opened up a new artistic world to me. I had read plays and even performed in a few of them, but this class taught me so so much about modern American theater. I learned about incubators, festivals, workshops and their respective processes. Now I better understand the development process from a playwrights and directors perspective. We also heard from the best in the business: Pulitzer Prize-nominated playwrights, Broadway actors, and more cake in to tell us about their life paths and artistic trajectories. Incredible experience. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about various playwriting labs, the process of developing a play from professionals who came to speak to us such as Sarah DeLappe and Ming Peiffer, and about foundational principles for writing a play according to Lajos Egri's \"The Art of Dramatic Writing.\" "
        ],

            "\u00a0This course was absolutely phenomenal. One of its greatest strengths was in the depth of discussion facilitated by Professor Brooks, and the caliber of playwrights, actors, and directors who were brought to us. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked that we got to go on field trips and meet special guestssince this class very much had to do with something practical and happening in the present, it was really helpful to connect what we were learning to how it applies in the real world. Something that I struggled with was that the theory book we used, The Art of Dramatic Writing by Lajos Egri, is pretty outdated and thus, I felt, didn't really apply to a lot of the plays that we read, many of which were quite new and broke away from traditional dramatic form. ",
            "\u00a0This is a good class. \r\nI loved the readings and I love how we learn by osmosis + exposure, and I love the awesome opportunities of this class: comparing early to late drafts, bringing in playwrights and actors and directors. I think it would be worth spending an extra week to read all of Angels in America, but I understand that the timetable is tricky. \r\nThis is a class that it is pretty easy to not do a lot of work in. But if you want to get something out of the class, you absolutely can, by thoroughly reading and participating. \r\nOrganizing the midterm and final presentations is difficult; it would be great if Hal could give us a mock presentation. I'm also not entirely sure how I feel about relying so totally on the concept of Egri and the dramatic premise; are there other interpretations of how plays work and dramatic writing as a whole? Sometimes fitting something into one premise felt like a stretch. ",
            "\u00a0The course has several strengths. First, the material on the syllabus constantly blew myself and my classmates away. Even outside of class, we often found ourselves talking exclusively about the plays. Also, by having the special guests visit the class and by seeing the shows live, there was always something new to look forward to. Furthermore, the class only meets once a week, but we posted throughout the week on Canvas's discussion tab, keeping the conversation going even during the long break between classes. Finally, this course only had eight students, and it was the perfect size for the intent of the course. I deeply loved all of the other students at the end of the semester because everyone put their heart and opinions on the line during the entire semester. This was aided by the trips to New York and Hal's teaching style, and it really paid off.\r\nIn terms of weaknesses, the only thing that comes to mind is the midterm and final structure. To be evaluated, we were required to write a paper and do an oral presentation on a play. Although this was a really great way to see someone's entire opinion on a work, it often took much, much longer than the time we had. Like more than an hour over class long. I think that there could be a much better way to enforce the time and to encourage students to consolidate their ideas. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the guest speakers (playwrights, directors, and actors) were a highlight of this class. It's amazing to read so many great plays and then have the people who wrote or worked on them come in to answer our questions and give us more insight into the development process. I also LOVED our class trip to New York to see Hillary and Clinton. This class is just so much of an experience and you become so bonded to Hal and the other students! Weaknesses: none! ",
            "\u00a0I only wish that we could have had more than just one class a week. Theres so much more to read and discuss. ",
            "\u00a0Because it was seminar-style, everyone's voice was heard and there was space for constant reflection. Also, since we were reading plays that were in the process of being developed or already being performed, there was always an opportunity to see them on the stage, which I feel like brought so much life to the class. No weaknesses. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I would enthusiastically recommend this course to another student! Professor Brooks taught me so much, the seminar setting really encouraged us to develop our individual voices, and the plays we read provoked so much interesting discussion. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would if they are interested in theatre, but probably not to a layman student, because the course is quite niche and would only be of interest to people who are already quite passionate about contemporary plays. ",
            "\u00a0I would fully recommend this to any student who wants to enter any kind of theater-related career, whether as a dramaturg, a writer, a director, an actor, a stage manager, etc. This is a great introduction to a very niche industry and the class itself is a blast, and it gives you the opportunity to make wonderful connections. However, for a student not studying drama, it might be worthwhile, but might be a bit too niche. There should be classes like this for other industries: independent music, contemporary visual art, etc. The theater department is very lucky they get Hal! ",
            "\u00a0Literally YES! \r\nThis was my favorite class of the semester, and I always found myself thinking about discussions, plays, ideas between classes. It just so happened that several of my friends were in the class with me, and we brought up the class every time we saw each other. Which is quite frequently. \r\nThese are also some of the best plays I've read in a really long time. One after another after another. Hal knows good plays, and he also knows how to lead discussions about them. \r\nPLUS, I got to meet so many people that I would otherwise have never met. The course has the resources to make this happen and to provide students the opportunity to go to NYC, get dinner, and really create a family within the class. And the day of the final, we all went for pizza. I mean, what a dream of a class. I am honestly sad that my schedule next semester will not include it. \r\nLastly, not only theatre people were in the class. I am a theatre major, but there were also musicians in the class too, but it seemed that everyone loved the class and could find a way into the material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes yes yes a million times yes. Even if you've NEVER done anything related to theater or don't want to be a theater studies major, you have to take this class if you find the description interesting at all. It is such an amazing experience and it will make you appreciate theater so much more. ",
            "\u00a0Wow, take this class. Hal is so enthusiastic and knowledgeable, and you get such an amazing view into the working of modern theater. You read great stuff, have awesome discussions, and have the privilege of talking with some of the biggest names in theater (and we got to go to a broadway show). This class inspired me to take more theater classes, start acting, and maybe even write a play! ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in any aspect of theatre -- whether that be playwriting, dramaturgy, acting, directing, etc. -- I highly recommend that you take this course. Especially with learning about various graduate schools and theatre workshops/laboratories, you get professional insight into the theatre world at an early stage of your career. "
