            "\u00a0I learned a lot of practical skills in this class that I will definitely put to use in individual projects in the future - mainly how to use artistic software such as Photoshop. I also learned a lot about visual art and the moving image, and the course pushed me to try more abstract things, to get away from narrative and try for pure visual work. This class was a really interesting complement to my other studies in film; taking it in conjunction with Intro to Film Studies really helped me understand different ways of creating moving images, the complexities involved with cinematic art, and the ways the two modes overlap (or don't).

            "\u00a0I liked that the course was project based. I think the only real way to learn how to make art is to do it, so getting to make animations and see how much work and consideration is involved was very valuable. I would have liked a few more in-class exercises on specific animation techniques. ",
            "\u00a0The class has projects are very open-ended which is nice for experimenting. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a great outlet to practice animation. It's greatest strength lies in allowing students to work on what they want and giving feedback to improve and grow. The greatest weakness, however, is that it is too varied in its scope. We cover all sorts of animation, from classic cartoons to really abstract styles. Because there is such a diverse array, however, it was hard to say we really learned a lot about each one. My favorite days in class were watching video lectures by the lead animator for Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, because those days it felt like we learned tangible repeatable skills. I didn't learn much from the strobe-light experiments of the 60s, and they didn't really seem like \"principles of animation\" either. This was a fun class, but I wish there had been more attention to learning the basics and foundations (i.e. a walk cycle assignment or studying and practicing how to convey weight) rather than allowing everything to be so open-ended and abstract. ",
            "\u00a0Some parts of this class was very rushed, especially towards the end. Some classes were also not as interesting as others. Strengths of this class would be the involvement of Prof. Johannes, and his dedication towards giving great feedback on project. ",
            "\u00a0We learn a lot in this class and the process of animation is very enjoyable. However, there is a heavy workload that a person who is new to animation may not realize at first. Even though I basically lived at CCAM for half a semester, I struggled to complete the assignments on time. ",
            "\u00a0strengths:\r\n1. great overview of the principles of animation\r\n2. learned a lot about different tools\r\n3. had several opportunities to create animations and try out different techniques\r\n4. loved screening different works of animation to explore different styles of animations\r\n\r\nweaknesses: \r\n1. we had a lot of work days, where the professor wasn't available during class. i would have liked to learn more from the professor, as the sessions when we were learning from him were pretty valuable\r\n2. the professor could have done a better job managing the class time, the class ran overtime very often\r\n3. i think more people could have produced better quality work if the midterm was just 20-30 seconds long. a lot of us were overwhelmed "

            "\u00a0I would recommend it to anyone interested in art or anyone who wants a class where they actually make things. It is a lot of work, however, especially at the end of the year. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would, after taking this class you get to walk away with some amazing projects and new skills. ",
            "\u00a0This course was fun, but I didn't feel that it taught us much about actually animating, other than maybe time-management. I was expecting to learn and practice more foundations and learn real tips and techniques, but many of the projects were so open-ended it was hard to focus. Instead, most learning like this had to be self-motivated, making yourself try something and improve on a project. That being said, animating is fun and it's great to have a class period to do it while also watching classic animations. My favorite classes were watching video lectures by the head animatior on Who Framed Roger Rabbit? as I actually felt I left those with tangible skills and notes. If you like animating, take it (though do be warned the midterm and final projects are long, at least 60 seconds, which is a LOT of animation). If you don't, this class probably won't convince you otherwise. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's structured the way a creative class should be. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the class was very enjoyable and I learned a lot. ",
            "\u00a0The projects for this course are a lot of work, but it depends on the finished product you want to produce. The course is really what you make of it, but you will definitely learn a lot about animation as an art and as an industry, and you will learn how to use some features of cool software. ",
            "\u00a0yes. if you want to learn about animation "
