            "\u00a0I grew in my ability to read a text and further analyze its meaning while also developing my interpretation of the topic at hand. ",
            "\u00a0In this course, I developed the ability to discuss abstract topics, to support my thoughts with textual and logical evidence, and to use sound as a means to understand the world. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the theory and practice of sound.  I engaged in challenging discussion, research, and writing that allowed me to grow as a person. ",
            "\u00a0Both my academic writing and ability to analyze and discuss complicated texts improved significantly. ",
            "\u00a0New perspectives on the concept of sound.\r\nGreater appreciation for writing. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to navigate a writing course at Yale. I also learned how to share my opinions on readings through class discussions and written work. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my writing skills and got familiar with the resources available to me at Yale. I also got a general introduction to the area of sound studies, which I am continuing to read about. "

            "\u00a0The strengths of this course include an extremely involved discussion. The readings are relavent to current events. Some of the readings were a bit too advanced, but I was able to understand the content through the class discussion. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the topic of this course, including the readings, the topics of discussion, and the videos. I found it very interesting, especially in the discussions it allowed with the rest of my classmates. This allowed us to foster a very close classroom environment, which I found integral to how much I liked the class. I think that the course would be a bit better if we received more concrete feedback on how we could improve first drafts, such as with rubrics. ",
            "\u00a0The course involved many interesting texts, projects, and discussions. I felt as though I got more out of the in class discussions than the papers though, and more discussions about writing rather than theory would have been beneficial. ",
            "\u00a0Unorganized curriculum.\r\nGreat discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Since it is an English 114, there are strict guidelines and specific areas that must be go over. It is holding the class back. ",
            "\u00a0This course's strength was how engaging it was. Almost all of the reading were very interesting and everyone's research papers were very unique. This meant the discussion was of very high quality. Sometimes, however, if the texts were too abstract or not accompanied by listening examples, the discussion was a little dry. Also, sometimes I felt that we spent too much time going over assignments. To me this issue was mainly reactionary to the first essay, which was due only a week into class, and therefore was not well-introduced. "
