            "\u00a0This course was very good at keeping the student engaged. The small class size allowed for an intimate environment and a safe zone in which we were able to practice a new language without being afraid of making mistakes. ",
            "\u00a0I love the interactive structure of this class. ",
            "\u00a0Last semester, my class learned predominantly straight from the textbook through a variety of reading assignments, grammar exercises, and written compositions.  While this was extremely helpful in establishing an initial grasp of the language, I did not feel confident in my speaking abilities entering this semester since they were not an area of focus last semester.  ITAL 120, however, addressed this area every single day.  The goal was clearly to acclimate students to holding and being able to carry on conversations in addition to building up our grammatical knowledge.  In terms of preparing my to actually use my skills in Italy to communicate effectively, this class was essential.  It is one thing to understand the theory behind the language, and other to put this knowledge to work.  This course drastically improved my confidence and comfort level with my communication skills, and it both motivated and excited me to continue my Italian language development.  My only criticism would be that it seemed to pack lots of grammatical skills into the course, and these topics cut into our speaking time.  The sheer number of topics that we pushed through made it difficult to take the necessary time to fully dwell upon and retain them ",
