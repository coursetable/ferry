            "\u00a0I learned about the various fields and sub disciplines in neuroscience as well as heard world class researchers explains their work in a relevant and concise way. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me a broad overview of current topics in fundamental neuroscience. ",
            "\u00a0I think that this course did a good job covering all of the main themes of neuroscience that are relevant to psychology/cognitive science. My knowledge of domains such as memory, decision making, as well as social and affective functions is much broader and deeper than before taking this course. ",
            "\u00a0Overview of the various neural systems related to different aspects of human cognition, behavior, emotion, or psychopathology ",
            "\u00a0This course collected together a diverse array of topics that were well taught, well motivated and interesting. I loved having different professors teach each week and thought that they worked surprisingly cohesively. I especially liked the opportunity to learn about the research of the faculty  the class has already pointed me towards a possible future collaboration. ",
            "\u00a0Some new knowledge about areas of neuroscience I did not know much about. Mostly review and quick overviews of topics in neuro. ",
            "\u00a0Basic, broad knowledge of neuroscience ",
            "\u00a0This class provided a broad overview of the principles of neuroscience, from the molecular level to systems-level. Prior to this course, I had limited formal instruction in molecular and cellular neuroscience, and this class widened my expertise of brain function and provides a broader framework from which I can approach the interpretations of my research. ",
            "\u00a0I believe that through some of the discussions and the final assignment questions I deepened my knowledge of a broad range of neuroscience topics. Further, I felt encouraged to think critically about the current state of the field and begin to brainstorm how my research could be part of taking a novel approach (fingers crossed!). "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The strength is the varied topics explored each week. It gives everyone a chance to really remember class.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness I could think is that some of the lecturers did not explain basic concepts enough and so when they went onto more difficult concepts, I more often than not got lost and couldn't follow. ",
            "\u00a0I didn't like that 100% of the course was dependent on the final. One idea would be to stagger the last 4 exam questions throughout the course at regular intervals when certain \"units\" are completed. There are pros/cons, but I liked the team-taught approach, although I wish there had been more opportunity to discuss integration. It might have been nice to have 15 minutes of each class period (or at the end of a presenter's second lecture) be devoted to Q + A with Ty about how this fits in/bigger picture stuff. It would have also been nice if discussion was fostered to a great degree. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: learning each topic from an expert in the field, the faculty, each lecture organization, the course organization;\r\nWeaknesses: having all four papers due at the same time (instead of some at midterms and some at finals) -- it would have been helpful to get feedback earlier on and also splitting up the work would have improved the quality of the four papers overall ",
            "\u00a0First of all, I think that overall this course went very well, especially considering that this was the first time it was offered and the first time in recent history running a team-taught class in the psychology department! I thought that the transition from week to week felt natural, and that there weren't any big gaps in any particular topic left uncovered. I also thought that (for the most part), the level of detail and rigor was pretty consistent from week to week. A few opinions/suggestions for future years:\r\n\r\n1) I really did not like having the final exam count for 100% of the grade. It made for an unnecessarily busy and stressful week of finals, and it felt like all of the work for the class was put off until the very end without any real opportunity for feedback. I feel strongly that trying to do 4 separate, hurried literature searches in a short time and flicking through class notes/slides from weeks or months before is not conducive to learning. That being said, my suggestion would be to release each \"bin\" after those topics have been covered, and then leave students one week or so to pick a question and answer it. That way, the work is spread out into 4 manageable chunks throughout the semester, and students have a chance to consolidate their knowledge and get feedback while the material is fresh. \r\n\r\n2) I may be in a minority here, but I would have enjoyed a larger discussion component to the class. I was definitely the most engaged during Arielle Baskin-Sommers' lecture, because she paused multiple times to ask questions and elicit student questions/comments. I also think that Arielle's lecture style in general was the most effective, in particular outlining what she wants students to gain from the lecture, starting with a general overview of each topic and then building on it with empirical examples, stopping for discussion before moving on to a new topic, and inviting students to try and tie the topic to their own research. BJ Casey and Molly Crockett followed a similar approach, and I learned and still remember the most from those three lectures. \r\n\r\n3) Building on the above point, I think that each lecture should start with a brief overview of the topic that they were discussing (building on the textbook) before jumping into empirical examples. Lectures that only went through study after study without a lower-level explanation were hard for me to follow, especially if I knew next to nothing about that topic to begin with! ",
            "\u00a0Having a variety of different lecturers teach the class was highly helpful, as each lecturer was an expert in the field they taught and was, therefore, able to speak to their topics very well.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of the class is the same as every survey class.  While each topic was discussed at length and in detail, anyone who was actually interested in that subject (and even many who were not) would likely have already known most of the content discussed in the class.  In contrast, those who are not actively interested in the topics at hand might have had difficulty engaging with the lecture, particularly since the class was almost exclusively lecture with little to no discussion.  The end result being that many students are really only engaged in a select handful of the lectures, while many of the other lectures were either too superficial or too tangential. At least, this was my experience, and, based on my discussions with others students in the class, I believe that this would likely be true for most/all older graduate students (i.e., non-first years), particularly students with any kind of neuro background or research focus. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nMultiple lecturers\r\nFocus on knowledge transmission\r\nInteresting topics\r\nSometimes professors took the class as a soapbox to zoom out. These were the best parts.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nSometimes the scopes were too narrow, in the weeds. Conversely, sometimes they were sometimes too broad and just rehashed an intro psych class. The middle ground was best. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: many professors were involved in teaching the class, which gave students the opportunity to engage in conversation with the excellent faculty at Yale and learn from different teaching styles. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: low emphasis on discussion translated to lower engagement from students. The depth covered by different professors greatly varied which made this class difficult to follow. Biggest weakness: the final exam being all at the end with no opportunity for improvement made this class more difficult.\r\n\r\nWay to improve: The course could be structured so that the course director (Ty Cannon) gives one lecture a week (which the guest lecturer attends) and the guest lecturer gives the other. That way, the overview section is covered with the same level of depth to get everyone on the same page, and the guest lecturer can cover recent studies etc. ",
            "\u00a0Better communication between the instructors so there was a general understanding of what had been taught/not taught -- this would alleviate some gaps in knowledge or assumptions that some professors made about students' existing knowledge in the different subfields. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the team-taught format. My one suggestion for improvement would be to split up the exams: rather than have all the essays released and due at the end of the term, perhaps have half the essays due in the middle of the term, and the other half at the end. Having essays due every quarter of the semester might even be more effective at helping students learn and retain information. More frequent evaluation (whether mid- or quarter-term) would also allow students to receive feedback on their course performance before it's \"too late.\" ",
            "\u00a0Particular strengths of the class were the variety in lectures and learning about topics from leading experts in the field! It was a really unique learning opportunity and really enjoyed learning about the topics that way.\r\n\r\nTwo particular areas for growth: spreading out the assignments (not just a final that is 100% of the grade) and balancing frontier research with covering fundamentals. Several faculty members found a way to balance these two and gave outstanding lectures that I felt offered the opportunity to think deeply and engage with the material by doing so (e.g. BJ, Nick, Ty, Dylan--and others too but these lecturers in particular). For the assignments, it might be helpful to have spread out the 4 essay bins over the course of the semester instead all at once. The questions themselves were thought-provoking and by writing responses to them I learned a lot. I had fun thinking about the answers! "

            "\u00a0Yes and no. I would recommend the course to someone who has some basic neuroscience knowledge. The class' premise was introducing neuroscience to students, even without a background. Furthermore, there is no prerequisites for this class and the course description said \"open to anyone with interest in psychology and neuroscience\".\r\n\r\nI am an engineering grad student and I realize that I am not going to be proficient in some of the concepts and terminology used in these fields. However, I would suggest emphasizing to lecturers that you might have a diverse audience and therefore mold your lectures to reflect that. As mentioned above, there was some lectures were I felt completely lost due to the complexity and the lack of previous knowledge. \r\n\r\nWith that being said, lectures where professors broke down complex concepts were by far the reason why I would recommend this class. Marvin Chun and Tyrone Cannon's lectures were engaging, knowledgeable and fascinating. \r\n\r\nI understand this is the first iteration of the class, and know that the class will only get better and better. I also understand that it might be very rare to find engineering or students from other disciplines taking this class since most grad students don't really venture out much, but in my opinion it is this little details that make a class memorable and long lasting for a student. ",
            "\u00a0Yes of course! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I certainly would! It was a great opportunity to hear the department's faculty talk about topics that they are experts in/ passionate about, and I think with a few minor tweaks it will be an exceptional class. It's also great to have a neuroscience basis class in general- the psychology department is quite neuroscience-focused, and it's very helpful to have this course for background knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to first year students in the neuro/clinical/cognitive areas who are interested in neuro research (particularly if they do not have a background in neuro), and all students (regardless of year) without a background in neuro to get an overview of the field.  \r\n\r\nI would not recommend this course to any older students (2nd year or above) who has done any kind of neuro research (regardless of whether they are a neuro, cog, or clinical student) or students who came into grad school with an extensive neuro background.  For these students, I would recommend auditing any specific lectures they might be interested in, but not taking the class as a whole.  This would allow them to receive the content that is most helpful for them, while avoiding the inevitable draw backs of a survey course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes and I have done so already ",
            "\u00a0Yes, having many professors from Yale teaching is a great opportunity to engage in conversation with the excellent faculty at Yale and learn from different teaching styles. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student if they did not already have a foundation in neuroscience; for students who had previously taken neuroscience courses in undergrad, I'm not sure that this is a very useful course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0I am excited to see how this course continues to develop and would recommend this even as is since it was such a special learning opportunity to get to know several faculty members. "
