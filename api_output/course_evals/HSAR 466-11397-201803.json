            "\u00a0I learned useful information in regards to the study of conservation in art history. ",
            "\u00a0The course offers a survey to different medium and conservation approaches - it offers a solid grounding in the field of conservation. It introduces different techniques well. ",
            "\u00a0It was great to have the opportunity to work hands-on with objects from Yale Collections. It wasn't only theoretical but also practical knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0This class was such a fascinating introduction to techniques of examination and conservation. It was a pleasure to see and handle various works from Yale collections close up and to work with conservators across various departments. ",
            "\u00a0This course has a wide range of topics, so now I have a basic understanding of many different art forms. As a non-science person, it's really easy to navigate the technical terms, but I don't think I really retained the science behind things so much as what the science can tell us. I think both are valuable, though. It was nice to be able to focus on one piece of art for the second half of the semester, because you really get to know your object. I have a solid knowledge of how/why/where/etc my object was made and what research can be done to understand it. "

            "\u00a0I really liked this course! Very engaging class sessions, and it was particularly fun to get to work with an object hands-on. ",
            "\u00a0This course was terribly organized. The utilization of guest lectures was a strength of the course but NEEDS to be better coordinated. Half of the work was not returned and feedback was terrible. Expectations were unclear and structure was poor. ",
            "\u00a0At the beginning of the semester, the lectures were sometimes longer than they needed to be, if we could start working with our objects earlier in the semester it would be great. ",
            "\u00a0The content of this course made it one of my favorites at Yale. It's incredibly exciting material, and the format of the class, in theory, gives students access to unparalleled expertise across different fields of conservation. The logistics of the class, however, need to be seriously revised. Assignments should be posted before the class in which they are formally assigned so that students have time to plan for museum visits. A syllabus should be available at the beginning of the semester listing all assignments and due dates. The format of the midterm assessment should be made clear in advance so students have time to prepare. In addition, time allocated to the final project should be better organized - for instance, students working on objects that are at West Campus should be permitted to miss classes that are solely focused on objects that are in YUAG conservation. Time management could also be improved - the class trip to West Campus (which was wonderful!) ran hours over, and should have been planned for a non-class time like a Friday when students could allocate the amount of time that is actually needed for the visit. This trip could replace one class meeting. ",
            "\u00a0Technically you can choose any type object in the YUAG collection for your final project, but really this course is targeted at paintings. Choosing a painting will only make your life and writing your paper easier. Not choosing a painting is just purposefully making your life harder, and you'll be wasting class time. Every week is different for the first half of the semester is different, so you learn a lot but it's really chaotic. Each class is taught by someone different, who expects something different. It's hard to keep up with what is required of you and when and who will be grading it. The midterm is less complicated than you'd think, and it's a good set-up for the final paper. There should have been more information about and preparation for the midterm, but overall it was manageable. There is a lot of awesome preparation for the paper (if you choose a painting) and many people to help you. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses:  For the weekly writing assignments, it would be extremely helpful to have a detailed criteria (or model template) of what a great writing response looks like. "

            "\u00a0Super fun class for those interested in art history, science, and art conservation. ",
            "\u00a0No - the class is too poorly structured ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to everyone interested in art. It gives you great perspective in the field since you actually get to learn hands-on about methods and techniques in the conservation world. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This was an enjoyable course to take. "
