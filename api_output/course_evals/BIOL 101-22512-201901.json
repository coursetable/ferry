            "\u00a0Strengths: well-organized, professor Koleske is great, all information made accessible through Canvas, straightforward policies, discussion in lecture\r\nWeaknesses: course moves fast so prior knowledge/AP Biology are in a way prerequisites to really do well, no feedback on homework unless you do well on an assignment ",
            "\u00a0This course is very well organized. The weekly quizzes, though tedious and perhaps a little stressful, were critical for me in keeping up with the material which made the overall learning process a lot smoother. I do think, however, that the material covered in class was sometimes explained poorly so that without a prior background in biology, it would be difficult to keep up. ",
            "\u00a0Weekly quizzes are a great way to ensure that everyone is studying/learning/mastering the material at roughly the same rate throughout the duration of the course. The only weakness of this course was that quizzes, which make up over a third of the grade for the course, were handed out willy-nilly in a large auditorium 5 minutes before class every Monday, and students would continue to look at their notes/electronic devices after having received their quiz. Students were encouraged to write their names on the front of the quiz and circle their section number then flip the quiz over, but many would scan the first page of the quiz and then look up something in their notes or online. There may not be a solution to this other than ensuring that everyone puts everything away before any quizzes are handed out. ",
            "\u00a0I think the weekly quizzes are great because they helped enforce the content and did not make studying for the final that hard. ",
            "\u00a0This course was taught very well, but at some points it was difficult to understand what was important to remember and what wasn't.  I really enjoyed learning very specific mechanisms of the body to illustrate larger concepts, but I also found it difficult to study for quizzes sometimes because it was unclear in how much detail we needed to know certain facts. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of the course is the many opportunities for students to show what they have learned through the combination of quizzes, homework, and discussion sections. A weakness is the large size of the lecture can make it less engaging, although Professor Koleske was a good lecturer and always kept students involved in the lectures. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the organization with the study guides and lecture slides - made it very clear what to study, what to bring to each class. What could be improved would be having less quizzes. I liked having the quizzes because it forced me to keep up with studying, but maybe bi-weekly instead of weekly would be nice, because I was constantly stressed about biology. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, the course is very well-organized, with the grading divided into many areas, and the discussion sections helping to emphasize concepts that come up over and over again. The weekly quizzes keep you on your toes. The homework did the same but didn't seem to quite match the lectures; sometimes we'd learn the relevant material after completing the homework. The provided powerpoints are very clear and not too overwhelming. Sometimes it felt like class was mostly just reading what was on the slides though. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very organized, and the logistics were explicitly stated at the beginning. For example, I liked having the slides for the lecture available before the class so that I could print them out and take notes on them. The professor was engaging and made learning biology fun! I don't think there are any major weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course was that we were given much help and advice in terms of how to succeed in this class, including how to stay on track. A weakness was the lack of interaction between the Professor and students in the class (but that goes for all lecture courses). Also, the weekly quizzes were worth so little points that they were very stressful, and making a small mistake could bring our grade down dramatically. ",
            "\u00a0I wish this course could be taught in a smaller setting, I found it hard to learn in the lecture environment. ",
            "\u00a0I felt that material was briefly brushed over and that  the course emphasized breadth over depth. For me, the course was manageable because I had taken AP bio in the past, but without that background I think it would have substantially more challenging. For example, the class spent a few minutes discussing super important topics like signal transduction and transmembrane transport, and while we were never required to know more than what was covered for the tests, I felt like the course wasn't touching on a lot of critical topics in detail. By that I mean more of the specific step by step reaction mechanics of biological processes. ",
            "\u00a0I generally felt like this course was not always flexible with student needs. By having quizzes at the beginning of class, the majority of my chem class would have to pack up early and leave as my teacher still taught because otherwise we'd receive a zero in the quiz in biology. The could have made the classes closer together or added more travel flexibility. Same issue with my discussion section-just like every single person in the class, we are all taking chemistry. Therefore we have 10 minutes to get to the other side of campus (from science hill to old campus) otherwise we get a zero, thereby encouraging people to skip chemistry or leave early. I thought that many things were considered 'policy' to justify being unfair and unflexible about things such as not posting powerpoint slides from discussion sections. I think there should be a removal of 'policy' to make things more enjoyable and fun for students. I liked the material being taught and it made me interested in biology, but I think this course should be taught as 3 shorter classes per week because I completely zoned out after the first 40 minutes because it is so densely packed with information. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths\r\n- Biol peer tutoring helped answer PSET\r\n- all the extra enrichment readings provided to offer a different perspective on topics \r\n- professor was funny\r\n- enrichment with Professor Lin was amazing\r\n\r\nWeakness\r\n- lectures were sometimes boring ",
            "\u00a0I was often confused in lecture but the daily quizzes really helped keep me on track. Enrichment was the most rewarding experience. Everyone, from the peer tutors to Prof. Koleske and Professor Lin, were very approachable and really cared about their students. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are the peer tutors and I thought they did a good job of going further into the topics that were presented in lecture. One of the ways this course could be improved is offering more convenient times for office hours and peer tutors. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very well organized and I am quite happy with it. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: great lecturer, good discussion groups, weekly quizzes\r\nWeaknesses: fast and hard to keep up with sometimes ",
            "\u00a0The course is taught well and is a good introduction/review into biochemical foundations as well as a good introductory course to the biology sequence. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very well paced. The instructors made sure that the students were able to follow the material and did not make assumptions about the students' prior knowledge. Lectures were interactive, which engaged students and also acted as a benchmark for their understanding in real time. One improvement could be the use of a 'clicker' app, like poll-everywhere, to make lecture even more engaging. A criticism of the course is that the connections between the concepts were not apparent until the very end of the class. It is hard to continually tie together a broad introductory course, but I think that if this were achievable, students would learn better, as they would have to keep recalling old concepts when learning new concepts, instead of learning them in isolation. This will both make it easier to learn new material and to better understand the past material. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were generally engaging, but sometimes went very quickly. The quizzes were often stressful and hard to do under a time crunch, but they let me keep up with the material. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very well-organized, teaching was clear, expectations were clear\r\nWeaknesses: none ",
            "\u00a0The class was very structured and organized. The slides were sometimes a bit confusing to understand but still pretty organized. ",
            "\u00a0I come from an under resourced high school that wasn't necessarily a STEM heavy school and a lot of the material that was covered assumed that everyone had AP biology understanding when I very much did not that. I wish there could have been a BIOL 100 or something to help combat this but it was very difficult and the enrichment session was at an inconvenient time for me, ",
            "\u00a0Generally, the discussion sections would have been more valuable if they were held before the homework deadline. I had section on Thursday, and homework was due on Wednesday. My peers in earlier sections had gained knowledge (for example, the paper on DNA application) that helped them complete their homework assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Koleske was good, lots of resources to do well, etc.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I always forgot that Piazza was there. Also, why is the Bio Sequence split up like this? It does not make sense. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The powerpoints were exceptional, the quizzes and exam were very fair, it was taught in an engaging way, and it was very very interesting\r\nWeaknesses: I honestly can't think of any ",

            "\u00a0Yes! If you've taken AP bio before, this course won't be hard at all. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if it is a prerequisite. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because it gives a very brief but comprehensive review of biochemistry and biophysics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Koleske was amazing and bio was very interesting. I though I was going to hate the class but ended up having a new interest. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student wanting to improve their basic knowledge of biology. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course. Its engaging and interesting, difficult, but manageable. ",
            "\u00a0This course is required for many majors and career paths but is by no means a boring requisite. The class is taught in an engaging way and help is available everywhere. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This class is mostly painless and a great introduction to biology. ",
            "\u00a0I keep track of how much time I put into all my classes. I did 22 hours of work outside of class for for this class, which is about the same as I did for gen chem up until this point. If you have taken AP Bio you will have at least heard of most of the concepts in this class before. It gave me more confident about my understanding of the material. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in learning more about Biology, or if you plan to major in MCDB or MB&B, then you should take this course. You learn a lot in just 6 weeks, and you'll be happy to have a greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms that are happening inside of us right now, as well as information about HIV/AIDS and our immune system. if you have any interest in Bio and want to see if it's something you may want to pursue, take this class with Prof Koleske. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. The class was well lectured, very organized and the content was very interesting. The class provided a great introduction to biochemistry and biophysics and touched upon a wide range of topics. ",
            "\u00a0if you really need to ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Biology 101 is a great way to step into STEM at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed this course, but a lot of my friends didn't and had weekly panics about the quizzes. I would hesitate to recommend taking this if it isn't a requirement, but I do think it's a good course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course as it is a prerequisite to a lot of classes ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course was a great intro to biology and quite interesting. It is not too much to manage at all. "
