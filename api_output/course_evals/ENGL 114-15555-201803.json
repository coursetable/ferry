            "\u00a0I learnt to write papers and cite sources. I gained new enjoyment for reading and writing and discovered a confidence in my writing which I did not think I would ever find. ",
            "\u00a0I gained more experience in writing college essays, which was beneficial for my transition into college. I also learned how to think about sound and listening in ways I would have never thought of before. ",
            "\u00a0I gained an in-depth understanding of how sound and music are interwoven in society. This class is especially interesting to musicians. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about how to write essays with close reading. How to analyze sound and how to understand society's perception of sound through cultural lenses, sexual tones and political actions. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my critical/close reading skills, as many of the readings were abstract and challenging but very unique and interesting nevertheless. Also began learning the basics of writing a college level paper, developing a strong, argumentative claim, and supporting that claim with sufficient and compelling evidence. ",
            "\u00a0I learned better writing skills and also gained knowledge of how to analyze music across genres. ",
            "\u00a0This course really provided me with an outlet to express my love for music and the importance that music has in my life. I was able to contextualize music in a variety of ways and think very critically about music's interplay with different aspects of culture, personal identity, and society. I analyzed the role that music plays in people's lives in ways that I had never considered prior to taking this course, and it really opened my eyes to the importance of music in so many different aspects of life. I also feel like my writing skills improved throughout the course; I learned how to fully analyze a particular quote or portion of a reading, leaving no stone unturned, and communicating my ideas very clearly to a reader through my writing. ",
            "\u00a0I became a better writer by learning incorporating various techniques of warranting, argumentation creation, source collection, and etc. Furthermore, origins behind music and sound became a fascinating topic of discussion - especially when analyzing the themes behind cryptic lyricism. This is also the most that I've written in any evaluation,, long story short, I learned a ton about writing and this class will help my future at Yale and beyond. ",
            "\u00a0I learned that I would need to work on my time-management enable to succeed in my college career by not putting essays until the last minute. ",
            "\u00a0I strengthened my use of evidence analysis and warrants. Though I still struggle with cohesiveness and developing a specific thesis, I learned how important it was to invest time into revising drafts so that my argument can come off stronger, and more clear. This course also strengthened my listening skills and allowed me to think critically about the role of music and sound in society. "

            "\u00a0The discussions were very interesting. The course deviated off its intended material enough to be interesting, but still stuck to the syllabus fairly rigorously. Sometimes the deadlines were a little intimidating, with a decrease in grade if an essay was a day late. Although some deadlines are necessary, this system is perhaps not the best for encouraging writing. Perhaps a better system would be that an late submissions would make an A impossible, but beyond that, a B or B+ would not at all be affected. This would mean that to deadlines would have to be met in order to get a high grade, but getting a good grade would be possible regardless. I think this is a problem with ENGL 114 in general, and our professor was very encouraging of our writing in general. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the course matter is interesting, especially if youre a musician and/or have a deep appreciation for music, the readings are not too heavy which is nice, the class atmosphere is chill which makes for good discussions \r\nWeaknesses: a little disorganized. Due dates would change a lot and we never really stuck to the readings ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that the class discusses fascinating topics and has deep discussions about the readings assigned. A weakness would be the timeline of writing essays  sometimes it felt a little rushed to write a paper. ",
            "\u00a0There were many times where we explored sound through creative projects that used students' talents and applied them. I really enjoyed how the course supplemented the usage of short essays rather than just books. ",
            "\u00a0Always had very engaging and insightful discussions in the classroom. It was very fascinating to hear each student's perspectives and thoughts on the readings, as there was always a lot of information to unpack. I wish more time had been spent in class covering the specifics of how to write a strong paper, particularly a strong claim. A lot of times the feedback I received was something like \"You need to craft a stronger argument/claim,\" but I always struggled to figure out how I could actually strengthen my claim/ask a better research question. ",
            "\u00a0The class was well laid-out, but the standardized English 114 curriculum got in the way sometimes. ",
            "\u00a0This was truly one of the best classes that I have EVER taken!!! This course explored a variety of facets of music in both the past and the present, and we were able to analyze the relationship of music and different parts of culture and society - including personal expression, technological development, and commercialization and economic dependence - in a wonderful setting. Every single discussion we had in class, whether they related to readings or the music we all brought in over the course of the semester, was really great because I always felt like I could say my opinion without fear of judgment or being \"incorrect\" and I learned a lot from my classmates and Rasheed. It was really interesting to see the ways that my classmates and I differed in terms of our interpretation of the readings and the meanings underlying the course material, since it really highlighted how music manifests itself differently to every person and we all attribute different meanings and levels of importance to music in our own lives. The class was formatted in a way that anyone, regardless of their level of musical background, could get a lot out of the material, the discussions, and the class as a whole. I loved how interactive this course was. Every student had a chance to bring in a song of their choice into class, where everyone would listen to it and discuss it in detail afterwards, which I personally loved because I got to learn a lot about my classmates and their tastes in music, as well as how they interpreted the same song in different ways. This combined with the way that this class revolved around class discussions greatly facilitated my learning and embracing of the material. All of the readings were so interesting, and the papers were very enjoyable for me to write because I could explore my own ideas about music and its meanings in different contexts; I never felt like I was doing work in this class because I enjoyed learning about everything presented and I felt like I had the freedom to articulate my own ideas and interpretations about music's importance in the world, and I felt like I could explore the questions that I had about music without having requirements imposed on me. This class always was the highlight of my Mondays and Wednesdays; I was always really excited to come to class and I was often disappointed when the clock hit 3:45 and class had to end. This course never failed to brighten my day and put me in a better mood for the rest of the day. This class really solidified the importance that music has in my life and I really wouldn't change anything about my experience in this class. This was definitely my favorite class that I took this semester and one of the best classes I have ever taken, both here at Yale and throughout my academic career prior to college! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: class discussion, explanations of new material, topic selection, a lot.\r\nWeaknesses: N/A ",
            "\u00a0I think everything could be improved but I don't know what about this course I would improve. I felt I had a pretty low engagement in this class but that was because I was admittedly a little intimidated by my fellow classmates and didn't really feel like sharing. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very engaging and class discussions were also consistently insightful. Even when some course readings were less interesting than others, we could see how all the concepts and materials related to each other. In other words, I could see the value and meaning in every thing that we read/listened to. I also really enjoyed the sound presentations at the beginning of each class. One thing that could improve was staying consistent with the syllabus or adjusting the syllabus at the beginning so that it accurately reflects what we will be covering in class. ",
            "\u00a0This course's main strength was its emphasis on discussion-based analyses. Students were able to openly voice their ideas about the readings or their reactions to the music and explore areas of intellectual interest. We were able to share musical pieces with each other and even go on sound walks to understand acousmatic listening. The peer feedback sessions were also very helpful in developing our papers. As for weaknesses, some of the readings were abstract and lacked a sense of relevance. I feel like we discussed musical tangents in such depth and specificity that it was hard to see how it all came together, leading to very open-prompt finals that could have used more direction. "

            "\u00a0Yes. This was a great course for people who have not written in a while and who would like to ease themselves back into it. ",
            "\u00a0It was a fun course and a good way to meet other musicians and first-Years, as well as get a writing credit. It could be boring at times, but it was overall pretty interesting and the essays were fun to write, and so was the final project. ",
            "\u00a0Yes  regardless of whether they are a musician are not, I would recommend this course to any Yale student because of the fascinating material discussed in the class. Readings by Attali, Chion, Berland, McClary, and listening to passages of music by artists from Tchaikovsky to Kendrick Lamar provides a solid foundation to the understating the breath and variety of music in the world. ",
            "\u00a0Yes this course takes a look at sound that no course exposes you too. I really enjoy how we explored sound through politics, gender roles, music industry and culture. This class will make you reexamine sound while giving you opportunities in better writing essays. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Anyone interested in music, noise, or sound in any way should try to get into this section. You don't have to be a musician or have a musical background to engage/participate and to get a lot out of the course. Many of the students in my section did have a variety of musical backgrounds which made discussions very compelling as we were able to bring many different perspectives to the table. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely would. The professor is great, and the class is very valuable for furthering writing skills and learning about an interesting topic. ",
            "\u00a0YES YES YES I cannot recommend this class highly enough!!!! Truly one of the best classes I have ever taken ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but I would warn that it may not be best for thy GPA though. It's hard because our grades come almost solely down to the papers we write. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend my seminar to other students. It was a great environment to speak on interesting topics while improving my writing abilities. It also pushed me creatively. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I learned a lot and was engaged throughout the course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The readings, though difficult, were very interesting and would appeal to many who consider themselves fans of music. I was exposed to brand new schools of thought regarding the relationship between sound and listeners.In addition to analyzing the political repercussions of classical music, we also got to discuss modern hip hop/rap songs by artists like Kendrick Lamar. We got to share our favorite pieces of music in class, go on sound walks to understand New Haven's auditory presence and even compose our own sound pieces as the final. The class was very fun! "
