            "\u00a0This course was tremendously helpful to me, both as a writer and as someone who wants to make a career out of writing about art. In terms of the former, our assignments raised the stakes of the individual sentence to a degree unprecedented for me. In terms of the latter, our assignments made me realize that I don't want to be a critic! ",

        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The guest speakers were amazing. I didn't feel like the notes on my writing were always consistent -- sentences that didn't change from draft to draft would receive different comments. ",
            "\u00a0The main strengths were the simulation of professional criticism (the regular deadlines, the fast turnaround) and the guest speakers! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I grew a lot because of the feedback structure and quick turn around of assignments\r\nWeaknesses: Saturday 3pm deadlines are brutal, especially with those involved in the performing arts on campus "

            "\u00a0Yes! I learned so much from Professor Spillane. I have a newfound appreciation for arts criticism. ",
            "\u00a0Only if you have time to attend all the out-of-class commitments and performances! There are a lot, especially up front. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! On the first day, we went around the room admitting the art form we had the least familiarity with. By the end of the course, I felt comfortable having a discussion about any of them. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to grow as a writer and have amazing conversations along the way TAKE THIS CLASS. Professor Spillane is a must-have, she's really caring and really knows what she's doing when it comes to writing. I have learned so much about the craft of writing and truly appreciated the conversations in class. "
