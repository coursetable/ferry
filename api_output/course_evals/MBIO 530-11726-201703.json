            "\u00a0Great overview of immunology! I feel like a stronger foundational understanding of the subject, which will definitely help my PhD work. ",
            "\u00a0Learned the basics of how the immune system works ",
            "\u00a0By taking this class I learned fundamental concepts in immunology, especially the framework that the innate immunity initiates the adaptive immunity. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the basic concepts of how the immune system is organized and functions in response to infection. ",
            "\u00a0Further refining of my immunology knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0I came away from the course with a much better understanding of the overall organization of the human immune system. More specifically, I gained a much more nuanced understanding of patterns of immune cell trafficking throughout the body. ",
            "\u00a0Solid overview of the innate and adaptive immune system with some lectures focused specific application i.e. vaccines, cancer immunology. \r\n\r\nI feel much more comfortable with understanding basic immune biology after this course. ",

            "\u00a0Despite being taught by multiple professors, the course was well integrated.\r\nThe course was a little slow to start - there were too many \"intro\" lectures. ",
            "\u00a0I really like how 1) lectures are recorded 2) TA sessions are held regularly 3) written assignments force you to keep up ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n1) The topics are very wide-ranging but at the same time up-to-date (e.g. recent discoveries in the novel transcription factor Fezf2 that regulate the ectopic expression of tissue-specific antigens).\r\n2) The quality of classes taught by different instructors are consistently high. All instructors were articulate and used chalk board, maximizing the amount of knowledge the student can absorb.\r\n3) The review session was very necessary and helpful. The papers assigned were informative and fun-to-read.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n1) The quality of the audio recording could be improved.\r\n2) The homework seems a bit extraby doing the homework, I did not learn much. There might be other ways where one can be tested and evaluated. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course were the lectures about VDJ recombination, lymphocyte development and MHC/peptide loading. The lectures about germinal centers and tolerance were also very good. \r\n\r\nOverall, I wish the course went into more in depth concepts and the current questions that are still being asked in the field. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course was excellent. My only critique was that some of the material was redundant between lectures, and I think this could be avoided if the professors were informed about the content of previous lectures. ",
            "\u00a0Maybe the flow of material could be improved for the beginning sections. But that's a maybe. For the most parts, the lectures do a good job of presenting material that is used in subsequent lectures. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the recordings need to be better to be actually helpful. If the person typing the notes could sit further away from the video, it would be really helpful. Also, if the people would wear their mics so that we could here, that would also be useful. ",
