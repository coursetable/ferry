            "\u00a0I have never thought about paleontology from a taphonomic standpoint, and I feel like I learned something new and insightful every single class. I've learned so much more about the chemical and geologic impacts on fossils. Aside from the class lectures, I also had the opportunity to develop my own research project, which allowed me to further my writing/research abilities, as well as learn about taphonomy with a more focused and in-depth view focused on a limited number of specimens. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Flexibility. You could tailor the course to your specific interests. Derek is a compelling lecturer, and I was gripped by the content during every session.\r\nImprovement: Perhaps the opportunity for grad/undergrad students to pair up for projects? Or group projects in general. ",
            "\u00a0I think this class is very well put together. We receive a number of lectures from Dr. Briggs as well as other invited speakers which gives us the opportunity to hear from other experts and points of view. Specimens were brought to every lecture to give us a physical example of what we were learning about that day. I have no suggestions to improve the course. ",
            "\u00a0- Weaknesses: None. \r\nOur class was too quiet as a whole, but I'm not sure how that could have been changed.\r\n\r\n- Strengths: \r\n(1) Derek's lecturing, with strong supplementary lectures by Lidya, Susan, Jasmina, Luke, and others. \r\n(2) Single (2-part) assessment in form of class project and presentation. This let us delve deeply into a particular problem of taphonomy. "
