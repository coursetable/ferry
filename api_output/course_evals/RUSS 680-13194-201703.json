            "\u00a0Due to the emphasis on theory, I was introduced to many new ideas and perspectives concerning the spatiality of literature. I believe that the theory aspect of this course was particularly strong, and provided a theoretical base from which I can pull for subsequent research papers. Additionally, I found that the way we approached texts by focusing on space to be unique and productive. I thoroughly enjoyed the course. "
