            "\u00a0I learned how to look at and analyze many childhood classics from a different perspective. I also learned a lot about how children's literature developed over time, and the impact that books can have on children as they develop. My writing also improved immensely, and the revision process for every paper was incredibly helpful. Professor Campbell gives incredible, very specific feedback that, though challenging, improved my writing so much. ",
            "\u00a0My writing definitely improved over the course of this semester. I learned to really organize my thoughts, plan my essay, and use my arguments to bring out my thesis as much as possible. The method of drafting and revision really helped my learning process, and I got a lot of tips, whether from meetings with Professor Campbell or in reading other students' essays. As for the theme of the course, I learned a lot about reflection and perspective, and I loved the way each book added the theme in nuanced ways and showed the many avenues people use to write and reflect about childhood, from memoirs to first person narratives and fictional fantasies. ",
            "\u00a0I strengthened my writing skills and reflected on childhood. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to outline my essay to clearly communicate my ideas to the reader, and how to proofread my own essay for clarity and flow. I learned how to look into literature, particularly children's literature, more deeply and come up with strong, nuanced arguments about the texts. I also learned how to edit other people's essays and provide them with feedback to help them improve their writing. ",

            "\u00a0This class was incredible. It allowed the students to read wonderful childhood favorites, and new, incredibly meaningful books about childhood from other perspectives. The discussion in class always surprised me with the depth that could be found in these books. The papers were actually fun to write, especially if you are passionate about the books you read in class. It was wonderful to be able to write the culminating research paper about Harry Potter. The revision process was incredibly helpful, and I improved my writing so much with Professor Campbell's feedback. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of this course is the drafting and rewriting process. It really helped me nail down what I wanted to focus on to improve my essay each time, and the meetings really helped me to realize what problems are common in my writing and how to plan ahead to avoid such pitfalls. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: There was a wide variety of literature on the syllabus, from very simple literature for children to rather complex literature about children and childhood. I think reading children's and adult literature about children provided an interesting perspective. There was a lot of help with writing, especially with feedback on written essays and meetings to brainstorm ideas before writing. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Because there were a lot of books on the syllabus, discussions sometimes felt a little rushed, especially toward the end of the course when the books became more complex (like Black Boy). Also, a little extra class time dedicated to talking about writing might have been helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: discussion based, engaging readings, manageable workload "

            "\u00a0Yes, if you like reading old, classic children's books, meaningful discussion, and writing. THIS CLASS IS NOT A GUT! There is a lot of writing, even in addition to the four papers (small writing assignments for almost every class), and Professor Campbell is not an easy grader. However, it is a wonderful, and incredibly rewarding class if you are willing to put in the effort. You can get so much out of these books that are considered for kids, and it is an incredible opportunity to be able to revisit these books from a different perspective. ",
            "\u00a0It was interesting but a lot more work than Id anticipated (and more work than it needed to be). ",
            "\u00a0Professor Campbell is fantastic! Absolutely shop this class if you are interested. All of my friends were jealous of me all semester long :) ",
            "\u00a0This was an absolutely wonderful class and I would definitely take it if you get in. This class teaches you that there's a lot more to children's literature than you think, and the class discussions are super interesting. Professor Campbell is incredibly kind and thoughtful - she puts in a lot of effort into the class and each student individually. The workload is pretty fair - there are readings and short assignments for most classes (very doable and who would complain about reading Harry Potter?) and four essays (standard for introductory English classes). ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to other students  especially freshman who want to take a writing credit. "
