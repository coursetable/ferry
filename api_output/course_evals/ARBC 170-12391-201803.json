            "\u00a0I developed are more nuanced understanding of Arabic literature. ",
            "\u00a0The quality of teaching we received from Professor Elbousty was phenomenal. He knew his stuff extremely well and always came to class very prepared to deliver the material. What is amazing is that he loves to see our progress by tracking our journal entries. He goes well beyond what is required from a professor and always has his doors open for all students. The feedback we receive from him is always detailed and the constructive nature of them allows you to identify what you need to work more on! He worked tirelessly to ensure that we all understood the details and vocabulary associated with the pieces we read. He taught us the power of interpretation where certain pieces of literature could be analyzed in a plethora of ways. By the end of this class, we were able to write a short story! Professor Elbousty is with no doubt the best language Professor at Yale and he is someone who makes you look forward to every single class. He also knows the art of teaching languages really well and follows a unique philosophy which is based on reading and writing, as opposed to focusing on the intricate and tedious grammatical structures. ",
            "\u00a0I have acquired strong skills in Arabic creative writing, including but not limited to: developing innovative ideas for Arabic novels, drafting an outline for my written work and organizing my ideas in a smooth and coherent way to create intriguing writing. I have also learned about so many Arab authors through their biographies and bibliographies. We also learned about the history of some Middle Eastern countries which we have discussed while analyzing the literary works of the Arab authors. ",
            "\u00a0This course is an absolute essential experience for anyone wishing to further their Arabic education. Your writing and reading skills improve so much throughout the semester, and you will find yourself writing your own stories with much ease. Out of all the Arabic courses offered at Yale, this one stands out as being the most structured and effective learning experience by far. "

            "\u00a0The course was good, though due to personal reasons the professor had to miss a few session, but that can't be helped. ",
            "\u00a0This course is different from any other course since it puts all your skills into practice and that is how you learn best. We all improved dramatically throughout the semester because you are always practicing the language in a natural manner, where the priority is reading and writing as opposed to learning unnecessary grammatical rules. In addition, Professor Elbousty teaches the content in an extremely engaging manner and you get so much out of every class. The feedback you receive throughout this course is very clear and constructive. It was my favorite class this semester since you read a variety of literature from across the whole Arab World. The amazing part is also that Professor Elbousty has met nearly all of these literary figures and has direct access to them if needed. The emphasis is not on examination, which is great and gives you the chance to improve your language skills in a stress-free environment! ",
            "\u00a0This class is organized in a way that optimizes learning. The fact that it is a small class made it very easy for me to learn from Professor Jonas and listen to my peers' analyses of passages of the novels. It was really enjoyable to interact with my peers and the instructor and there couldn't be a better way to learn creative writing than this setting. I think that the class should stay the way it currently is because it's amazing! ",
            "\u00a0Professor Elbousty provides a very structured calendar and changes it throughout the semester depending on the needs of the students. One of the largest strengths of this course is the breadth of novels you get to read from every country in the Arab world, so you can compare and contrast writing styles and cultures. This class teaches you just as much Arab culture as it does Arabic. Some students are more comfortable with reading Arabic than others, but the professor makes it a point to make sure everybody feels confident and able to speak and converse with their peers, no matter how many mistakes they may make. Some of the stories may be a little difficult to grasp the first time around so youll have to read them twice, but usually the professor gives you a heads up about this and helps you a lot. This class has a very doable workload, and you get what you put in. Definitely a must-take! "

            "\u00a0Yes, if you feel confident in your grasp of Fusha. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommended for Students who want to drastically improve their Arabic writing and reading skills. ",
            "\u00a0DEFINITELY TAKE A CLASS WITH PROFESSOR ELBOUSTY! He is a genius in his field and you will never ever encounter such a passionate Arabic teacher! He loves his classes and research and within the first 2 minutes of meeting him that becomes very apparent. The course is put together in an amazing manner, which leaves a lot of flexibility for you and your fellow classmates to take it in whatever direction you want. The learning environment is very inclusive and you touch on many relevant topics such as colonialism, violence, corruption and womens' rights to just name a few. I have never laughed this much in a Yale class and that is what makes this course extremely distinct. You get to learn from your peers a lot and the group presentations are very fun. The weekly responses are also very flexible, which is such a great method for you to write about whatever interests you the most about the text. Do not hesitate for a second when it comes to classes delivered by Professor Elbousty! ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course because the material studied in the class is amazing and the instructor is extremely competent. By taking this class, not only will you acquire really strong writing skills in Arabic, but you will also be able to learn so many interesting things about Middle Eastern culture and history. I am so glad I took this class and really hope similar courses are offered at Yale in the future. ",
            "\u00a0I can not recommend this course enough to any Arabic student who has taken L5 (maybe even just L4). It is so different from any other Arabic class Ive ever taken. The focus of this class isnt on the grammar, but on the literary devices and writing style of each author. There is also a large focus on the Arab culture and traditions. Professor Elbousty makes sure every student feels welcome and comfortable in the class, so do not worry, just sign up! I am so glad I took this class. If you ever need an extension or extra help on anything, or if you do not understand some of the writing, the professor will welcome any questions and will make sure you feel comfortable with the material no matter how much help you need. Do not hesitate to take this class! "
