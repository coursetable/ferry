You're either one of those grad students/undergrad geniuses who get most of everything, or you realize (too late) you're in over your head and you struggle to understand the most basic 20% of stuff. But you still learn a lot, and the expectations are actually not very high - that 20% is enough to scrape by/get a decent grade if you pore over the readings dilligently and go for office hours often enough.

Despite everyone (including the prof) saying that its really theoretical and only 1% is practically relevant to say web dev, its still nice to know you can intellectually categorize and deal with various constructs and components of distributed systems.
