            "\u00a0Learned a lot about planet and star formation, what ingredients are required for life to get started, how simple, complex, and intelligent life might evolve, and what kind of thought and tools go into searching for extraterrestrial intelligence. Discussed often how to think scientifically about subjects that currently have a lot of conjecture, and where to find evidence for such subjects. ",
            "\u00a0In the first part of the course we learned how stars and planetary systems form and how conditions similar to that of earth originate. Next, we looked at the evolution of life on earth starting from the birth of the planet, the evolution of intelligence, and replicability of such events. We then shifted to how we are looking for ET life, what we are looking for, current questions in the SETI field, and explored some social implications of what would happen should we find evidence of other life in the galaxy. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much in this course. I learned how to think about the probabilities of extraterrestrial intelligence existing in the universe. I learned about possible locations of extraterrestrial life. I really gained insight into how fascinating the search for extraterrestrial life is as a subject and how multi-faceted it is. ",
            "\u00a0So so much. Everything from origin-of-life theories to plate tectonics to planetary formation to culture and religion and the history of the universe. Covers topics in biology, chemistry, geology, astrophysics, and a whole host of other sciences. ",
            "\u00a0Better scientific writing, the ability to balance the philosophical and the technical, and the ability to discuss scientific topics in a seminar class format ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to perform research and synthesize information from scientific texts. ",
            "\u00a0I practiced writing in a scientific context ",
            "\u00a0This class covered the fundamentals of astrobiology, spanning astronomy, biology, and the search for extraterrestrial life. ",
            "\u00a0I knew nothing about astronomy and space before this class and felt that I learned a lot in that field! "

            "\u00a0Super interesting subject material. Professor Faison is really great at leading class discussions and going on fun tangents. Sometimes, the psets were a bit vague in how they related to what we had done/discussed in class. Donuts every Thursday! ",
            "\u00a0Honestly, I don't think the course could be much improved. I greatly enjoyed the readings and the professor was good at explaining concepts. It would have been helpful if the professor shared his lecture slides, which would have greatly helped with problem sets. ",
            "\u00a0Course was strong in the presentation of material, the professor was excited to discuss the fields. In-class discussions were not very rigorous, it was clear that many people were not following the prescribed reading so often only a few people could have coherent debates. ",
            "\u00a0It is very thorough and covers SETI from a comprehensive variety of angles. I don't think it had many weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0The seminar topics in class were always extremely fun. Perhaps my favorite part of the class was how much freedom we had in choosing an essay topic. The homework assignments however were mostly summarizing information from the readings, so I feel a few more exploratory questions (like the ones about the waiting problem and space travel) would be beneficial. ",
            "\u00a0I think that shifting the curriculum one week prior would help, as we often discussed topics relevant to problem sets after those sets had to be submitted ",
            "\u00a0The course material was really interesting, and I really liked the readings we did. One weakness was that the course didn't feel very interactive or seminar-like, it was a lot of lecturing (which was still interesting), but not a lot of discussion between students. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- small class\r\n- a lot of discussions\r\n- a really good professor \r\n\r\n Weaknesses: \r\n- I took a long tie to get back your problem sets so it was difficult to know where you were at grade wise "

        [
            "\u00a0If you like space, thinking about aliens, or are generally curious about the universe and its possibilities, then YES! The course isn't super science-y (as in we don't do a whole lot of math and there are a lot of Scientific American readings) but the material is super duper fascinating. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The material is very interesting and the class discussions were always fun and engaging. The class covers a broad range of topics but does not go super in depth to any of them. The readings and homework are sometimes a lot, but the material is interesting enough that the work is not particularly difficult. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course. It combined astronomy, earth science, evolutionary biology, paleontology, and engineering into a class that had something for everyone, and due to the sources we used you did not have to be a STEM major (and wade through an ocean of scientific jargon) to really learn a lot. The books we read were very interesting, and since we were not reading out of a textbook the whole time the discussions were always fresh. If you are on the lookout for a writing credit like I was, this was a great option that did not require constant essays; there is great freedom of choice on the final essay so I genuinely felt excited to write it, and the weekly problem sets break up the writing so it doesn't feel like you're writing pages. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this class to another student. I had never taken an astronomy class, but I found this class extremely interesting and not too easy but not overly difficult either. I had a great time in this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The class was very interesting and explored topics I had never before thought about. The perfect 5th class for a first-year. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would. But don't come into this course expecting an easy science or writing credit, because it does take time and effort every week to do readings and answer the challenging reading response questions. ",
            "\u00a0Very highly. We discussed so many interesting topics in the class, and I was always excited to go to seminar. ",
            "\u00a0Of course! I love it ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course, I learned a lot about astrobiology that I didn't know before. The material is very interesting, and the trip we took to the observatory was very fun as well. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would! It is a really fun class and the professor is amazing, he makes it really interesting. Coming in with no knowledge in the field at all is not a problem, you start off by learning the basics and then dig deeper into astronomy and the search for extraterrestrial life as the course goes on.
