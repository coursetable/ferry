            "\u00a0My french dramatically improved. I also learned a lot about french culture/ current events. ",
            "\u00a0This course made me a lot better at French, especially spoken French. Taking the course in France allowed me to practice the language in a way that would not have been possible in New Haven, and Madame Pinzka is an amazing professor. I became better at writing in French and learned a ton about French culture, politics, life, etc.. This is a great course! ",
            "\u00a0Firstly, I learned how to communicate more clearly in the French language. This was harder than I thought it would be - I realized that even though we learn certain textbook phrases, sometimes there are other phrases that the French use more frequently in normal conversation. Often times the sophisticated grammar we learn is forgone in favor of easier, less correct grammar. Secondly, I learned so much about French culture. We read articles, watched films and videos, and observed things about French government, society, educational systems, geography environmental efforts, and so on. Lastly, I learned so much by living with a host family. I learned not only about the nuances of French culture, but also how to understand and communicate with people from a different place. That was one of the most rewarding experiences to me, and I think it will continue to impact the way I interact with others. ",
            "\u00a0This class provides not only an intensive review of basic communication in French, but also expertise in a wide range of topics, including French history, politics, social norms, food, and art. I now have a great deal of context for understanding French language as a function of its culture. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about French society and culture and improved my French conversation skills significantly. "

            "\u00a0It was a lot of work, especially at the end. The work could have been spread out more. Additionally, I would have enjoyed spending more time in Normandy. ",
            "\u00a0The course is well-paced for a summer course, with a lot of interesting content and a manageable workload. A strength I see is how interactive the course was. We often had to ask questions to our host families or other people in Paris about various topics, which was a great way to take advantage of being in Paris. ",
            "\u00a0Some strengths of this course included the reading/viewing material, which was engaging; the environment, because Paris is incredible; the excursions, which offered much different landscapes and aspects of France than just Paris; the homestay, which taught me more than I could have ever imagined, and; the professor, who is an absolute delight and taught me so clearly and thoroughly. The only weakness that comes to mind is the guided tours. Ultimately they offered ways to learn about historical monuments in depth, but they were quite boring. I found it hard to focus, and I was often extremely tired by the time we went on the tour. I would have preferred spending the time together in a museum or doing some other activity. (Another degustation, perhaps?) Another weakness of course was the endless strikes. I was always late to restaurants/theaters, and on the very last day, thanks to the strikes, I ended having to take an Uber to the airport and arrived an hour late. I know that Yale has no control over that, but it was definitely a less pleasant memory I have of the whole experience. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: you are speaking almost exclusively French, all the time. The small class size really forces you to push yourself and participate, even if it's a little terrifying to speak full paragraphs in a foreign language.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The homework is no joke. Of course, this aids with learning, but it sometimes got in the way of being able to go out, explore Paris, and interact with real French people - which I would argue is just as important as answering questions and annotating articles. ",
            "\u00a0The content and readings were very useful, but most classes were just long, open-ended discussions. There could have been more structure. "

        [
            "\u00a0Yes, but make sure to ask your friends to do it with you because its way more fun to do it with friends. Also, truly be prepared to work. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student who is interested in the French language and culture. It is an amazing course and you will learn a lot! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This was by far one of my most positive experiences at Yale altogether. I am so thankful to the French department and CIPE for making the application process so easy and affordable. ",
            "\u00a0Paris is a fantastic city. If you're at the L5 level and you want to polish up your speaking skills, this is the best way to do it. Living with a host family is like having an oral examination every day at dinner. Bear in mind, though, that you will not have nearly as much free time as you think you will. Plan ahead so that you actually take in all that the city has to offer. ",
            "\u00a0Taking this in Paris is amazing, because it is so applicable to the actual experience of living in France. I highly recommend to understand the politics, society, and social perspectives of the country. "
