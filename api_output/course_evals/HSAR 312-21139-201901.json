Professor Buckley gave us not only a foundational knowledge about modern architecture, but also encouraged us to draw common themes between seemingly disparate buildings. Furthermore, this course taught me that there are always deeper reasons and meanings beneath major architectural projects, and that the different ways in which architects respond to their environments create different movements and styles within architecture.

            "\u00a0Lectures were interesting, just get to sit and look at pretty pictures and listen to stories about buildings twice a week. It was a good time. Workload is also minimal -- great HU credit for stem majors like me ",
            "\u00a0I personally enjoyed the lectures. They're more similar to art history lectures than architecture, so if you're looking to learn more about architecture through an art history lens the lectures are interesting to listen to. I was not a huge fan of the traditional sections as they were a bit repetitive. However, I really enjoyed the sections where we visited various sites (YCBA, YUAG, etc.) as looking at original archives was fascinating and really added to the class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: engaging lectures, meaningful discussions in section, a manageable amount of work/readings. Assignments were creative and enriching for me. \r\nWeaknesses: none! ",
            "\u00a0Little strict in grading but interesting class. ",

            "\u00a0As a survey of Western architecture, this is a great course. However, to frame the course as \"Modern Architecture in a Global Context\" is simply inaccurate as the class discusses pretty much exclusively Western architects in a Western context. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the focus of the writing assignments on the local architecture and history. The course was easy to follow and well taught (by both the professor and TA). I really enjoyed the course and felt I learnt a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Professor Buckley is a great lecturer! I would love to take another one of his classes. This class really inspired me and I hope to take more architecture classes. ",

            "\u00a0The course was very well organized and included a great variety of assignments and material. I would highly recommend. ",
            "\u00a0This class was very organized. Expectations were straightforward. Sections that met in the YUAG or YCBA were extraordinary additions. For the other sections, my TA brought in great additional references.\r\nOne way the class could be improved is greater integration of global architects in the first half of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I liked this course. The lectures were very interesting. It would be nice to see a few more women architects, especially in the more modern eras. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: not chronological for a lot of it so hard to develop connections between material. For example, we talked about architecture in the 30s in Fascist Italy and then the week after talked about Brazil which covered 20s through 60s. \r\nStrengths: readings are well organized to relate to material. Professor Buckley is a very eloquent lecturer and the TFS are great. ",
            "\u00a0This course was far too narrow, focused only on white mens role in modern architecture. And I am saying this as a white man. It so blatantly made no effort to incorporate the many contributions of people or color and women in the history of modern architecture. The fact that a few women and architects of color are brought up toward the end of the course is wholly insufficient. This school can do better. I am extremely disappointed by this curriculum. Though women and architects of color were kept out of the field in some cases and therefore had less influence in the mainstream of American and European modern architecture, to omit them as much as has been done in this class is revisionist history. An active effort to make this course more representative is crucial. ",
            "\u00a0The course title, \"Modern Architecture in a Global Context,\" does not reflect the material that is taught, which is primarily western. The course could be strengthened by actually teaching about modern architecture in a global context. ",
            "\u00a0I was supremely disappointed by this course. As a 300 level course required for architecture majors, I expected this class to go into a depth and cover material fitting of students who have already taken at least two other history of architecture classes. Sadly, it was another introductory survey class barely scraping the surface of the biggest hits in the cannon. Lectures were often dry and glossed over countless important buildings, sites, and architects. Understandably, to cover the entirety of the modern era some things must be skipped, but considering at least half of the class had or will have to take ARCH 150 and American Architecture and Urbanism, the material could have been tailored such that materials covered in this lower level course to permit new unfamiliar materials to be covered. At least 60% if not more of the content covered in this course was covered in another class mandatory for architecture majors. In the future, I hope this course will take more of the approach History of Architecture I did, expanding outside of the cannon, and having more than superficial conversations about complex ideologies as seen through architecture. ",
            "\u00a0This class is designed for people who have never taken an architecture or art history class before at Yale, so it's a wonder why it's a 300 level. It is really straightforward slide ID and visual analysis, though it would be a stretch to call it visual analysis because you're really just repeating what Craig has already analyzed and tells you is important. There is no room to be creative with your own analyses if you want a decent grade. We got almost no feedback on the exam, just random points taken off with no explanation as to why. The majority of the class is Europe and the US, which like one week of Japan and Brazil thrown in there, which felt really awkward and random. I was really disappointed because the material is really promising, but if you've taken any architecture class at Yale it's a lot of repetition. The writing assignments are annoying because, again, if you've taken an architecture class at Yale you've already written about New Haven buildings more than anyone ever should. Section requires no thought, and does not let you engage with the material beyond very superficially. Honestly I learned nothing. This class needs to give more exciting assignments with less restrictions so students can really learn and engage. It needs to put less pressure on memorization and more on how to visually analyze buildings with the information you are given not to just recite it. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the lectures were very interesting, not only because I was introduced to many different types of architecture, but also because we studied the history of architectural movements and the people that led them to the spotlight. I think that the sections could be improved by taking a deeper dive into one or two topics from the lectures instead of trying to do a recap of what we saw in lecture. ",
            "\u00a0The material is very interesting. I wish we included a lot more non-European architecture. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed both of the papers, both of which involved visual and historical analysis of New Haven buildings of your choosing - great way to learn more about the architecture of the city you are in for four years! The format of the midterm and final exam (memorizing the architect, *exact* years of construction, name, and historical context of ~25 buildings for the midterm and an additional ~25 for the final) is not fun but is also not terrible. ",
            "\u00a0This was a good course in that it addresses some important issues within architecture but it was pretty poorly taught and the exams and papers tested one's ability to memorize and recognize rather than think more critically. ",
            "\u00a0I wish they'd given us a little more direction on how to properly analyze buildings which owuld have been very helpful for hte papers. Instead we had to take terms we picked up on from the lecture or reading. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were the lectures. Buckley was an amazing lecture and was very engaging and knowledgeable about the topic. The only downfall was if you happened to miss lecture once, there was no way to obtain the notes unless through a friend. It would be helpful just to have a brief overview of the lecture apart from the readings/or some notes that were incorporated in the slides, especially for when reviewing for the midterm and final. ",
            "\u00a0I loved my discussion sections and I thought it was a great way to bring in the readings. One of the weaknesses was that global really just meant we also talked about European architects and spent a couple class periods in Brazil and Japan. Many of the buildings we studied were the same as the buildings we studied in intro architecture and American architecture and urbanism. ",
            "\u00a0One strength of the course was Professor Buckleys lucid and thesis-driven lectures. While they did contextualize the buildings and architects that we were discussing, they also advanced arguments about these buildings. By doing so, his lectures allowed me to look at architecture in a more critical manner. \r\n\r\nI cant think of any major weaknesses for this course. I would have liked to have spent a bit more time learning about contemporary architecture as well as some of the more general arguments regarding the idea of space and place in architecture, but these suggestions dont stem from any damning flaw within the course itself. ",
            "\u00a0I think the class is organized well and the lectures are structured in clear way. I felt like we covered a lot of architecture and it wasn't too crammed. I do wish that for at least one of the papers, we got to write about a building that was not in New Haven. I wanted to dive deeper into a building that was not in the U.S. since this is a class on global architecture. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strength by far is Professor Buckley  -- his lectures brought to life the architectural projects that we were studying and he always made sure to place each building in its context (both historically and within art movements). Placing a building within its context may seem like a simple thing, but, it also provided for much deeper and more intuitive understandings of the buildings we studied. Another strength was how Professor Buckley had us visit the art galleries and print rooms -- this allowed for us to become more engaged with the buildings that we were studying and to apply the concepts we learned within our discussion section groups. "

            "\u00a0Yes, I would. If you're interested in learning more about architecture, especially through an art history frame of mind, it's an interesting lecture. The class will leave you feeling more cultured and you'll gain an appreciation for buildings both internationally and around campus. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to any student. Professor Buckley is a wonderful lecturer. Furthermore, this course has allowed me to look differently at the buildings I inhabit, and I have a really solid understanding of the social/political/cultural ties to each architectural \"movement.\" ",

            "\u00a0This is an awesome class if you're moderately interested in art/architecture. It's a cool survey of important developments in modern architecture, and you get to appreciate the architecture at Yale/in New Haven more. The midterm and final are fair, and the papers are straightforward. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend taking this class. The most engaging and interesting class I have taken in my 4 years at Yale. Prof. Buckley is amazing! ",

            "\u00a0Yes,  I would recommend this course,  even to not art history majors. It enables a far greater than aesthetic appreciation for the architecture in which we live. ",

            "\u00a0Maybe but only if you have never taken an architecture or art history class at Yale. Otherwise you will probably have already learned everything. If you already know how to take a slide ID test, then the course doesn't teach you much. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to someone who wants to better appreciate architecture but doesn't want to become an architect. It's a good class to dip your toe in and understand the rich tradition of architecture without being needlessly bogged down with technical skills. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This is a great survey class for anyone broadly interested in architecture history. ",

            "\u00a0This course seems oriented towards non-history-of-art majors like me. For such people, this course offers a great introduction to modern architecture and to the practice of art history more generally. For those already familiar with the basics of modern architecture, this course may frustrate attempts to discuss it in greater detail. ",
            "\u00a0There are more interesting, effective, and intelligent ways to learn about modern architecture than by taking this class. If you aren't required to take it, I would recommend against. Maybe check out some library books and visit some of the buildings instead? This comment applies also to the precursor to this course, ARCH 260, ancient to baroque architecture. (One highlight of the course was the visits to see Yale's extensive collections on primary sources, although by no means do you need to take the course to access these materials. Ask a librarian at the Beinecke or Haas to view documents and drawings on the Crystal Palace, Frank Lloyd Wright, Bauhaus...) ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would! I am new to architecture as an art history topic so it was great to see how people talk about it and why certain buildings look the way we do ",

Not only is it a very painless course to take, but its content and the buildings that you learn about are extremely fascinating. Finally, Professor Buckley is a fantastic lecturer, and he brings to life the buildings that you study. Definitely take this course! "
