As a history major, it seemed important to engage with one of the oldest forms of history, even if some people consider it to be decreasingly relevant. Kennedy is a very engaging lecturer, and the entire course really is just attending lecture and listening. If you do that, you'll be fine on the two exams, which are your entire grade. Honestly, even if you don't do that you'll be fine if you take the time to study for a day or two.

At times felt like an art history class because he was showing, and talking about, so many paintings that seemed only somewhat related to our topic. He was descriptive at best, and never analytical. Often he would literally say nothing. The readings are also super long (90-150) pages a week and quite dense, as they're often filled with data and the intricacies of military phenomena. Most students I know did next to no readings. If you were to do all the readings you would learn a lot, and it would be very interesting, but there are way too many, and you would be completely unsupported by lecture or your TF so you may as well read the good ones by yourself. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths lie in the material covered, as it is super important to study military history and European history.

            "\u00a0Weaknesses: there is virtually no work, so it doesnt make you learn the material as you go ",
            "\u00a0The selection of historical events that the course covers is great. However, some of the readings are only very tangentially relevant to the course, and doing them had very little effect on my exam scores. Professor Kennedy's lectures are very slow and cover almost no material.\r\n\r\nMy TA, Laurence Gaillard, had several shortcomings that hugely impacted the course. She was reliably 10 to 15 minutes late to every section, then would spend at least 5 minutes trying to make the projector work (every single time). Partly as a result, her sections always overran by at least 10 minutes; she would neither acknowledge that class has ended nor dismiss us. The class usually consisted of two student presentations; after the first one, Laurence made a point of giving at least 10 minutes of personal feedback to the presenter, usually on a very specific point that she had a problem with, and which had absolutely no bearing on the rest of the class. Her own presentations were unclear, typically listing many individual events without comment or point.\r\n\r\nLaurence is a harsh grader who gave the class a B- average at midterm and at least two Ds. My friend and I, who both had her as a TA and who had both done all of the readings, got a B+ and a B respectively; several of my friends who had neither read nor studied history before in college, but had different TAs, got As. This forced me to Credit/D the class, which was very disappointing since I had been taking it seriously. Her criticism of my essay was that she disagreed with the thesis.\r\n\r\nLaurence has a lot of difficulty understanding the workings of an academic system to which she is not accustomed. She remarked that when she first graded our midterms, before reading the Yale grading guidelines (because clearly that's a reasonable order in which to do things), she gave a large number of grades below 40%, just because this is how things are graded in France. During exam preparation, she expected us to produce a 20 line description of Louis XIV for the IDs, even though he is at best tangential to the course; likewise for several other French figures who were barely mentioned. She assigned far more work than other TAs, expecting not only presentations but splitting us up into \"reading groups\" every week that were supposed to comment the presentations - if this sounds inane and poorly defined, it's because it was. She did not seem to understand that students were taking three to five other courses besides this one, and made it impossible to be successful in the class without approaching it as the main priority of one's semester. Between this and her late-starting, overrunning sections, it became clear that she had no respect for our time.\r\n\r\nLaurence did not set clear goals. She took several weeks to grade the midterm and was still grading after our last section before spring break, making it extremely difficult for people to decide whether they should switch the course to Credit/D. After we came back, she gave some indication that the midterm grades might not be representative, but did not define what grading would be used - she rambled, \"I will look at the top grade and say what I think it should be, and then grade like that, and the bottom grade will be the bottom grade\" which mathematically does not mean anything. Rather, Laurence prefers to use weird and vague pedagogical methods, like writing the dates in our IDs in terms of the \"quarter of century\" they were in, which is not only stupid because saying Operation Barbarossa was in the second quarter of the twentieth century is useless, but also unhelpful to learning because nobody's brain works in terms of quarters of centuries. Why not just say there will be a five year tolerance on the IDs where appropriate? Everything was like this.\r\n\r\nFinally, the grades for this course arrived two days after the Yale deadline for seniors; apparently professors and TA's do not have to care about deadlines that affect students' graduation. ",
            "\u00a0I'll state the few positive aspects of this course first: it seems like the professors and TA really enjoy history, and some of the readings were rather interesting. However, this is where the positives begin and end. The bulk of issues I had with this course can be traced back to my TA, Laurence Gaillard. With no exaggeration, Laurence is the worst teacher I have ever had. She has absolutely no consideration for her students' time. She would come to section late, take an excessive amount of time to get the projector in the room to work, and consistently have us leaving late. Furthermore, she would assign additional work outside the bounds of what others in other sections would have to do, and uphold a standard for quality that would exceed what is normally expected in a Yale course. This is indicative in her grading as well. Initially, when grading the midterm, she had to regrade every exam, because she had no idea about typical Yale grade distributions, and had most of us failing or near failing. Her altered grades still had class averages far below many of the other TAs. I know several students in other sections who did not even purchase the books, yet managed to receive As on the exams, whereas in our section, with her level of preparation, class averages still circled around a B- or B. I normally would not overcomplain about the grading from a professor, as professors have the right to have any distributions they want. However, the students in our sections were doing over 100 pages of reading each week to prepare for her higher standards, yet managed to receive lower than normal grades, so I feel like this needs to be stated. I must also say, numerous people asked what she is looking for when grading exams, so as to not make the same mistakes, but she could not adequately provide objective standards for us to use when learning the material. Ultimately, I can only place so much of the blame on Laurence, as Pranav was the head TA, and should oversee all the TAs. The lack of standards among the TAs makes me question how well this class was organized. I wish this class was a lot better, and I usually would not even take the time to evaluate professors and TAs, but this experience was so poor that I felt compelled to let my opinion be known. ",
            "\u00a0Super interesting material, and great lectures. Maybe the discussion section can be a bit more structured, although the TAs have done a great job. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Paul Kennedy, learn a lot of material while not being too difficult, Interesting enough that i didnt fall asleep, and Paul Kennedy (he is a great lecturer).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the grade is heavily weighted towards the essays on the midterm and finals. If you are taking this class to learn about all the important battles of history or the tactics or which exact model of gun was used at what time, this class isnt going to live up to your expectations. Kennedy focuses more on trends and lessons for this time period as well as taking a more surface view while only diving into such topics when necessary. ",
            "\u00a0The reading was definitely interesting, and the subject matter certainly has a lot of potential. The guest lectures were also engaging. With that said, the normal lectures were often hit-or-miss: either very engaging or a little dry. More uniform grading across the TA's would also be helpful (same criteria across different sections. ) ",

            "\u00a0Very strong course load and reading material. Maybe make lectures more engaging and more main idea topics discussed. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures from about half-way through are quite weak. I recall one week where a list of wars post-1945 were just mentioned with little to no explanation via powerpoint. There is little to no grading uniformity and it is almost entirely dependent on your TA. ",
            "\u00a0The class is quite easy, so long as you maintain a balance with the readings and have a good study guide for the exams. The lectures are always insightful, and sections often round out the particular topics of a given week. The class can get dull sometimes, especially if you aren't the most enthusiastic about Western history. The class could probably be improved if there were fewer readings -- or at the very least, all the readings were concentrated on the most important points. ",
            "\u00a0This was a very interesting course. It could be improved with less reading as many of the readings overlapped. ",
            "\u00a0Great professor. Not a gut, very difficult grading. ",
            "\u00a0Having only two assignments is both a blessing and a curse for this course. The midterm seems easy, but the grading is not particularly generous. The final was also fair. This course might be improved by having more review sessions outside of class to try to digest the enormous amount of material presented. ",
            "\u00a0While the lecture was quite large, section creating and enriching learning environment. The course was very broad and technology-focused rather than battle focused, which could be a positive or negative depending on your outlook. One area of improvement is organization. There were some lectures where I didnt understand the point that Professor Kennedy was trying to get across. ",

            "\u00a0No, no and no. Paul Kennedy is an amazing professor. However, this course is completely dependent on the TA you get. My TA was the worst TA I have ever had at Yale. I had Laurence Gaillard and she was absolutely the worst TA ever. I once fell in the bathroom and broke my leg. It was an extremely painful experience. I would rather break my leg again than ever have her as my TA ever again. I really hate to write this evaluation and it truly breaks my heart that I have to but this has to be said. I normally decline to write reviews but for this class, because of this TA, I just had to write a review. So, let me begin by outlining how this class is structured.  There are two lectures each week and one section. You select which section you want and are not allowed to switch after. You don't get to know who your TA will be before selecting which makes it a complete gamble. Before taking this course, I actually read some reviews on coursetable about how the TA you get for this class would determine your fate and that is so true. Now, about my TA. If there was a Nobel Prize for the worst TA, this TA would receive it every single year. If there was a Forbes list of worst TAs, she would be on it. If there was a Times 100 worst TAs in the galaxy, she would be on it. Laurence came late to section frequently (10-13 minutes), was extremely disorganized, extremely harsh at grading and would respond to emails a week late or never respond at all! We were all extremely shocked by her behavior. It reached a point where most of us would just come late to section as well because we knew she would come late! And when she did come late to section, she would go 10 minutes over time! Very inconsiderate of other students who had to go other sections right after hers. And when you tried to leave early when she was going over time, she would give you some look. My issue with her is not with the grading at all, I came into this course with a very strong military history and essay writing background so I did extremely well on the midterm (got an A) and found the final (grade pending) to be extremely easy as well. This class has two assessments. A midterm (30%), a final (60%) and participation (10%). For the midterm, almost half my section got Cs and Ds. Yes Cs and Ds. You read that right. Half the class. She said most people actually deserved Fs but she was being generous (aww thank you). However, grades are not my issue with her. I just felt that had to be mentioned for anyone who is pre-med/law or whoever cares about GPA a lot. Laurence was extremely disorganized. It was so unbelievable. If you set up an office hours appointment with her, you would be lucky if she came late because she most likely would not show up! Very inconsiderate of others! There are other specific instances I had with her but I dont want to go too much into detail and identify myself. This course is great but if you have Laurence as your TA, try and switch. If that doesnt work, drop the course! If you are looking for a Humanities credit, take Basic Drawing or The Rise and Fall of Atlantic Slavery (good guts, trust me). I know this evaluation might sound a bit dramatic but I promise you these comments arent exaggerated. Take this class next spring and have Laurence as your TA if you dont believe me. It was the STEM people in my section who really suffered with the grading. If you are a STEM person and choose to disregard my comments thats fine. But at least buy a coffin and make funeral arrangements for your gpa so that you can give it a proper burial after Laurence murders it. If you choose to not take it for a letter grade, be prepared for Laurence to completely miss out on your appointments or come extremely late and give you some weak excuse. Her extremely sloppy behavior really affected my mental health and I couldnt even fall asleep for most of the semester. In conclusion, I hope they do something about the TAs in this course. I'm sure Laurence only meant well. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0Very much yes. This class was amazing and very interesting. It's a great distribution or elective. ",
            "\u00a0If you're looking for a fifth class, and want an easy B, then it's a good choice. You do not have to do any readings to get a B. But getting an A is not that easy, and you are super dependent on which TF you get. Some are very kind, and some will grade harshly. If you take history very seriously and want an engaging, analytical course, this is also not a good pick, as your lecturer and TF will do next to no analysis. ",

            "\u00a0No. I found it very boring and the lectures were almost impossible to get through, even for people who enjoyed the material. If youre willing to do the 100 pages of reading each week, maybe then you could skip lecture but it seems hardly worth it. Even then, much of whats on the test is only in the readings and not covered in lecture, so who knows.... ",

            "\u00a0Many of the other reviewers may talk about how you should take the course because Professor Kennedy, a famous historian, is teaching the course. While I do not criticize his incredible contributions to the field of history, the lectures are mind-bogglingly uninteresting, unorganized, and irrelevant to tests. The readings are surprisingly interesting, but so much is assigned that it is impossible to actually appreciate them all. Tests are completely decided by ones TA, and there are huge disparities between sections regarding average grade. There is 1 midterm and 1 final, thus there is almost no room for error, and the first time you ever get feedback is on the midterm worth 30% of your grade. This class is aborrently bad, and I would steer far far away. Please do not make the same mistake I did. ",

            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Kennedys course is enriching, interesting, and foundation-building with a relatively low workload. The class does require strong writing and synthesis skills to succeed, and furthermore studying and paying attention are absolutely necessary. ",
