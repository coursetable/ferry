            "\u00a0I think that this course could be improved by greater participation from the entirety of the NT/AC faculty; there were two notable absences this semester. I also think that a conduct code, similar to the one CLA circulates to their cohort, should be circulated prior to the beginning of next semester. I would like to also see people workshop papers that are not super polished.  I would also like my peers to feel more comfortable engaging with ideas that are not within their immediate expertise; I felt like there were several moments this semester where students held back from sharing because they did not feel like they were the most knowledgeable person in the room on a subject.
