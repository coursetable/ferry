            "\u00a0This course really benefits from the collaboration between graduate and undergraduate composition students. Grouped all together, we are placed within the same high standard of learning and we are all fortunate to listen to every great guest. Another great strength is the freedom to pursue whichever composition project that we want. This allows musicians from very diverse backgrounds to gather and share their own voice in the class. ",
            "\u00a0This is truly an excellent course; I cannot think of any ways to improve it. ",
            "\u00a0I think better critical response to our pieces would benefit the students greatly ",
            "\u00a0-strengths: engaging guest speakers, accommodating schedule\r\n-weaknesses: could use more structure, direct feedback, a more reliable lesson schedule, and more content-based classes rather than guest lectures ",
            "\u00a0I found my TA to be very helpful, and learned a lot. I also always appreciated the meetings with Dr. A. She is consistently helpful and supportive. However, I wish that in addition to the guest lectures, there could be a real score study component. The guest lectures always felt a bit long to me, so it might be worth looking at spending the first half of seminar looking at a guest's influences, scores, etc, and then have them talk the second half?

            "\u00a0I would (and have!) recommend this course to other students, especially those with a strong musical background. The workload is not too overloading or intimidating, so it is a good place for people even mildly interested in composition to come and learn a lot. ",
            "\u00a0I would strongly recommend this course to anyone interested in music composition of any style.  The professors and TFs all know about many different styles of music, and the guest lectures also cover a broad range of styles and careers. ",
