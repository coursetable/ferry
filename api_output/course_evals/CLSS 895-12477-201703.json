            "\u00a0I learned a lot in this class. I can honestly say my facility with both Greek and Latin improved drastically. ",
            "\u00a0Being exposed to a large number of a variety of texts in a short amount of time was actually very helpful in pushing the boundaries of my language skills, as well as getting to know a greater number of authors than I previously had had the chance to look at before. Looking at Greek epigraphy particularly was very useful, in that I've never done that before. ",
            "\u00a0Exposure to a tremendous breadth of texts important to the study of ancient history.\r\n\r\nIntroduction to resources, databases, and literature needed to tackled specialized kinds of sources, like inscriptions and papyrus fragments.\r\n\r\nThe useful opportunity to develop comfort reading Latin and Greek aloud.

            "\u00a0I think there are three primary things I would change about this course and how it is structured. I list them in descending order of importance, as I see it:\r\n\r\n1) I would separate the Greek and Latin components to separate semesters, allowing the historically-inclined to work on some of the verse documents together as well.  They could be offered in a complimentary cycle with the literature surveys (i.e. Greek when Latin survey is on offer, and vice versa). This will permit more time for difficult authors and more engagement with a wider ranger of texts.\r\n\r\n2) I would recommend an additional hour be added to the class in which the focus will be primarily on additional translation from the week and grammar review.\r\n\r\n3) Consider placing the quizzes online. Taking quizzes in class seemed to consume a lot of time we could have spent grappling with the languages. ",
            "\u00a0The equal focus on Latin and Greek sources in a single course was a nice interdisciplinary experience.\r\n\r\nI really enjoyed the opportunity to analyze a single piece of secondary literature each class. Our discussions often revealed that some of the handbook articles were less than impressive. In a future iteration of the course, perhaps those could be replaced with stronger or more important pieces.\r\n\r\nThe course could do more to situate each of the ancient sources within big diachronic trends, like the development of Greco-Roman historiography. This might be achieved on its own with more time allotted to discussing the primary text themselves.\r\n\r\nFrom week to week there was some variation in the amount of Latin and Greek assigned. The syllabus could be slightly tailored to even this out. "
