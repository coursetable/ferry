            "\u00a0I learned so much about other traditions/religions, how to think about and verbalize visions of the life worth living, and how to formulate my own vision. I also learned how to think through some very difficult topics and verbalize things that are difficult to verbalize/put into writing. ",
            "\u00a0Critical Self Evaluation ",
            "\u00a0Never learned more deeply about how other people throughout history have reasoned their existence in this world-- those traditions that have materialized because of human desire to make sense of it all. I also learned how to locate myself within these traditions. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to ask lots of questions and discuss deep ideas. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a new vocabulary and methodology for trying to evaluate my life, and a new set of questions to aid in that evaluation. ",

            "\u00a0I broadly agree with previous years' reviews about how the course exposes you to traditions you might not have an incentive to closely study otherwise. However, I would say that a weakness of the course is that it depends too heavily on a structure introduced in the first week -- that visions of life worth living can be broken down into how they prioritize three areas (basically, your circumstances, how you feel, and your agency, but the details are not important). I think this limits the course significantly in that it caps how much you can really engage with each tradition. For some traditions, the course questions simply aren't relevant -- in the end of the course, when we try to chart how each tradition answers the course questions, many of the answers don't apply (for example, how the vision of scientific naturalism handles \"failure\").\r\n\r\nDespite this, though, I don't know if there's a better way to structure the course (and the course doesn't presume to teach deeply about each tradition, so it is fine that it doesn't). I still highly recommend the course (especially Matt's section!), but just want to highlight this weakness which might not be avoidable considering what the course attempts to do. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: This course is amazing. I love the format (2 seminars a week, 1 guest lecture). The weekly blog posts are great low-stakes ways to engage with the material. The three essay topics were provocative and engaging. I also very much enjoyed how we reviewed a tradition each week.\r\nWeaknesses: Maybe consider assigning less reading some weeks if possible? Also, sometimes it felt like, once we had the guidelines of the tripartite structure, that we did not necessarily need to learn about the various traditions/religions to write the essays, and thus sometimes the essays seemed a bit unrelated to what we were learning in class. Though, of course, it is understandable to review what different cultures/religions espouse as the LWL in order to help you identify what you like/don't like and how to phrase things, to help eventually guide your own vision. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes wished that we had more time in each unit to discuss concepts more fully, but ultimately it was nice to be able to discuss so many different traditions. You get out what you put in in terms of discussions, so the other people in the seminar are importAnt ",
            "\u00a0Take it with Matt. Great professor!! ",
            "\u00a0This course is obviously fantastic in so many ways and perhaps the best course I've taken at this university. Two recommendations for improvement: better readings for Islam that better showcase more modern and relevant practices of the religion, and inclusion of Hinduism (a major world religion!!!) within the content of the course (perhaps instead of scientific naturalism). I think it is important to include a religion that isn't classically considered monotheistic although many might say Hindus believe in one major deity. ",
            "\u00a0I really didn't like the structure of the course--you basically discuss a different philosophy or religion each week. I would have liked it better if the class had been centered around questions that we discussed each week using a variety of different philosophies/religions. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n- intimate setting, outspoken classmates, and compelling material\r\n- fabulous instruction\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- too much reading ? ",
            "\u00a0This course does a lot of things right when it comes to giving an overview of different traditions. However, we never really debated any of them except for utilitarianism. I mean I get that it's very rare to meet a true utilitarian so debating its merits doesn't really \"attack\" anyone in the group but I really think it would be beneficial for the seminars to debate ALL the traditions or at least discuss them beyond just adding some thoughts to the ideas presented in the readings.

            "\u00a0Yes!!! Matt is the best ",
            "\u00a0If you get Matt's section, just take it -- life worth living is his thing! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! I truly feel like every Yale student should take this course! To learn more about others and yourself! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Great course, well facilitated for learning and discussion and matt was great at encouraging great discussion ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Very important to be able to think critically about the type of person you want to be. Great to take as a jaded senior. ",
            "\u00a0Everyone at Yale should take this course. It frames the rest of your entire life. ",
            "\u00a0Eh...not really. I didn't really enjoy it, except the papers were kind of fun to think about. It was good to overall reflect, but this course was much more about religion than I thought it would be, and I'm not really into religion. I wanted to discuss questions more in terms of a broad range of beliefs, not just dive into a different religion each week. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in learning more about themselves and what they might be missing. This class feels like what I expected I would learn from Yale as a whole, and also what I never could have gleaned from within its walls. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you have the chance, definitely take this class. A lot of seniors take the course in an attempt to try to figure out what they're doing with their life after Yale, which is great for them, but especially as an underclassman the class really shaped my vision of how I want to live my life DURING Yale as well as beyond it which is an invaluable asset to me. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend - pushes you to examine how you craft meaning in your life, which arguably is more important than any other academic subject. "
