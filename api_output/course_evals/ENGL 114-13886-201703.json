            "\u00a0We learned of the various ways privacy is interpreted by academic scholars and former/current justices. We also became more aware of how arguments are presented and heard at the supreme court. For our 4th paper, the assignment involved two mock supreme court sessions. We wrote a brief in groups (2 pages per person) and then gave oral arguments/answered questions by other classmates who were justices. The justices then had to write a 1-2 page opinion and then the roles were flipped for a new topic - justices became lawyers and lawyers became justices. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of grammar skills and my writing became more succinct. ",
            "\u00a0Essentially, this class just reinforced aspects I already know about writing mid-length papers. That said, it did help me think more persuasively and write to rigorously defend my opinion. ",
            "\u00a0At the end of every English course I have taken, I usually realize that my writing has improved. I then try to decide how much of the credit for this improvement goes to the instructor for reading and revising my drafts, and how much goes to the practice of writing and editing for months on end. I have often found that the instructor has little effect, and that my writing improves by virtue of practice alone. This is certainly not the case with Palmer's Modern Privacy.\r\n\r\n\r\nPalmer's class discussions are intellectually rigorous, something that now seems so proper in an English class but that I'm not used to seeing in one. Palmer listens more than he talks, but guides the discussion to where he wants it to go. Sometimes we students can get there on our own, but when we can't, he steers us with prodding questions. Palmer gives every student a chance to speak. Even when inspiration fails us and we repackage what was just said, he waits patiently, just in case we stumble upon something new. If he sees a flash of recognition on our faces when someone else is talking, he'll add us to his mental queue and make sure to follow up on what we have to say. This I appreciate.\r\n\r\nPalmer also has an incredible ability to interpret the mess of sentence fragments and other sounds that Yalies make as we try to explain nuanced takes that we ourselves hardly understand. He can run with any idea of ours, even ones with which he may personally disagree, and see it through to its implications. This is a skill that I admire and hope to work on myself.\r\n\r\nSure, my writing has improved, but that is to be expected with practice writing and revising. I am much more excited to see improvement in my ability to form and analyze arguments. (Although Palmer goes to great lengths to edit our drafts line-by-line, and also write a page of comments about our argument and style.) This class was the most intense my first semester at Yale, but also the most rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about writing at the college level, and how to formulate a strong argument and write succinctly and cohesively. Additionally, how to read dense law articles and read so that I am well prepared for class discussions. ",
            "\u00a0I became a more insightful thinker, and a clearer and more elegant writer. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about writing clear and compelling research papers, as well as some of the most important issues and ideas surrounding the concept of privacy. ",
            "\u00a0I greatly improved my close reading and analysis skills through the readings and discussions in class. In addition, my writing skills, especially with regards to organization, were strengthened by the writing assignments and the great feedback from peers and my professor. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about academic writing, and specifically about the law and philosophy that governs modern privacy. We covered modern privacy theory, where computers, social media, and genetics are all important, and the privacy theory from the 19th century that shaped the way we think about the subject. "
        ],

            "\u00a0It was well organized - we typically had 1 reading (or 2 smaller ones) due for each class and then discussed them in class with my classmates. ",
            "\u00a0Strength is feedback on essays and workload. Weakness is some readings could be removed. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are many, and I have discussed them in my other review (beginning with \"At the end\"). \r\n\r\nMy suggestions are few. I would appreciate if all of the readings were available well before they are to be discussed in class. I also think that we were not given enough time to write the drafts on the first and second essays. I started on them well ahead of schedule to make sure that I had enough time to submit a considered draft worthy of Palmer's attention. I know that this was not the case for most students. Many, faced with only few days between the last class discussion on the material and the first draft due date, wrote their drafts in a matter of hours the night before the deadline. I think it would be better for all if we had more time to think about our drafts. This way the feedback we receive on the drafts would be reflective of our best efforts and applicable to the final draft.\r\n\r\nI know that there are scheduling constraints, imposed by both the calendar and Palmer's action-packed syllabus. This wasn't a big deal, and I don't think many students cared ab/out it, but this was my only problem with the course. ",
            "\u00a0I think the strengths of this course were the discussions and the topic. Additionally, the readings were very interesting and I really liked how the provided different opinions on similar arguments. ",
            "\u00a0Good reading list, classes are well-structured. ",
            "\u00a0I found this course to be excellent as is. ",
            "\u00a0The main strengths lie in the class size, which is perfect to promote discussions with a variety of unique viewpoints and ideas, and the excellent feedback from returned papers, office hours, and peer reviews. The topic and the readings were interesting and, although they were all related to under the umbrella of privacy, the wide range of settings made for great debates and discussions. The main weakness in the class is in the first two or so papers, when you are trying to get a feel for how your professor grades and what he or she is looking for in your writing. The lack of strict guidelines makes it difficult to know if you are on the right track; fortunately, there are peer reviews in class and office hours as well. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was very interesting and engaging. I think some of the readings were hard to get through, and maybe could have used more explanation, but overall the course material was well designed. "

            "\u00a0Definitely. The topics of privacy that we discuss are very interesting. But don't expect it to be all about internet privacy, wiretapping, surveillance, etc. These things are discussed, but it's mainly through other lenses. For example, we'll read foundational legal texts on how privacy is defined and understood in several law reviews, and then compare their understandings of privacy. For example: front stage v back stage/ public v private, panopticon, privacy in terms of trust, etc. We even got to watch Psycho at one point and discuss how privacy is presented in the movie. The workload is manageable, especially since the class meets twice a week so you can easily do the readings over the weekend (or the morning of since this section was at 2:30pm). However, for your third paper, you can write it on any aspect of privacy that you want. Although 114 is just supposed to teach you the skills of writing, this class will definitely help you gain a better understanding of privacy as a whole. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting material. ",
            "\u00a0I certainly would. See my other review beginning with \"At the end.\" ",
            "\u00a0I have been recommending this course to many fellow students because I enjoyed it so much. The discussions were energetic and fun and very applicable to modern day life. Palmer was a wonderful teacher who is just a really great and helpful person. I definitely learned a lot in the class and am sad to done with it this semester. ",
            "\u00a0Yes: this is a great introductory college writing course, and teaches you how to develop your thoughts and structure your arguments. ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course to another student based on the essential skills taught and the interesting readings. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this particular 114 section to anyone who wants to improve as a writer and do so through a thought-provoking, captivating topic. I cannot speak for other sections of the course, but English 114 was my favorite class this semester. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the professor was helpful and interesting, and the material was not only engaging but also highly relevant to our modern life. "
