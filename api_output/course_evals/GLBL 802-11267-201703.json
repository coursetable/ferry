I found the course gave me a significant enhancement in knowledge and skills of calculus and statistical analysis. Prior to this course, my maths skills were rusty but I was excited to return to them and refresh them and this course gave me a great opportunity to do so. The statistical analysis part of the course enhanced my ability to consume and understand statistics. "

It was a challenge that really caused us to do critical thinking and mimicked what we might be tasked with in a job. I would have enjoyed doing some work like that for homeworks.\r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses \r\n- I strongly felt that the time distribution between calculus and Stata was not helpful and not geared towards realistic expectations of skills needed in the workforce. I understand the desire to remind us all the concept of derivatives, and even taking basic derivatives. A quick review is fine. But I really dont expect that in the \"real world\" I'll ever be asked to take the derivate of a logarithmic function or of a complex fraction. We spent a lot of time drilling this, half the semester. The concept is important, drilling into manual complexities is not. \r\nI then felt we spent much too little time on Stata! This is the \"real world\" skill that I really do want to be able to use in my future jobs, and that could reasonably be expected of me from employers. This is the applied part that could actually be useful. I felt we only dipped our toes into Stata and while I did well in the assignments, I am not walking away feeling confident about my Stata proficiency. \r\n\r\nI know this was intended as an introductory course to Statistics, not intended for mastery, but I think we could at least move to greater Stata proficiency if we diverted time away from digging into details of derivatives and utilized that time instead for more Stata. \r\n\r\nIf Jackson is trying to prepare students to be professionals, not mathematicians or academics, then I think future students would benefit greatly from re-adjusting the calculus-Stata balance. \r\n\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I felt the workload of the first 5 or so weeks of homework was insane! We were handwriting 12+ pages of calculations every week. The level of difficulty of the homeworks was fine, but the sheer quantity of questions that we were asked to do was a lot. I would spend 8-10 hours a week doing them. I can understand that one wants to drill it enough that taking derivatives becomes quick and second nature, and we can get to that place with far fewer questions. The later homeworks then calmed to a more reasonable level. ",
            "\u00a0The course was excellent and I do not see how it could be improved, except the statistics part went by very quickly and was for me much harder to follow "
