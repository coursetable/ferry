            "\u00a0Very careful ways to analyze the behavior of people when making decisions. Bayesian probability, decision analysis, EVPI, prospect theory, framing, anchoring, endowment, etc. There were a lot of very specific skills, most of which involve breaking intuitions about logic and consistency. ",
            "\u00a0Thorough understanding of expected value theory, expected utility theory, and prospect theory; ability to solve problems related to Bayesian statistics and expected value of information; insight into the philosophy of science and data presentation. ",
            "\u00a0I learned that everything I had learned in a previous behavioral economics class is wrong, which was a good learning experience. I also learned a lot about how to be a good academic in the sense of making sure your results are replicable. ",
            "\u00a0The course material was extremely interesting, particularly the lectures. I found the main theories to be the most useful (expected value, expected utility, and prospect). ",

            "\u00a0I think Shane knows that this course is a work in progress and at times it was very apparent. I generally support experimental teaching styles, but I think some of the topics ran over out of excitement, which cut time out of other topics that were expected to be covered. Not a huge deal, again, I think Shane knows that is going on and is actively trying to work on it. ",
            "\u00a0Fantastic lectures that are incredibly engaging and thought-provoking. Perhaps more direct guidance on strategies for answering homework/exam questions in class (for example, like when we went over the russian roulette problem in class). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very interesting class and lecture was very engaging and interesting ",
            "\u00a0Shane is very funny but also comes off as quite conceited. He calls his students unsophisticated in class, interrupts them, doesnt listen. It was honestly quite a frustrating class to take. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: lectures were very interesting and the readings fit well with the lectures. Examples were usually relevant and main concepts were explained clearly. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: problem sets often felt disconnected from the course material. Lectures and readings did not prepare students to complete the homework, particularly the math-heavy problem sets. I often looked at the homework and had no idea how to find the solution and had to research the formulas on google. Then Shane would seem confused about why no one did the problems correctly. The final exam seemed to have very little to do with the course material and some of the math problems were completely unintelligible. While I appreciate that the course was not taught to the test, the lectures simply did not prepare us to do well on the final and no resources were provided to understand how to do the math. Homework assignments were also given to us usually a day or two before they were due. It would have been helpful to get them earlier to have more time to complete them. \r\n\r\nThe course would benefit from more clear instruction on the problem sets and perhaps some examples in the lectures. The slides were often just pictures and case studies so they were not helpful for studying after the initial lecture. Additional resources about how to do the problem sets, or more specific office hours would be helpful. We didn't receive problem sets back until the last day of class so it was impossible to know how we were doing. There was also nothing posted on canvas so we couldn't find readings or resources to help. Homework grades were also not posted on canvas. Please, find a TA who knows how to use canvas...it's not that hard. ",

            "\u00a0Timely grading and feedback for assignments would help improve this course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: super interesting material and presentations\r\n\r\nImprovement: quicker grading of assignments so we can incorporate feedback "

            "\u00a0I'm torn because the course material is fascinating but the course was not well organized. I would recommend that other students audit the course so that they can go to the lectures but not be forced to do the problem sets that seemed completely unconnected to the lectures. ",
