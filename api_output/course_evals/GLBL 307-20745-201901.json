            "\u00a0There are very very long readings assigned for each week, and even though I couldn't do all of them each time, I definitely have a very good sense of the general academic discourse around economic development especially in Latin America. The course is presentation-based, and Professor Zedillo's insights were very helpful in guiding us through the theories. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: hearing about about Prof. Zedillo's personal experiences is incredible\r\nWeaknesses: absolutely no feedback throughout the whole semester, plus classes are just student-run presentations ",
            "\u00a0Great course ",
            "\u00a0I wish Professor Zedillo lectured more on specific topics and gave more background. I was a lot more interested in what he had to say than in the students' presentations, which took up most of the time. It would be great if the presentations were 40 min long, and the rest of the time was split between lecture and discussion. The TA wasn't helpful at all. His role in the class was unclear, and he did not give useful feedback on the weekly reading responses that I spent hours reading for and writing (with very little idea of what they were supposed to look like.) ",
            "\u00a0Maybe a final comment that sums up the main points of each class ",
            "\u00a0Professor Zedillo is of course fascinating and I learned a lot from him. The material is also pretty interesting, especially if you're interested in macroeconomic policy. However, I didn't love the presentations format. I found that because presentations lasted the whole class, there was rarely any meaningful discussion between students. Mostly students would just direct questions to Professor Zedillo. "
