            "\u00a0This course was unlike any other class I have taken at Yale. It was effectively a months-long, client-facing consulting project. We met with our client several times over the semester and worked to create deliverables that met their needs. It was thrilling to get the chance to work for UNICEF, and it was an opportunity unlike any other. I picked up valuable skills for employment in the future, such as public speaking, advanced Powerpoint, project management, to name a few. I learned especially how to work and manage a team of nine people, all with different skill sets and working styles, in order to create a cohesive final product. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to work with a team for an extended period of time. I learned how to properly divide and compartmentalize work, and I learned how to interview key professionals. I learned how to create better presentations and how to adapt to changing goals. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to work in a team, approach a complex real-world issue, interact with clients, and source data to form recommendations. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Many of us in the class felt unprepared for the challenge or felt that the project did not work with our strengths. Some of us wanted to work more with data others just didn't clearly know what was expected. While the course provided a real-world simulation of what collaboration may look like in the work place, we would have appreciated more guidance from our instructor. "

            "\u00a0This class is required for Global Affairs majors as their thesis, but I would recommend taking a capstone with Prof. Hecht if you are interested in taking a more active role in shaping the project direction and want to pick up skills that will be valuable in consultancy. I really appreciated the global health focus of the project, and I think the hard/soft skills obtained from this capstone will be helpful post-graduation. However, if you're interested in more of a security-focused capstone with more direction and perhaps more analytics/data-heavy, this is likely not the capstone for you. ",
            "\u00a0It's a requirement, so this question is a bit moot. That being said, the course would be a great recommendation even if it were optional, since it's very much a pre-professional course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, while the capstone has a lot of room for improvement I really enjoyed getting to know my team and working with our client. As someone passionate for global health, it was awesome to get to work with a renowned client on a pressing issue and knowing that they are listening to your recommendations. "
