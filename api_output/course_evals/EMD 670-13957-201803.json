However, if I can have the chance to learn coding work hand in hand by the bioinformatic researcher, that will be much helpful. Or if he can provide me with some learning resource, I can also learn it by myself. By doing that, I will save a great amount of time to do other meaningful stuff. "

Not only gives you advice on academic life but also daily life. He cares about students a lot. Professor Pettigrew also gives me a lot of opportunities to learn. She supported every decision I made(like what I want to learn in her group) and met with me every Monday morning to give me detailed instruction. I appreciated a lot. "
