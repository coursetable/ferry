I recognize that our class was diverse in ability and previous experience and Professor Schmidt did an excellent job of handling the wide range of students, but there were days that I wished that we could have moved faster and, compared to what I've heard from other Coptic classes in previous years, this class was behind. We didn't make it through the book's passage of Mark, which made studying for the final test convenient, but it was also slightly frustrating because I've heard other classes made it to other sources outside the text.
