            "\u00a0I feel much better about my grammar, reading, speaking and listening! ",
            "\u00a0Learned so many new characters, sentence structures. My speaking improved greatly and the weekly tutorials with a TA were very helpful. Xu laoshi and Liang laoshi are very enthusiastic and supportive teachers. ",
            "\u00a0I think my speaking abilities improved significantly as well as my listening. I can make out most of what is being said and with some degree of difficulty can respond. ",
            "\u00a0Language skills improved very rapidly ",
            "\u00a0I learned plenty of new Chinese vocabulary and grammar structures in Chinese 130, and the frequent reading and writing exercises helped me develop my language skills in those areas as well. "

            "\u00a0I enjoyed doing the oral presentations to practice speaking skills. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of work but it really helps you learn Chinese better. The oral presentations (powerpoints) are hard and I didn't find very helpful to my learning. This class teaches you an incredible amount of Chinese in just a few months, and xu laoshi and liang laoshi are amazing teachers. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is the consistency of the curriculum. It is nice to know exactly what is due when. I think we could have, however, spent more instructional time going over the grammar structure and practicing its usage. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the regularity of the course was a strength. Because we did the same thing every week, we could focus on improving our methods of learning characters, practicing listening, etc. However, I thought we could practice learning to speak spontaneously a bit more. Our speaking exercises (besides the oral tests) usually consisted of recording ourselves reading part of a chapter and paying attention to pronunciation and tones. While this procedure helped my tones, I don't think I learned as much about how to hold a naturalistic conversation. "

            "\u00a0Yes I would, I learned a lot very quickly, this course is demanding but totally worth it. The instructions are great! ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class. The workload is tough with about 2 hours a night, some nights more, but the tests and quizzes are very fair and really test your knowledge well. This is a fantastic class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I think it was a well organized course that helped to smoothly transition and continue my Chinese language studies at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend Chinese 130. The teachers were nice and pretty helpful, I liked the tutorials, and the instruction was always reasonably clear. "
