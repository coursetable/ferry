            "\u00a0This course provides a broad survey of Italian film, ranging from the inception of neorealism in Italy's postwar period to the more freeform, postmodern films of the late 90's and 2000's. The weekly screenings are well planned in their order and well discussed in the two 75 minutes lectures. The films are also artfully tied together throughout four units that cover the postwar film, meta-cinema, Italy's retrospective grieving of the Holocaust, and finally the postmodern film. ",
            "\u00a0I certainly now know a lot more about Italian film (and also Italian history and politics) than I did before! Also, this course definitely helped me with my ability to effectively analyze films. And I think it helped me with my writing. ",
            "\u00a0You learn about Italian film from WWII to the present. You will also learn about hw to engage in film analysis. ",
            "\u00a0This was my first film class, and I loved it. I thought the films were, for the most part, very well chosen and that there was a good mix of genres. I learned about both film and Italian history, and I also enjoyed the essays, which were not difficult but provided a nice way to think about the movies. ",
            "\u00a0I learned techniques for general film analysis, as well as specific trends in Italian film. ",
            "\u00a0How to analyze films and a lot on the history of Italy and of Italian Film ",
            "\u00a0I learned to analyze film! This was my first film course. ",
            "\u00a0an increased awareness and appreciation for italian film and film in general. sharpening of essay writing abilities, and historical information on Italy. ",
            "\u00a0Lots of knowledge about Italian Film, Italy, and film as a whole! ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to watch films critically and analytically, what to look for and how to interpret films. I also learned about the rich tradition of post-war Italian film. ",
            "\u00a0As my introduction into film analysis, I gained a newfound appreciation for film, particularly the nuances of form that separate various directors. I also gained better fluidity and coherence in my writing through the writing conferences within the course. I also learned about the beauty of Italian film specifically and its role in the history of post-war Italy. ",
            "\u00a0This is a fantastic course! An excellent introduction to the many many classics of Italian film, taught by a preeminent scholar in the field. Great films, great lectures, great discussions. "

            "\u00a0I thought the course was extremely effective but that the final exam was not a great use of time or an effective way of testing engagement with the course. This is mostly because of its length and its naturein the time span of the final, I don't think students are given sufficient time to put meaningful thought into the powerful prompts we are presented. The result, in general, is a regurgitation of many of the concepts presented throughout the semester but in a disconnected way. The exam prompts would have made for great final paper prompts, which I think should have more if not all of the emphasis in a course like this. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent course! Professor Marcus' passion for the subject really shines through, which makes the class so enjoyable. The close analysis portions of the class are particularly compelling. Does, by the end of the semester, get slightly repetitive in terms of format, but overall I loved this class. ",
            "\u00a0This course is excellently taught. The syllabus is very well organized and prof Marcus explains films incredibly well. She is also so kind. And the TFs were great . ",
            "\u00a0I think that for some movies two lectures were too much, and I also would have liked to have the option of writing about one or two movies rather than three per essay. I loved the movies, and I also liked the way the way that we got overviews of directors/ eras, even when we only watched one film a week. ",
            "\u00a0The only way I think this class could be improved is by having it in a classroom more conducive to group discussion. This is difficult, because it is also beneficial to have all seats facing the same direction for when we are viewing clips. ",
            "\u00a0The readings assigned in this course were never very helpful, and sometimes I thought replacing readings with a second (perhaps optional) weekly screening would have been helpful. Also, sometimes Prof. Marcus's emphasis on \"units\" of interrelated films came at the expense of watching the best or most important films by each director, which I thought was a weakness (particularly for Visconti and Sorrentino.) ",
            "\u00a0This course was fantastic, nothing to change ",
            "\u00a0I wish the film screenings had multiple time offerings. And I wish they'd taken attendance at them! I ended up watching lots of the films on my own but always got more out of the ones I went to screenings for. ",
            "\u00a0Everything about this course was great. The material/readings were always interesting, films were great, I always looked forward to lecture, Professor Marcus had so many interesting things to say but still appreciated our opinions. Essays were always fun to write because the topics and structure were always interesting. Only weakness was that it was a bit stressful having a final and a paper during reading period/exams. ",
            "\u00a0We watch great movies and I like the structure of writing many papers. It would be nice if we could discuss more, maybe in a seminar or section format. ",
            "\u00a0I think the format of the course's 3 meetings is well done, with an introduction into the director on Tuesday, watching the film Wednesday, and analyzing Thursday. In addition, the open setting of class discussion and the knowledgeability of Professor Marcus makes every class period engaging and full of new insights. The main problem with the course was the time period given to write each of the essays throughout the semester, as I felt rather rushed to be given only a few days to write a complete essay after the last class period of the week. Having it due the 2nd period of the week would alleviate much of the stress by only shifting the due date a day or two. "

            "\u00a0Yes. This course changed the way I view film and art in general, and Professor Marcus is one of the most kind and passionate professors you could have the pleasure of meeting at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent course! Professor Marcus' passion for the subject really shines through, which makes the class so enjoyable. It is a writing credit, so you write a lot of papers (4), but the films are, in general, highly interesting and engaging and the paper topics are also interesting, so writing all those papers is not that arduous. You will really gain a batter understanding of film as a medium, as well as a familiarity with Italian film, history, and politics. Would highly recommend this class, even to someone with just a passing interest in film studies. Professor Marcus does a great job making the class accessible to students coming from different fields of study, while still keeping it interesting and engaging for those with more film studies experience. ",
            "\u00a0This course is so good please take it!! I was hesitant because Itlan film seems like a very specific subject. However, you will find the class is extremely interesting and well-taught. Being in this class has also helped me approach other films and life in a whole new way! Also Prof Marcus is AMAZING!!!!!! She is so nice and smart and gets to know all of her students! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is relaxed but still engaging. A great fifth class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to anyone looking to learn about film analysis in general, as well as about Italian film. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student if they are at all interested in film studies, Italian culture, or improving their writing. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a fun way to watch some wonderful movies. Professor Marcus provides steady guidance and though I never left class with my mind exploded, she definitely is an expert and cares deeply about her students. Great for credit/d. ",
            "\u00a0This is a gem, please take it, truly one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Prof Marcus is adorable and such an engaging and wonderful lecturer. Workload is 4 5-pages paper and the grading can be hard if you have a harsh TA but still the class is just so interesting! Again, please take this class!!! ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Definitely the best course Ive taken. See reasons above. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but don't underestimate how tedious writing 4 paper can get. You need to talk about all films in the unit for each paper, which can get very dull. As a student you don't get much agency in your paper topic or other aspects of the class. However, Prof. Marcus is very engaging and it's worth taking just to learn from one of the greatest Italian Film academics. However, note that there seemed to be great disparities in how TAs graded papers from what I gathered from other friends in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Very interesting, even though I have no prior background in Italian history or film studies. Makes you see movies in a new way. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The movies are fantastic and they fit so well wth each other. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would, as even without a film or Italian background I was able to engage in the class and understand the material being taught. The films themselves were fun and interesting for the most part, and the analysis of each furthered my understanding of the film each time without stretching the themes of the film itself. Professor Marcus is a wonderful and knowledgeable teacher who is a pleasure to learn from. "
