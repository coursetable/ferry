            "\u00a0An understanding of Athenian law courts, the construction of sexuality/gender in Ancient Athens, and a better understanding of forensic rhetorical strategy! ",
            "\u00a0Much better Greek; much more interesting ways of thinking about gender, especially masculinity; a general sense of the strategies and forms of forensic oratory; a better knowledge of ancient Athenian legal systems. ",
            "\u00a0My ability to craft mellifluous and accurate translations improved significantly, and my ability to analyze and synthesize rhetorical arguments grew by leaps and bounds. "

            "\u00a0The strengths of the course include the extraordinarily interesting choice of texts, the worksheets that would supplement our understanding of the material, and, of course, Professor Greenwood! I loved that we would split the course into both translating and discussion each time, and Professor Greenwood made extraordinarily reasonable expectations for course reading and assignments. ",

            "\u00a0YES. This might be my favorite course that I have taken at Yale (and certainly within the Classics department)! The material of this course is very interesting and provides a lot of fodder to work with in when thinking about social constructionism. You will develop a better understanding of the meaning of \"justice\" in Athenian law courts and grapple with the importance of narrative development. This class is a MUST if Prof. Greenwood is teaching! ",
            "\u00a0Probably only to students who are interested in Greek history or literature -- it's a lot of work to put in if you're not interested in the subject matter. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely.  The course material was interesting and entertaining, and Professor Greenwood was a stellar instructor, equal parts engaging and informative. ",
            "\u00a0Yes "
