I have learnt too many new techniques/skills to list here, but it is definitely true that this class has been by far the most useful course I have taken in grad school, more so than the MCGD required classes.

            "\u00a0My opinion of this course is very good. However, there are a couple of things that could be improved: \r\n\r\n1) Design a more logical and cohesive lecture component. For example, we started this class by taking about gene regulation and RNA seq and then we talked about identifying the causal genetic variants that drive the changes in gene expression. To me the genetics section should covered before regulation and transcriptomics as genetic variants modulate transcription and influence mRNA levels. I think a more logical flow for the course would be: a) HPC, linux and basic programming (Knight and Mane), b) sequencing platforms and genetics (Knight, Lek, Bale and Cotsapas) c) Regulation, RNA and transcriptomics (Noonan and Giraldez) d) Proteomics (Reinhart) and e) Further applications of the techniques learned (Reinke, Smita and Chen, Goodman). This order is more intuitive to me as it follows more closely the central dogma.  \r\n\r\n2) Re-shuffle the corresponding problem sets so that they match the lecture component described above.\r\n\r\n3) It would be good to further expand on the topics covered in this course with subsequent follow up courses that are targeted specifically to a) research in human genetics with an emphasis on coding and new genomic programing languages (e.g. hail), b) gene regulation, transcriptomics, and programming where a more in-depth analysis of chip-seq, mRNA data and HiC/ATAC data is explored. c) A more in-depth computational genomics course in the applications covered (proteomics, single cell sequencing, metagenomics, and other omics techniques, phylogenies?).

            "\u00a0The lectures were extremely variable. some were very good, and some were very weak/ ",
            "\u00a0Professor Noonan's lectures were great, and I enjoyed when the class got into the weeds of how the programs we are actually using work. Genomics can be a black box, and demystifying that black box is integral to our proper use of these powerful tools. To that end, it felt that several of the guest lecturers did not tell us much about the inner workings of the programs or techniques in question, and it felt much more like a survey class than an in-depth class. \r\n\r\nThe PS's and TA meeting sessions were vital to making this class as effective as it was, and I enjoyed them greatly even in their difficulty. \r\n\r\nThe group assignment for the group projects was interesting. On one hand, random assignment of individuals is by definition fair, but on the other hand it led to members of the groups having very diverse interests and skill sets that did not always align. If the point of the project is to mimic a collaborative effort it did not quite succeed in this regard. Grouping students by academic interest (transcriptomics, epigenetics, human mutation investigation) may lead to more interest by all members of the group in the project.\r\n\r\nI liked the use of piazza and the dropbox pages.

            "\u00a0The only major improvement that I could suggest would be for the lectures to be more in-sync with the discussion sections and Problem sets. "
