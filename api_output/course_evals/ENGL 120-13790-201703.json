            "\u00a0English 120 is a fabulous introduction to college writing or a great way to meet a writing distributional requirement for upperclassmen. You need to make sure you get a good professor however, because that can really make or break the course since they are responsible for choosing the readings and facilitating class discussions. ",
            "\u00a0I think the most useful skills I got from this class were 1) a practice in writing drafts and changing/improving them greatly for the final draft and 2) a practice in constant churning out of material. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write a creative, non-fiction essay. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read creative nonfiction pieces for craft, and several techniques to use in my own writing. My creative nonfiction skills definitely increased over the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I am a better writer because of this course, but even more, a better reader! ",
            "\u00a0I was introduced to a form of writing - the modern essay - that I've never considered pursuing much study in. Not only have I begun to love new writers, but I've honed my essay-writing skills and exercised much creativity. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0For STEM majors, this course was a great break from psets and I actually looked forward to the readings and writing of the actual essays since they were all very different and open to whatever you wanted to write about. I had not done much creative nonfiction before this and I loved it. ",
            "\u00a0This was a great course.  We got to read a variety of essays by many different authors, and we discussed the techniques used by the authors in class.  Then we got to write our own essays using the tools we had acquired through reading.  It was a very effective way to learn how to write. ",
            "\u00a0The course was genuinely fun, with interesting pieces to read and interesting topics to write. Professor Jones was a great discussion facilitator, and gave very helpful feedback. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are its focus on student contributions during discussion and the rigor of the course load. Not much to add about weaknesses! "

        [
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend to anyone looking to take a writing credit. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I'm a senior who took this during a busy semester as I was writing my senior thesis, and I still don't regret taking it. I took this class because I hadn't written creatively, specifically personal non-fiction, since high school. It was such a nice experience to return to this mode of my writing at the end of college, after so, so many stuffy academic papers. I think I became a better writer - I think we all did. The greatest attribute of this class is the intense, personal attention you get from your instructor. Prof. Jones was so wonderful and gave such thoughtful, thorough advice for each student. She met with basically every student one-on-one before their final drafts too. I really valued this attention, which is actually pretty rare I find to get from professors at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the class was very interesting and fun.  The essays we read were very enjoyable to read, and the essays were equally as enjoyable to write.  The class-time consisted of class discussions, which were also very informative and enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student at Yale, despite their major. It is fun and very helpful to someone who either wants to improve their creative nonfiction skills, or explore a new area of writing! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would. It's a great introduction to modern essays, and has given me a new appreciation for this form of writing. A fantastic course. "
