            "\u00a0The seminar went very in depth with theories and historical examples of populism. It gave not only information about populism itself, but of broader political science analytical techniques and ways to view politics. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to identify populism in leaders, social movements, and political parties. I also learned how populism affects democracy and how it is used as both a strategy and ideology by political actors. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This course forces you to think critically about a topic, populism, that dominates contemporary discourse. Prof. Aslanidis expects his students to engage with the course material and to develop their own perspective on the materials we discuss in class. The material covers a wide and intriguing range of current and historical case studies, from the 19th Century U.S. to modern-day Western Europe. This course encourages intellectual growth, in the way you think about discourse and political strategy, and Prof. Aslanidis cultures that growth by expecting a lot from his students. ",
            "\u00a0A strength is that the topic is narrow in the sense that it focuses on just populism, but in doing so, students can go very deep and learn more about political science generally. A weakness is that the essays written can be very broad as they have no prompt which can be a strength for some but for others it can be difficult to know if you are doing the assignment correctly. It's important to be proactive and seek help from the professor. ",
            "\u00a0Very good course. The readings were very interesting and the lectures were informative. To improve the course, the professor could encourage more class discussion. "

        [
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course to another student, with the stipulation that the readings are central to course discussions. While there are always 3-4 readings per session, they tend to be quite interesting and they lend themselves to engaging conversations during the seminar. The course covers a great breadth of material (in both time periods and geographic regions), has an appropriate amount of work (midterm paper, final paper, and relaxed, in-class quantitative exercise), and forces you to think critically about a topic which you probably already hold some mis/preconceptions. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend it to students that are not only interested in populism, but also are proactive and will do readings. It's hard to be engaged if you don't do the readings. ",
            "\u00a0Yes because the course was both interesting and informative. "
