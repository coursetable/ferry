            "\u00a0This seminar was pointless. We met like 3 times and the professors just asked \"Is there anything you want to tell us?\". It wasn't a productive use of anyone's time. Seminars should be more frequent and purposeful. ",
            "\u00a0I feel like this was an okay opportunity to meet and discuss SBS related issues, but could certainly be more frequent, and more structured. I feel like I am still hazy on course selection for next year, and didn't get as much face to face time with professors as I would have liked. A less formal and more mingle type seminar would be helpful at least once or twice within the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I wish we would have had section more frequently, as I would have loved to get to know the faculty and my fellow students more. I feel like this would have been a good chance to connect with my SBS cohort (especially if we could have eaten during section). The sections we did have were interesting though! ",
            "\u00a0monthly meetings don't make much of a seminar ",

            "\u00a0Most of it was useless, especially for students who've had job experience (not even extensive experience). Perhaps make it more worthwhile with actual, real-world activities or maybe get rid of it ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Engaging, interesting to hear from speakers coming in\r\nNot enough meeting times to have weaknesses ",
            "\u00a0The smaller seminars with more discussion were helpful, and it was nice to see other people in the department and talk about events/improvement areas with Trace and other faculty. It would have been nice to have had better lunches, as we were told during the accepted students day that they provided healthy lunches during the seminars. ",
            "\u00a0Should be more consistent and offer food options other than sandwiches ",

            "\u00a0Fantastic guest lecturers. Only weakness was the inconsistency with when the seminars took place. Would have been great if they were every other week. ",
            "\u00a0The seminars throughout the semester were helpful and interesting. It may be improved if there were more of them - but I know there are limitations to the budget on this. Really appreciated the opportunity to meet with a speaker one-on-one, which was offered to any student who so desired. ",
            "\u00a0Only had a few seminars the whole semester with half of those few being a speaker, not much to say ",

            "\u00a0I enjoyed the course. It was interactive and engaging ",
            "\u00a0We only had two seminars if I recall correctly. One was advertised under a completely different title and topic. It seemed disorganized in general, but that was fine with me. Main complaint: there were insufficient options for people with dietary restrictions (allergies, vegetarian, lactose free, etc). I often couldn't eat during the seminar. Really not acceptable since simply planning better and more inclusive meals should be a given for a required lunchtime seminar. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed all the lectures! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - we had some great speakers come in to talk about relevant public health experience, it was also a safe space to discuss our experience in the Yale MPH program\r\nWeaknesses/Improvements - I felt like we did not really have that many speakers come in, having a more consistent speaker series would allow students to gain more from this seminar. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were very engaging and relevant though the discussions were not particularly approachable if the professor with whom you have a concern is sitting in the room listening to the discussion. More approachable forums to voice concerns could be with just the chair of the department or with fewer teaching professors present. ",
            "\u00a0I only went to this course on two occasions, as it was only required for first-years twice. I was disappointed that the course was not more intensive. It would have been a wonderful opportunity to get to know other SBS students and faculty. "
