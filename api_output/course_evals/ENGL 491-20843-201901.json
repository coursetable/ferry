            "\u00a0I learned how to conduct a long-term project and write a much longer paper than I have ever written before.  I also learned how to better integrate sources into my writing and to conceptualize a broader thesis. ",
            "\u00a0Throughout the course, I refined my ability to work various framework and put them in conversation with one another. I learned to give the text deeper meaning and situated it within literary discourse. I also learned the difficulty of doing too much research. ",
            "\u00a0Taking this course with Prof. Reed was a tremendous gift; he helped me become more confident in my writing, pushed me to express my ideas in the clearest possible way, and constantly made himself available for in-depth conversations about and dissections of my argument. I came away from this course with the sense that I really knew how to do research in my field, a sense that had been incubated but never developed as fully in my other classes. "

            "\u00a0Perhaps a second adviser or slightly more varied program of meetings with professors. ",
            "\u00a0I think I would have benefited from more structural and organizational help earlier on. Julia was amazing, but I feel like the advice she gave me would have been helpful earlier! ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely loved having senior essay lunches to discuss our progress on our essays.  It was great to hear what everyone was working on and to have to consistently think about and work on my own project.  I think the lunches and internal deadlines were helpful in making sure I continued to work on my project; the fact that it ended up taking longer than I expected was more my fault than anything the department could have done. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the chance that this course gave to form an intellectual community around the act of knowledge production; our weekly meetings were relaxed but also a really helpful way of checking in and reassuring each other about a writing process that might otherwise have been unduly stressful. I also appreciated that we were able to set our own schedule with our advisors, depending on what we needed. In terms of weaknesses, I have very little to say; the class was stellar from start to finish. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend writing a senior essay, especially to students who have a deep interest that they would like to pursue independently.  I think I became a much stronger writer and thinker as a result of writing a senior essay, as hard as it was, and am grateful to have had the opportunity to push myself this way. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, yes, yes! A thesis is a TON of work, but the payoff is so worth it. Also, the relationship you form with your advisor is tighter and more intellectually stimulating than any you could form by simply taking a standard class with them. "
