            "\u00a0I learned how to read and assess the merits of fairly complex regression analyses and correlation studies, as well as to apply my knowledge of European history to other contexts. I especially liked the second part of the semester, where we studied patters of state formation in South America, Africa, and China, using the material encountered earlier in the class to cast light on topics ranging from civil war to  ethnic strike and regional separatism. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read political science papers and to develop serious critical thinking skills around every single difficult argument. Walking out of this course, I now possess not only so much interesting history about state formation processes but also about the theories that drive modern state formation. This is a fascinating course. ",
            "\u00a0This course is invaluable to anyone interested in learning about the formation of states, how states have consolidated in the past and how they can consolidate in the present day. The course has a pretty wide scope - going from the earliest origins of states up until the present day in various regions of the world. You will learn about the specificities of state formation in various contexts (Early Modern Europe, China, pre-colonial Africa, etc.) and think about whether or not we can derive a single theory of state formation. Since the field of studying state formation within political science is fairly new and dynamic, there is a strong critical analysis element to the course, and you will get much better at evaluating the quality of an academic paper and the methodology it uses. ",
            "\u00a0I now have a solid foundation in my understanding of how states all over the world have formed historically and how state capacity has been developed. I have a better notion of the timelines of state formation in separate regions and of why states currently boast a wide range of abilities in terms of providing public goods, etc. I also feel more comfortable reading literature about state formation now and being able to build off of the knowledge I acquired this semester. ",
            "\u00a0Some stats knowledge, and I learned a lot about reading academic papers, what to trust and what not to trust, and how to decipher important takeaways. It's a good class to learn how to be a more serious academic. ",
            "\u00a0This class provides a comprehensive overview of the literature on state formation and highlights the three dominant hypotheses for why states have formed (war, trade, and political competition). The literature we read for the course covers a broad range of disciplines, from political science to sociology to anthropology to history. You come away from the course with a solid understanding of the primary debates in this field of research and the tools to develop your own opinions on them. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt how to read political science papers, as well as understand the development of political organization (on the state level) through history. "

            "\u00a0I cannot find any weaknesses to this course. The assigned papers are engaging and illuminating, and Professor Queralt is an amazing section leader. I loved the way in which seemingly compelling research papers by prominent authors would consistently be torn apart in class, a fact that shows how crucial it is for students to possess an inquisitive, critical mindset. ",
            "\u00a0This course is difficult, but very interesting once you get into it. There is a lot of very good content, but the amount can be staggering. I sometimes wished that we could just read one paper really in-depth every week for my own sanity, but that would then cause the loss of some of our interesting discussions. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength of this course is that it leaves you with no choice but to be engaged. With nine reading response papers over the course of the term on challenging readings you will definitely develop your analysis skills and judgement on the quality of a paper. Class discussions are based on the readings too, and this is absolutely not a class where you can show up without being super solid on what the week's readings were about! Prof. Queralt has high expectations, and will give you detailed feedback on your written work. I learned more in this class than in the vast majority of the other courses I've taken at Yale.\r\n\r\nOne weakness of the course is that at times the readings reveal a worrying direction that the field of political science as a whole seems to be taking - there is way too much of a focus on quantitative analysis, and authors sometimes build models on shaky assumptions that could be argued much more efficiently using a qualitative toolkit. Furthermore, the class focuses little on ideology, which seems strange given that it has played such an important role in legitimizing governments and rulers throughout much of history.\r\n\r\nHowever frustrating this can feel at times it is also very useful, and Prof. Queralt does this on purpose - you will learn to recognize methodological flaws in the models that scholars build in an attempt to prove an argument, and if you are interested in working for an international organization that makes policy decisions based on similar papers and reports, knowing how to separate good methodology from bad methodology is an invaluable skill. ",
            "\u00a0The material itself is just really interesting and the readings are really well selected so each week feels like an extension of the previous one. Although it's a lot of reading, the weekly reading responses keep you responsible for doing the work which made the actual seminar time enjoyable because everyone was on the same page. My only complaint is that I wish we had been given discussion questions or things to think about before each class/while writing our reading responses. Some of the readers were quite long and dense and it was sometimes difficult to pinpoint what he wanted us to get out of them. ",
            "\u00a0Professor is a bit too harsh, can be counterproductive to learning because all he really cares about is himself being right, not educating the students, though he does that by being really difficult and challenging the students by being so difficult. ",
            "\u00a0I can think of only two problems with this course. One, there are way too many readings to write the required reading 2 page reading responses without writing a fairly bland overview. Also, the number of readings means that we would often get to the last text with barely any time left in class. Other than that, the class was wonderful and one of the best learning experiences I've had at Yale. The readings are fascinating, Didac is super intelligent, and the papers are very manageable. ",
            "\u00a0The discussion format of the class is very good. Professor Queralt does a good job of both directing students towards key points in the readings and posing open-ended questions which invite debate in class. The course is organized in a logical fashion, and I felt like each week successfully built on knowledge we had developed in previous weeks. I think the structure of the course, which begins with theories of state formation in Europe and then moves toward examining how these theories apply to the rest of the world, is great. I definitely felt during the first part of the course that I was eager to understand how these theories apply in other contexts. \r\n\r\nYou will also learn how to read papers well in this course--Professor Queralt points out methodological errors in many of the papers we read, which I found really helpful. He pointed out a lot of things that I wouldn't have thought to look for. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course are the curated readings, and Prof Queralt's dedication and insightful seminar comments. The weakness is that the course readings might be too heavy at times, but it pays off at the end of the course. "

            "\u00a0I would strongly recommend State Formation to any student even vaguely interested in interdisciplinary studies combining history, economics, political science, and international affairs. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to an upperclassman studying political science, or someone interested in learning a bunch and who is willing to take a lot of time to engage with the readings. Otherwise, take it, but use your credit/D/fail. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you're interested in working for international institutions or think tanks that give policy recommendations to developing countries, this class will really teach you a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This a great course that is really well-organized to facilitate student learning. If you are interested in understanding why states today have different capacities to provide public goods, tax their populations, etc, you need to take this. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you want to learn about academia, but it IS A LOT OF WORK. The syllabus doesn't look too bad, but you really have to read every sentence of the readings to even compete with your classmates, so watch out. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this course if you are genuinely interested in the subject. I feel like I learned so much, and the class was very engaging. It is also a huge amount of reading, so not a course to take lightly. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this was one of the more demanding classes I've taken at Yale but also one of the most intellectually stimulating. Didac is an incredibly smart professor and you will learn so much from him. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to students who are interested in the subject matter--It is well-structured and the readings are fascinating. The discussion in class is stimulating, and Professor Queralt guides the conversation towards interesting conclusions. The workload is somewhat intense since you have to write a reading response most weeks, but all this really means is that you have to start the readings earlier than you otherwise would. FYI, the class tends to attract a lot of PolySci assholes, perhaps because of the Game of Thrones-esque subject matter, so be ready to deal with that. Professor Queralt did a pretty good job of making sure they didn't dominate the conversation, though I did feel at times like our class was derailed by one asshole who wanted to monopolize the discussion. ",
            "\u00a0I'll recommend this course for whoever's interested in the development of statehood and state functions, and is willing and has the time to do a deep dive into about 3-4 journal articles a week. The class may have a steep curve for those who have little experience with quantitative political science or game theory, but by the middle of the semester, you'll see the hard work pay off as you begin to understand the journal articles better. The insights you gain from the course become applicable beyond a historical analysis of state formation, and helps us to understand the world today, and the common pitfalls in approaches to improving living conditions in the world.
