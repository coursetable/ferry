            "\u00a0I gained insight into the field of cybernetics, networking, and how histories of science interact with histories of art. I came to think of the Cold War period in a different light through this class. ",
            "\u00a0Media Cultures of the Cold War was not at all the class I expected it to be. In a way, I'm reminded of Foucault's \"The Birth of Biopolitics.\" He baits and switches his College de France students, thinking they're taking a class on \"Biopolitics\" and then gives a full semester-long diatribe on the rise of the ordoliberal governmentality in Germany and libertarianism in America. N.b., I did not take Pam's prior \"Precarity\" course, so I'm both (a) hoping I remember my undergrad Foucault correctly, and (b) was not at all thinking \"Media Cultures of the Cold War\" to turn into \"Prelude to Neoliberalism.\" \r\n\r\nI hope Pam receives this whole Foucault comparison as a compliment because I think that's what I'm going for, here.\r\n\r\nHere I was, somehow expecting to activate my knowledge of Soviet nonconformist art and bring a Warsaw Pact perspective to a syllabus I first read as \"Media Cultures of NATO,\" and ultimately walked away with: an almost indelible familiarity with Fred Turner's \"democratic surround\"; a new respect for the Eames Office, buckyballs, and the Sokolniki Park exhibition; histories of leisure in America from the 19th century to the postwar moment; an Adornian fear of top-down media; Weiner's love for distributed networks; a new lease on that tired old hack Clement Greenberg; and a lingering obsession with traffic management.  As if a testament to this, my one attempt to talk about Soviet performance art was a complete and total failure: there was simply no room for it in the narrative of the course. This wasn't about the Cold War, per se, so I lacked the ground to plant that material and fell flat on my face.\r\n\r\nIt is to Pam's immense credit as a teacher and facilitator that the content, the key points, the frameworks--whatever you'd like to call them--turned out so lucidly in my recollection. I went from zero to \"Family of Man\" in 10 weeks. Here I am, a scholar of 19th century landscape art opining freely and passionately about nuclear deterrence and the ontology of the game versus the work of performance art. All throughout this course, there was some disciplinary gremlin pounding away at my self-consciousness, wondering: \"Who the hell does this Industrial Revolutionary think he is? Where's his modernist credentialing? His theory certificate?\" that I think Pam's generosity as interlocutor helped quash. \r\n\r\nI definitely have also developed an awareness of how differently an area study like Slavic Languages and Literatures talks about its subject matter compared to the contemporary history of art. True or false: Allende's Cybersyn suite is like Rodchenko's workers' club because it has wood in it. The art historian says: \"Sure, it's modular and multi-purpose and is sensuously similar.\" The Slavist rears up in indignation, however, and swears that: \"No, Rodchenko is mobilizing a long history of wood kustar fabrication that goes back to craftsmen in Moscow making prefabricated homes for a literal 'fire-sale' market. It has a national and culturally specific dimension in play at an exhibition (producing a bolshevized Russianness) that can't possibly be at work half a world away in Chile.\"\r\n\r\nI mean, the contemporary art historians in the room would look at the legacy of Constructivism and think in abstract terms like \"material agency\" and \"medium specificity\", while me--the social historian of art who is only half a Slavist--jumped to more concrete terms like \"VKhUTEMAS\" and the \"First State Textile Printing Factory\" and \".\" It got to the point where I felt we'd be speaking different languages (yes, sometimes we actually were however feeble my command of Russian), though we were talking about the same material: talking right past one another, really.\r\n\r\nThose exchanges were as, if not more enlightening than Fred Turner. I still feel like a bull blasting his through the semantically-precise porcelain shop established by my more theoretically-committed colleagues. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to adapt my writing to different styles and identify ways in which archives have or have not been worked with. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a broad background in scholarship addressing media culture/visual culture during the Cold War. The assignments were especially helpful for learning how to synthesize a body of literature. ",

            "\u00a0The seminars were very well run and Professor Lee consistently engaged us and had fellow students engage each other in discussion. The presentations were also very useful and running seminar discussion was a good and important exercise for me to practice as a graduate student. \r\nI think some of the reading felt haphazardly organized, but I'm not sure if that's because of my own unfamiliarity with the topics at hand. ",
            "\u00a0I think Pam has cracked the key to the dreaded ritual of response papers. I had a similar seminar this term that required we submit response papers every week (except when we were presenting, and we presented a total of three times), and I also sat a seminar last term where we'd write the response paper every other week on an A/B rotation.\r\n\r\nNow, in the case of the former: the seminar paper became a chore and was not at all very exciting to write and just mostly recapitulated the key arguments in the articles under review. In the case of the latter: I ended up not having any stakes in what we'd write about for that week, and pine longingly for the more exciting article assigned to the subsequent week's rotation, all grass-is-greener-like.\r\n\r\nPam's decision to ask students to write only three of these short response papers on any week of their choosing a) appealed to my conditioned Franklinian sense of never putting off until tomorrow what can be done today, b) kept the response papers from being a chore, and c) allowed me to dive down rabbit holes that I didn't think I'd ever delve. I just happened to have \"New Haven: Reshaping the City 1900-1980\" on my bookshelf for the week we were talking about designing the US Interstate System for the atomic holocaust and managed to do some good work with it after reading up on the difference between a system interchange and a service interchange.\r\n\r\n(I can say this: It may be six months from now, or six years from now, but Pam is going to get an email from me one day containing traffic simulation screenshots proving how much of a nightmare Norbert Wiener's \"life belts\" would be for commuters on a daily basis.) \r\n\r\nThe weakness is also paper related: I honestly felt like I ended up repeating myself in the second writing assignment, a proposal for a research article directed at the editor of a major journal. The first writing assignment, a summary bibliographic essay, was still very much needed to introduce key concepts at the front half of the article proposal, so I raided it rather judiciously instead of producing all-original prose. This qualifies as a weakness, only because I actually think I had enough material to block out a 20-25 page draft right there and right then, as my archive was quite conveniently located at Yale (or, rather, out in Orange, CT). I'll probably wait, now, until a catalog entry needs writing about this content, as--I've intimated elsewhere in this evaluation--I come to post-war art as a relative outsider with no disciplinary credentialing per se. ",
            "\u00a0I honestly have no complaints about this course. Pam Lee facilitated discussion is such a way that it was directed but not limiting. I felt like I got a lot out of the course because our class time was focused and directed and the materials were diverse but thoughtfully knitted together. ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus gives a good progression through the topics and I find it helpful when a text or a name is referred back to in a later context, but some definitely came up more than others, e.g. Cybernetics had a very central role which I did not expect. The scope and depth of the material are good for building close-reading skills, and the readings often served as the touching stone for my research in other classes. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Fascinating topics, materials, readings. Feedback from professor on each assignment was very specific and helpful \r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes wasn't clear how each week's topics/readings built on each other. ",
            "\u00a0It is a class that evades any singular narrative to this moment in history. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes. I think that especially as a historian its important to be around other perspectives and ways of working with materials, visual culture, and the archive. ",
            "\u00a0Heck, I'd recommend this course to my mother. I had half a mind to email her Brown's article on neoliberalism as soon as I finished reading it, thinking: \"A-ha, here are the levers that really move the world! Wouldn't it be great if the true blue-collar working class--compared to me, the limply liberal idle intellectual--could have at their disposal such a lucid description of the rationality that integrates itself into every aspect of their lives and subordinates them to its will?\"\r\n\r\nNow, obviously, I didn't do that. But then I heard all that seminar's subsequent bellyaching about being \"forced\" to buy things from Amazon after 31,000 supermarket employees had just that morning won a perilous pay-less strike for higher wages and better benefits and thought second of my initial skepticism...\r\n\r\nThis is all to say: I think regardless of your disciplinary specialization, we are of the moment outlined by the course's syllabus. Scholars like Adorno and Wiener; the movement from Fascism to Counterculture and Counterculture to Cyberculture; the evolution of media technologies from the radio to the internet is of profound significance for the contemporary historian of art working in the 21st century. Furthermore, for the historian of 19th century art, it's helpful to have some trajectory for how Smith and Marx and Engels ultimately panned out in the 20th century as context; the light at the end of the tunnel, so to speak, that turns out to be Milton Friedman's Ayn Randian locomotive all fired up and raring to go. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This was a wonderfully expansive and engaging course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the course is great for identifying novel areas of research ",
            "\u00a0Yes, provided a broad grounding in this area and really generative topics for thinking more about media culture and art during the cold war and in the present ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend this class! Professor Lee is an amazing, thoughtful instructor who illuminates the media cultures of the Cold War in a fresh way. It is also a thoroughly interdisciplinary course that spans art history, history of science, and more. "
