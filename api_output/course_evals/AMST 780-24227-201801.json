            "\u00a0Rather than purely posing discussion questions for each week, it might be useful to have students also summarize the text to make sure that everyone is on the same page in understanding the argument and how effective it is. ",
            "\u00a0I liked that many classes had a particular concept to unpack--price, property, wage, etc. It was also good to include the foundational readings (Marx, Polanyi, Wood). Class discussion was robust and expansive.\r\n\r\nA few of the weeks of reading could be maybe a little excessive. (Urban geography week--Self, Harvey, Gilmore comes to mind. Hard to complete that much reading in a week.) Maybe I'm a wimp, but when it's over 350 pages, it becomes very difficult to finish, especially with other classes' readings. "

            "\u00a0Yes-it was a good intensive course in political economy. I would warn them, though, to make sure they have enough time to devote to some of the weeks of reading. "
