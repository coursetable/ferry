            "\u00a0This course not only is a wonderful exposure to important issues in education and more generally in society at large, but offers a strong foundation from which to approach further law/policy related courses and work. ",
            "\u00a0We learned a great deal about the history of American education and the legal principles that are relevant in settling various disputes. ",
            "\u00a0Through this course, I explored the body of case law governing our education system and learned to apply precedent to analyze  legal situations in schools. ",
            "\u00a0I think one of the most fruitful exercises of this course was teaching us how to apply case law to various hypothetical problems in the book. In contrast to other law courses I've taken at Yale, in which we have simply read and memorized cases, this course enabled me to really engage with the material, write papers in which I was asking and grappling with questions that interested me, and think about the application of case law in the real world. ",

            "\u00a0This course has become the benchmark with which I assess truly exceptional class experiences. Everything from choosing how and when to fulfill the paper requirement to the arc and thematic organization of the course was brilliant.\r\n\r\nMy one comment would be to perhaps focus more time in class on the application and discussion phase of the seminar. It was very helpful that Judge Garfinkel spoke to the historical significance of many of the cases and issues we discussed, but at times I found myself wanting to grapple with some of these challenging issues head on on a more regular basis. ",
            "\u00a0Judge Garfinkel is a strong instructor.  He always leads riveting class discussions, and the feedback he provided on my writing/legal analyses over the term has immensely helpful to my growth.  I highly recommend taking any opportunity you have to learn from Judge Garfinkelhe truly makes this course special. ",
            "\u00a0I think the flexibility of the course is a strength, as it is rare at Yale to find professors who trust students enough to create their own deadlines and submit original work that is not based off of a specific prompt. That really forced me to think about what we had read and how I wished to engage with it. In addition, I liked that on some days Judge Garfinkel taught the course as if it were a real law course, cold-calling students on the facts and holdings of cases. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Judge Garfinkle is so knowledgeable and experienced, and he also cares a lot about and engages with students thoughts and questions. The reading was super interesting to me, because Ive been interested in education issues and it was neat to have a purely legal perspective. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Class time could strike a better balance between Judge Garfinkle lecturing about the cases and student/class discussion.

            "\u00a0PLEASE TAKE THIS COURSE!!! It is arguably the best learning environment I have had during my time at Yale, where I felt excited to dig deep into the material and push myself in and outside of class. You'll walk away feeling truly enlightened, and excited to continue pursuing the issues from the course. ",
