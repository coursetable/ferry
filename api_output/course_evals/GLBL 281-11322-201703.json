Truly, I learned a lot about the behind-the-scenes of warfare that I never knew, and I really enjoyed examining why military powers rise and fall. ",

You learn a lot of grand strategy -- how technology impacts warfare and great powerhood, the relation between economics, military, and great powerhood, etc. Prof Kennedy is a legend, and the chance to listen to him twice a week is not to be missed! ",

            "\u00a0Good improve the lectures by being a bit more engaging for students perhaps by varying the ways they are given. ",
            "\u00a0In all honesty I took this course to be an easier class on my schedule, but this became my favorite course I have ever taken at Yale. I love professor Kennedy's lectures (he is a gem), I was lucky and had an amazing TF, and the material was engaging in that it connects to so many other histories. ",
            "\u00a0STRENGTHS: emphasis on connections between military, economic, and technological developments. Strong sense of thematic continuity & recognition of genuine changes.\r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES: I know it's military history of the West, but I think it's shortsighted to spend the 18th & 19th centuries talking about intra-European conflicts and financial developments and technological innovations while treating colonialism as a side story. Obviously Britain had a better tax system than France, but it's weird to spend so much time meditating on superior tax structures without integrating how colonial powers took wealth from their colonies into that same discussion. It's weird to spend so much time talking about technological innovation spurred by intra-European competition without noting that colonial powers used much older means of violence in their colonies, like dogs were used to sow terror in the Caribbean. All these things are intensely relevant to the military history of the West: they just happen not to physically take place in the West as it's imagined by this course, and that imaginary is vaguely defined anyway, given the United States' sudden entrance after the Civil War. I know the course is necessarily limited, and that's okay. I just think it needs to spend more time explaining its conception of the West, especially when the US arrives, in order to more clearly set expectations. ",
            "\u00a0I found the material fantastic and very interesting. It focuses on the big ideas, which is not for everyone. Lectures focus on big trends and are very low on actual material or information, so you have to do the readings to be able to write about what's going on. ",
            "\u00a0It was hard to know what to study for the midterm and finals because nothing was incredibly stressed besides very broad ideas. ",
            "\u00a0Paul Kennedy is a great lecturer and very insightful. Andy Hogan the TA was very awesome they both made learning fun. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: good topic. Weakness: too broad, no specificity, easy to blow off. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Kennedy is a legend. And the TAs did a wonderful job of making the material approachable and synthesizing information across lectures.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: N/A ",
            "\u00a0The course material is very interesting with an emphasis on more recent history. The readings are useful and related to the material covered in class and section and are not too cumbersome to read. The exams are straightforward and test your engagement with the themes of the course; if you pay attention and engage with the lectures, you will be prepared. One weakness is that at least in the early lectures we cover such a large period of history and such large topics that the connection can sometimes be easy to lose sight of. ",
            "\u00a0I think the content of the course is very interesting, however, as a course marketed as one that gives students an introduction to military history, it often makes assumptions that students already have a strong understanding of the material. Both in lecture and in a lot of the classes, names and specific battles are mentioned with the assumption that students would be able to follow which is not always the case. I think the class could be improved, by potentially speaking briefly about the basic causes, significance, and players before talking about the more general trends that way students are able to better follow both in lecture and in readings. For example, important events such as the French Revolution or Nagasaki and Hiroshima are simply mentioned, a picture is shown, and the class moves on after 1-2 minutes. While these are two more well-known examples, there are often many events and specific battles that are handled in the same way that don't allow you to absorb the material as fully. Overall, I think the lectures could be better structured so that more than just pictures of ships and charts are included. Having dates, participants, causes, outcomes, and/or significance would all help in allowing a student to follow. ",
            "\u00a0The course is VERY disorganized. Professor Kennedy lectures in such a way that it is very hard to take away anything besides general ideas from his lectures, and if you don't have a good TA who is able to go over the specific things you need to know, then it's hard to learn much at all. It just doesn't work for a history course to have powerpoints with only images and minimal text. It would be SO much easier to follow if there was even a little text in terms of dates/important terms, people, events etc.\r\n\r\nAlso, there is WAY too much reading. If this was a senior seminar I took willing to do a lot of reading and work, it would still be too much to get through. For a lecture course, it is just an impossible amount. ",
            "\u00a0Paul Kennedy is the best lecturer I've encountered at Yale. He is unbelievably interesting and is phenomenal at explaining the material clearly. In addition, I thought the readings for this course were very good, but sometimes too long. Finally, while I had a fantastic TA, others who have taken the course were very dissatisfied with their TA's, mostly due to the varying degrees of rigor with which the TA's ran their section and assigned grades. ",
            "\u00a0This was a great class! The only weakness was the disparity of grades across TA's. Same quality exam answers were given a various range of grades according to each TA's grading style, creating an unfair overall grading scheme. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Kennedy knows a lot about military history, in particular giving a structural, economic perspective on war. The two guest lecturers he got were also really really good.  \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Seems like there's more reading than necessary. A lot of them overlap. Also, the course is the definition of a survey course, with some wars, even the World Wars, being glossed over really quickly. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are the fantastically selected readings and the ever engaging subjects of the evolution of land, air, and sea power.  A weakness of this course might be its (at times) disproportionate focus on naval power, as well as the fact that the final is worth a whopping 60% of the grade.  Overall though, the lectures and readings are fabulous. ",
            "\u00a0The schedule could have been finalized further in advance. I would often do the readings only to find the topics for the week had completely changed a day before lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Fascinating material from a terrific lecturer. The assigned readings are definitely too long but almost no one actually does them. ",
            "\u00a0The class was very large so it is sometimes difficult to have consistent grading across all of the different sections led by different TFs. I also feel like these discussion sections were where most  meaningful conclusions from the class were drawn and because they were so different, it was difficult to standardize the material learned in class. Otherwise, Professor Kennedy's lectures were always very engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Entertaining lectures - you feel like you are going to watch a movie, and come out with some fascinating anecdotes about the past. You also come out feeling like you haven't learnt anything concrete and that you have no idea what could possibly be on a test. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Over-arching view of military matters from 1500 until now, Kennedy is an amazing instructor and super knowledgable guy, readings are interesting. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none really, although some of the readings are somewhat unrelated to material taught in class. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent course. Change nothing. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Kennedy's lecturing style is the greatest strength of this class. His candor and demeanor make this class one of Yale's most can't-miss lectures. The course takes a 30,000-foot view of western history since 1500, which is both what makes the class so cool but also its weakness. It's a great survey of the history of the west, but it is almost so broad that it is hard to really dig into any of the topics. The reading is also too long in comparison of what is tested on. It's hard to figure out which readings are important and which are not. Still, this is one of the most interesting classes I've taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this class lie in stringing together and developing themes from a large swath of history. The primary weakness of this class lies in the readings become too vast and specific to be able to discuss and engage with the material effectively. ",
            "\u00a0I felt that the quality of the course depended on the discussion section which depended on the TF and the student's knowledge of the readings. Personally, I learned a lot from my TF (Colonel McCarthy) and found the readings interesting. The lectures themselves were a bit dry with but provided an overarching concept of the materials and picked out interesting and critical details. ",
            "\u00a0The professor the teaching fellows and the course material are all huge strengths ",
            "\u00a0Great course. ",
            "\u00a0I understand that the course must be really broad in order to cover all of the material. Big ideas are important, but it would also be good to focus on some specific topics and talk about them rather than spend the whole time talking about really big ideas or listing off battles/wars. Having a thesis for each lecture and backing it with specifics could help. ",
            "\u00a0The course is a great didactic lecture experience. No recommendations to improving it. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: a pretty easy class, great 5th class, not too much work but still fairly interesting. \r\nWeaknesses: can get a bit repetitive for anyone knowledgeable about history. Low engagement from students can sometimes make section drag. ",
            "\u00a0A weakness is that, because it is a survey course, you don't go into great detail about anything because there simply isn't time. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course with great content, but it seemed that Paul Kennedy sometimes avoided bringing his truly deep and nuanced understanding of the subject to class. I wish that we had gone a little more in depth in this class. ",
            "\u00a0I would say that this course is strong in that Professor Kennedy is able to cover the thematic elements and the sense of where we begin and end each segment through his lectures. At times, Professor Kennedy's lectures do not explicitly summarize how that change takes place. Fortunately, I had an excellent TA who was able to go over some of the nitty gitty and answer some clarifying questions about the mechanics of the change that we covered in class. ",
            "\u00a0strengths - all of the readings contain a lot of good info\r\nweaknesses - the lectures were a little dry at times ",
            "\u00a0It was an excellently taught course, with a great section. I have no complaints! One suggestion would be to include some essays as well like most History courses do -- I kind of felt like I didn't get to adequately demonstrate the depth and breadth of knowledge I had gotten from doing all the readings for this class in section and in the exams. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Kennedy is a huge asset to the class, I always enjoyed going to lecture and listening to him. I think one improvement that can be made is more transparency in the grading. Since the grade is almost entirely based off one midterm and the final, it would be nice to know going in exactly what is expected of students. I didn't feel as though I really knew what was expected of a good answer. ",
            "\u00a0Strength was Professor Kennedy as a lecturer and weakness was the vast discrepancy in the quality and grading of TAs. ",
            "\u00a0Fantastic lectures and interesting readings. ",
            "\u00a0Readings were really interesting, but often repetitive so it seemed like they were not all necessary. Maybe cut down the reading load a bit to make it more digestable. Also, a few times, we were notified very last-minute of reading changes which made it harder to keep up with the readings. ",

            "\u00a0This class really doesn't force you to do anything other than show up for the exams and contribute something in section every week, which is fine if you're motivated to do the work/reading, but it's very easy to fall behind. I think the midterm could have tested students on more than one topic of their choosing, and it was pretty easy to figure out which questions/topics were likely to be on the midterm. If this class had two midterms or something in between the midterm and the final, it would force us to keep up a little more and really stay on top of the readings and the lecture material. This is a great class that a lot of people don't take seriously. I originally took it because it looked like it could be interesting and mainly because it looked easy, but now I'm strongly considering becoming a history major. Professor Kennedy is the major strength of the class because of all the knowledge and charm he brings to the table and I hope he is able to teach it for many more years to come. Definitely try to take any class with him as he'll probably be able to make it interesting because of everything he knows and his appreciation for it. ",

This was once again apparent in the review session when the TAs presented the overall requirements for essays, but then when asked individually TAs changed requirements. Additionally the review session was not only poor but basically useless, giving no more information then a highschool history class about 'how to write a 5 paragraph essay'. The review session did not go over ANY major themes or topic of the course. "

",
            "\u00a0YES. Take this class. Professor Kennedy is a gem and amazing and I actually loved going to lectures. The material is engaging and I think it is applicable to so many other history classes, it works as  a great basis of military knowledge to take into other history classes if you choose to take more. ",
            "\u00a0Sure, if you know what you're getting into. You'll be given a big picture that's nonetheless incomplete, and some of those incompletenesses seem startlingly unintentional on the part of the instructors. It's definitely a rewarding experience, but you have to take other classes to fill in the gaps. ",

As a STEM major who doesn't have much interest in the military, I still really enjoyed this course and feel as though my understanding of European history has been greatly strengthened. Also, Professor Kennedy is an AMAZING lecturer. You don't feel like you're in a class - it's like he's telling you an interesting and engaging story every lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Great course to get a firm foundation in the great power politics and how the west came to dominate the world. Not a class about military tactics and battles, but the broad rise and interactions of different powers. ",

With that said, I think it is better suited for students who have a background in history (e.g. AP World History) in order to fully take advantage of the course.

Even if history isn't a student's intended major (take myself as an example), it's still very interesting to study the growth and change of the world.

Professor Kennedy is very witty and enjoyable in lecture, although he can talk pretty slowly, which may be a problem for some students. ",

I think it is one of those classic Yale courses that everyone whose remotely interested in big historical trends and ideas should take.  The class switches off from being focused on the details and specific inventions to covering the large themes of why the West was able to dominate the global sphere for 500 years, and I think those big themes are really important for anyone interested in history or diplomacy since the early modern period.

I went in with relatively little historical background (no AP Euro, etc.) and you're definitely able to establish a very good knowledge base throughout the semester. There is a lot of reading assigned, but it is possible to do very well on the exams while only doing some of it. Professor Kennedy is excellent, and his TAs range from good to outstanding, from what I've heard. Awesome professor, awesome class. ",
