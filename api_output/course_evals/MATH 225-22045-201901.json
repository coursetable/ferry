In the second half of the course, we moved to applications of these concepts including linear systems, determinants, eigenvectors, eigenvalues, and diagonalization. Applications outside of pure math were discussed very briefly. Along the way, I became much more proficient with constructing proofs by using smaller results to prove larger ones, and with writing these proofs coherently. ",

There also seemed to be a lack of organization, as psets were posted several days late multiple times without an extension, although the syllabus clearly says they should be posted a week before they are do. ",
            "\u00a0This course is difficult and I feel like it could be improved if more time was spent going over how to prove things. Maybe spending a little time each day going over one practice problem/proof could go a long way to improving students' learning. ",

The assignments just made us prove a bunch of obscure theorems and then when it came time for quizzes or exams we had no idea what was actually important for us to know.  We were offered \"review problems\" for our exams which were also literally just a list of obscure, very difficult proofs that would never be on the test that we were never even given the answers to to know if we were doing them right. ",
            "\u00a0I would have liked a little more big-picture discussion of the concepts of the course--making connections to other fields of math, science, philosophy, discussing why these ideas matter and their impact. Nevertheless, I felt like the structure was successful: lectures were interesting, psets were valuable to solidify understanding, the textbook was well-written, and the instructors and peer tutors were very helpful!

            "\u00a0The course could have helped students more in learning how to actually write proofs. I feel like the course was great for students who already knew the lesson and could already write, but for students like me who didn't know how to write proofs and learned linear algebra for the first time, the class was very difficult. ",

There were also abundant resources for help if needed, and the professor was very understanding and helpful. ",

I would have liked some more review of the connections between chapters, which I found the most difficult part of preparing for the exams. While I understand that this isnt an applications-based course, I think that a little more discussion of applications would have provided a clearer intuitive basis for some concepts. I appreciated the through review sheets and sessions, and the exams clearly based on the material wed covered without much focus on time pressure. ",

Although it was tough at times, and required a lot of textbook reading, at the end, after I figured out that you needed to read the textbook BEFORE going to class, it was actually an enjoyable class. I now have a great appreciation for abstract math (very different from the application based math of MATH 120). ",

Definitely take it over 222 if you care about learning the actual math and are interested in how everything manages to fit together. The Psets are graded really generously, and are heavily weighted. Even if you get an entire question wrong, you should still be able to receive some credit. This course will challenge you, but if you read the book and follow along, you should be able to do well. ",
            "\u00a0I mean linear algebra is a class that every STEM major should take at some point.  You will learn more from this class than 222, but it's hard to say which will be more frustrating. ",

The material was interesting and very satisfying to gain mastery of over the course of the psets. I like that proofs force you to be very precise about every claim, every \"causal\" connection, and to know where every single assumption you make is coming from. You get to go down to the fundamentals of the system you're using, then build back up to see the emergence of profound and useful theories. It takes work, but very worth it if you're interested, and it didn't feel like a grind. ",

            "\u00a0You should probably learn linear algebra before taking this class. That's not a joke; it will lead to an easier time. Learning linear algebra while also trying to prove things and moving at the pace that the class does can be tough for some people (such as myself). ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you are looking for a more theoretical foundation in linear algebra. This course is not for everyone; some people would be much better off taking Math 222. However, I enjoyed this course and recommend taking it with Anibal Velozo if possible. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who has not taken linear algebra before especially over 222 because it is so different. I would say the teaching could be better and it requires a lot of self motivation ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course over the other linear algebra option, MATH222, for most students, but I would advise students to shop both classes and see which perspective and professor suits them better. I personally found that MATH225 was more interesting and more engaging for myself, but others might find it the other way around. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you want a deeper understanding of Linear Algebra than just how to do some matrix manipulations take this class. It offers a very solid basis to the concepts of linear algebra, and is very doable if you put in the time to do the psets well. Anibal is also a great professor; his lectures are very solid, and beyond that he makes class entertaining and is very understanding and helpful in regards to the psets. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if youre interested in an approach to linear algebra thats focused on proofs and helps you really understand why each technique works. This class was definitely difficult, but with only a little background in proofs (CPSC 202) I felt fairly well prepared. Multivariable calculus isnt really necessary at all. As an engineering major, I was somewhat disappointed by the lack of discussion of applications, but I found I could think of application examples on my own and I benefited from the increased focus on deriving every result. If you understand the readings and problem sets, and review the results that you can use in your proofs, youll be very well prepared for the exams. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only if they enjoy mathematics or did to take this course for their major. I do not recommend taking this course out of interest or fun as it is hard. ",
            "\u00a0Between MATH 222 and MATH 225, I chose the latter because it includes the theory behind what is taught in MATH 222. I am happy with my choice, and would recommend this course to others who are interested in knowing underlying theory. "
