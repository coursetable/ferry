To that end, I certainly learned a lot in subtopics such as bioinorganic chemistry, environmental chemistry etc. that I did not expect to be covered in this class. I most enjoyed the organometallic section, and found it a very effective introduction to the field.\r\n\r\nPerhaps more practice questions could be given, and more time spent during lecture covering mechanistic thinking in organometallic chemistry. I also thought that the first third of the content had largely been covered in introductory courses, so more time could be freed up to cover advanced, interesting topics. ",

            "\u00a0This class is super disorganized and hard to follow. Crabtree is a great guy who does a good job explaining the material...when he chooses to explain the material. Most of the class seems superfluous and random, and I wish the class focused on key topics and basic chemistry more intensely. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Crabtree is a wonderful person, but this course is a mess.  The homeworks are repetitive (ie there was only  5-7 questions a PSET and he would repeat questions from one PSET to another).  The concepts themselves should not have been incredibly challenging, but Professor Crabtree flies through the actual chemistry and spends most of his time on random topics including history and art.  These are really interesting, but not what this class is supposed to be and it overall makes the much much harder and more time consuming.\r\n\r\nProfessor Crabtree is clearly a genius and a fantastic Yale resource as someone finding the intersection of science, art, and history.  He is truly a Renaissance man, and I think would be a great mentor.\r\n\r\nThat being said, the class was unfocused and disorganized, and left it to the student to figure out what was going on.  That is a very difficult given there isn't a solid textbook for this course and the TA's do their best, but honestly how do you TA a class that goes through hundreds of slides a lecture, and flies through all the relevant topics at lightening speed? ",

            "\u00a0It was kind of hard to decipher what information in the course was relevant for exams, and what was not. It felt as if so much information was thrown at us in a short period of time and that there was not enough time to properly understand all of it. Also, I wish there were more practice problems available for the different types of reactions covered. It was an interesting course though. ",
            "\u00a0This class was rather disorganized. Professor Crabtree, although one of the nicest professors I have met, goes through the lecture slides without much explanation, and the lecture slides (to non-experts like us) end up seeming rather all over the place with no obvious connections or introductions. The TA's were also not much informed on what the professor wanted, so they often made mistakes themselves, couldn't explain what the slide meant, or couldn't explain why our pset answer was wrong. This was rather unfortunate because I thought the subject itself was interesting; it would have been a lot more engaging if the class was taught better. "

            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to another student unless they had to take it for the chemistry major. Prof. Crabtree has too many anecdotes and stories which get in the way of the comprehension of the class. If his slide shows were just cut down to the testable material, I think we would have had a much more efficient and well-taught class. Instead, we have thousands of irrelevant slide material and slides which teach you on how to be a good scientist rather than inorganic chemistry material. I understand that he cares about his students' ability to think like a scientist would and wants to introduce some interesting topics into the classroom, but I think those can be reserved for outside the classroom in order for this class to actually be effective in teaching inorganic chemistry rather than being an exercise in sorting through slides to find what's relevant.

            "\u00a0Inorganic chemistry is like a messed-up reflex where your product yield is 20% and your side products a jumbled mess on the NMR spectra. The content of the course is fairly interesting, however Crabtree spends too much time I think reviewing general chemistry and not enough time explaining the inorganic chemistry concepts, especially how things work, such rationalizing the mechanisms and explaining how the energy levels in coordination compounds are derived and drawing arrows for mechanims. A lot of concepts are connected, but the connections are often not made explicitly and are hard to make on your own. As such, I feel like I only got a cursory overview at the fundamentals of inorganic chemistry with several chunks of content missing. Even with the Chili Peppers, it is extremely hard to tell what is relevant (and need to know for the exams) and what is extra material that is shown just for exposure. From solar camels to fading Van Gogh's, the random facts are cool BUT is often presented in a way that impairs learning the chemistry parts. \r\n\r\nHomeworks are relatively short but graded sort of harshly, at least at the beginning - it seems like questions are all-or-nothing with no partial credit awarded. Homework is useful though - maybe it would be better to have longer homeworks with more practice questions. Tests are hard to study for b/c of not being sure what is relevant - grading also seems a bit arbitrary and is not at all generous with partial credit. That said, Crabtree is fairly nice and funny to listen to. Both the TAs were also good at helping sieving through and finding the relevant content and answering questions during section. Overall, would not recommend unless you are super interested in organometallic chemistry or are required to take it for the chemistry major. ",

            "\u00a0If youre looking at this your probs a chem major so it doesnt matter but this course really aint bad. Also if youre doing this, take the lab for your advanced lab requirement sovuou can get the writing credit ",
            "\u00a0I have reservations about recommending this course. I kind of wish I had been able to take it with Nilay. Professor Crabtree's lectures were often really fun to listen to, but he usually went through the most important content too quickly in favor of sharing some fun facts or insights. I would actually recommend taking notes on the slides because otherwise you will not have time to write everything down. That and the sheer number of lecture slides made the content seem a lot more confusing/impenetrable/intimidating than it really needed to be. It seemed like there was way too much material until I sat down to study for the final exam and realized how all of it fit together-- and then I wished that it had been more clear/organized/accessible from the beginning so I could have learned it at the pace it was taught instead of all at the end, and so it would have been a more enjoyable and less stressful class. I do think that the weekly problem sets were a reasonable amount of work and helpful in learning the material and pinpointing what was most important to know. Section was also a super helpful resource, as TA Nick went through the most salient topics covered in lecture in a much more organized manner. But it was also only 50 minutes per week so it wasn't enough time to cover everything. The exams (2 midterms and one final) were somewhat difficult because of the amount of material and the aforementioned intimidation factor, and there was not a lot of partial credit which was frustrating. ",
            "\u00a0Out of every chemistry class I've taken, this is the worst class! If you're taking this class, you're probably a chemistry major or are thinking about it. I highly reccomend that you take you wait to take this class with another professor. I've been told Nilay Hazari has also taught this class and that he's been a good professor. While Robert Crabtree is very knowledgeable, he babbles a lot about history and art and how to be a good researcher. We've had days where he only talks about history. Lecture is quite boring and seems unnecessary to attend 50% of the time. I was especially frustrated when we spent 2 weeks learning about green chemistry and 1 week about biochemistry. This is an inorganic class, so I expected we learn about inorganic chemistry. An example of how useless this class is this: Crabtree spent 5 minutes talking about crystal field theory (an important topic) and he spent a whole 1-2 lecture on why the environment is important. I'm still confused what crystal field theory is, but did you know that CCS stands for carbon capture and storage?? WOW. Another frustration I had with the class was the TAs. One of them was decent, smart, explained things well but kind of in a hard-to-understand, convoluted way; The other TA didn't seem to know major topics (like crystal field theory), explained things poorly, wasn't approachable, obviously did not prepare for sections, and was just bad. If lecture does not provide good explanations for topics, I expect section to!  Grading PSETs is \"based on completion,\" but you should know that you can get points taken off randomly. Maybe it was that the TAs were not good, but my friend and I did our PSETs together, had similar answers, and I would always get points taken off while he got those points. The TAs probably just slap a grade on your PSET. Sometimes questions are worth 1 point, sometimes 0.5, sometimes 0.33. This class needs more consistent grading! Another thing to note: Crabtree talks a lot about things that aren't inorganic related, but we were always told that he would not ask us questions about history or art. Here are three questions from the final to get a little taste of how ridiculous this class is: (true/false) Arrhenius developed his ideas in the 1900s. (true/false) Aristotle agreed with Arrhenius's ideas. What is the metal center of urease? THESE QUESTIONS ARE RIDICULOUS AND TEST NO KNOWLEDGE OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY. The first two questions are history-related and we were told we wouldn't be tested on history. The last question is a straight-up biochemistry question!! Make better questions! Ask me about counting electrons, ask me about mechanisms, ask me about hard/hard and soft/soft interactions, ask me about a question on crystal field theory because I spent hours trying to learn what it is because the professor and the TAs did not spend the appropriate amount of time on it! I expect Crabtree to give everyone at least an A- in the end because his class was not consistent or fair, and he and the TAs know it. This is coming from a person who does fairly well on the exams! Even though I did well in the class, I still think it's a bad class. Honestly, it's a joke. If I wanted to learn about the environment or history, I would read about them myself. This class was so bad that it just supports my conclusion on chemistry at Yale: it's bad. I should've committed to going to MIT or Harvard for chemistry because chemistry at Yale is taught poorly in general. Great researches, just poor professors and TAs. ",

            "\u00a0Chances are that you are a chemistry major and need to take this class. The class is fine. The beginning is deceptively easy, and then all of a sudden you are in the middle of actual inorganic chemistry and have no idea what is going on. You'll get through it. Just stay on top of the work and the millions of lecture slides. ",
