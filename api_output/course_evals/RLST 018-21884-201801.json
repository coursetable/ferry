            "\u00a0I gained a new appreciation for South Asian religions and practices from this course. The discussion really facilitated open-minded learning and exploration. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to discuss one topic for an entire semester that I wasn't super passionate about. ",
            "\u00a0An in-depth understanding of the history of yoga and its relationship to Hinduism, Buddhism, Islamism, British imperialism, and westernization. You will gain familiarity with a lot of important religious and yogic texts such as the Bhagavad Gita, the Yoga Sutras, and the Hatha Yoga Pradipika as well as an understanding of common concepts and sanskrit words within the context of yoga and the Hindu religion. ",
            "\u00a0Taking this course improved my writing skills and definitely helped me become a better student. I would recommend that students go into the course with some level of background knowledge on yoga's history. ",
            "\u00a0I became much more familiar with the culture and religions of the part of the world I knew nothing about before taking this course. Through research I had to conduct for my papers I improved my ability to find and use different  types of resources. "

        [
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course was that it was for first-years only and also was small so that allowed for a more individualized learning experience; however, the latter benefit was also a con because sometimes it seemed like the five of us had exhausted all we had to say within the first 45 minutes of class. ",
            "\u00a0The course does a great job of giving you lots of context for the history of yoga. However, it spends a bit too much time on context instead of delving into yoga's relationship to the modern world. It would have been nice to have learned about the relationship between yoga, British imperialism, and America before the last two weeks of class. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course could benefit from a larger class size, as this would lead to bigger discussions. ",
            "\u00a0This course ended up having a much bigger workload then I initially expected. I found the readings assigned in the beginning of the course quite dense because I was so unfamiliar with the topics and found my self a little lost and overwhelmed at times. In the end the course rounded up really well and everything that we did during the semester fell in place and made sense. Over all, I am glad I took this course. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course for other students who are interested in this topic. It gave me an entirely new perspective on yoga and on South Asian culture, which I will remember for future encounters. ",
            "\u00a0Great course if you have a deep interest in the historical roots of yoga and yoga's relationship to India. More of a history course than anything else and super interesting! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. However, I would recommend taking it Credit D. The material is very interesting, making this course a solid choice. ",
            "\u00a0Even though this course is dealing with a relatively modern and relevant question a great part of it is concentrated on ancient religious texts so a student who has no interest in learning about South Asian religions would probably not enjoy this course. With that said, I would not recommend this course to every student at Yale, but some would definitely enjoy taking it. "
