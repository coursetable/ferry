            "\u00a0Read lots of interesting texts, learned about analyzing them, and learned how to improve my writing immensely. ",
            "\u00a0Everything I should have--a broad exposure to the early part of the Western canon of literature, and honing my interpretive, discursive, and writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0I developed my ability to closely analyse passages of texts and relate their importance to the wider significance of the texts as a whole. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a familiarity with canonical works of literature spanning from the ancient Greeks to renaissance Europe. I also improved my ability to perform close-readings and analyze works of challenging literature, and to convey these analyses in a coherent paper. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write better essays, and I learned to look at texts in a more analytical light. ",
            "\u00a0Through the assignments which require close reading/analysis and the discussions with the classmates who have talented insights that enable them to read between the lines logically, I was able to enjoy analysing the logic and the author's intention underlying the beautiful and complex literary works. ",
            "\u00a0I thought it was a great introduction to Western literature and really gave me the context of a lot of what I have read and elements of our culture. I also was exposed to many books that I had never read before but that are really good. I gained writing skills and good reading skills. ",
            "\u00a0I gained the skills of deed-form literary analysis and close-reading. We also learned many centuries worth of literature and literary history. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how to write. A lot of high school writing is unnecessarily high-minded and complex, but these professors have really helped me simplify writing styles for clarity and concision. I ready some of the most beautiful and exciting works I have ever read, and I really do feel like I have a great grasp of the major works that dominated the Western cannon from antiquity to the Renaissance. Moreso, I can speak to how these works reflect the zeitgeist of the era in which they were written. I also would say that my ability to close readings has improved drastically. "

            "\u00a0Too much material to effectively cover in such a short period of time. certain stories were slighted because there wasn't enough time to really get into them. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were most of the lectures and the text selections. A weakness is that some of the lectures, particularly the Greek Tragedies ones, I feel only covered the most obvious context and analysis concerned with the texts and could've gone into greater detail if they had been more concise. The course could perhaps be improved by more references to literary criticism regarding the texts so we could gauge how it has been received since its creation. ",
            "\u00a0The main strengths of the course are that it covers a large number of important works over a large span of time. It provides a nice overview of western literary history and its evolution over time. However, this also means that it is impossible to spend much time on any of the works. The class moves fast, and I would personally have preferred to focus for more time on slightly fewer texts. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: essays - through the cycle of writing and getting a feedback from the professor, I could nurture good command of reading the materials profoundly.\r\nWeakness: exams - personally speaking, I cannot agree with the form of the final exam (esp. part II). I felt as if the exam had required me to write a long essay off the top of my head since I could not refer to the original text during the exam. I'd rather prefer to write a final paper, a bit longer than ordinary writing assignments, as other courses in humanities have. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the lectures are great and very interesting, illuminating, and even mind-blowing. I also thought the seminar discussions were very engaging and thought provoking. The subject matter is not as easy or productive to talk about in seminar format as philosophy, but the professor compensated for this and made it so that we really learned a lot and cemented the lecture material. But still, I did feel like the seminar discussions were mainly people giving their opinions than actually any learning. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course include the depth of conversations and breadth of literature which we covered. On the flip side, it was often difficult to digest all the material thouroughly enough. We often found ourselves unable to finish or even come close to covering all the major themes and concepts in each work. ",
            "\u00a0I believe that this course is very rigorous. There readings are extremely vigorous and long, especially Homer and Virgil. The writings can be tough, and I spent many a late Thursday night in Bass. However, I believe that the knowledge I gained and my writing abilities made it all worth it, so I can't think of anything that I would fundamentally change about the course. The literature lectures are on Fridays, which proves problematic to those who stay up all night Thursday writing: sometimes students fall asleep. Maybe the Friday lectures could be moved to Thursday, so exhausted students don't miss the vital and really engaging information taught. Overall, I really enjoyed the lectures. "

            "\u00a0Yes; it's an excellent exposure to this type of literature, and it's very interesting if you like to read :) ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The books are good, the sections and lectures are interesting and informative, and it is great for skill improvement. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - you read great texts that have shaped the Western canon. Although some works are hard to get through, once you finish them you gain much greater insights into the Western canon and feel really accomplished having made it through something like 'The Iliad'. ",
            "\u00a0Provided that the student has an interest in the history of western literature and is willing to read a lot of texts in a short period of time (at the expense of more in-depth analysis) I would recommend this course to another student. It provides familiarity with important texts and hones literary skills. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely. The texts are engaging, and the faculty and lectures do a great job of establishing continuity between works. Works are put in context really well, and the lectures are often insanely eye-opening. ",
            "\u00a0I will definitely recommend: there's no other opportunity to learn how to read, through the intriguing interaction with the excellent professor and classmates, and through well-organised reading materials and writing assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would definitely recommend this course. You get to read some of the most fascinating books in the world, and that is your homework. If you love reading then the 'homework' will not be work at all, but rather a chance to relax and let someone tell you a story. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend DS to a student who is willing pit forth much effort and who is truly interested in learning about the western canon. I would definitely recommend taking literature with Professor Ellermann because he helped us understand the texts with context and guiding us through the almost important parts of the text. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to all students interested in the humanities. It will make you a better writer. You will be given the platform to read and to think about some of the most important and beautiful works out there. You will be able to talk about these works with close friends. And you will place yourself into a tight-nit community of likeminded individuals all passionate about the human condition. I suggest trying to complete as much of the readings as you can for literature. These works aren't meant to be speed read or summarized. The art is in the details, so as much as you can try to read all of it. You will enjoy the experience much more that way. That said, there will be a week (or multiple weeks) where you are behind. Don't sweat it. That happens to everybody. The course is a survey of these works, and its expected that at some point you will get behind. Just enjoy the ride s much you can! "
