            "\u00a0This class really taught me how to construct a narrative and a \"reading machine.\" The books we read were cool but we didn't have as much time to talk about them as I would have liked. ",
            "\u00a0After this course, you'll think about why authors chose to present their story in the form you now see. Much of this course is figuring out which package your story should fit in -- much more craft than story, which is good for anyone, especially those who don't consider themselves creative writers. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the \"ingredients\" for fiction writing - how to create a plot, characters, conflict, etc. ",
            "\u00a0I developed an understanding of how to structure a narrative, and gained the ability to engage with literature on a craft-specific leve. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write short fiction! And I learned what makes fiction work (the mechanics: what makes it engaging to read). ",
            "\u00a0Reading fiction for craft is a very different mode of reading than most classes teach. I appreciated how it make me look more carefully at the choices behind the writing of a text rather than the meaning of it. It encourages you to read great literature--all of the short stories are wonderful. "

            "\u00a0Professor Sexton is great at facilitating discussion, he provides feedback on your writing and clear instruction for what he is looking for in the short stories ",
            "\u00a0I loved the reading and writing components of this class. The books each illustrated whichever component of craft we were talking about that week. I think we could have done more one-on-one peer editing of each other's short stories. I also think the class structure could have been more varied so it was not always discussions, which sometimes were not engaging. ",
            "\u00a0The readings and Prof. Sexton's book accompanied each other very well. The books were great, but came up so fast that many students didn't finish the books, especially since there wasn't incentive (in the form of quizzes) to do so, but you definitely lost out by not reading. The workshops were very helpful, but one drawback of the 1-pro 1-suggestion for improvement model is that it is tough to really get across that someone's story is in a great place or that their story needs a lot of work. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: distills how to write fiction into a method that is almost formulaic, but it works.  Professor Sexton has taught this class many times and he really has it down.  He is also excellent at leading discussions.   I felt I learned a lot both from him, from his book (the class textbook) and from my classmates.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:  There is a bit too much reading.  We are often expected to read entire novels in a week.  I much preferred reading the short stories; I also felt they were more relevant to the course since we write short stories anyway.  If I were to create the reading list, I would keep the short novels like Secret Sharer and Metamorphosis (and Severed Head cause it's just so good) but no to Beloved or Sense & Sensibility. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this course. This was my first experience workshopping my writing, and I felt that part of the course was structured very well. I didn't enjoy all of the novels on the syllabus, but I understand why they were selected. ",
            "\u00a0The course was a great balance of exposure and application. I really liked the workshop setting and felt they facilitated meaningful discussion. ",
            "\u00a0The instructor was enthusiastic about the topic, which was a plus. At first glance, the syllabus appeared well organized. However, we would constantly fall behind on the schedule. We were assigned novels to read for classes, hundreds of pages that we would discuss for maybe 30 minutes on a very surface level. As a result, most students grew disillusioned and stopped doing the assigned readings. This was evident in the quality of the discussion we would have. We never practiced any close reading, which one would expect from taking a 'reading for craft' type of class. I expected this class to be on par with the ENGL 120 curriculum and rigor, but it was nowhere near that level. \r\n\r\nMy suggestion for improvement would be to center homework and discussions on short stories, much like the 120 curriculum. I believe you learn the most in the shortest amount of time that way. Reading novels takes too much time; you understand the gist of the stylistic material we're supposed to absorb by page 10, anyways, and no one's reading to the end. "

            "\u00a0Yes, the course readings are great and the workshops are incredibly useful in writing your final short story. It is a creative opportunity to engage in a new type of literature and writing craft ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you like creative writing and are willing to put in the hours reading. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It makes writing fiction very approachable. It's an area that seems hard to get into but Adam Sexton makes it very approachable. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! Especially if you want to learn how to write fiction. ",
            "\u00a0100%.  one of my favorite courses I've had the chance to take at Yale.  If you are interested in learning how to write, but it seems like this elusive, impossible thing, this class is for you.  FYI - it's competitive to get in, but it varies from semester to semester and if you don't get in the first time, apply again.  I had to apply twice before being accepted ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you're interested in dipping your toes into writing short fiction, this is a great introduction to doing so. ",
            "\u00a0If you love creative writing, this is the class for you. You read great stuff and talk about fiction in a meaningful well: not what things mean in an esoteric, academic sense, but how good writing works and bad writing doesn't. Straightforward, but practical. You get to practice it yourself and workshop with students. One of the best creative writing classes I've taken at Yale so far. ",
            "\u00a0It's hard to evaluate this class based on workload, etc because the work is so different from what the other classes in the English department. But yes, I would recommend it. The syllabus is great, especially with the short stories. Given that we all workshop each other's stories and much of what you learn is based on what other students have to say, each year is bound to be really different--take a look around the classroom on the first day and feel out if there are interesting voices in the class. Adam Sexton has interesting things to say while still being chill and fun. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Take the course if you can get in! It gave me an outlet for creative fiction writing in the middle of a busy semester ",
            "\u00a0No, unless you take this Credit/D. You'll spend hours reading novels in depth, then have a 30 minute (or less) very surface level discussion on the material in class, so it's not very worth it. Feedback on your final short stories will be minimal. If you're really serious about writing, take 120/121 or something else. Most people in this class are in it for the gut, or for fun, or are credit/d-ing. "
