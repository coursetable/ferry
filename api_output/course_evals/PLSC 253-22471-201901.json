            "\u00a0It's a great course for people without a ton of working journalism knowledge. However, the readings were terrific, and the insights that can only come from someone like Bob Woodward were amazing to be a recipient of. ",
            "\u00a0I became more interested in journalism and, more broadly, in people's stories. I learned a lot about investigative reporting, and the persistence that is required of a journalist in pursuing the truth. I learned a lot from our discussions about journalism ethics, and came away thinking more about the idea of outsiderness, and how being an \"outsider\" might be crucial to developing insight about people and systems of power. ",
            "\u00a0How to work rigorously in the logic of reporting ",
            "\u00a0I've learned a great deal about what it means to be a journalist  the triumphs, the inevitable failures and everything in between. I feel like I've gained so much just listening to Professor Woodward talk about his storied career. He's extremely honest and not afraid to criticize himself, and I think I gained more from listening to him talk about his failures and challenges than his many successes. The final project was a great opportunity to get to cover something I was really passionate about, and it taught me a lot about myself, as well as about what how to cover a fairly sensitive topic in a responsible way.

            "\u00a0No need for change. I thought it was great. There could be a little more student to student interaction, or some mini writing assignments that happen in class in an improv type form. ",
            "\u00a0Too much focus on just discussing current events, not enough focus on the actual practice of journalism. ",
            "\u00a0It was such an opportunity to be in this class and learn from Professor Woodward, Emily, Evelyn and the other students. I enjoyed the class session we had on emotional truth with Elsa Walsh, where we discussed the difficulties and nuances of reporting on emotionally fragile people and situations. I really valued office hours sessions and phone calls with Professor Woodward as well. ",
            "\u00a0This is not a writing course, but more a conversation and exercise on reporting specifically. This should be the clear expectation going in. I would advise students interested in daily reporting more than longform to apply to this class. You will be discussing politics and journalism in general terms. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Woodward is the strength of this course. I loved the opportunity to critique pieces of journalism. As someone who has read and written a lot of stories, I've never had the opportunity to take a step back and analyze the process. \r\n\r\nSome minor things that I could see improved: I thought that Elsa Walsh's seminar on emotional truth was great. I think next year, you should replace that seminar with the profiles one. I feel like I learned so much about what it takes to honestly profile someone from her, but we had that seminar the day the first draft of our profiles were due. Moving that class up would be super helpful if possible. \r\n\r\nI also think that it was really great to have the opportunity to talk to Megan Twohey and Jodi Kantor about their Harvey Weinstein reporting for the #MeToo reporting seminar. I think it would be a good idea to perhaps bring in someone who specializes in narrative journalism for the class that focuses on that sub-genre. "

            "\u00a0This was the single best class I took at Yale. It was an honor to study under Professor Woodward. Anyone who gets into the seminar should take it. ",
            "\u00a0If you can get into this class, definitely take it -- no question. Learning journalism from Bob Woodward is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and students in this class get to hear directly about his insights, past mistakes, and anecdotes. Between the profile assignment and class discussions, I learned how to think about the world and other people in new ways. The class also draws a really talented, interesting group of students, so you will constantly be challenged and inspired by your classmates and professor! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to absolutely anyone who enjoys journalism, politics, or history. Bob brings all of them to the table. ",
            "\u00a0If you're admitted to this course, take it! I am someone who loves writing and journalism but didn't quite know how much I wanted to go into journalism. This class definitely encouraged me to consider it more strongly. It's really incredible the kind of support you're afforded through this class, and through conversations with Professor Woodward. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in daily reporting, in political reporting, yes. But not necessarily if you are interested in nonfiction more broadly. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This class is awesome, and even if you don't plan on going into journalism, you'll learn a lot and it will be worth while! "
