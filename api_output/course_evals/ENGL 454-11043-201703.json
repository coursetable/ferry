            "\u00a0I felt this course was absolutely essential to my development as a journalist - it completely changed how I think about planning pieces, writing, and reporting. Fred can hardly contain his enthusiasm in class (sometimes, he really can't) and he brings so much enthusiasm for the material. He holds students accountable in both their writing and their contributions, and I'm a more critical reader and thinker for that. The course's emphasis on voice and structure isn't a gimmick - each part of the class gave me an valuable mode of thinking that I will continue to make use of as long as I continue writing. I'm lucky to have had the chance to take a course with a professor who loves what he does and cares about his students as much as Fred does. ",
            "\u00a0A in-depth understanding of how to structure a non-fiction journalistic piece and a better knowledge of how to reckon with the \"I\" in such writing ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to structure long-form articles and develop an persona adequate to the drama of my subject. ",
            "\u00a0This class was SO helpful in learning how to write journalistic pieces in an engaging, creative way! From reading lots of examples of New Yorker-type articles in this class and closely examining the authors' voice and structure techniques, I got a better sense of how I want my own writing to sound began to craft my own style incorporating those different techniques. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think about structure before I start a piece/as I am writing a piece. Before the class, I thought little about structure. I just sort of started writing and hoped it would develop in a coherent way. This class teaches you how to organize a piece before/during/after the writing process, which is lit. It also helps with creating an authorial persona. ",
            "\u00a0I learned that the structure of a written piece is never arbitrary and that to write well you should always put thought into it; that it pays to take risks; that a journalist need not shy away from stories and characters with whom they have complex relationships (in fact, they should embrace that!); that you shouldn't write about something you don't care about; that it's okay to take your work seriously. "

            "\u00a0This is an exceptionally well-designed class - its dual focuses, voice and structure, provide an anchor for the readings, class discussion, and reporting assignments. Fred's fast-paced discussions kept forced me to think quickly, provide substantive feedback in class discussions and workshops, and think through my own writing more critically. His feedback on assignments is detailed and thorough, and he is sincerely invested in helping his students succeed, pushing them to expand their thinking and, in some cases, even lending out his car for reporting. I would have appreciated more guidance on what type of subject is most amenable to experimentation with structure and/or voice, especially before I began reporting - though I got helpful feedback on my own individual proposals, it would have been interesting to devote some class time to discussing, more broadly, what kinds of pieces are best suited to  structural innovation and what kinds of pieces are best suited to strong persona. I also would have liked to discuss what kinds of pieces aren't really suited to either innovate narrative or strong persona, and how narrative journalism fits into the modern journalistic landscape. Overall, this is an excellent, inspiring, formative class. ",
            "\u00a0The section about structure was *so* useful. However, the section on persona was a little less organized, at times more vague-- so I might change the second half a little bit. Secondly, I'd send pre-class updates to inform students of what material is being covered during class time. Lastly, I might focus the assignments on really perfecting one piece. At times, reporting and writing two different pieces felt quite rushed (we saw reporters working on pieces for months or even years), so perhaps it might be useful to focus instead on refining a single piece, rather than ending with two pieces that still need a bit of work. ",
            "\u00a0This course may best be described as an editing seminar. The readings are fantastic, the workshop atmosphere (provided you have a good group, which you will) tremendously helpful, and the opportunity to produce two polished pieces sublime. You will not, however, get much help with reportingwhich means finding stories, developing sources, conducting interviews, etc. So I'd recommend going into it with some experience doing those things already. ",
            "\u00a0This course is perfect as is. He's been teaching it for decades -- I don't think there's much improvement to be had at this point! ",
            "\u00a0Professor Strebeigh is always so prepared for class and doesn't waste a minute of time (even though the seminar is long)! Getting the chance to workshop your writing in this class is invaluable because Fred gives in depth, line-by-line feedback and the class always gives helpful advice as well. I would say this class could improve by spending some more time in the beginning giving a sort of crash-course or brainstorm session about how to choose article topics  we spend the majority of the semester on two long-form pieces on topics of our choice, so the topic you choose matters a lot and I would have benefitted from some guidance on how to choose what to write about. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: helps with voice/structure a lot. Good feedback/suggestions on written pieces. Prof. Strebeigh has a great vision for how a piece can improve and is generous with his time. \r\nweaknesses: I feel like a little more time could be spent on the actual readings themselves. Some readings didn't get discussed, and some were barely discussed. There were a few readings (not even necessarily the best ones) that got brought up multiple times across classes, which I thought was kind of weird. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: lots of room for creativity; Fred is incredibly thoughtful and holds you to a high standard; frequent opportunities to read and edit the work of other students and get their feedback in turn; very cool guest visit; the reading list is awesome; class is fast-paced and fun.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: class seemed to be ultimately more about structure than voice. I would have increased the focus on the second part a little, I think. Also occasionally frustrating when Fred had a very specific point to make and you weren't really able to push back. But overall class was really wonderful. "

            "\u00a0If you're invested in journalism, I think this class is essential. Fred is a one-of-a-kind professor, boundlessly enthusiastic, relentlessly thorough, and deeply invested in his students. The discussions are fast-paced and you've got to be prepared to be pushed in class - Fred holds everyone accountable. I'd take this during a semester where you have the time to prioritize the two big assignments and dig deep into the reporting and writing process. The more you can apply the readings and class discussions in your own work, the more you'll get out of the class. For me, this course made me rethink how I report and write. I'm really glad I took it. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Fred is such a kind, thoughtful professor that really takes the time to help you suceed and understand the material. He really pushes you to make pieces national in a way that I wouldn't have pushed myself to do beforehand, and for that, I'm so grateful. ",
            "\u00a0If you can get in, take it. It's a great class to focus on a couple of pieces and it incentivizes you to be more intentional about your writing. The opportunities for extensive feedback from classmates and from Professor Strebeigh are also invaluable. The workload is high--lots of reading in the beginning and a ton of writing before each piece is due--but worth it, in my opinion. ",
            "\u00a0I would! ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone and everyone. Don't be daunted if you're not a journalism major. I had never done reporting before. Never written anything for the YDN other than an op-ed or a play review. And, although this course didn't talk much about the mechanics of reporting, there was no time to hesitate -- I just had to take the plunge -- and it was wonderful. Of course, if you're a more methodical person, consider taking a more introductory journalism class before you focus on the writing aspect specifically. \r\n\r\nProfessor Strebeigh is incredible. He runs his seminar like a tight ship: comments have to be grounded, on topic, and he teaches you to think, write, and speak at the same time, with clarity and confidence.\r\nI remember one day when I sat down to meet with him after class. We had been talking for half an hour when he mentioned he had to be on his way to a Poynter Fellowship lecture which he'd helped organize. Then he shook his head. \"No,\" he said. \"We're here, now, doing this. We'll stay until we're finished.\" And he did, despite my insistence that it was okay to meet at a later date. \r\n\r\nBoth students and faculty are busy, so we don't meet one on one very often (although there is no actual impediment). But I have never seen such thorough comments on every single page of my essay. That's not even to mention the incredible feedback we get in class. \r\n\r\nBy the way, I would take this class even if you aren't interested in journalism. As long as you want to write nonfiction (travel writing, memoirs, what have you -- and as long as you're willing to fact check it), your writing cannot but benefit from the tools you'll learn here. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this course, especially if you're interested in a career that involves creative writing!! It's quite an intellectual and time investment but it pays off. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely fantastic course that has completely expanded my understanding of what journalism is and can be. Excellent readings; regular, useful feedback from Professor Strebeigh and class workshops; new ways of thinking about reporting and storytelling that will stay with me long past college. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. If you take this class, you'll end up with a much better vision of how to structure a piece. You'll also get better at developing a persona within a piece, but I definitely feel like the class is stronger structure-wise. On a sentence level, you probably won't improve much, which is fine because there are other classes that seem more focused on style. \r\n\r\nYou'll write two essays: one focusing on structure and one on persona. You'll feel pressure to write about super important topics (all the pieces are expected to be national in scope), but I would really recommend just writing about pretty much whatever you want. If you actually care, it'll end up national in scope. I felt like at points, people felt a little trapped into writing about \"super important\" topics that have the potential of being kind of clichd/boring. \r\n\r\nIt's tougher to write two good pieces in a semester than you might think, for whatever reason. I'm not really sure, looking back, if I would've preferred taking Genre of a Sentence, or another class more focused on style, but this class was definitely useful if you're looking to write long New Yorker style pieces, which is not for everybody, and probably not for me. \r\n\r\nStrebeigh is an incredibly nice/caring professor who is incredibly passionate about journalism. ",
            "\u00a0i cannot recommend this course highly enough. as a journalist and a thinker, i think so much more carefully and cleverly about journalism and my own abilities as a result. anyone thinking about being a journalist, an artist, an anthropologist, or just a consumer of media should take this class without hesitation. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to a student who is serious about writing, willing to take risks and get creative, and put in a lot of work. Fred is an incredibly thoughtful professor and will give you very detailed feedback, and he holds you to a high standard. The readings are always fun and varied. You definitely get out what you put in. "
