            "\u00a0There's a lot of self-motivation involved for this class because how much progress your senior thesis makes pretty much depends entirely on you. ",
            "\u00a0This course enabled me to begin working on my research project. ",
            "\u00a0Great! Super recommend. Likely depends on your advisor. ",
            "\u00a0This semester I learned a lot about the value of comparative specimens, how to structure figures, and how to start tackling writing a publishable research paper. As always, I also learned a lot of easily transferable skills about the importance of allocating extra time for tasks that are unexpectedly difficult. I've been rather slow to learn how to use a lot of the different features of software available in the lab due to unexpected roadblocks, but it has taught me to be really patient, resourceful and willing to ask for help when seeking solutions. ",
            "\u00a0I built on my research skills, worked on designing my own project, and learned new skills in the lab. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to independently design a research project with the guidance of my advisors. ",
            "\u00a0I learned basic biology research and communication skills related to how to complete and explain experiments, as well as a better understanding of plant biology techniques such as transient expression assays in tobacco and rescue assays in Arabidopsis. I also learned more about the function of TCP family transcription factors. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a lot of laboratory skills. This was my first time doing wet bench research. More specifically, I learned pipetting skills, and other laboratory skills that would help me run an assay. \r\n\r\nI gained background knowledge into cortisol assays, and their limitations. \r\n\r\nI learned background information into the physiological effects of stress, and discrimination. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about lab techniques such as DNA extraction, PCR, and allele scoring. I also read scientific papers on spatial distributions of Tsetse flies. "

            "\u00a0No particular weaknesses as far as I know! Meetings were really easy to schedule on an as needed basis and the answer to questions over email would consistently arrive well within a 24 hour period, often within the hour, so I never felt unsupported or lost. I also really appreciated the flexibility I was offered. My schedule was often fairly inconsistent as I need to work student jobs and often meet with TAs or Profs for office hours, and I was really grateful that I never felt as though there was pressure to maintain set hours within lab; I was easily able to balance my research with my classes without either suffering. This flexibility might sound like a small thing, but some of my friends have a lot of difficulty with PIs not quite understanding that undergrad expectations/availability are different from grad students, so the level of kindness and understanding that I experience is always deeply and sincerely appreciated. ",
            "\u00a0No weaknesses. Really is what you make of it. If you put a lot of effort and thought in, it will be very rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0nothing I would change! ",
            "\u00a0EEB 475 is a good format for research for credit. It offers flexibility (e.g., you can do one semester or two semesters) but also spurs you to have a completed research report by the end of senior year. ",
            "\u00a0I wish the course was more helpful in finding funding for students. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the structure of how the course is set up so that students can determine their own availability to work in the lab.\r\n\r\nI received very clear and strong guidance from people in the lab. Everyone was very helpful and supportive. "

            "\u00a0Research for credit is really rewarding. I've gained so many skills (more technical writing, organizing my ideas and concerns before meetings, software) that I just haven't gotten through my classes. It's also really wonderful to be at a point where I'm producing results and am able to start to see how my work will come together. It's exciting :) ",
            "\u00a0Yes of course. Doing your own research is an incredibly valuable experience. ",

            "\u00a0Yes for EEB majors. Doing research for credit has definitely improved my experience with EEB because it encouraged me to get a better hands-on understanding of biology. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would. This class can provide you with hands on experience with conducting research. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it to students who would like more experience in research for their senior thesis. "
