            "\u00a0Learned about creole and contact languages from many different perspectives. First, we discussed the historical context of West Africa, the slave trade, and the Caribbean. Then, we discussed the typology (or lack thereof) of creole languages as well as the theory of hybrid grammars. Finally, we examined the syntax of Atlantic creole languages and how it originated in the syntaxes of the superstrate and substrate. Overall, very interesting course! ",
            "\u00a0Learned how to get the gist of long linguistics papers even when I did not understand every detail of the syntax presented in them, learned recombination theory and the socio-historical nature of the designation \"creole\" ",
            "\u00a0Learned about creoles and hybrid grammars\r\nCompetition and selection of linguistic features in the process of language emergence ",
            "\u00a0Recombination as an underlying linguistic mechanism; re-assessment of creolisation theories; analysis within a generative syntax framework ",
            "\u00a0I learned the process of creole-formation and change, which can be projected onto all language formation and change.  I learned the history of Atlantic creoles and the leading theories of creole formation, including Prof. Aboh's leading theory. "

            "\u00a0I really liked how we got to discuss history, syntactic theory, change, and specific linguistic properties of the Atlantic creoles, all in one course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Interesting lectures, flexible writing topics\r\nWeaknesses: Lecture slides and readings are very similar, so it's hard to understand one if you don't understand the other ",
            "\u00a0- ",
            "\u00a0This was such an interesting and wonderful course that approached traditional theories of language contact from a very different viewpoint; Enochs recombination analysis is really on to something that could redefine the study of language contact and the entire field of Linguistics as a whole ",
            "\u00a0This course was the best linguistics course I have taken at my time here because it helped me discover a passion for language-change. However, I felt as though the course materials ran out about two weeks before the end of classes so that those last two weeks were not as engaging as the beginning of the semester. "
