Unlike other courses where student students subconciously complete problem sets or just answer the problems, Sudesh made us appreciate and understand the math we were doing. Everything connected in the class and I loved all the math we were doing. I left the course inspired to continue to pursue math! ",

The class clearly explains key concepts in multi variable calculus which one is set to master. ",

            "\u00a0Sudesh is a fantastic lecturer (great at explaining material), and he tells you exactly what you need to know to understand the material covered by the course. He provides great notes, and was very available during many office hours. The textbook is also pretty clear, though notation can vary (Sudesh also gave us every iteration and explained it). I've heard so many complaints abut this course, but none of them held for my experience. Problems in the textbook and from lecture are similar to the tests and problems. ",

It's very fast-paced, especially since my section had only 2 classes per week, but the lecture note sheets were always very helpful in staying on track. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: everything is learnable. It's not terribly hard. There are tons of resources if you want extra practice, but at the same time if you don't then you do not have to use them. The psets only ever take like 2 hours and are twice a week.\r\n\r\nWeakness: it doesn't feel that applicable to real life. Doing the math isn't hard but no one really knew what we were doing on a meta level and why any of the theorems worked. ",
            "\u00a0The course was well-structured and Sudesh was seriously an awesome instructor. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: SUDESH!!! I can't say enough about him. He makes packets for each lecture, constantly provides extra practice problems, and is all-around the BEST math lecturer I've ever encountered (I took multivariable calc / linear algebra in high school, and things made so much more sense this time around). I've heard the Math 120 experience is subpar with other instructors, but with Sudesh, a huge strength of the course was its clear explanation of concepts and the availability of practice problems. // Weaknesses: grading felt harsh, especially given the prevalence of tricky true/false questions. If you lost the all-or-nothing credit on those, your grade took a severe hit. In one case, I did nearly all of the math flawlessly on the midterm and didn't get above a 90 because I messed up 2-3 true/falses. You put a lot of effort into the weekly homework for it to be only worth 10%, although it's totally manageable. ",
            "\u00a0There are only stengths to this course as I was lucky to have Sudesh as a professor. He was wonderful and such an amazing lecuturer and professore who offered countless office hours and review sessions. In lecture, we were given packets which helped us stay organized. The problem sets seemed a bit outdated but they allowed us to practice the skills we learned in class. Most of all, the ximeras were extremely helpful as they allowed us to watch videos to review each topic and practice with conceptual true and false questions as well as normal problems. ",

            "\u00a0The main strength is really Sudesh. Multivariable calculus can be difficult but the content is the same regardless of the teacher, it was really having Sudesh that made the difference. The note packet he gave during each lecture made studying a lot easier and so did all of the resources he provided us with. ",

            "\u00a0The weakest part of this course is that it is inconsistent across sections. There also seems to be a lot of course material for one smester, and at times the pace seemed ridiculously hurried. However, I really liked my section and found that there was a lot of help available if I had the time and put in the effort. ",
            "\u00a0The course is exceptional in its ability to have students master several key ideas in multi variable calculus. The concepts are very fleshed out and explained well. Where this course falters is in helping one prepare for exams in that some integration techniques can surprise you because all the examples use simple integrals to explain the general concept. ",
            "\u00a0Student experiences vary dramatically from instructor to instructor. My experience with Sudesh was great but other students had worse instructors. Perhaps general standards for each instructor would help, things that every instructor should do. "

I'm an average math student (formerly a humanities major), and he made everything make sense, and connected the material to linear algebra. ",

But otherwise, even though the material is difficult, I found that doing a lot of practice problems and taking advantage of office hours/resources makes it pretty manageable. I actually really enjoyed this class even though I was taking it as a prerequisite. ",

I actually did not have to take this class for my prospective major, but thought that it would be interesting to learn and like math. I enjoyed it and am glad I took it even though I did not have to. If you like math and are decently good at it or willing to put in some work, you will probably do well in this course. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend the course to any prospective stem major. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the class sparked a love for math, which I previously never had.  I also think as an intro level course it is very difficult, which may deter some, but I believe it prepares one for a typical college course-load. ",

The instruction is engaging and the course is complex, but it does not compensate with more work. The workload is exactly what it should be to learn te interesting concepts in the course. ",
