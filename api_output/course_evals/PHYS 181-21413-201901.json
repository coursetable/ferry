            "\u00a0Strengths- well taught\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- unnecessarily complicated and in-depth for an intro physics class. Psets take too long ",
            "\u00a0I don't think that it's necessarily a weakness of the course itself, but the general layout of intro physics here: Physics 180/181 has to try to cater to far too broad an audience, ranging from those with 2 years+ experience with the subject in high school and knowledge of multi-variable calculus (which admittedly matters more in 181 for E&M than in 180 for mechanics) to those with literally no experience in either physics or multivariable calculus. This isn't to say that someone with no experience whatsoever in either of physics or multi can't succeed in 180/181, but as someone in that boat, it's been a lot more rough for me than a lot of my peers and I wouldn't exactly say I've succeeded in the ways they have with this course. Basically, I think there should be perhaps another introductory physics sequence that doesn't force Prof. Steinacker to have to cater to all of these too-varied levels of experience at once. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: high level of engagement, very interesting classes\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: ridiculously long problem sets, lectures where if you doze off for 10 seconds, you're lost for the rest of the class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Steinacker is amazing. She is so dedicated to helping everyone learn: she holds office hours every day so that we can work on the pset and ask questions. She also posts really comprehensive lecture notes so that you can go back and review the material on your own, and her review sessions for exams are super useful for gauging what she will test you on.\r\nWeakness: Not really any. I think sometimes the concepts themselves were confusing, so if I didn't keep up, then class would be a bit confusing. ",
            "\u00a0I loved how Adriane holds multiple office hours and study halls so you can definitely get help. She is such a nice person who really wants you to do well and I like how she learned my name this semester. I thought the psets each week were ok, but the last one was unnecessarily long. The lectures after midterm 2 were pretty confusing and I don't think they were delivered in the best way. Other than that, the lectures were great and conducive to learning. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Amazing professor, challenging and engaging PSETS, fair exams\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I felt that study halls this semester lacked the support that it had last semester. Other than that, none. ",
            "\u00a0Lecture notes are great. Problem sets seem pretty (very) tedious and time-consuming. I also feel like I'm lacking in practical electronics knowledge but know a lot of super semantic stuff. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: well organized, covers a ton of material, lots of support offered\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: people who took AP physics have a huge leg up. Otherwise you're left struggling through conceptually difficult material with little background knowledge. You can get extra help but it often is just too much to learn if you have a weak physics background. ",
            "\u00a0This course was extremely well taught and the professor's lectures were for the most part straightforward and easy to follow. The professor also posts class notes, which make it easy to go back and better understand concepts that might have passed over your head in lecture. Overall, the course is extremely well organized and makes learning easy. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: learned problem solving skills, mostly interesting topics, interesting lectures. Weaknesses: psets felt long at times, exams were a bit overwhelming content wise ",
            "\u00a0It is a course that dives deep into introductory concepts of electricity and magnetism that challenges students through problem sets and draws connections to various other sciences and concepts in physics. Sometimes, the lectures could get a little dry when the same concept was repeated over and over in various examples. However, I understand that this may be necessary to cater to a wide range of speeds in the class. However, given the amount of extra help available, perhaps the class could be more engaging a little faster/varied. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Professor Steinacker is a wonderful professor.\r\nWeakness: Problem sets take an awful amount of time. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - the professor is willing to help with just about anything\r\nWeaknesses - the class is really hard.  This was by FAR my most time-consuming class, and at times your grade doesn't reflect the effort you put in. ",

            "\u00a0The PSETs took me a ridiculous amount of time, but I do appreciate how Prof. Steinacker challenged us with the problems. It is just incredibly time consuming so you need to be ready for that. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength is the professor. Steinacker is an absolute gemThe class was also extremely informative and I learned a ton. The drawbacks are the workload, and how the psets practically require you to go to office hours to finish. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Steinacker made her herself extremely available for help, and she is empathetic of students' schedules. She made the whole course a great experience. \r\nMy only complaint would be that take-home tests should not be done. It was clear from the high average on the second midterm that there was academic dishonesty and that is frustrating for people who actually strive to be honest. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were very well taught and the course was structured so students could receive as much help as they needed outside of class. ",
            "\u00a0Great course, very high workload but the instructor more than makes up for it by being absolutely awesome. ",
            "\u00a0The TA, peer tutors, and Steinacker herself are outstanding; dedicating hours to helping us understand the tangle of the question and how to unknot it, until you become almost unconsciously familiar with the logic, the steps to solve. The class notes are clarifying, or crystallizing, with anecdotes (appearing in class also) to engage your interest and contextualize the concepts. \r\n\r\nIt may not be a weakness but the length of the psets can be draining; perhaps it is necessary to drudge through them in order to obtain that hard-earned, intuitive understanding; whether or not you had to pester PTs/TAs/Steinacker to guide you along the way or not. \r\n\r\nSome of the homework questions seemed to be unnecessarily convoluted to illuminate the E&M concepts they address, with lengthy algebra-intensive solutions. This, however, is relatively minor and perhaps helps to illustrate the sorts of skills physicists must apply to their own theoretical work. ",
            "\u00a0The psets were so long that it was hard to spend any time actually studying the material. The class itself was really well taught though. Professor Steinacker had really good notes for each lecture, which helped me to fill gaps where I had missed things in her original teaching. ",
            "\u00a0This course is truly designed to allow students to be challenged and to learn a lot over the course of the year. There are many resources for people who are struggling which make the course more accessible. The main weakness in my eyes was the workload. While I expected a heavy load, I spent every single evening throughout the entire semester working on nothing but physics. While I loved the challenge and the rigor, at times I felt frustrated because I spent most of my time working on physics and got a lot less out of my other classes because I couldn't spend as much time working on them as I wanted to. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Phenomenal and copious lecture notes posted online, thorough application of knowledge through homework;\r\nweaknesses:  lectures often difficult to sit through, though many were broken up well with short videos or demonstrations. ",
            "\u00a0It's taught very well and there are always TAs available to help you if needed. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the weekly problem sets, although long and often times difficult really help you assess what you know and don't know. Additionally, the peer tutors at office hours were amazing and incredibly helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The online notes that are posted are very helpful. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I find the professors teaching style hard to learn from in class. Tends to over-complicate things rather than try to build a confident foundation for us that we can build upon with further exploration outside of class via her notes.\r\n\r\nThe most conceptually difficult topics of the class were all at the very end. This made it super hard to learn them because most kids have a million other things to do at that time of the year. This led to a frustrating final that didn't represent our engagement over the first 5/6ths of the course. ",
            "\u00a0The problem sets were extremely laborious. While I don't believe they are as difficult as people say (taking 10+ hours a week), I was annoyed by how math heavy they were. The ugly integrals and derivatives were prone to mistakes, and most of my time was often spent getting the answer in the right form or looking for small math errors as opposed to understanding the physics. The strength of this course is Steinacker. She is an incredibly kind hearted professor who really wants to help her students in any way possible. While I felt like she treated students she favored better, she was incredibly kind across the board. ",
            "\u00a0This was amazing course! It really depends on you whether you like and do well and put in the work. The professor was amazing and the course material interesting. I did not do that well just because I am still figuring out how to study (I suggest writing down steps for each type of problem and then doing practice problems). ",
            "\u00a0Great professor, long and hard problem sets, but also plenty of opportunities to seek and obtain help ",
            "\u00a0This course was well structured overall. Steinacker cares for her students sooo much it's unbelievable, and her passion inspires the students to truly learn the material and gain confidence in physics. Her dedication extends far beyond the classroom, and she always makes herself available in office hours and other contexts to help us learn. ",
            "\u00a0There was a strong community of students that helped to increase support in the class. The professor and peer tutors were very helpful in office hours. The professor was willing to answer questions and asked on the status of the class's understanding during session. ",
            "\u00a0The course covers a lot of material and uses a lot of calculus in the material so I think that possibly taking multivariable calculus before the course would be beneficial. The course itself teaches a lot of the fundamentals of physics and is a great introduction to the world of physics. ",
            "\u00a0Adriane steinacker is a gem and what makes this course bearable. In order to cover the necessary material, the class assumes a certain prior knowledge which can make it tough to keep up with if you have a weaker background. Psets are extremely time consuming and can pretty much only be done in office hours or study hall since for most they are too hard to do alone, but they do prepare you well for the exams ",
            "\u00a0The lectures I believe could focus a bit more on the concepts behind these phenomena so they are more interesting, instead of focusing on deriving the formulas given on the formula sheet. Still, the P-sets are fantastic and facilitating student learning, as they encourage collaboration and teach concepts through actual problems. ",
            "\u00a0The course has very complected problem sets but the study halls available and class notes were very useful resources. The lectures were a great improvement from 180, much more  concise and easier to follow. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Steinacker, enough said\r\nWeakness: The p-sets take a while if you are a normal person ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course are that Professor Steinacker is great and that the structure is manageable. The weakness is that the lectures are a little dry and hard to follow. ",
            "\u00a0The teacher was amazing and I thought it was well paced but difficult. Honestly I dont have a ton of ways to make it better, but maybe more office hours. ",
            "\u00a0Very well structured, basic tools we learned in previous lectures were applied again with a deeper understanding of their purpose. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes I felt that we covered material very quickly which made it difficult to full understand all the concepts ",
            "\u00a0This is an amazing course with no weaknesses. The professor is amazing, and the problem sets help facilitate learning a lot. Lecture is very helpful for learning the material as well, and the consistent help sessions are very beneficial. ",
            "\u00a0The psets are too difficult, but professor steinacker is an amazing lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course are Professor Steinacker's passion for the material and her students and the availability of help. In such a large lecture, students come into the course with highly variable background knowledges of physics and mathematics, so it may be difficult for some students to keep up or learn the material based on lectures alone. However, there are notes posted on Canvas which are very detailed and extremely useful in terms of explaining the material covered in class in greater detail or in a different way which allows students to better understand it. These notes are also very helpful when it comes time to go back and review materials that were covered earlier in the semester, as they are more organized and detailed than a typical student's class notes and can be used to fill in gaps in understanding. Other strengths include the fact that office hours and study hall sessions are held so frequently, that there are so many peer tutors and TAs available to provide help, that there are weekly review sessions, that there are lengthy review sessions before each exam, and that test corrections are allowed. Last semester I found the exams to be unreasonably difficult, giving me massive amounts of stress and anxiety leading up to them, but I generally found the exams in 181 to be, though still of course challenging (as they should be), much more fair. The biggest weakness, I would say, is the massive number of hours that must be spent on problem sets per week. I understand that it is necessary to have difficult problem sets for a course like this, but perhaps they could be cut back slightly in length. The massive number of hours that I needed to spend per week working on problem sets cut into my focus for other classes and time that I would've liked to spend doing research work. ",

            "\u00a0I like how she bases her grades off of how much effort she puts in, but she doesnt know who goes to study hall so maybe she should have people sign in if they go to study hall if she really wants to help improve your grade if you show that you put in a lot of work. Because I could never get to her office hours due to class and other required events. ",
            "\u00a0This course is really hard, which could be considered a weakness, but really it's a strength. The homeworks help you really get the concepts into your head and pretty much require a bit of teamwork, so you'll hear other people explain things or you'll explain things to people and reinforce everything. Prof. Steinacker is one of the greatest lecturers ever--she explain it well, she's funny, engaging, and VERY caring about the students and the topics. She is the greatest strength of this class. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot in this course and I feel like I became more able to handle what I was given as the course proceeded. The difficulty of the problem sets is inconsistent week to week which sometimes makes it difficult to prepare properly. ",
            "\u00a0Problem sets were tough but great preparation for the exams ",
            "\u00a0A lot of work, but its rewarding because it pays off. So a weakness is how time consuming it is, but a strength is the level of comprehension that comes with it. ",
            "\u00a0Her office hours were very useful. I did not notice any major weaknesses ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the support that the professor offers by having many office hours, the topics, the enthusiasm of the professor while teaching, the style of teaching, and providing the lecture notes to the students. \r\nWeaknesses: none ",
            "\u00a0It is ridiculous that going into the final I had 5 weeks of homeworks (and my last exam) that were ungraded. The TAs for physics have been the least prompt TAs of any class I've taken at Yale. Learning occurs when the feedback is fast, something which the TAs failed to do both semesters. I have taken classes where TAs have a turn around time of a few days. Over a month is nowhere close to acceptable. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: So many office hours/study halls, a grading system that emphasizes the homework, and homework that (although it's very difficult) really forces you to learn and retain the material if you devote time to it.  The course is organized for students success, and allows you to get back what you put in.  You won't have hours of busy work that don't actually enhance your knowledge of the material.\r\n\r\nWeakness: This isn't so much a weakness, but it is a very challenging class.  I think especially towards the end of the semester when there were more psets due on Sunday (as opposed to Friday), it would've been nice to have even more office hours because otherwise the students who are behind just mooch off of the students who went to office hours early in the week. There was a TA who did a review of concepts, but it was on Monday evenings.  Personally, I didn't have that time free, but I also wonder if a time towards the end of the week would've been better.  Having class on Monday and Wednesday means between Wednesday and the next Monday, there are practically five days of no lecture, so I think the review of materials might be good on a Friday. ",
            "\u00a0Very well taught, but PSETs are very long and require peer-tutor help. Although the support system is sufficient if you use it ",
            "\u00a0There were no real weakness of the course. The main strength of the course was definitely the instructor. Professor Steinacker is an amazing professor and was able to beautifully convey the information whether in class, office hours, or her online notes. The class was very much a success because of her teaching style. ",
            "\u00a0I think having the notes for each lecture available before class would be amazing because it's hard for me to understand everything when seeing it for the first time. If the notes are not made available before class, then it might also be better to skip some of the smaller algebra steps and focus more on the conceptual parts and just note that the algebraic steps are available in the notes. ",
            "\u00a0The class is manageable but the PSETS are long and frustrating if you don't go to office hours. Professor Steinacker does a great job making resources available to help students understand the material! Lectures were long but professor Steinacker is a great lecturer. A weakness of the class is that there is a wide range of experience level with physics and there are many students that have much more experience in physics than others so they should have been in the higher level physics class. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are that it builds very naturally off of PHYS 180; the problem sets are reasonable; there is lots of help for the problem sets; the exams are easier than the problem sets, which makes them less stressful; the course is extremely well-organized; and that it goes through what are traditionally seen as difficult concepts in physics in a very easy to digest way. The main weakness is that I feel like we could do more. I especially felt this way after the professor showed us how to derive Maxwell's Equations on the last day of class, since these equations have SO much potential in physics. But, I guess people can take PHYS 201 or 261 if they really want more... ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength is Prof. Steinacker. She is a gem (much like her favorite problems), and her passion for the subject makes her students care about it too. She is very organized in the way she teaches and her online notes are a great guide. The only suggestion I have for improvement is to perhaps slow down a tiny bit during class, especially toward the end of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0A real strength of this course was the alignment of the course content in every aspect: homework, class, exams, etc. It was an immense time commitment. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of this course is professor Steinacker. She is beyond dedicated to helping every student learn the material and do well in the course. The biggest weakness of this course is definitely the homework. Quite simply, I see no point in having homeworks so long and so challenging. Instead of spending countless hours stumbling through tedious algebra, students could learn the material much better if they could instead use that time to study in other, more direct ways. More often than not, when the problem sets got too difficult, many students would simply go to peer-tutoring or study hall, obtain the answers, and leave without really learning the underlying concepts behind the material. In this sense, I really think students should be encouraged to work through the problems on their own first and only later resort to outside help. A better way to facilitate this would be to make the problems sets easier but with more problems. I often felt like many of the concepts we learned in class were not \"relevant\" just because one of the long homework problems did not address them. Having problem sets with easier but more problems would a.) allow more testing on more content of the course, and b.) encourage students to start the work on their own first. ",
            "\u00a0Steinacker is a wonderful Professor- her office hours and study hall are incredibly helpful and I appreciate that notes are posted online. In class however I find that my notes can seem a bit disorganized. Otherwise, conceptually a very logical progression in material ",

She is completely extraordinary in her love for students, for teaching, for the material of this coursereally cannot imagine it being done better than her. she dedicates so much extra time to helping her students during office hours, puts so much time into writing thought provoking yet doable problems, and is super fun to interact with.

She is a gem.\r\n-Extremely frequent office hours\r\n-Very well organized class notes--I think this one is not talked about much but a big one for me\r\n-Exam reviews--Exceptionally good at clarifying key concepts, especially when compared to review sessions for other classes\r\n-Problem Sets--Difficult and a bit time consuming but working through them well really helped you learn the material\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n-After the take-home midterm I learned that a lot of students used their notes which was not allowed. Which is sad :(  Not sure if this is a weakness of the course, but in general I don't think take home exams seem suited for this class\r\n-Sometimes it felt like the peer tutors acted more as answer checkers than tutors, which is understandable when the question they usually get is \"Did I get this one right?\" Still, I think it would have ben nice at times if they were a bit more focused on broader concepts than on the specific answers you got for a given problem ",
            "\u00a0The course is well-structured thanks to Professor Steinackers rigor and organization. Each class has a defined set of topics to cover, and supported with historical context and everyday examples. Each lecture is also in notes form on Canvasback to review concepts. The homework assignments help us understand the material through practice, and Steinackers willingness to help students and doing the problem sets together made the assignments fun and learning bonding experience.

Lecture was extremely useful, problem sets were challenging but doable if you pay attention in class, and there were ample opportunities for extra help. Professor Steinacker went far above and beyond to make sure that any student who asked for help received it! ",
            "\u00a0The course is taught very well, and the lectures were some of the most enjoyable and engaging lectures I've had at Yale. The weekly problem sets are not easy or short, but they really help the understanding of the course material, and with the amount of office hours and study hall, they are very doable when one plans their schedule for it. Also, the course really fosters a very supportive community between the students, which is a very important quality I wish more courses at Yale were able to achieve. ",
            "\u00a0This course, like Professor Steinacker's Physics 180 course, is truly one of the most well-run courses at Yale. There is an abundance of help for problem sets between office hours and study halls in which Professor Steinacker and the peer tutors really dedicate themselves to helping their students. One weakness of this is that it often feels like office hours are not a place where you can ask for help for broader conceptual questions or for help preparing for an exam. The lectures are very clear and engaging, and Professor Steinacker's appreciation for physics really shines when she lectures. ",

I felt lost during a lot of the class, but as I went back through the material to study for the final I was surprised at my level of comfort with everything. Most of this was thanks to investment Professor Steinacker makes in her students' education. ",

Professor Steinacker is super nice, but her teaching style just isn't for everyone. This course is conceptually quite difficult and the math is quite tough at times. If you need to take it it's manageable but the course is not super engaging as its lots of dry calculations. People who took AP physics have a huge leg up. Otherwise you're left struggling through conceptually difficult material with little background knowledge. You can get extra help but it often is just too much to learn if you have a weak physics background. There isn't really another intro option though... ",

Psets take at least 7 hours of my time, with extensive help; if I were to struggle through alone it would take longer and I would tend to head in the wrong direction, solution-wise.
