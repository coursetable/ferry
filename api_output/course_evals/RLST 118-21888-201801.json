            "\u00a0I learned how to understand and apply major interpretive strategies used to interpret important and authoritative texts such as the Bible and the US Constitution and how the two can be put in conversation. I also learned to apply the same to other texts. ",
            "\u00a0I became much more analytical. I would rename this course \"Analyzing Interpretations of Things\" - it's all we do for the readings, for the assignments and for the final project. During class we also learned very interesting material about the content of the Constitution and the Bible, and their role in history. I got better at writing, with input from Professor Doerfler and the TFs! ",
            "\u00a0A decent understanding of interpretive strategies of both texts. ",
            "\u00a0In this course, I learned about the different strategies for interpreting texts, the strengths and weaknesses for those strategies, and what they look like in practice when applied to the Bible and the Constitution. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest insight I came out of this class with was the ability to understand how groups of people read and interpretive authoritative documents and use these readings/interpretations to guide their decision making process. The interpretive process is one that results in changes and decisions that have real world effects on every human an understanding it is fundamental to understanding society. Additionally, I walked away from the class with improved writing skills, especially for humanities writing that requires deep analytical writing. To be specific, I've always had an issue refining the scope of my paper to produce effective arguments; typically I would be spilling over the word count with unclear logic. This class forced me to refine my theses and aims of the papers so that they could be effective arguments. By the end, I felt like the issues was almost non-existent. Though, I could always use a few more words. ",
            "\u00a0Ability to write reasoned, measured, focused papers that present arguments. understandings of the intersections of religion and american law, similarities and difference between the authoritative or canonical status of various texts in the interpretation of both. Reading documents for arguments, understanding differences in strategies of arguments from texts. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how different communities interpret the Bible and constitution now and how they have been interpreted in the past. We also spent a lot of time discussing the theory of interpretation in general. ",
            "\u00a0So many! My analytical thinking skills were really stretched and developed during this course, and I now feel much better equipped to approach texts with a critical eye. ",
            "\u00a0I did some neat comparative work applying interpretive strategies common in legal interpretation to the Bible and vice versa, which was fascinating. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a great introduction to hermetical and exegetical strategies and methods in readings texts in general, with the Constitution and Bible as the main texts examined. The final project, which asks you to apply strategies to reading texts to other works is a good capstone to the coursework overall. ",
            "\u00a0i learned how to read scholars of the bible and the constitution and to read case law in a more careful way than i have in the past. ",
            "\u00a0This course allowed me to gain experience working with legal and religious texts and I learned not only a lot about writing papers but also just how to read and analyze primary documents. ",

            "\u00a0Taking Biblical and Constitutional Interpretation gave me a deeper understanding and more profound appreciation for how we go about interpreting foundational texts such as these. I feel much more secure in my knowledge of both texts and the interpretative strategies in learned in this class, I think, can serve me well in many different arenas. ",

I learned many of the central figures from different religious and social backgrounds who interpret these texts, and then applied them analytically to discuss current-day issues such as migration and gay marriage.

While I was expecting this course to be more of an analysis between the relations of the bible and the constitution, instead it was much more focused on studying why a certain group came to their specific conclusion on an issue. ",

            "\u00a0Frankly, I wish I could copy and paste the entire syllabus and the discussion questions posted for the day in announcements. The class is really focused on interpretation and interpretive strategies across both the bible and the constitution's interpreters. The methodologies and thought processes learned can be applied to any text, document, question, or problem, for which there is no substitution for the class and its professor, Professor Doerfler. "

            "\u00a0The combined lecture and seminar format of the course provided an enjoyable mix of instruction and participation and helped me to engage more with the excellent selections of readings. The papers are good opportunities to engage more closely with both primary texts. ",
            "\u00a0It is very academic and Professor Doerfler knows so much. While the course was dry at times, I think everyone could tell by the title that that would be the case...and took it anyway. It was of unparalleled benefit for my writing, and general knowledge regarding two of the most foundational texts in history. I think that the final project was a great idea - but perhaps more effort could have been made throughout the semester to address texts not so eminently foundational as the Bible and Constitution. Hearing Professor Doerfler's own exegesis of Harry Potter would have been fascinating! ",
            "\u00a0This class probably should have been a seminar. It ended up being a weird point between a lecture and a seminar, so didn't really do either well. Part of this effect was that the airtime was taken up by many of the same students rather than entirely the professor or room for everyone to speak. The essays were interesting and so were the case studies. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The instructors were all very knowledgeable, engaging, and helpful. You never feel out of touch with the class. The beginning of the course, which focussed on interpretive strategies, was particularly interesting. The first several readings were all very fascinating and relevant to the course. The range of perspectives and variety of approaches was another huge strength.\r\nWeaknesses: I think the course could have benefited more from direct engagement with the Bible and the Constitution. Particularly during the case studies at the end of the course, it did not feel like we did justice to the texts. We looked at other people's opinions on what the texts say, but its hard to evaluate their arguments without more familiarity with the texts themselves. I think the course would benefit from reading the entire constitution (as well as comparing it to other legal texts from the time) and much more of the Bible. With none of the four instructors coming from mostly legal backgrounds, I think the course could've benefited from one or two TAs from the law school.\r\nWith that said, I still think the course fulfilled its purpose, and I really enjoyed it. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Well-organized, informational, writing and discussion oriented, very helpful instructors.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes rushed when doing group work and presentations, but this is normal.\r\nImprovements: Many of the kids coming into the class took ConLaw the semester before or have had experience in a scholastic religious setting before. Therefore, they already have familiarity with a lot of the practices and texts talked about in class. Meanwhile, some students have little to no experience with these two areas (for me, this was the latter.) I do not believe that any more lecture time should be taken to give students more background on these texts (the bible and constitution) since they and the other students would be losing stimulating intellectual discussion. However, some type of \"starter pack\" or initial resources uploaded to Canvas would have been useful. This would just be a series of readings/websites/outlines hand selected by Prof. Doerfler to give the greenhorn a crash course in these texts so they have a better framework in their mind to talk about them. ",
            "\u00a0This course had a well curated syllabus, excellent instruction, a fantastic learning community, exciting activities and discussions, and addressed interesting topics. Weaknesses are few, but I think that some people may have been in the class without fully participating in the community. Having the class as a smaller seminar would have drawbacks though, because it would eliminate the awesome TA lectures and fun class activities, so I do not think it would be better to change it. \r\n\r\nSometimes having all of the class instructions come through email was inconvenient. ",
            "\u00a0The strength for me was the very interesting material. It felt to me that the class focused on the Bible more than it focused on the constitution, which was exactly what I wanted. There was also a good degree of flexibility in regards to choosing what to write our papers on so that allowed us to focus on the readings that interested us most, which was nice. This class is all papers and participation, no tests or final. The main weakness for me was that the class was 45 students but still felt rather impersonal. I wasn't sure if the professor or TF's ever learned my name. Another weakness was that we rotated between TF's rather than having one assigned to us, which contributed to the impersonal nature. Some students also have a very strong background in either the constitution or Bible so if you do not it is possible you will feel a little out of your element. However, since there are no tests this didn't matter too much. ",
            "\u00a0This is a GREAT class. Its well constructed with a balanced reading load, and the prof and TFs really know their stuff. The class would work better as a seminar than the leminar format it has now. I also think students might be more committed to the discussion in a seminar setting. ",
            "\u00a0I really recommend this course as the material, despite being very wide in scope (from early Christian patristics to Antonin Scalia), are still engaging across the board. I think one improvement could be a reduction in the time spent on getting students to engage and discuss with one another, as sometimes lectures were rushed to get to open discussion time when more should have been allotted for the lecture itself. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: really informational! i loved this class\r\n\r\nweaknesses: a few too many people in the class, a weird combination between lecture and seminar ",
            "\u00a0I think the course material was very interesting but since the crux of the lessons focus on biblical and constitutional interpretations, it is very Euro-centric. As a non-white individual, I often felt uncomfortable within this class as we discussed very controversial social topics such as gay marriage and immigration in a class that was predominantly white, with many conservative students. Also, given the Euro-centric nature of the curriculum, all of the teaching assistants were white women who undoubtedly were experts in the field but this made the experience even more uncomfortable. ",
            "\u00a0Awesome course. Professor Doerfler does a great job or varying class structure and lesson plans in order to maximize student engagement and learning. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting readings, manageable workload, great exposure to many lines of religious and legal thought! ",
            "\u00a0Would have been better as a seminar ",
            "\u00a0The course is structure in a leminar form, which I find to be its greatest strength. I learned so much from Professor Doerfler's lectures and walked away feeling as though the class perfectly balanced lecturing and discussion. I do not think that the class has any weaknesses, but one way in which I think it could be improved would be to possibly offer more writing prompts on biblical interpretation. I found it personally very difficult to write about biblical interpretation because at times it felt that when it came down to having the rubber meet the road, so to speak, the course was more weighted to constitutional interpretation. ",
            "\u00a0I think Prof Doerfler intended for a different class size, but we ended up with ~40 students and the class was taught kind of like a high school class, with activities that felt juvenile and group presentations. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course was its title, a clever enterprise that the course never deigned to pursue. The TAs did their best to warm the students to the subject in spite seeming tasked with either (a) nothing in particular or (b) the entire teaching component of the course.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of the course was its poor organization: in-class course content differed widely from the syllabus readings and graded content.  Rather than teaching interpretive techniques as the seminar sold, the 'seminar' consisted of death-by-powerpoint lectures on intelligence-insulted introductory Christian and legal history.  The readings of high-brow interpretive works went unaddressed, until occasional 5-minute TA breakout sessions that were tasked cumulatively with (a) breaking down 100s of pages of erudite interpretive theory for understanding, (b) appraising who did the readings, (c) extracting a transferable interpretive method from those readings, (d) practising the skill of applying that interpretive method in another setting, to give students the wings with which to write their essays.\r\nUnderstandably, the sessions only achieved (b).  Thereafter, essays were not graded on idea quality but on mechanics and (it seemed) political palatability. ",
            "\u00a0Too much constitution, not enough Bible ",
            "\u00a0I think this course would be better done in a smaller setting, like a seminar or 25-person lecture. I enjoyed the content and thought the TFs were very knowledgeable. ",
            "\u00a0Great that we were able to have seminar-like discussion in a lecture-sized class. ",
            "\u00a0This course had a steep learning curve. For bible/law neophytes like myself, this was challenging at first. However, it meant that I learned a lot and quickly in this course. ",
            "\u00a0I would have enjoyed doing more comparisons between conclusions reached by interpretive strategies of different works and how those works actually lend themselves to different interpretations. I think that would have been interesting, but definitely not necessary. I really enjoyed this class. ",
            "\u00a0A more systematic approach would have been helpful at the beginning of the term.  Also, while the readings were helpful, it was fairly easy to do well in the class without doing them.  Class discussions felt dominated by the same few people. ",
            "\u00a0This class was amazing. I really like the half lecture/ half seminar format. ",
            "\u00a0This class was incredibly strong - Professor Doerfler was engaging and organized, the TFs were constructive and involved, and the readings were rich and substantive, complementing each other, the lesson, and the lecture. I wish the semester could have been longer for the sake of this class. "

            "\u00a0I recommend this course to all who are interested in the rich interpretive traditions surrounding both the Bible and the Constitution. It is a very specific interest, but it has broad application. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend, as long as you really engage with it. ",
            "\u00a0The topics are interesting but definitely an intro level course. I don't recommend if you have high levels of experience in either area. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would recommend this course. The material is interesting and well taught. It changed the way I see the world, and I think it is very relevant and useful knowledge to have. ",
            "\u00a0Whether or not to recommend this course is a tricky question. If you are a Poli Sci or Religious Studies students, take this class. There is no other like it. The challenge is absolutely worth it and you will develop so many skills and so much knowledge pertinent to your field (re: the first question in this evaluation) it'd be a bad idea to not take the class at some point. If you are majoring in another humanities/social science major, it's also probably a decent idea to take this class but not as immediate as the former situation. I, though, am a STEM major and this class isn't directly related to my academic/career goals. If you're in that position and just want an easy Hu/WR credit, don't take this class; it'll be bad for both you and everyone else since this class benefits so greatly from class discussion. If you want to satisfy those credits but still want a stimulating class that is manageable, then again, I recommend you take this course. It will change the way you read and write generally and equip with you with a very profound understanding of how religion and civics are read in the US and the world. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. The course is fantastic, well run, and interesting. Take it as a writing credit if you need one, or if you don't need one take it anyway. ",

            "\u00a0Yes I would, as long as the student is interested in the Bible and/or the Constitution. I felt that the readings about the Bible (from both Christian and Jewish sources) were very eye-opening and the class as a whole was fascinating. ",

            "\u00a0No. From my experience, the class was taught at a low intellectual level, but expected preexisting knowledge on the Bible and the Constitution that was not taught at all. As a student who was familiar with one of these texts, I found the discussion of it very uninspired, yet simultaneously did not understand much of the discussion of the other text--not because of intellectual level but because of esoteric citations that were never explained. ",
