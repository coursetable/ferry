I learnt a lot about historical perspectives of the global environmental movement and the role environmental law has played in promoting the global environmental protection agenda. ",

They two professors were great and knew their fields very well--and were therefore able to make the courses very practical and engaging. They provided a lot of real life case studies which made the course very interesting and practical. ",
