            "\u00a0I was able to expand my knowledge on land use planning concepts by thanks to Jessica's lectures as well as to guest lecturers' experiences and stories. I am now also able to apply these concepts to real-world planning scenarios. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great overview of a variety of land use topics and offers some perspective on urban issues (a topic largely missing from the FES curriculum) ",
            "\u00a0zoning history and tools ",
            "\u00a0An understanding of local land use legal considerations. ",
            "\u00a0I gained an overview of the land use field.  Nice exposure to a diverse set of professionals. ",
            "\u00a0A great overview of land use planning. As a second year I had already engaged with many of these concepts, but I still learned something new each class. Some topics were entirely new, definitely make this class worthwhile! Each speaker was great, and provided in depth knowledge and examples for each topic. ",
            "\u00a0This was an excellent entree into the field of urban planning. For very little work I reaped high rewards. I wish more courses like this (quick overviews of a topic) were offered at FES. ",
            "\u00a0I learned new concepts and theory on land use. I really enjoyed the class it covered different interesting topics. To me It was very useful to narrow my interests. "

        [
            "\u00a0They aligned perfectly. I was hoping to get more of a foundation of land use planning concepts out of this course before devling into more advanced course at FES and that is exactly what I got. ",
            "\u00a0Very well- Jessica laid out a clear plan for the semester and followed that closely ",
            "\u00a0Very well. ",
            "\u00a0Well. ",

            "\u00a0I wasn't sure what to expect of a 1 credit course, but I was very pleased with what I got out of Jessica's class. It was well organized and most of the speakers she brought in were great. I appreciated the range of focus of the lectures. ",

            "\u00a0I really loved having all of the guest speakers come in and talk about their experiences. My favorite guest speaker was Snigdha Garg from C40, partly because she was an FES alumnus and also because she worked on resiliency projects which is something I am very interested in. I loved the variety the course offered while also providing a solid foundation for concepts used in land use planning. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course offers alot of breadth but should be extended to 1.5 hours to allow for more class discussion and engagement with the speakers. ",
            "\u00a0The class length needs to be increased to 1.5 hour to allow for more discussions. This class is very informative. ",
            "\u00a0The topic presentations could be more direct, succinct. ",
            "\u00a0Nice variety of topics.  Individual classes were too short (under an hour); speakers ran out of time each week. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include great guest speakers, a variety of topics, and plenty of room for exploring specific ideas you are interested in. Jessica is a great lecturer, and is extremely knowledgeable! ",
            "\u00a0I would have liked to see more international cases. I felt the course and the majority of the lectures/presentations were US-based. \r\nI recommend starting the class on time. Sometimes we run out of time, and there was no time for questions and sometimes the guest speakers were not able to finish their presentations. "

            "\u00a0I would tell a prospective student that this class is essential for them if they are interested and plan to pursue land use planning as a career. It provides a great foundation for important concepts used commonly in the field and other more advanced land use planning classes at FES. ",
            "\u00a0This is one of the few land use planning/ urban classes at FES so I think it is an important introductory course. ",
            "\u00a0Take it ",
            "\u00a0Take it!  Really fun. ",
            "\u00a0This class builds overview knowledge of land use planning which is valuable for any FES student. There is material here that applies to every area of study. Do the readings to get the most out of the lectures (especially anything written by John Nolan). Great opportunity to learn under Jessica Bacher. She is a smart teacher who brings her land use experience to the classroom. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great class to take as an overview of land use planning concepts. Highly recommended for first years, and still recommended for second years - there will always be topics you haven't fully explored yet! Jessica and all the guest speakers are great, and provide lots of in depth subject matter knowledge. The workload is light, so it is a great one-credit to add. ",
            "\u00a0If you're considering taking this course, take it! There is no reason not to. It's a great overview of the topic, and you don't have to do much work. You'll get a glimpse into the legal and policy angles of this work, as well as some specific areas like green infrastructure and renewable energy siting. "
