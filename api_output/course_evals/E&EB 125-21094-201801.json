            "\u00a0I gained a more holistic perspective on the history of life on Earth and the very small place that humanity occupies in that history. I was exposed to a plethora of strange and incredible life-forms and the evolving scientific protocols and processes by which they were found, classified and the attempts to understand their behaviors and environments. I gained an appreciation for and understanding of the basic principles involved in paleontology, geology, geochemistry, paleobiology and many others, and how these fields intersect to create useful information. I also became more scientifically literate through exposure to contrasting hypotheses and reading field research, which greatly increased my understanding of the course material. ",

            "\u00a0The course could be improved by more discussion and coordination between the two instructors, as I felt that there was a very significant difference in the teaching styles and points of emphasis in content (I felt strongly that Prof. Brigg's section of the course very firmly belonged in the G&G Department, whereas Prof. Hull's belonged just as strongly in E&EB). While having two instructors with different specialties in the same course can be a very rewarding experience, I often felt more like the course was two concurrent classes that (sort of) build on each other; I believe that the course would be significantly improved by integrating both departments better into both halves of the course.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed the two labs we did and felt they were excellent illustrative experiences; the few sections were useful with a good TA, otherwise not. Lectures were especially valuable in the first half of the course, as they were very specific-content heavy; however, it was also easier to recover from missing a lecture in the first half of the course, as Derek's lecture slides were far more detailed than Celli's, whose lectures sometimes lacked focus and/or a binding narrative.\r\n\r\nReadings in general were incredibly useful to clarify the course material, although there were too many of them and some were too technical to understand without a heavy background in geology/geochemistry/chemistry/biology; the instructors should probably do a better job of screening for readings like those and removing them. I would say about 2/3 of the total readings assigned would be a reasonable amount. There were definitely too many to consistently keep up with, which was a shame - as I said before, they were generally engaging and quite valuable.\r\n\r\nI question the necessity of the paper, which strongly felt like a \"grading for the sake of more grades\" mechanism and did not whatsoever assist or enhance my comprehension of the course content. ",
            "\u00a0The serialized format of the course, particularly in the later half of the semester, was difficult; it felt like there was no overarching arch to the course, which made it difficult to engage and draw connections. However, the strengths were in how wide-reaching it was; it does exactly what it proports to do, which is expose you to the major events throughout the history of life. ",
            "\u00a0I think it would be interesting to acknowledge theories for the origins of life in the first place. ",
            "\u00a0This course was absolutely terrible in terms of TA's. The grading was extremely unfair and lacked any sort of consistency. The lectures were disorganized and most of the time in class was spent by the professors rambling on stuff which in no way pertained to the course. The assignments, although very few, were not well explained in terms of expectations and were graded extremely brutally given the fact the course advertises itself as a course for non-STEM Majors. The only redeeming quality of this course was the fact that the material was interesting and learning it on my own kept me entertained. ",
            "\u00a0At the beginning of each lecture, Celli would ask a few questions to review the main ideas from the last lecture. This was very helpful for my learning. ",
            "\u00a0This course was really fun! I enjoyed the material, and it was engaging. Both Professor Briggs and Professor Hull were engaging and fun, and sincerely passionate about the information. However, there was a huge discrepancy between the two teaching styles, which made the transition rather difficult. In addition, while Professor Briggs could often be a little dry, I did feel like I grasped the narrative that he was trying to teach us and walked away understanding the basics, where I could fill in the gaps later with the readings (which were often dense), I felt that Professor Hull's lectures weren't cohesive and I often walked away not understanding what the greater point was. I definitely think that the cohesiveness of both the course in general and of individual lectures could be improved, as well as finding readings that were more easily accessible. In addition, I found it difficult to get responses from the instructors/TAs at times.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the midterm was weighted more heavily than the final which seems unfair considering the only difference was the length of the final, not the amount of material covered. As the amount of material covered is the same, I would expect the exams to be of similar length and difficulty. However, the final was much harder than the midterm and expectations for the answers were unfair given the amount of time we had. ",
            "\u00a0The lecture is great they just use some very large words at some points and dont spell them or so when I go back and look at my notes its very hard for me to determine what animal or event I am trying to look for. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the course was taught by just about the best faculty members you can ask for. They are the rock stars of the field, so every lecture was really worth it.\r\nWeaknesses: not enough personal feedback (understandable given the large number of students taking the course), the fact that a huge portion of the class was treating it as a gut. ",
            "\u00a0The grading was bizarre and the TAs were disorganized. Professor Hull was great. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- Very interesting material \r\n- I really enjoyed the labs\r\n- Some TAs like Nicolas Mongiardino Koch very helpful and knowledgeable.\r\n\r\n Weaknesses:\r\n- Lecture slides were extremely disorganized. They mostly contained pictures. In order to access the information to succeed in the exam, we were obligated to do internet search. \r\n- Exams were unfairly hard and badly graded. \r\n- Professor Hull answers her emails late or she doesn't respond at all. I think this is an unprofessional behavior. \r\n- They don't give you a proper midterm feedback. ",
            "\u00a0More consistent sections would be appreciated with clearer ideas of what should be the learning goals in the first half of the semester. But the sincerity of the professors in wanting us to learn is evident. ",
            "\u00a0I like that this course is divided in two and we have two excellent instructors. I think that the difficulty of the class is different between the two halves of the semester, so perhaps that can be standardized. ",
            "\u00a0The midterm was hard to prepare for because themes of the course where unclear to me at the time. It would be better if there were a study guide like the final ",
            "\u00a0The first half of the class was excellent. Professor Briggs is very engaging and his lecture material is very clear, although it is very detail-oriented. Professor Hulls half of the class is also fairly interesting, but the lectures have a tendency to wander a lot more and Professor Briggs lectures. Overall the two-Professor system is good for people with different learning styles, and it helps give a different perspective on the material. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Celli was really nice. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: terrible location (literally the farthest point on campus), labs that were more fitting for fifth graders than college students, abysmal communication between professors, TFs, and students about grading standards, strangely graded assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Strenghs: \r\n- The professor\r\n- Comprehensive material \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Material in the first half of the course is really dry and could be suplemented with more examples from current life \r\n- The lab and visits to museums are not that organized. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: terrible slides that were not useful for studying\r\n\r\nStrength: well organized ",
            "\u00a0The material was very interesting and incorporated recent research. Professor Briggs and Professor Hull were clearly the foremost experts of their fields and their enthusiasm was inspiring. Their care for the individual students was unparalleled for across lecture classes. I liked the cornucopia of topics covered and would also have like a little more structure. It would have been particularly helpful if the lecture slides had included more text. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very interesting and tells the story about how the world was shaped; it's a history class about Earth's past. The material was very engaging and the professors make an effort to explain concepts in a very general way that makes seemingly difficult topics that can go over your head accessible to everyone. There are also trips to the Peabody museum and sections to help prepare for exams. ",
            "\u00a0The course covers a lot of content (reasonably so) but I felt that the content was so specific and to a non-science major was very hard to make sense of. When it came to the final, I felt like there was an overwhelming amount of information to review that was not always very clearly articulated. The midterm and final were incredibly specific in the questions they asked but the lectures were vague and confusing. I was never really sure what information mattered during lecture. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very interesting, and it actually helped me pick G&G as my major. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Hull was good about indicating through lecture what content we should and should not preoccupy ourselves with trying to memorize - Professor Briggs not so much, which was really an issue because his segment of the curriculum covered/texted so much more content and such specific details (names of inidividual species). ",
            "\u00a0Grading was such an issue. On several assignments I got points off when I had asked the TAs whether my answer was correct and they said yes, but then said it was wrong when grading. It was all super inconsistent. And there really wasnt anything to balance out grades. ",
            "\u00a0I think the lectures were very interesting, and I liked how the course was taught by two different professors. I also liked the lab classes for this course, but I think they could have been a bit more rigorous. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are very knowledgable instructors who are leading experts in this specific subject.\r\n\r\nWeakness is sometimes information isn't well presented and engagement among the class is low. ",
            "\u00a0There was so information being given to us at one time it was difficult to discern what we should study for the exams. The material was really interesting, at least! "

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! History of Life is exactly what I wanted for a science credit in that it's an extremely thorough intro course that is fairly challenging with fascinating material (although it is quite content-heavy). Be warned that this is not a gut and involves a fair amount of regular work, almost all reading, to stay on top of it, and two comprehensive exams. I've seen other reviews that say that the reading is optional - this is definitely wrong, as the readings greatly helped me in clarifying and solidifying the course material (although some readings are highly technical and can be skimmed/skipped). The course is also designed to increase scientific literacy, often by walking through evidence, resulting hypotheses and how well these stood the test of time - classic stuff. The material itself is fascinating and has greatly increased my understanding of the history of life on Earth (duh), paleoenvironments, the mode of life of fascinating extinct organisms and the interactions between these organisms and their environments. Humans really are quite small, not physically but temporally - that sense of informed perspective is perhaps the most important thing I gained in this course. Derek is an incredible lecturer and renowned expert in his field, and Celli was good; the two sections of the course can be rather disparate, and Celli's lectures sometimes felt as if they lacked cohesion (although this was not an all-the-time thing - I said she was good and it's true, her enthusiasm and passion for her work were contagious!) The midterm was difficult but reasonable; the paper was long, difficult and unnecessary, as it took far too much outside research for no real reason; and I have no reason to assume the final will differ significantly from the midterm. ",
            "\u00a0If a person is really interested in G&G, maybe. But if you are taking this class to fulfill a distributional req  I wouldn't take the class. Nothing about this class facilitated learning for students who are not strong in the sciences. They make a lot of assumptions about your knowledge base and it was hard to catch up once you fell behind. In addition to that, the professors were not really clear on how grading works and were very harsh graders, making it hard to accurately assess how well students were doing in the course. ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course, but expect to work hard studying for exams (theyre kind of brutal). But the material is super interesting, and it definitely left me wanting to learn more! ",
            "\u00a0This class was my favorite this semester, a must take for anyone who wants a better understanding of the natural world. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely not recommend this course to another student. The exams were nothing more than last-minute memorization and the material was not well taught at all. It was unclear what would and wouldn't be tested and the professors did not provide much in terms of practice material for the examinations. The TA's were terrible and the grading was extremely unpredictable and unfair depending on which TA you received. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class if you want to be generally knowledgeable about the timescale of earth's history and when certain forms of life appeared and went extinct. Be warned: while some people love learning about early life forms, they are not particularly vivid. Also, there is a lot of time spent on fossils and how to understand life-- not just what we know, but how we know it. It's challenging at times. ",
            "\u00a0I would! I learned a lot and it was very interesting. The passion that the two instructors feel are very evident and it makes the class worth attending. I think had I not attended the lectures it would have been a much drier subject - the readings were much harder than how they were presented in lectures and so I highly recommend going to the lectures (even though the location is difficult, at best - please move them from KGL!!! Especially the sections!) There are 4 sections, two for each professor. One is a general section to help with concepts of the course (for that half) and the other is the review for the midterm/final. These were helpful, but often the review sessions were too loosely structured for any real progress in the allotted hour (also they were at times that were not very convenient...) \r\nThere is one midterm and one final, each covering the same amount of material, but the final is weighted more heavily than the midterm simply because it is longer. While the midterm was pretty fair, especially for the amount of depth and breadth it wanted for each question, the final was brutal. I think if that were restructured it'd be better. The grading was also a little unspecific, so you know your grades but not really why the point assignment was given. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would it was very interesting ",
            "\u00a0Don't treat it as a gut, because it is in every way not. If you don't show up to lectures and expect to know everything just by studying overnight, you are out of luck. You can learn a ton of stuff about paleontology and how the field developed its theory and knowledge from Professors Briggs and Hull, so imo this class is 10/10 worth it. The people with whom you are taking this class may make or break your experience. ",

Going to class and taking good notes is the key to doing well because the readings are dense and too complex to be truly helpful for exam preparation. ",
