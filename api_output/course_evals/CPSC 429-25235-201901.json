            "\u00a0The project was fun and useful to my learning. The class itself needs a lot of improvement though. It seems like the professor didn't have a good grasp on what college students would know and what they wouldn't. As a result, we spent way too much time on useless topics like what a hypothesis is, what a scientific experiment is, and what the difference between a metaphor and an idiom is. The exam was also way too easy (an average above 100% is kind of ridiculous) and the professor too easily manipulated by the students. ",

Truthfully if there were scheduled weekly quizzes, I feel that more students would focus more on the readings. ",

            "\u00a0It's a great class if you like working with people.\r\nIt is not if you don't.\r\n\r\nIn fairness, Professor Vasquez was incredibly efficient in all aspects of her work - presentations and lectures were immaculate and emails were answered within minutes. However, the class as a whole felt very high school with deadlines every other day and little room for self organisation. ",

I had a great time working on a project from start to finish.\r\nHowever, I think the project timeline could have been scoped better; we had the same number of days for assignments even though some required much more time and effort and others were a simple writeup. Also, I'm not sure if design is conducted like this out in practice. ",

Also because there was no final exam, many people stopped coming to class halfway through the year, which was kind of disheartening. Also wish that there had been more practical aspects to the course and less theoretical components. That being said however, there were a lot of interesting descriptions of practical applications in the lectures, and the project was an extremely rewarding process to go through (regardless of the state of your final product) "

            "\u00a0It's a good gut and you do get to work on a project and learn some useful ideas. Otherwise, it's not a challenging class at all and learning is limited. It was often frustrating to sit through lectures, sometimes mind-numbing. Don't expect to learn much and getting a good project group is almost entirely necessary to enjoy this class at all. If you're at all interested in the least CS related aspects of CS though, this is your class. ",

It is also one of the few classes in which you get to work on a project and test it with real users. ",

It also lets you apply these skills to a project. The projects this year were excellent and could definitely become real products. ",

            "\u00a0The prerequisite for this class is passing first grade. This class is a joke. I used an Elmer's glue stick for the first time since lower school. You have many small assignments of busy-work that are constantly being due, like it's lower school. The assignments are supposed to teach you useful skills for the \"design process\" but they're really just dumb wastes of time. Then you get some comments on your assignment, like \"this font should be clearer,\" or \"a back button here would be useful,\" and the next assignment is just to fix those things. \r\n\r\nThe class itself is an even bigger waste of time. We literally spent a class learning how to make a poster. Then the assignment was to make the poster. The next assignment was to edit the poster based on her comments. The class after that was to present the poster. \r\n\r\nThe median or mean on the midterm was a 108%. What you're tested on is things like \"what is user-centered design?\" with the answer being essentially \"design that is focused on the user and the user's needs.\" There's no final. There are a bunch of pop-quizzes with vague questions scattered throughout the semester - because there's no other way anybody would ever go to class unless you forced them there with the threat of a pop-quiz...much like middle school.
