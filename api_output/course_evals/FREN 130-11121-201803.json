            "\u00a0Weaknesses are the exams because it tested more memorization skills rather than French itself. Vocab especially was only memorization and was almost impossible on many exams. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Really teaches you a lot and shows you some very relevant aspects of French culture, from books and movies to songs and food. I definitely feel like my French improved a lot and I really enjoyed the content.\r\nWeaknesses: Instead of a big test every 2 weeks, I would prefer smaller tests more frequently, or some better method to average them out. The tests were usually pretty tricky and there were a lot of questions that seemed specifically designed to trick us. In contrast to L1 and L2, it also seemed like we were doing a lot of the learning ourselves and simply reviewing or strengthening the concepts in class. There was a considerable amount of daily homework. ",
