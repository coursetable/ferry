This course definitely made me force a ton of content into my head all at once, and a lot of it is going to fall right out, but I do think I will be left with those problem-solving skills, plus a greater appreciation for bacteria as a whole! ",

            "\u00a0I learned about a lot of different subjects in the field of microbiology and immunology. Even though a good portion of the course was pure memorization, I also developed critical thinking and problem solving skills when we were asked to come up with our own experiment or tests. ",

            "\u00a0I learned about how people use bacteria to study phenomena that apply to humans (either research using bacteria as a model organism, or as a disease pathogen of interest). I thought the most useful topics we covered were genetic screens (forward genetics), and screening for virulence/pathogenicity (molecular Koch's postulates). ",

Many of the lab concepts were covered in earlier classes, but it was very helpful to see them applied to an interesting subject matter, and that helped reinforce these principles.

They cover things from gel/Western blot/SDS page to Sanger sequencing/next-gen/pac-bio sequencing, etc. I have learned to not think definitively about results and think about the ways in which the data can be interpreted and what needs to be explored to determine whether each of the hypotheses hold or fail.

            "\u00a0The course is taught at a 10th grade level, and even that is a charitable evaluation. If you're looking for an easy MCDB credit, go for it. If you're looking to learn something, hard pass. ",
            "\u00a0A surprisingly deep and wide set of topics. I did not expect to learn so much, yet this class allowed me to do so with great ease. Some latter parts of the lecture grew very technical (sequencing, proteomic studies, etc.), which were welcomed especially as I use those technologies very often in research myself, but a quick warning for the less prepared peers in the class might have been good. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are fantastic. Both Prof J-W and Prof Hatzios are exceptional lecturers and have great pacing and level of explaining things. Theyre also really nice.\r\nThe tests were really hard and felt much more difficult and less representative of what weve learned than other classes Ive taken. It was tough to not do as well on tests compared to how much I studied and enjoyed the class. ",
            "\u00a0Only real weakness is that they give no information about the grade breakdown. Otherwise everything is great ",
            "\u00a0Lectures taught basic concepts and then illustrated these concepts with relevant, often interesting, examples. Exams, however, were often very detail-oriented, testing more memorization than understanding. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the professors. They teach the material pretty well. However, there is a lot of information and it is difficult to study for the cumulative final. One thing that would make this course more manageable is splitting up the exams into  three/four non-cumulative exams throughout the semester instead of two midterms and a final. ",
            "\u00a0this course was extremely difficult, I think it could be improved by offering a section to go over material rather than optional review material. I also think that it would be more helpful to have smaller assignments instead of 3 large exams, since this material is dense. ",
            "\u00a0Weakness: It is difficult to stay on track in this class because there are no sections and or biweekly assessments. I believe the latter would help students better master microbiology.\r\n\r\nFurthermore the bathroom rule during exams isn't too great. If you need to use the bathroom you are automatically disadvantaged because you will not be able to check over first half of the exam. Furthermore, you will not get to plan out your question order to maximize your pacing.\r\nI would suggest that the professors ask you to hand them your phone instead. ",
            "\u00a0This course's lectures were, for the most past, very good. Even if they were often dense and fast-paced, I think there was a lot of value in them, and both professors lectured really well and engaged effectively even in a roughly 75-person class. One lecture that stands out to me is the bacterial motility/flagella lecture--SO awesome and taught so well. Another strength was the extra help outside of class: all four TFs had their own office hours, and I was able to receive one-on-one support multiple times when I needed it, and in addition, they held review sessions roughly every four lectures just to keep people updated with the material. One weakness is the way the course was structured/how we were evaluated: with our entire grade coming from two midterms and a final, it was very easy to fall behind, and the breadth of material required for each exam was staggering. Even if those three major assessments remained, if there were smaller, more manageable checkpoints like quizzes or homework (even ungraded homework) that forced us to engage with the material along the way, I think the class would've been less daunting. Also, a small annoyance I had was that the professors didn't allow bathroom breaks during exams unless you took half the exam, turned it in, and went to the bathroom before starting the second half, which seemed overly strict and potentially insensitive (or just stressful for nervous pee-ers like me). ",
            "\u00a0The TFs answer emails about course material but many get annoyed that you didn't wait until the next review session or go to the previous one (and are unsympathetic when you have prior commitments). The graded tests also didn't have super helpful feedback on them, which I wasn't able to ask more about since all of the office hours were when I had class. The course material is more interesting than most MCDB electives, in my opinion. ",
            "\u00a0The course is quite good, but a discussion section would probably be useful for clarifying many of the concepts which are not discussed with sufficient depth/ may be discussed to quickly during lecture. ",
            "\u00a0I wish the course had other measures for a grade in the class besides midterms. I personally prefer timely checkpoints throughout the semester, such as quizzes, insteas of having our enter grade being based off of three tests. ",
            "\u00a0The discussion sections could benefit from a bit more structure. ",
            "\u00a0I think that this class's strength is also one of its weaknesses. We focused on a lot in this class. Good because we go into a lot about microbiology but bad because it was just to much to process and remember. The class many times felt like info was being thrown at us and very few times did I feel like I was learning. This is true especially towards the end of the semester when the material got harder. Like studying for the final gave me a headache because there was just to much. Also there is very little engagement with the class material. Because it's only exams, the material becomes something I have to just study not something I need to learn. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this class could actually be classified as a lower level class (for example, make it MCDB 207), rather than a class above MCDB 250. I felt that the majority of the material we learned was something we had already covered in a lower level class (truly, there was a slide at one point that explained what the central dogma of biology is, which we learned definitely in high school, if not in BIOL 101). The only new material that I thought I learned in this class and not in previous classes was information about traits specific to bacteria (for example: peptidoglycan synthesis, the process of conjugation), Tn mutagenesis and genetic screens. I don't think this made the class weak, only that it should not have such a high classification. In this way, students who have already gone through MCDB 200, 202, 205 would not take the class at the beginning of the semester and expect it to be very detailed and difficult, but instead sit through much of the same material repeated from previous classes. ",
            "\u00a0I felt like I really learned a lot in this course, and I felt like the lectures were interesting and engaging. However, I wish there were intermittent assignments or quizzes rather than 2 midterms and the final, because I felt like it was a bit hard to get full feedback on how I was doing. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The staff is very good. This semester it was an all-female taught and TA'ed class, which was very refreshing in STEM. Hatzios and Jacobs-Wagner are both engaging lecturers, good at teaching their material, and obviously are really interested in the material they're teaching--the enthusiasm was welcome and sometimes infectious. They both also did amazing jobs of soliciting questions and answers from lecture and were extremely encouraging in a way that made you pretty comfortable to speak up. There is also no section, which depending on your preference can be either a strength or weakness (does free up some time though)\r\nWeaknesses: The entire grade is based on two midterms and a final, and the lack of sections and homeworks meant that you had to make the effort to retain things as you go, or risk having to memorize all the slides the night before an exam. The material isn't terribly intellectually challenging (I found it super interesting and was never lost in class) but the exams are extremely rigorous and you need to know the material back to front. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths is the applicability of the lecture material to current trends in microbiology. It could be improved by having more interactive work. ",
            "\u00a0This course was great. ",
            "\u00a0The course is well structure and easy to follow. Some material feels arbitrary, however. ",
            "\u00a0The course covered very interesting topics, and the instruction on different lab techniques such as DNA sequencing and how to design genetic screens was very useful. The course was taught very well and there was a good mix of information and concepts. The timing of the two made it easy to see the connection between material.\r\n\r\nOn some portions of tests, it felt like the level of detail was too specific. That being said, I could have prepared more thoroughly and this is not the fault of the instructors. ",
            "\u00a0Strong female teachers and TA. Wow first STEM class ever that had two female professors. Also content is engaging and teachers are really easy to understand, good at explaining, and happy to give extra help. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is the general approach to science. At the beginning, the main focus is on applying the basics to design genetic screen experiments to determine what genes are responsible for a given phenotype, etc. This allowed me to think critically in a science class rather than go about memorizing details. However, later, the focus seemed to go back to some detail memorization. The course is taught by phenomenal instructors (Professor Jacobs-Wagner and Professor Hatzios) who are engaging during lecture - you can tell they are so interested in the subject. This was one of my favorite courses at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Smaller assignments like quizzes. While I liked the course I wish I had a better idea of my performance throughout the course. ",
            "\u00a0Style of teaching was such a difference that the first to second exam comes like whiplash. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were very well organized and the professors were wonderful, but there should be more help available outside of lecture. Weekly mandatory discussion sessions could have helped or even a Piazza site. ",
            "\u00a0Again great depth and breadth. We covered a lot of topics that are relevant to the field that would allow students to find niches that they would want to study more later. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Comprehensive, teaches material well\r\nWeaknesses: None, I just have to put in more work in studying. ",
            "\u00a0This course does a good job covering various topics in the field.  However, I wish we were able to go more in-depth. "

        [
            "\u00a0I wouldn't. Prof. Jacobs-Wagner is a lovely person who is unfortunately stuck teaching at a level far below what she'd like, and Prof. Hatzios lectures like she's speaking to a room of kindergarteners (I ran out of fingers to count how many times she responded to incorrect answers from students with some enthusiastic variant of \"terrific!\" within the first 5 minutes of each class). Do yourself a favor and take a class that will treat you like a Yale undergrad and not someone who's just learning that biology exists. ",
            "\u00a0A very manageable class that teaches some really fascinating (no kidding/gushing here) concepts in microbiology. Clearly an underappreciated field, and one in which Yale has some incredible scientists. Great class choice for both medical- and science-oriented students alike. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This was a terrific course and one of the best classes Ive ever taken at Yale. The combination of fantastic and caring professors with interesting course material was a win-win. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, amazing and interesting info taught by professors that are good at what they do. ",
            "\u00a0This course is definitely hard and intimidating, and there is no way to know what your grade is at any point during the semester because of the way it is curved, but I think it is really valuable. I learned how to think through problems and make connections in a much more critical way than I had before, even in other upper level MCDB classes. Granted, I would recommend taking this course with the intention of reviewing your notes after every single lecture because if you don't, the material piles up really quickly. Also, take the midterms stategically--they are longer than you think if you take too much time on any given question, and a lot of the points are concentrated at the end. ",
            "\u00a0It's relatively interesting material. It's pretty much just another MCDB class. No surprises. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to another student. The material is interesting and you get a good glimpse of many different topics within microbiology. I found the lectures on antibiotics and immunology in the latter half of the class to be the most interesting. ",
            "\u00a0YES. It's a really great class, I enjoyed the material, and the atmosphere was very nice. The only downside is the intensity of the exams and lack of consistent assignments for accountability, but overall I would highly recommend you take this. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend if you're doing micro related research/want to/will in the future! This course is very easy if you've done anything with bacteria, even as simple as cloning. If you think you will be doing any research like that in the future, this class is very relevant and applicable to what people are researching right now. ",

However, only two midterms and a final make up the whole grade, so you have to really put in work for the time leading up to those three exams - and make good use of the TAs, they are very very helpful and available.

Im a pre-veterinary student, so this was a required course, but I would have liked to take even if it wasnt required because it gives a great background into the microbes around us influencing the environment and our health.

Studying wasn't a chore because I found the material incredibly interesting. Keep in mind that this course ISN'T easy! It does put in context SO much biology that you may have learned in other situations, and the focus on devising and critiquing experiments in this course helped my intellectual development for sure.
