            "\u00a0You learn a considerable amount in this class. Using a book written by the professor, each chapter compares something from the US Constitution with similar laws in other nations. Bill of Rights, property laws, freedom of speech, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Critical reading, comparative analysis. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to analyze the same concept through different lenses based on what countries we were studying. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a basic comparative constitutional apparatus. This was a really eye-opening way of thinking about the US Constitution--my worldview, I was surprised to learn (somehow), was remarkably American-centric--and about constitutions in general. I can't imagine thinking about governance without this framing. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a much better understanding of the historical evolution of democratic constitutions, in studying the origin of the US Constitution and then those of other democracies.  The course was very comparative, going through different constitutional features and how they worked in different constitutions, both in text and in court cases and practice. ",
            "\u00a0This class opened my eyes to the extraordinary diversity of legal and political systems around the world, as viewed through the lenses of national constitutions. Thanks to the courses focus on the historical and cultural underpinnings of different constitutions, I gained what seems like a fairly comprehensive and deep understanding of the political and legal scenes in several important countries including the United States. "

            "\u00a0This course offered a very broad range of constitutional law topics and how each institution compares to its US counterpart. Class discussion was always engaging, although I wish I was given more of an opportunity to talk (as Professor Calabresi usually called on the same people). The only other weakness to the class was the papers and just the lack of explanation of what is expected. ",
            "\u00a0The weekly reading load is about 125 pages - if you need to shorten it, you can google the cases mentioned in the book instead of reading the long form versions. The class discussions are interesting. Professor Calabresi will cold call you, so be prepared. The good news is that before asking a question, he'll set it up with lots of background info, so even if you didn't read the chapter, you should still be able to answer the questions. The two short papers aren't too difficult - but reading the chapters will make them even easier. The final is 18-20 pages and you get to choose the topic. ",
            "\u00a0The course is a great pre-law preparatory class which is a strength for those who might be interested in pursuing law. \r\nStrengths are that it is a seminar.\r\nWeaknesses is that there is no variation in class/lecture style. ",
            "\u00a0If you are not thrilled about comparative constitutional law, this class will probably bore you to tears. If you are thrilled about comparative constitutional law, this class has as much breadth and depth as you could need, with really open-ended opportunities to take deep dives into whatever part of the material you found most engaging. ",
            "\u00a0The structure of the course in moving through readings/material was great and very useful and interesting.  The actual class was often somewhat boring or rambly.  Prof Calebresi called on his favorite students generally, and a more structured seminar discussion would have been helpful especially with the quantity of reading to process.  It was often hard to stay engaged with the low energy early on Monday morning.  Additionally, it would have been nice to receive the prompts for the midterm papers earlier than one week before.  The one week timeline seemed unnecessary, and gave less flexibility for managing writing his hefty midterm papers at the same time as other exams/papers/midterms. ",
            "\u00a0Partially because it exactly followed a casebook written by Professor Calabresi, the course was efficiently structured and comprehensive. I feel that I learned a great deal about an important topic. However, the class could get a little tedious and predictable, considering that class time essentially consisted of Professor Calabresi restating and expanding on the information in the book. I enjoyed using the final project as a chance to explore an area of interest, and it would be nice if we had more opportunities throughout the course, perhaps in the form of discussions on current or historical events and their relation to constitutional law.

            "\u00a0This class was an interesting look at constitutional law and how the US compares to the other G20 democracies in regards to the US Constitution and setup of the government. Although the readings for each week are quite long, Professor Calabresi discusses most of it in class and it is relatively easy to get a grasp of each of the cases by looking them up instead of having to read the whole opinion. Discussion in class was usually very interesting and engaging! ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this course if you are interested in international law. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you're interested in learning more about the constitutional workings of other countries. The two short papers aren't too difficult - but reading the chapters will make them even easier. The final is 18-20 pages and you get to choose the topic. ",
            "\u00a0The course is a great pre-law class which is great for those who might be interested in pursuing law. \r\n\r\nThe material is suuuuper interesting and Prof. Calabresi is clearly very knowledgeable and passionate about the topic.\r\n\r\nClass can be a bit boring and slow, especially as a 9am seminar. Be prepared to do the readings and participate in class, it's the main way to really get a lot out of the class. ",
            "\u00a0For anyone considering law school or a career in law, I would definitely recommend. Taking any class with Professor Calabresi is extremely humbling, and Comparative Constitutionalism is fun and important to learn. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only if you are sure it's for you. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! One of the best courses I have taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0If you're very interested in Constitutional Law you should take this course, but be prepared for a ton of reading and writing and really make sure you have time for it in your semester.  It's definitely an interesting and informative course, but not a gripping class like Amar's lecture. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures could get tedious, and the reading was 150 pages a week from the same casebook, but it was all well worth it for the amount of information I learned about an important and relevant topic. This is a useful class for anyone interested in international law or policy. Professor Calabresi, while not the most exciting lecturer, is kind, supportive, and smart. "
