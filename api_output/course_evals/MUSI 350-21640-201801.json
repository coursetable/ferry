            "\u00a0We learned not only how to analyze, but to read, write, and appreciate early music. ",
            "\u00a0A very broad look back on the history of (writtten) music from 900-1600. Most of the time was spent understanding old manuscripts, ",
            "\u00a0I was exposed to an incredible repertoire of Western music that, despite training in music performance for about twelve years, I had never even known it existed. I gained an appreciation for the unique challenges posed by musicology in general, especially to those who choose to study ancient music, and for the diversity of forms in which music can express itself. I now understand how arbitrary many of the conventions are that govern our current ideas of what art music consists in, and the organic and sometimes random evolution of that art music from its inception in early Christian church music all the way up to the late 16th/early 17th centuries in Europe. I was also exposed to a wide variety of ancient notations, and can even passably read some of them! This course expanded my knowledge of music history more than any I've ever taken before. ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge of some specific Medieval and Renaissance composers/pieces, but, more importantly, a general understanding of the complexity of how to approach early music and of the challenges music historians face in studying this music. ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge of a rich body of repertoire. The ability to read its notation, and to grasp the history of that changing notation; analytical frameworks for considering this music as both social and aesthetic object. Insight into the long and varied history of our music-makinga great boon to the imagination. ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge pertaining to the development of music and its notation and the context surrounding these areas in Europe ranging from the years 800-1600 C.E. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about the history of Western music from the earliest notated music until c. 1600.  I now have a whole new perspective on music in general from studying this incredibly rich history. ",
            "\u00a0The class offered a lot of insight into the Western Art Music tradition, in a way that I think typically does not come up in history courses. I felt that questions of historical and social context were conveyed clearly, as well as developments in musical technology and how that relates to aesthetics. The course also discussed historiography alongside history, which I found to be a valuable perspective. ",
            "\u00a0I developed knowledge of music from early monastic periods to the 16th century, improved my listening skills, and developed insights regarding the importance of addressing what we dont know in history as much as what we do know. ",
            "\u00a0I developed and understanding of the progression of music history from the years 900-1600. I am now able to listen analytically and recognize crucial traits in recordings that help me to understand when in history a piece was composed. I can also contextualize music with non-musical history. ",

            "\u00a0Amazing course. the lectures were very good and enjoyable. The ta's were amazing, and Prof. was very knowledgeable and passionate about the material. ",
            "\u00a0It's hard to put so much into such a small time frame, and I think the course was mostly well proportioned. However I do think it could use a little more thematic categorization, as opposed to chronological. Some of this was there, but I think going through and seeing how music writing changed over 700 years, and then singing styles, and then songwriting techniques, would've helped me get a stronger grasp on the time. Of course, that would be a drastic re-imagining of the course, but it might help.\r\n\r\nAlso the weekly listening/reading comprehension quizzes, while not worth much individually, would always be a rough start to my week. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the lectures were generally quite good, and rather enjoyable. Sections were also incredibly useful in clarifying some of the more difficult concepts, and our TAs were extremely competent and helpful. I believe the critical factor in this was the workload; it is entirely possible to do well and not read any of the textbook whatsoever (although I did read the primary sources, which were interesting). If I had read the textbook, it would have been an incredibly high and perhaps unsustainable workload with the weekly quizzes and projects, which really weren't too bad in retrospect. Professor Z is an enormous asset to the course and is knowledgeable, humorous, kind and helpful, and very much enjoyed the opportunity to work with her this semester. A single suggestion I would make is perhaps the creation of more cohesive review materials for the midterm and final, as there was a ton of content that doesn't easily fit into single historiographical categories or trends. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this course--lecture was engaging, and the course organization was as good as it could be considering the nature of studying things that there isn't a *ton* of historical documentation about. I appreciated weekly listening quizzes, because I felt very prepared for the listening sections on the midterm and final.\r\nThe only thing that I thought was unhelpful were some of the projects. The ratio of time spent to amount of content learned was low--I understand that students will remember struggling to transcribe a manuscript, for example, but that same level of understanding (and a similar level of struggle) could be achieved with having them transcribe a shorter section of the manuscript. Having said that, I did enjoy the projects, at times. It just got frustrating (which I acknowledge was part of the point, but aiming to frustrate someone as a means to make them remember decreases engagement with the rest of the class: I know it did for me). ",
            "\u00a0The class was very well-run. The engagement of the professors and TAs, with both the material and with the students, was as high as it's been in any course I've ever taken. (I merely wish there were more time, to cover more material.) ",
            "\u00a0The course is quite engaging and provides a way to help differentiate music that would initially seem quite similar to those unfamiliar with the music from this time period. The course may prove quite challenging to those with limited background in music, or even musicians with little singing experience. ",
            "\u00a0The weekly quizzes were excellent because they helped people solidify the material as they learned it.  Also, the listening assignments were well balanced and fascinating.  There were no significant weaknesses to this course. ",
            "\u00a0It's a good course with a well structured syllabus - I like the weekly quizzes because it makes you have to do the listening. The projects felt a little high school-esq. I wish it were a little more historically grounded - perhaps that would have come if I did the reading. ",
            "\u00a0-sometimes a bit too much busywork ",
            "\u00a0I found it helpful that we often dealt with primary source material in the class, both to study it as historians and to engage with it as musicians. This helped familiarize me with the material and also, I think, made it easier to use my own musical training to understand historical artifacts, rather than rely on the analyses of an editor or other historian.\r\n\r\nI liked the weekly listening quizzes; I found them way less stressful than grouping tons of listening into a midterm, and felt that they made it hard to fall behind in understanding the key points of the class. They also demanded more reflection on what was important in a given week of the class, which I think helped solidify a big-picture understanding of the material.\r\n\r\nIn general, I liked that dates were not emphasized in this course (even when known), since it made it easier for me to imagine that narratives present in music history - that is, understanding what happened and what caused what. However, an occasional timeline might have been beneficial, since by the time I got to the end of the course, I had no idea which century anything happened in - this would be especially useful since the course often jumped around substantially in time. (I thought that the particular narrative of motets spanning from Ockeghem to Palestrina was made very clear through the timeline)\r\n\r\nSome of the assignments were rather vaguely defined; to a large part, I think that this was fine, given that they all included something to the effect of \"Now write an essay about this thing you did\", which I felt shifted emphasis away from whether the principal wok was what the professor had in mind. However, it might have helped to have somehow more clearly delineated the purpose of assignments.\r\n\r\nI thought there were too many handouts - I felt handouts were productive for short musical examples or for anything we sang, but felt that informational handouts (or worse - handouts with blank spaces) tended to only have the effect of spreading my notes out across multiple sheets and disrupt their continuity.\r\n\r\nI didn't feel that the assigned textbook readings added much to the class. The most valuable parts of the reading were the musical analysis of excerpts from our listening list, but these were fairly sparsely sprinkled in the Taruskin. I thought that looking at editions and translations of the listening material was very useful. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I really enjoyed the course material and just wish I could have spent more time engaging with it. Lectures were definitely a strength of the course, and I would consider the textbook a weakness, only because I often felt like the important information was present in lectures, and much of the information in the textbook was interesting but les pertinent. ",
            "\u00a0This course got through a lot of info in very little time. However, it also glossed over certain crucial parts of history without even a mention, primarily to fit the narrative that the course was presenting. I would appreciate at least a mention of some of the things we missed (which we had a little bit of in section). ",

            "\u00a0YES. its amazing - I don't understand why some people leave bad reviews, because it has been my favorite music history class at yale. Prof. Z is a great teacher in my opinion and the TA'S were so helpful. I looked forward to section every week, and even the harder parts of the class were still enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0Recommended to music majors as a way to understand how music came to be in the western world. It's really interesting, although if you have absolutely no interest in the topics it may be a bit dull. Still, it's not hard to find fascinating aspects of each lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!!! Dr. Z is such an incredible professor. She's so smart and the class is phenomenal. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! Although it can be a lot of work, the lecture material is fascinating and Professor Z does her utmost to incorporate active learning (projects, singing etc.) that really helps it all come alive. Our TFs (Brianne Dolce especially, and Pippa Ovenden) were incredibly helpful and the sections were actually enjoyable, which has never happened to me before. There are weekly quizzes, which can be annoying but definitely ensure that you stay on top of the material - you'll be thankful for them by the time you get to the midterm and final, as if we didn't have them I'd probably have procrastinated all the listening up to the day of the exams. The projects were interesting, though not always the most relevant (the focus seemed to be on introducing students to fieldwork in musicology rather than the course content). The textbook is quite dense and entirely unnecessary - the material in class, sections and primary sources is more than enough. Definitely take this class! Truly a rewarding experience. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. Lecture was interesting, even if you came in not hugely interested in the topic. The music is beautiful and, at times, truly exciting. I think I'm walking out a better and more thoughtful musician. ",
            "\u00a0Even if you think you know your music history quite well, this class offers constant surprises. Prof. Z is hugely committed to conveying the life and vitality which inheres in this music, and its special relevance for musicians today (sitting, as we do, at the juncture of a complicated rift in notational practice seemingly unprecedented to many, but recognizable to those who study early music). The class richly repays the time you put in; the reading is good, the listening features gorgeous music, and the professor and TAs are entertaining, sharp, and ever-ready for conversation. ",
            "\u00a0For someone fulfilling the music history requirement of the music major, I feel that MUSI 351-352 would probably be more relevant, although this class was assuredly quite interesting and helped provide context for how many conventions that are now taken for granted in music came to be. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would highly recommend this course because the material is simply fascinating and some of the music is truly incredible.  It changes one's perspective on all of music. ",
            "\u00a0It's a pretty small, self selecting crowd that would be interested in this topic. ",
            "\u00a0I could not oversell this course: the material was made accessible and fun, and the professor and TAs all listened to feedback and were extremely flexible and kind throughout the course of the year. There were amazing opportunities afforded by the course, such as a day in the Beinecke looking at old, original manuscripts which we'd been studying, and projects that allowed everyone in the class to showcase their musical strengths, from performance to composition to editing and everything in between. While I went into the year extremely worried and pessimistic due to reviews that I had seen from past years, apparently Professor Z took these reviews to heart. She was a passionate and engaging lecturer and her exposition of the material was insightful. There's a lot of church music, because that's kind of the meat of Western music up to a certain point, but both Professor Z and my TA took time to delve into that and explore the implications of studying the material through different lenses.\r\n\r\nI know that you might be afraid to take a course about old, often religious music, but the material was awesome, the teaching was awesome, the projects were awesome, and the weekly quizzes were very manageable, provided you spend an hour before the test studying. One of the best classes I've taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I have. Music history classes provide another way of interacting with the past that I think is really beneficial. ",
            "\u00a0YES. It covers an area of music that we rarely think about and is a great survey course if you want to be pushed slightly out of your comfort zone. ",
            "\u00a0For sure, it's a little sad that just as the music major changes to allow people to skip this course, Professor Zayaruznaya has come in and made it fantastic. I was a bit worried coming in because of the whole \"eat your vegetables\" reputation in the music major, but it was engaging even though the material for most people is foreign. ",
            "\u00a0I assume that if you're taking this class, it's probably a requirement. However, this class is definitely the least painful required course of my entire Yale career. The professor and TAs make a real effort to make the music accessible and our most of our projects were interesting in how they engaged with the material. If you're into medieval music you'll love it, but if not, you aren't going to be bored the entire semester either. Which is more than I can say for other required courses. "
