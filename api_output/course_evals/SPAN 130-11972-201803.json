            "\u00a0Spanish L3 was a great course for improving speaking, writing, and reading abilities in Spanish.  There is an understanding that you know most of the basics but they are reviewed briefly. The speed of the course picks up fairly quickly towards the end of the semester as more readings are assigned as well as may different tenses. The class does not have many standard exercises for learning the various conjugations as most of the material focuses on differentiating when to use the tenses which is nice as it reduces the amount of busy work but demands that effort be put into the class on your own time.

            "\u00a0In this course I was able to focus on my speaking and fluidity in the Spanish language due to the course's focus on transforming an elementary understanding of grammar into a more advanced understanding of usage and speech. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: this course is very well organized--the Spanish department does an excellent job at setting everything up in the syllabus with assignments and expectations. Even though you meet every day, the workload is manageable. We read several short stories and a novel, as well as watch some videos and movies in class. I found the class very engaging.\r\nWeakness: not very many weaknesses. I would say that reading the entire novel in one week was a bit much for me. ",
            "\u00a0I overall think this course is pretty solid. It gets us to learn the Spanish grammar well, we develop different kinds of skills, and offers good opportunities to learn about different Hispanic countries. One thing that I didn't love, though, is that we had been reading this 1-2 page short stories, and then suddenly at the end of the course we had to read dozens of pages in Spanish per night from a novel. I think perhaps the pace that we read the novel should be slowed down a little bit. ",
            "\u00a0I understand students have this class everyday, but I think having sometimes 2-3 hours per night is too much. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: It is every day, and the readings are not helpful. There is too much of a focus on grammar.\r\n\r\nStrengths: It isn't too hard ",
            "\u00a0Better cultural information ",
            "\u00a0The everday structure, while taxing and sometimes stressful when other classes' workload increases, is very helpful in ensuring you do not forget the material right after it is learned. The coursebook is nice as it has everything needed for readings consolidated into one place, however the organization of the grammar and exercises is terrible. There is also not a clear table of contents which makes it difficult and frustrating to go back and look for sections when studying. ",
            "\u00a0I think a weakness of this course was the lack of speaking practice. I thought a strength of this course was the way in which grammar was taught. ",
            "\u00a0There is an equal focus on all skills of the language, which helps to develop all of them at a similar pace (i.e. I felt like my reading skills and writing skills were around the same level). I wish they would make L4 a three day/week class, because I would take it if it wasn't every day. ",
            "\u00a0This class is interesting enough for someone who already has a very high interest in Spanish and has the internal motivation to learn. However, for those without the same level of interest, it can be difficult to form a connection to the material. The course lacks a well-rounded cultural curriculum and focuses heavily on arbitrarily chosen topics. "
