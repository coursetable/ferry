Most of the world and the country agree that this decision by the Administration is of great peril and folly. The skills I honed and developed were primarily in data analysis and writing, and I gained insights pertaining to the above subject matter. "

            "\u00a0The strength is in the Professor Josh Galperin, as well as Dave Hawkins and the other instructors, and the format of the class. The clinic class leads to a format whereby students get to craft their own experience largely through working with a group and client. This is both a cause of strength and weakness at times. I would've liked to have spent more time in class learning from the many guest speakers, but that was not a requirement for the Advanced version of the class, and for that I am a bit less enriched than I would've liked to have been.
