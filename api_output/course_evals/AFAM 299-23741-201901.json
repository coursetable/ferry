            "\u00a0Professor Meyer takes you through a survey of the major developments in the Black Freedom Struggle in the postbellum period. Great at developing analytical skills to apply to current issues of white supremacy. ",
            "\u00a0I can now understand and contextualize different periods of Black freedom struggles and the concepts that informed them. I have a better understanding of Black womens history and often ignored role in catalyzing and driving social change through organizing against interlocking systems of oppression. ",
            "\u00a0better understanding of the black freedom struggle, from reconstruction to the present. deconstruct myths of the civil rights movement, understand civil rights as a longer movement. examine the role of black women and feminists "

        [
            "\u00a0As long as you do the readings discussion is super engaging with fascinating ideas to talk through (Professor Meyer knows so much about the topics covered). This class is not a gut, especially the final, which required a decent amount of time of preparation, but if you're willing to put in the work the information the readings and discussion equip you with is fantastic. ",
            "\u00a0Narrowing down the reading to leave out a few chapters of each book would help to focus discussion and increase absorption of the material that is read. Besides the heavy reading load, the midterm paper and weekly DQs were great preparation for the final and overall helped me consolidate info. Discussion depends on the interests and passions of peers, which is good. ",

            "\u00a0Definitely! If you want to develop a more thorough knowledge of the history of black intellectual developments and social justice movements of the past 150 years, this class is a must! ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this class! It gave me so much perspective on thinking about Black American history and writing that's hard to get in a class that isn't a survey course, and the class was set up so that the readings were the focus, with historical grounding from lectures and presentations to back them up. ",
            "\u00a0YES! professor meyer is incredible and this class was so informative and interesting "
