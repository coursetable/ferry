The course is broadly focused on metaphysics and epistemology, not on logic or ethics; some mentions of Kantian and Humean ethics were mentioned, but only in passing. The course is first and foremost and introductory class in philosophy. That means that almost all of the work you will be doing in the course will be either evaluative or comparative (the two essays, of the form \"Explain what X says about Y in book Z, and evaluate their argument\", or \"Compare the thoughts of A and B on topic C\"), while the final examination is merely descriptive (\"What does G have to say about H\"). Section is spent mostly reviewing the ideas covered in lecture to ensure the students have a good understanding of the material. You will be expected to \"read\" a passage or two a week; I put \"read\" in quotation marks not because I think you ought to not do the readings (you really should) but because it is not necessary to do well in the course if you don't, provided you have a good understanding of what the readings actually say. Again, I strongly encourage you to actually do the readings (it's really not that much, you can find the time). ",

            "\u00a0The main weakness of this course is that there is 0 clarity on how things are graded. In addition, it seemed that all the instructors purposely wanted to give you bad grades at first in order to make you work harder in the course. 60% of this class was based on 2 essays; I did not write a much better 2nd essay, yet the 2nd grade was 2 grades higher than the first. The TA's in particular were elusive as to how the essays would be evaluated. Furthermore, my TA did not offer me very thorough comments on my essays; most of them were \"good\" or \"could be improved\". There was no rubric on how they would be evaluated.\r\nThe strength of this course is MDR. MDR is *sometimes* a good lecturer but 100% brilliant in office hours. If you don't understand something clearly, just go to OH. It's clear that he is very enthusiastic about this course, yet the TA's make it a rather unenjoyable experience. ",

I think it's both pro and con, but due to the nature of intro philosophy, I think it's the best way to teach it. ",
            "\u00a0I wish more time had been spent on big philosophers such as Kant and Leibniz.\r\nStill a great survey course though. ",
            "\u00a0MDR is an incredible lecturer. Seriously.\r\nThe most is gotten out of lecture if you do the readings (at least at a cursory level) before lecture, cause he will be clarifying much of the really crucial information. He does a great job of making the material accessible.\r\nAlso the final exam was a strength. Some may prefer final papers, but to be honest the exam format really did force me to understand the key takeaways from each philosopher better than I would have otherwise, which to me is a big plus. ",
            "\u00a0The instructor did an excellent job clarifying the material in lecture. Perhaps he could have done a better job connecting the philosophers to overarching themes. ",
            "\u00a0The wide range of philosophers covered was certainly a strength but it might have been more engaging to delve into their deeper philosophies, which we started to do at the end with Kant and Hume. ",
            "\u00a0I think there could be a lot more help on how to write philosophy essays. It is an introductory course, after all, but I found that most students were philosophy majors or knew what they were doing, whereas I had no proper experience. I think the expectations of this course should be clarified- it is not easy, and you should have experience or knowledge going in. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are mainly that the material is fairly interesting. The weaknesses are that a lot of it can be overly dense and impossible to understand. The class is really good if you're willing to commit to the material and try to understand it, but sometimes the readings are very long and to do them with full engagement would take forever. But, sometimes they're OK, and then the class is very interesting. ",

            "\u00a0Lectures were fantastic, and through the handouts that my TA would make and give us during section I really feel like I had access to all of the information I needed to understand what I needed to. I would've enjoyed even more discussion, but idk how that would be possible without just having longer sections. It was also really awesome how email correspondence was encouraged - really made me feel like I was being welcomed into the web of philosophical discussion. ",
            "\u00a0I wish we spent more time on Hume and Kant, felt like we rushed through the end of the syllabus ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: MDR!! Joanna!!\r\nWeaknesses: a little too much Descartes ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Michael Della Rocca is a great person to teach this course. He has a very good command of the material at hand and he is very good at making the lectures interesting (no small feat when covering Spinoza for first year students). The material itself is interesting enough. The workload was exceedingly manageable (only two essays plus the final), bordering on \"Too Easy,\" but I doubt many will find fault in that. The readings were a good selection of many different philosophers, and the broad themes covered in the course were essential.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I feel that this class, in attempting to be accessible to first-year students or non-majors, perhaps spends too much time focusing on \"What did philosopher X say about Y?\" and too little time focusing on \"Is Y a good theory? What can we say about it?\" There was very little \"philosophizing\" done in this course, which was kind of disappointing. For a concrete example, I wish we had spent more time discussing whether Cartesian Dualism was a good theory of the mind rather than just trying to learn what Descartes said about the mind-body problem. Due to the nature of the course, section was far more exegetic than I would have liked. Additionally, I feel that some ideas were covered far too briefly, while some ideas were given too much consideration. It's impossible to cover Kantian metaphysics in a single week, and we only actually read the Introduction to Critique of Pure Reason rather than any of the actual material. Admittedly, this is a really hard text, but I would have preferred to see us spend a bit more time covering the main ideas and debating them. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were very engaging and the course moved in a linear manner. ",
            "\u00a0Too few assignments so I was not accountable to anything and could not improve my grade ",
            "\u00a0I thought the class was well taught. ",
            "\u00a0This was course was an incredible intro course because it was challenging and engaging but not overwhelming. It did a great job of introducing us to several key modern philosophers and gave us a great taste of the philosophy major at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0A great introduction into philosophical arguments/logic; could have spent more time on fewer philosophers so that we could've gone more in depth on interesting topics, could've spent a lot less time on Descartes, a lot more time on Hume/Kant ",
            "\u00a0Strength: \r\nnice combination between lectures and sections \r\nLectures laying out important topics\r\nSections focusing on certain questions raised by students\r\nWeakness:\r\nSometime section goes astrayed. ",
            "\u00a0This is an excellent course. Professor Della Rocca knows what he's doing and has the material down to a science. The readings were technical and challenging. Yet somehow, Della Rocca made it all feel accessible. \r\nI think that the course suffered from probably one too many lectures on Spinoza. This is likely because Della Rocca is an expert on Spinoza. However, the focus on the Ethics felt dragged out and unnecessary given the scope and focus of the syllabus. I would have preferred one fewer lectures on Spinoza in exchange for an extra lecture on Hume or Kant, both of whom felt rushed. \r\nI also think that some of the philosophers, especially the women philosophers, were unnecessarily skimmed over in class. I would have preferred either investing more time on a smaller handful of influential philosophers (instead of moving quickly through thinkers like Du Chatelet and Conway) OR allowing some of the less covered philosophers more airtime in class. The project of making the syllabus more inclusive came at the expense of going in-depth on the material. ",
            "\u00a0Great teaching and great TAs. Could structure the readings more around themes, as we seemed to jump between philosophical ideas a lot. Also, would love to see a greater emphasis placed on non-European philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this course. It was very engaging and such an organized lecture. It was very conducive to learning and following along. Would not change how it is taught. I think philosophy can easily become confusing, but MDR gave concrete examples and was very clear in his reasoning, often repeating the main point of particular topics several times. ",
            "\u00a0It is a good class. The texts can be hand to understand, but with the help of a great professor it is possible. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely! Even if you've never done philosophy before or are scared of philosophy, take this course if you're curious! The professor MDR was an excellent instructor--really explained the concepts extremely well and in understandable language. There are lots of opportunities to seek help if you have trouble understanding the text, and this is expected since the reading is difficult. This is such a rewarding class and it challenged me to think critically. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student but only if Prof MDR is teaching it because otherwise the subject can be pretty dry. ",

            "\u00a0I would probably not recommend this course. First, if you want a relatively easy way to get an A, don't take this course; there are many easier courses to take for a good grade. There are only 3 major assessments in this course (2 papers and 1 exam), and if you do badly on any single one of them, you will be unable to recover your grade. Second, this course is also badly structured for learning philosophical writing and thinking. The TA's did not offer very thorough feedback on the papers, and it was incredibly difficult to gauge how they were evaluated. Remember, this is a content on philosophical content, not on how to actually learn what philosophy is about. On the bright side of things, the workload is incredibly low. While there are assigned readings, you don't actually have to do most of them in order to do well in the course, as philosophy papers have to do far more with arguments and evaluation as opposed to textual citation. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Amazing course; MDR is a godsend, and you learn sooo much philosophy in this course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you would like to get a solid foundation on modern philosophy. Even with no background, the course is conducted in a way which makes it very conducive to learning about and unpacking philosophy. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, especially as a first course in philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0I took this course as an elective and for distributional requirements. It was a large challenge, but extremely valuable. Having said that, do NOT take this course if you are looking for an easier humanities credit. It is very difficult to succeed in and requires a ton of your time and energy. This course is designed for philosophy majors. ",
            "\u00a0It's a good class, and the papers can be quite fun. I would recommend it if you like reading old books or really like philosophy. Also, if you have no clue about the history of philosophy, this could be a decent introduction to some thinkers. ",

Some of the stuff got boring/frustrating for me at times but it was really cool to work through it with my TA and with other students (and im sure OH would've been great if I had ever gone). The final was really reasonable, and the papers were challenging but in a good way. They forced me to learn clarity and how to engage bravely with really challenging ideas. ",

I think it has a lot of things going for it; in no particular order, (1) it's pretty easy. Two essays which have an assortment of prompts to choose from and which are graded pretty generously. Minimal readings. If you are comfortable with you ability to write a philosophy paper quickly, this could be a really easy A for you. (2) The professor and TFs are great. MDR is an absolute legend and you should definitely try to take a course with him. He really makes the work come to life and it's a pleasure to go to class every week. \r\n\r\nThat being said, there are good reasons not to take it: (a) there are other classes that cover the same material, or parts of it, better. Want to learn about Kant? Take a class in Kantianism, or take PHIL 175 (Ethics with Kagan). Want to learn about Metaphysics? Take a metaphysics course. This course is definitely geared towards introductory students, which means that if you're already familiar with philosophy in general, it can be kind of dull. (b) Honestly, I'm not a fan of most metaphysics. I would really love to have an honest debate about whether or not some of these ideas are rigorous or what the problems they have are. If you don't enjoy metaphysics, look elsewhere.\r\n\r\nOverall, I'm glad I took the course. It was interesting enough, had a great teacher and TF, came with a chill workload and final, and it padded by grades nicely. ",

He does such a great job of distilling super difficult readings and philosophers in a way that students can understand and even relate to their personal lives. It's a super fun and challenging class, but it's not too challenging. The concepts and readings and papers are really difficult, but the workload isn't too bad. It's honestly the perfect class. ",
