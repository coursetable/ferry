            "\u00a0Evelyne is a great teach fellow. She is always ready to help her students and assists them with useful resources. ",
            "\u00a0Evelyne was knowledgeable and helpful ",
            "\u00a0In the few times I interacted with her, she was very approachable and positive. I was no in her section. ",
            "\u00a0Evelyne did a wonderful job of teaching a group of people with varying backgrounds of interaction with (or not) the Old Testament. Discussion sections worked well with the lectures, and added useful material and practices. I appreciated that we got to practice the interpretive methods and exegesis in discussion, since class meetings were all lecture-based. Evelyne brought structure to discussion section meetings, but was flexible enough to answer questions that we had throughout. I especially appreciate her giving extra time for a review session before the midterm and another before the final exam. It was clear that Evelyne has a strong grounding in the class material, and beyond, and her teaching skill helped make discussion sections a very useful part of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I thought Evelyne was great. She is clearly brilliant, is excited about the material, and genuinely cares about student success and understanding of the material. I always came out of section feeling like I had a new tool at my disposal for exegesis. ",
            "\u00a0She was very responsive, diligent and kind.  She tried hard to explain everything.  I don't have suggestions for improvement - she really added to the course and was faithful to each task she was assigned by Professor Wilson to complete in section. ",
            "\u00a0Evelyne was incredible - she was really prepared for each session and available for any questions we might have. You can tell that she cares about her students and wanted them to fully grasp the material. ",
            "\u00a0Teaching Fellow is John Thames; checkbox not available on this form ",
            "\u00a0This wasn't my TFI don't now why it isn't giving me John Thames as an option, but he's amazing and Yale should hire him as a prof (I learned more from him than I did any of my PROFESSORS, and his relationship with us students made me excited to go to section. He works incredibly well with people, is incredibly knowledgeable, and is incredibly kind. Can you just hire him with tenure already?). ",
            "\u00a0TJ was my Teaching Fellow that led sections. He did a great job fielding our questions, engaging us in conversation, and synthesizing our readings and lectures. ",

She allayed our fears and anxieties as a group.\r\nThere were several moments when we weren't sure about what would be relevant. She steered us in the right direction.\r\nShe directly answered our questions and did research to make sure we understood. ",

            "\u00a0Outstanding!  Evelyne sent emails and maintained regular communication that showed a sincere, real interest.\r\n\r\nI sat behind her or in the same row often in lecture and she followed along.  (Sometimes I see the TFs on the phone or doing something else but not Evelyne.)\r\n\r\nShe was not late to section nor unprepared.  Rather, Evelyne was engaged and dedicated to our learning.  This is a wonderful professionalism.\r\n\r\nHer English is first-rate.  I admire how well she does in this second language. ",
            "\u00a0Simply amazing. I learned so much from her. ",
