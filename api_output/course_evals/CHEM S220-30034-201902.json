            "\u00a0I learned how to draw, manipulate, and react organic compounds. I also learned many terms used to describe the properties of organic molecules such as polar, chiral, meso, etc. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot by taking this course including a ton of different mechanisms for reactions and how these different reactions take place. ",
            "\u00a0I really pushed myself to use new study materials such as flashcards and a dry erase whiteboard. A skill I will use going forward when trying to memorize and comprehend material ",

            "\u00a0excellent professor, problem solving sessions could be less helpful as the TA only taught one way to solve a problem and failed to recognize other ways of solving them. ",
            "\u00a0I thought it was fast paced, but understandably so. I thought the practice problem sessions were very helpful and similar to what we saw on a test. The material was organized and taught very, very well. One way it could be improved is by having more material in our grades; it would be nice if the tests were weighted less and there was some sort of homework grade (maybe even optional homework grade). ",
            "\u00a0strengths - availability and willingness of Dr. D and Dr. M to answer questions and help us as much as they can. \r\nweakness - I'm not sure there were any. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course was laid out well so that the new material we learned built on what we had learned previously. ",
            "\u00a0I liked how intense the course was due to the condensed timespan. It was a lot to keep up with, but it helped me really understand the material. The only weakness I would mention is that the last bit of information, for exam three, was given very quickly without much time for us to absorb it before the final. I would have liked to have spent less time on the review material for exam one and more time on the material for exam three. But overall the course was very good and I enjoyed it! Another HUGE strength was Dr. DiMeglio. She was so sweet and encouraging; she really made the course amazing. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very engaging and made so we can understand the material as easily as possible. ",
            "\u00a0A successful crash course of organic 1. Prepared me very well for organic 2, and covered what seemed like all the relevant material in a short amount of time. ",
            "\u00a0This class moves very quickly, making it difficult to fully learn all of the material. ",
            "\u00a0Organic Chemistry over the summer is incredibly difficult due to the pace of the course and the accelerated intake of knowledge. If taken during the school year, perhaps better study techniques involving long-term learning and understanding may be utilized, but because we were learning a chapter a day at some points, students were pretty much required to commit to cramming and straight memorization to prepare for exams.

            "\u00a0of course, especially with Dr. D. You obviously have to study a lot and everyday because it's so much content crammed into five weeks, but definitely a decision that I do not regret. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone interested in chemistry. I thought it was taught well and I liked the material. ",
            "\u00a0YES! I was worried about taking a course this intense over the summer and all I can say is IT WAS WORTH IT. I felt like I was able to understand the material just as well, if not better, than I would have taking this course during the semester. Dr. DiMeglio made it clear she wanted all of us to succeed in our personal goals for taking the course and she was always super accommodating and helpful. Most of us students were taking the class as part of the pre-med track and she was super understanding and even directed the course towards the information likely to be presented on the MCAT. So, if you're on campus for the summer and want to get a hard class out of the way, yes, I would definitely recommend Organic Chemistry. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Fulfills medical school requirement. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Dr D was a very effective teacher and the course was a great way to handle a challenging course in a more timely and intense, yet doable fashion. ",
            "\u00a0Taking orgo over the summer was a great choice because it allowed me to devote more time to the course. ",
