            "\u00a0An understanding of the history of witchcraft in colonial America, as well as document analysis skills and how to write papers in a historical lens. This was actually a very useful class in that sense- it was great practice for that sort of skill. ",
            "\u00a0You will gain a much broader understanding of witchcraft in New England beyond the exposure that most people just have to Salem. You will learn to dissect the dynamics that made witchcraft possible, paying particular attention to the role of gender, power, and the small community. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the Colonial/Puritan worldview. The class challenged a lot of my assumptions about witchcraft (especially Salem) and helped me understand why witchcraft was so common in colonial New England. ",
            "\u00a0In-depth knowledge of the worldviews of Puritan New England; engagement with primary and secondary sources; writing essays "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: Prof, topic, assignment distribution\r\nWeaknesses: difficult to carry on conversation for such a long period of time- often ran out of things to talk about. ",
            "\u00a0This course has some great readings, especially toward the beginning, that complicate popular narratives of witchcraft and help communicate how real and grave these outbreaks were for the folks who experienced them.\r\n\r\nClass is too long of a time period for the amount of discussion that gets pumped out. ",
            "\u00a0The books assigned were interesting and mostly added something new to the material. The integration of primary material was good, but I would have liked to read even more primary sources. ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus is strong - I appreciated getting to engage with a range of secondary sources that challenged and contradicted each other so that we never took the interpretations of a secondary source for granted. The primary sources were also well chosen and getting to engage with primary sources of our own choosing for the final paper worked really well as a cumulative project. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely! How often do you get to read about something fun like witchcraft for an entire semester on purpose? ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend this course if you really are invested in the material. It sometimes became tiresome to talk on end about the same small topic and so i think a keen interest is necessary. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely - a great chance to dive into a range of literature about the topic. This class is an extraordinarily thorough exploration of its subject matter. The range of secondary sources lets you engage with scholarly debate and the engagement with primary sources is a great way to understand the historical period. "
