            "\u00a0This is a fabulous class. It is a huge time commitment, but I really enjoyed the feedback and the emphasis on revision. The main improvement I'd suggest is a little more direction in terms of essay prompts! ",

            "\u00a0Definitely take it if you can get in. This is a great class! The workload is heavy-- you're writing constantly for the class-- but that's the best part. You learn by reading and by doing in this class. I definitely learned a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Do be aware that this class is a LOT of work, and Professor Wepler is not an easy grader. But it is so much fun, you end up having great in-class conversations, and you get to write about whatever really weird and fun topics you feel like! You get a lot of wonderful feedback on your writing, and the class is just a great environment. ",
