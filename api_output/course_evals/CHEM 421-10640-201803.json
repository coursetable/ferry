            "\u00a0I learned advanced chemical techniques and developments in the field of chemical biology. We went over types of systems and tools that chemists employ to study biology. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the field of chemical biology, which I knew nothing about before this course. Every topic was very interestingly and complex. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a survey of the modern techniques in chemical biology, not really so much chemistry. ",
            "\u00a0In this class, I learned a lot about applying chemical logic and methods to design novel experiments. In section, we discussed important papers that involved the methods we had learned. ",
            "\u00a0Literally none rip ",
            "\u00a0I learned about hot areas of research in chemical biology, all quite interesting stuff!\r\n We also prepared an NSF proposal on a topic of choice, by all means a useful skill. ",
            "\u00a0This is one of the best Yale courses I have ever taken! I learned a lot about experimental design and how to really think about biological systems using chemical principles. ",
            "\u00a0So many. The course is great for developing intuition and background in experimental design for biological and biochemical experiments. It is not an in-depth course in biochemistry, so do not be fooled. There was a very steep learning curve because we covered one facet of chemical biology per lecture, but you come out of it with a better understanding of how to read papers and judge experiments. "

            "\u00a0This class is really well done. It provides a lot of course material based on new research and groundbreaking discoveries. It also makes you better at experiment development and specifically understanding how research was conducted. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is that is really goes deep into the conceptual understand of these major topics. The weakness is that the undergrads had almost no means of preparing for this course. I know this is grad course, but it was taught WAY above the ability for undergrads to understand. There is clearly a disconnect between what Slavoff expected that we knew coming into the class versus what we actually knew from Orgo 2. She is a great professor but she was teaching at the graduate level the entire time, so for the vast majority of the lectures, I had no idea what was going on at all. Discussion sections were also not helpful, and I wish they would have been refocused on teaching material again (even though I know that wouldn't benefit the grad students that much). ",
            "\u00a0This class really catered to people who had a lot of experience in chemical labs, specifically chemical biology labs and was really hard for the undergraduates in the class. ",
            "\u00a0This course is horribly taught, assumes too much prior knowledge of chemical and biological processes, and is much better suited for graduate, rather than undergraduate students. ",
            "\u00a0This course did a goood job of reviewing many current topics in chemical biology. As someone with a biology/MBB background, I found the subject matter engaging and the chemistry manageable. \r\n\r\nI thought that the problem sets , though challenging, did a good job of connecting the lecture material with the sort of reasoning that we might have to do while working on a research project in a chemical biology lab. \r\n\r\nLectures are rather dense (and very early in the morning in CRB), with many biology concepts quickly reviewed in the early part and the latter half building on the former, so be aware of that! Losing focus for even a bit can render a sizeable chunk of material hard to decipher. \r\n\r\nOne thing I would have liked is to have had feedback on the NSF proposal assignment, as this could be helpful embarking into a career in science. I think this was the original intention, and that there was less time towards the end of the semester for the instructors to process everyones work. ",
            "\u00a0I think the biggest weakness was that it seemed a bit disorganized at times and there wasnt communication between the professor and the TA. I felt like I wasnt getting a lot of feedback throughout the semester so I didnt know how I was doing in the class. ",
            "\u00a0It's a grad lecture. It is what it is, but I also find it disconcerting that the grad and undergrads were graded with the same curve. Homework was manageable. "

            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to any student interested in chemistry and biology. Also, if that student is interested in research, this class provides material for a whole bunch of fascinating assays and topics. ",
            "\u00a0I would be very careful before taking this course. While conceptually this is probably one of the most interesting courses I've taken at Yale, as a Chemistry or MB&B major, you are in no way prepared to take this course from previous chemistry and biology courses. It is by far the most difficult class I've taken at Yale content-wise, and I always felt multiple lectures behind, having to cram before each exam. The problem sets are really hard and the proposal/presentation at the end take a lot of time to prepare for, fyi. Also, at least with Slavoff teaching, the exam questions and problem set questions focused heavily on you destining an experiment with appropriate controls, etc., which is not anything that undergrads have any experience with unless they've done a lot of research. Overall, I really wanted to like this course, but it was very frustrating. Slavoff is really amazing *graduate* professor but for the undergrads this was a rough ride. Many students dropped after the midterm exam. All that being said, most of the advanced chemistry lectures are either impossibly hard or taught really poorly, so I guess this might be relatively comparable to some of those, although I don't have much experience with those. ",
            "\u00a0I wouldn't recommend this class unless you are working in a chemical biology lab and want an overview of modern lab techniques and new chemical biology developments.  It was SUPER hard for the undergrads in the class and I don't know that I actually learned that much.  I'd take MBB 300 instead if you're interested in chemical biology/biochem. ",
            "\u00a0Really great course. You learn a lot about chemical methods in biology. The problems set and test questions mostly involved application of the methods and logic learned to design experiments. I found the experimental design to be very useful and fun. This class also has a discussion section in which you talk about important/interesting papers that make use of methods learned in lecture. Section helped to solidify the material. Overall, this is a fun, informative course. Would recommend. ",
            "\u00a0Only take this course if you absolutely need to in order to graduate. As a chemistry major, I thought this would be the lesser of all the evils when selecting an advanced lecture elective. I cannot believe how mistaken I was in my thinking. It's an embarrassment and an insult that this is what Yale has to offer for its advanced chemistry students. The course focused nearly exclusively on experimental design, which is fine if you have significant laboratory experience coming into it. Unfamiliar with many biological processes, however, I was left completely lost throughout most of the course, even when going to seek extra help. It was just a big mess. ",
            "\u00a0If you have a strong biology background and are interested in the subject, Id recommend it! ",
            "\u00a0this is a straight up bio class, not a chem class. ",
            "\u00a0I think it's good if you want to learn a lot about chemical biology all at once and maybe become familiar with some big names in the field. Note that this course is called chemical BIOLOGY, and it is more biology and experiment design than it is chemistry, which is more of a tool used to answer biological questions in the course. Take biochemistry if you want to learn about the chemistry and structure of amino acids, etc. in depth. "
