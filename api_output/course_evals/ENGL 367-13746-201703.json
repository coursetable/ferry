            "\u00a0Knowledge of plays written in the first half of the 20th century; interpretive skills when reading plays; ",
            "\u00a0I developed an expanded repertoire of knowledge about some of the most famous modernist American plays, in addition to many fringe, niche modernist works by American literary and cultural figures who also tried their hand at playwriting. ",
            "\u00a0The reading list is dope. I hadn't read any of the plays on the syllabus, and it was worth taking the class just to read them all. But I also developed an appreciation for theater I didn't have before, thanks to Prof. Robinson's emphasis on aspects beyond the words on the page. ",
            "\u00a0This course covers many must-read plays from early- to mid-20th century American drama--big names in theatre like O'Neill, Wilder, Williams, Miller, and also big names who made their careers in another literary form, like Stevens, Eliot, Stein, Cummings. It's worth taking for the syllabus alone. Professor Robinson's knowledge and passion for theatre makes class interesting and enriches your way of seeing the plays. You write two ten-page essays and seven short response posts on the reading. These are often quite enjoyable and a good way to unify multiple plays by a consistent theme or discuss the commonalities or evolution of a playwrights' works. ",
            "\u00a0You get to read all the great American plays ",
            "\u00a0I gained a fantastic overview of the sociopolitical environment of the American 1920s-1950s, as well as an incredibly survey of dramatists from that era, ranging from the famous (Arthur Miller and Tennessee Williams) to the obscure (Jane Bowles and Djuna Barnes, to name a few). And while neither an insight nor a skill, this class gave me the opportunity to speak with both Thornton Wilders nephew, Tappan, and Emmy- and Golden Globe-nominated actress Jane Kaczmarek for a paper I was working on, which was a pretty special experience.

            "\u00a0Incredible selection of plays and engaging conversation ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed getting to read and reflect on all the works we read for the course, but sometimes class discussion felt a little static. I appreciated the freedom we were given with our longer papers and enjoyed getting to explore specific works in depth based on a topic of my own choosing. ",
            "\u00a0When Prof. Robinson talks in class (which he does for ~75 percent of the time), it's great. He's extremely knowledgable, and comes in to class with copious notes and anecdotes prepared to illustrate his points about the plays; listening to him is a delight. And maybe the class would be better served by being a lecture, because, more often than not, when we shifted to discussion-mode, the class fell flat, and I was left disappointed.\r\n\r\nDiscussion was dominated by the same five or six people. Theater kids all. Really annoying. And it would be fine if Prof. Robinson steered the conversation back to the more interesting parts of the play, but he'd instead let anyone who wanted talk for as long as they wanted about (in my opinion) less interesting things. I wish discussions had been led with a more purposeful hand, and that more voices had been brought into the fold. ",
            "\u00a0Simultaneously an advantage and a disadvantage, this course meets once a week. This set up is more conducive for discussing the sizable reading--multiple full-length plays each week--than dividing it up into a twice-a-week set up, though this means that we only get one chance to discuss a play in depth, and sometimes not even that gets accomplished in the hour and fifty minutes allotted for each class. Often I felt we were talking in circles or repeating or the discussion was not going into any depth. That came largely from the students' lack of engagement with the text. They were not forced to participate, which meant usually the same group of people was contributing, sometimes without something interesting to add. Discussion was not nearly as stimulating as it could be. \r\n\r\nDespite that, however, Professor Robinson always found a way to say something interesting or enriching in response to a student's comment, no matter how basic or uninformed. This made discussion worth listening to. ",
            "\u00a0I think the class is at its best when identity and social politics do not interfere too much with discussions. ",
            "\u00a0This courses extremely strong syllabus and Professor Robinsons otherworldly knowledge of all things theater are the strengths of the course. The course could be improved by moving it to a different locationits incredibly hard to concentrate and analyze for two hours in a stiflingly hot, dry and claustrophobic basement space (you think Im kidding; I started to dress in layers on Tuesday in anticipation of class). I would say the only weakness of the class is that while Professor Robinson would read the weekly blog posts we wrote, not everyone in the class would read every blog post before class. As such, some of the discussions would just be students summarizing their blog posts, which would sometimes prevent us from getting into deeper/more nuanced conversations, because we would waste time reiterating what we could have read before class.

            "\u00a0Yes, if interested in subject matter ",
            "\u00a0Would recommend this course to anyone interested in modernity and plays, whether they are comfortable with plays or not ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed all the readings we did, but sometimes class discussion can be somewhat flat and boring in the momentat least with the less famous works we read. Students were much more engaged and lively during the weeks we read the work of more famous playwrights, which was enjoyable. The assignments are very reasonable and self-motivated, so as long as you put in the work and remain engaged, its very manageable. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to read the plays and listen to a super knowledgable professor, yes. If you're looking for a stimulating seminar, no. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this class, if only just for the syllabus. The works on it are varied and worth reading, especially since drama is not studied as much as it should be and these make the genre particularly compelling and intriguing for those with little exposure. And for those with lots of exposure, you're sure to find something great that you've never read, or even heard of, before. \r\n\r\nProfessor Robinson is also a great resource. With his range and depth of knowledge, he keeps class interesting and gives you new angles by which to understand the plays. Seek him out in office hours, especially before writing your essays. He will listen, make helpful suggestions and contributions, and give you some good paths of enquiry to follow. \r\n\r\nThe key is to be engaged--with your reading, your writing, your participation in discussion. It is fairly easy not to do a lot of the reading and hide during discussion, and the apathy present in about half the class can often be frustrating. So put effort in, because (as with most classes, but especially this one, since it meets once a week and much of the work is reading), you get out as much as you put in. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, these are plays that should be read and known by basically anyone ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you are interested in exploring theater (or rather, works of text you didnt know you could even classify as theater), then this class is for you. The range of playwrights on the syllabus make every week a different experience. The way Ive described it to other friends is that you, the class and Professor Robinson meet once a week to geek out about all things theater for academic credit. What could be better? ",
            "\u00a0I'd definitely recommend this course to another student. Professor Robinson is really great: he's funny, engaging, and unbelievably knowledgeable. Most of the plays we read I really enjoyed, and discussions were usually lively. Because it was a large seminar (ours was 20+ students) it was hard to participate if you're on the quieter side, but class discussions were still engaging and useful. "
