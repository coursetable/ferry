        [
            "\u00a0This course taught a lot of content, and should be a 3 day a week class instead of two days. Lectures were often very long and  laborious, and I think students would absorb more information if it was more spaced out. Also, the office hours are completely overcrowded and loud. There are not even enough chairs and tables for students, so many sit on the ground. It is an extremely stressful environment to work on problem sets that are already so intense. It is amazing that this class has so many office hours, but they need to be in a bigger space. ",
            "\u00a0Steinacker is great and the lectures and lecture notes are very helpful. The problem sets take up my whole week and while I understand the point of having the problems assigned, you just come to resent the class when it gets in the way of your life. ",
            "\u00a0The professor was really great and I liked the wide variety of options for getting help on homework, etc. I felt that we had an extremely knowledgeable professor that really boosted what we were able to get out of the course. Another strength is that Prof. Steinacker Some weaknesses were that Prof. Steinacker went WAY too fast in lecture. Sometimes I would lean over to ask a friend a question about the material and when I would look back up I'd be even more confused about everything because she would have covered several more things. Another thing - those problem sets. I was in study hall Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and sometimes Thursday trying to get those done. If you want to improve the course, 1) have less time consuming psets and 2) maybe go a little slower in lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Professor very enthusiastic, sometimes felt lost on p-sets. More problem tips rather than theoretical stuff. ",
            "\u00a0Some of the problems sets were incredibly difficult and Adrian (although a wonderful person) was sometimes disorganized and her wording of the problems was not the best. The class also moved really fast through some complex topics and then went too slowly during easier topics. It would also have been nice for homework solutions to be posted shortly after the due date. ",
            "\u00a0There is ample help available via peer tutors, office hours, study hall. P-sets force you to think deeper about material learned in class. Hard to pinpoint any weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very well designed, but it does assume that students have a strong calculus background. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:  You really learn so much, and with psets being such a large part of your grade, the focus is much more on actually working through problems and figuring things out than on cramming for tests.  Also, Steinacker is an amazing professor who genuinely cares about everyone's learning.\r\nI can't think of how it could be improved. ",
            "\u00a0This course does a great job of teaching you about physics. Professor Steinacker is a decent lecturer and her demonstrations are always fun to watch. And although the PSETs are difficult, there is a lot of help available, from office hours to study halls to peer tutors. Once you get past the initial barrier of difficult homework, the class is manageable. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: One the more unique aspects of this course compared to others is that most of the learning is done in the completion of the assigned problem sets, and it seems Professor Steinacker wants you think so as well, as demonstrated by the numerous opportunities given to students for help with PS completion (M-Th office hours, Su-Th study hall hours). The lectures themselves were helpful in providing an introduction to the concepts that would be solidified upon completion of the problem sets. The midterms and final were challenging for sure, but not impossible--Steinacker gives enough resources and direction for you to do well, provided you put in the time. In fact, that statement is true in regards to the course as a whole--very challenging, but conquerable with enough time and energy invested. My suggestion is to find a friend or friends you can work with, and develop a strategy for tackling the problem sets together--my friend and I figured out a method that would allow us to spend about 7 hours overall on each problem set (1 hr/problem average). Lastly, Prof. Steinacker is a great professor with a very unique personality. You'll be fascinated by her rugged sense of individualism, her confidence, and her unique humor. \r\nWeaknesses: It's difficult to make a subject like physics interesting, and Steinacker already does such a great job of doing so. I wonder if there are supplemental online resources that could be provided for students to understand concepts a little better (e.g. simulations, online activities that are not mandatory but perhaps available on Canvas). ",
            "\u00a0The course content overall is quite good. In some cases I feel that it is made a little bit more complicated but this also makes it more interesting.\r\n\r\nThe course workload is huge and Psets will take sometimes 12+ hours to complete. ",
            "\u00a0I think increasing the number of pset problems that were a simple demonstration of concept would be swell. Too often problems were convoluted. I feel as though the purpose of the psets were to use problem solving as a teaching technique, which is GREAT, but also simpler problems that lead up to more involved applications of equations and concepts would teach the material A LOT BETTER, and allow for self-directed learning as problems scaled up in difficulty, instead of necessitating the use of outside help at every turn because the question of how to set up this problem was so unapproachable. \r\n\r\nOtherwise, I support the use of hard psets. Physics is like the ultimate problem-solving subject, so I support the rigor of the intro class. But taking out a few hard problems and replacing them with slight easier \"show of concept\" ones would be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The class is very well taught and Professor Steinacker is very thorough in her examples. She also posts class notes for every single class and the solutions for every problem set.\r\n\r\nThe problem sets are often very time-consuming, and sometimes needlessly tedious and complicated. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Steinacker is a gem - she is very interested in students, humorous. ",
            "\u00a0The level of help you get in this class is amazing. There are so many TA office hours, peer tutors and Professor Steinecker is amazing. \r\n\r\nThe P-sets are really challenging and they force you to think outside the box to find solutions. I sometimes thought that the questions on the p-set were so many that they overclouded the goal of the p-set which was to get an in-depth understanding of the subjects. ",
            "\u00a0The psets are really long and time consuming, but they prepare you well for the exams ",
            "\u00a0It's pretty hard not going to lie. But she is a really sweet professor so you want to do well. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest weakness of the course was the grading of the problem sets. Before the final exam, the grading was three weeks behind. When the grading is so far behind, you miss the opportunity to fix any sort of conceptual mistakes you made in the class. I think problem set class can be awesome, but the grading needs to be prompt. I also think that midterms should count for more, it's a little weird that they're just 15% of the grade. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Grueling PSETs that make you actually learn the material very in-depth. Lectures are very helpful and essential. I felt like my time was well spent in lecture (even though sometimes there is a lot of information to unpack).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None that I can think of. This class was amazing. ",
            "\u00a0It was very well designed ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that you can't help but learn a LOT about physics by the end of the semester. I enjoyed the lectures and the demonstrations.\r\n\r\nThe main issue with this class is the workload. I am willing to work very hard for a class, but for physics I spent several hours every single day working just to finish each problem set. Every evening I went to the study hall to work for hours. The problem is that this course took away from all the other interesting courses I was taking (including ones for my MAJOR), because I was forced to spend every spare moment on physics. I can't tell if that was worth it for the skills I learned. \r\n\r\nIt could also be more accommodating to students without a background in physics, because we were thrown in with people who've taken years of AP physics and expected to perform the same. ",
            "\u00a0This course was taught very well, but the PSETs were insane. The psets helped with learning but they took way too long. It took so long to finish the psets that I didn't have the time to study material beyond that. ",
            "\u00a0Some of the lectures were very fast but class notes were provided which really helped fill the gaps in knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Steinacker is a good lecturer to some, but I don't understand what is going on most of the time. That's why I don't go to class. ",
            "\u00a0The problem sets are daunting. Making them a problem or two shorter would have substantially increased my learning because I would have been able to take my time and process each problem better. ",
            "\u00a0Great professor - very caring and always willing to post helpful materials on Canvas after lecture. It's just an intro class, not much to change. ",
            "\u00a0The course really succeeds in making you understand physical principles by working out the relationships and formulas that describe these phenomena yourself in the problems sets. The fact that you also have to apply these principles to entirely new situations with different stipulations also helps you understand these concepts more clearly. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Steinecker, difficult weekly psets that prepare you for exams, exam revisions\r\nWeaknesses: the course is hard, but you probably knew that if you are thinking about taking this ",
            "\u00a0I wish there were discussion sections like in General Chemistry I, because its hard to get a TF's attention in study hall or Adriane's in office hours since there are so many students seeking help ",
            "\u00a0The problem sets are pretty time consuming and intense and sometimes they were so difficult that I felt like I wasn't actually learning the material. Lectures were interesting but I felt that sometimes they moved too quickly or it was assumed that we had already learned the material. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I thought the course was great and didn't really have any weaknesses. The amount of resources I could go to for help was a strength for this course. ",
            "\u00a0There were a plethora of opportunities for extra help, whether directly with Professor Steinacker or with a peer tutor. ",
            "\u00a0Problem sets are wordy and unnecessarily complicated. Would recommend doing them in office hours because the way that they're written makes it hard to even interpret what the questions are saying. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this was a remarkably well-taught course. Although the lectures provide exposure to new concepts and relevant examples, I learned the most by going to office hours and doing the problem sets by collaborating and trying things out with my peers. In that sense, the class is similar to a flipped-classroom in which most of the learning occurs outside of class while applying the concepts. I'm impressed by the sense of community that was created by the course, and become so close with such a large number of classmates in a lecture course. I appreciated that Professor Steinacker gave us time in some of the lectures to solve problems on our own, which made the class more interactive. I would love to see more of this individual or group problem-solving done more often, maybe one out of two lectures, to apply the concepts just learned. I also really appreciated the exam corrections for the midterms, which encourages students to lessen the focus on grades and more on learning. The main element that made me love the course was Steinacker's commitment to making us learn, by being present every day at office hours and hosting exam review and revision sessions, and taking the time to get to know and care for her students. ",
            "\u00a0the lecture format was great and interesting. better support for the p sets would be nice. ",
            "\u00a0A major strength of this course is Prof. Steinacker. She's absolutely wonderful, kind, patient, and genuinely cares about each of her students. She holds office hours every day and is always happy to help students. She is also a clear and engaging lecturer. A weakness of this course is that psets take a great deal of time every week, and could be reduced in length by a problem or two (though I understand why Prof. Steinacker makes them as long as she does; doing the psets is great prep for exams). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: many opportunities for students to get help\r\nWeaknesses: long p-sets ",
            "\u00a0AMAZING professor - great at teaching and cares more about her students than any other STEM professor I've ever had. Workload is super manageable - psets were often a refreshing break from the rest of the week, and office hours were always helpful for when you got stuck on the tricky ones. Tests were tricky but very reasonable. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Great lecturer, both in terms of teaching ability and character; gives great foundation of physics; lots of support for problem sets; problem sets are challenging but fair, and they encourage growth of skills in physics; very hard to fail class if you try.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Doesn't cover thermodynamics, relativity or a few other really interesting physics topics; not much that can be done about this since there's only so much time in a semester, but if you want to take this course, keep in mind that you won't see VERY advanced physics. TA's were sometimes a bit slow getting graded problem sets back, though I guess it's a pretty big class. Problem sets could be a bit harder. ",
            "\u00a0The course was awesome. The psets each week were long and extremely hard, but there was so much support that you'd hardly notice. Prof. Steinacker made herself available for at least 12 office hours every week, which in my experience is unheard of for any professor. On top of that, there were TAs and peer tutors available at study halls and by email to help as well! And Prof. Stienacker is such a good lecturer - she sometimes went fast but she was thorough and posted class notes online so you could read through something again if you didn't understand it completely the first time. I was so scared to take physics but she made it doable, and now I'm actually excited for next semester! ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the applications to space and other ways in which Prof. Steinacker made information relevant in a real-world context. I felt as though I learned nearly everything in this class from doing the problem sets which I found to be both a strength and weakness of the class. The p-sets helped me get a good grasp on the material, but I often found that by attending lecture alone I would not have been equipped to solve the homework on my own (i instead had to go to peer tutor and office hours for many hours a week). As a humanities major taking this course, I understand the necessary rigor but wish that it could be more accessible to students outside of pre-med or STEM to take. ",
            "\u00a0The course is overall strong--the organization and teaching were both strong.\r\nThe weakness is that since it is a large lecture class, Study Halls are usually flooding and it can be not the most efficient or productive for people trying to learn 1:1 from tutors. The peer tutor system can be set up better. ",
            "\u00a0There are so many office hours, study hall hours, and peer tutors, willing to help. This is a very challenging class but there is help at nearly any time of the day. ",
            "\u00a0Great lectures and good teaching pace, no complaints. ",
            "\u00a0This strength is very well taught and the problem sets are very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a very high work load, which is understandable but also very hard to manage at times. Professor Steinacker was very forgiving with exams and always willing to help, and I found it incredibly helpful that office hours, study hall, and peer tutor hours were all offered every day. This course is geared to help students succeed. ",
            "\u00a0I think the strengths of the course are the support, the structure, and Professor Steinacker. I think that the class is well organized and for the most part reasonable. I think that the issue is that the homework assignments are either slightly too difficult or too long. I found that I was forced to try and finish them as fast as possible instead of learn the material. ",
            "\u00a0The class is well taught but the PSETs are very challenging and time-consuming. ",
            "\u00a0It is an excellent class. Very difficult, homework is almost impossible to do without going to office hours or tutoring. But the lectures are engaging and the homework is rewarding. Lots of opportunities to save your grade. A lot of work, but very worthwhile. ",
            "\u00a0I wish the review sessions had been more helpful. I only attended one or two before I decided that they were not beneficial. They were just not as structured as I would have liked. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is its professor, Professor Steinacker. She is probably the most dedicated professor I have studied with. It's amazing how the professor's attitude can totally transform students' opinion about the material in the course. This course could be improved by making the wording on problem sets and exams clearer and less ambiguous/confusing. Other than that, PHYS 180 is excellent. ",
            "\u00a0I really like the structures of the lectures, though I think the problem sets can be unnecessarily algebraic and don't always get at the meat of the concepts we're covering. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths include that there are many opportunities to seek help through office hours and study halls, that detailed, helpful class notes posted for each lecture, that Professor Steinecker holds review sessions and sometimes exam feedback sessions, and that corrections are allowed on the midterm exams. The weaknesses include that the course is so time-consuming that it becomes difficult to focus on other courses and that the exams are often extremely difficult, resulting in such a low class average that everyone totally relies on the corrections. Further, the lectures often feel quite disorganized. It is difficult to read what is written on the board and follow what is happening. Most students express frustration over spending endless hours, several evenings each week, at office hours and/or study hall, completing the problems sets only after being walked through them by Professor Steinecker, teaching fellows, or peer tutors, but still feeling as if they don't understand the material or as if they would be able to work through the problems on their own. ",
            "\u00a0The professor is fantastic and discusses each topic throughout, while giving numerous examples. She even provides different ways to solve each problem, so students would be able to chose the way they prefer for future related questions. The office hours for the course were immensely helpful, however sometimes I feel that there could be more help, since some sessions could get rather busy. ",

            "\u00a0Adrianne is definitely the big plus of this course. Even though there are hundreds of students enrolled in her class, she takes the time to talk to you personally. She gives the lecture an amazing energy and her enthusiasm spreads to her students. \r\nWeaknesses are the way office hours can feel a but daunting. There is nowhere to sit and it is ovuercrowded, which is never good since you have to focus on the actual problem set. Another minus, is that the psets are long.  But this pays off in the end. ",

She is the best part of the class.\r\n\r\nMy biggest complaint with the class was the psets. Overall, I found them largely distracting from the real material of the course. I was often frustrated by solving the physics of the given problems quickly, only to be bogged down by excessive math for the next few hours. I really didn't feel like completing the psets helped me learn the material better. Furthermore, as someone who did all of the psets outside of study hall and office hours, I wish that the psets contained less tricks that could only be given by peer tutors. ",
            "\u00a0Hard psets but plenty of help available for students if seeked out through office hours and study sessions. Some concepts covered in class were a bit fast but overall everything was made clear. ",

Another strength was the accessibility to office hours and study halls; peer tutors and teaching assistants were always available as much as they could to help students, which is really great. There was also a review of topics weekly from one of the teaching assistants which I thought was helpful. Test corrections are also a huge plus. \r\n\r\nNot a weakness but something that is just a part of the course - it goes quickly which makes it demanding and sometimes hard to keep up with, but you have to keep up. P-Sets take a long time, multiple office hour sessions, and teamwork, and it's a lot of work for one class. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Exams are tough but fair. Numerous study halls and office hours offered weekly which really helps manage the course load.\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the psets were almost too time- consuming but luckily these were compensated with extra time to turn them in. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: I feel like I mastered the intended topics due to the difficulty of the problem sets. \r\nWeaknesses: hard problem sets but helpful in the end. ",

            "\u00a0The strengths of the class include the abundance of help available (office hours are held almost every day) and the generous grading. If you do the work and show up to office hours, it's not too hard to get a good grade. The psets, however, can be almost impossible to complete without going to office hours, so the class is extremely time intensive. ",

Another great strength is being able to do revisions on the exams. That is an incredible privilege. ",

She is extremely patient, and she pushes you to gain a deeper understanding of physics than you would otherwise. Would recommend over PHYS 170, which seemed to me was a more superficial look at physics than 180. ",

            "\u00a0Absolutely. If you have to choose between different kinds of physics, this one cannot be beat. You will learn the basic, fundamental principles that govern the universe, applicable to all scales and contexts. What's more beautiful than that? ",

The only people that will say to not take this course are the ones that probably skipped class or didn't go to office hours. If you take PHYS 180, make sure you have room in your schedule set aside for when you'll attend Adriane's OFFICE HOURS--not study hall. Study hall is fine, but if you have to choose between the two, go to office hours. In the first half of the course, I skipped class, went to study hall to work on psets I didn't understand, and then i FAILED the first midterm. The second half of the semester, I sat in the front row of every class and went to office hours as many times as I could, and then I scored above the class average on the second midterm. So, take PHYS 180 ONLY if you know you will devote time to truly getting help!! Also Adriane Steinacker is the best professor at Yale and there are test corrections (which literally saved my life)!

It can definitely be a lot of work, and the weekly psets will take up ~8-10 hours a week, but Prof. Steinacker is incredible and you can definitely get through it with a good grade if you work hard. As a pre med, I thought the course content wasn't personally what I was most interested in, but the course was engaging nonetheless and I loved the problem-solving aspect of this class. It's pretty impossible to not like physics the way Steinacker teaches it. ",

If, also like me, you don't feel comfortable going up to physics 200 or 260 and you're mainly choosing between 170 and 180, consider what you want out of a physics course. If you want a solid foundation in physics that appeals to all fields (medicine, engineering, physics, etc.), take 180, both because it covers the fundamentals of physics and because Professor Steinacker really knows how to teach. If you're comfortable with physics or just don't really care about having a solid foundation (not advisable), and really prefer seeing examples of physics in medical contexts, consider 170. Again, if you sincerely want to learn about and appreciate physics for what it is, 180 is probably better, but if you're just trying to complete the pre-med physics requirement, do 170. From what I've heard, that class is taught pretty well too, and it does provide some interesting biological examples of physics. ",

And Prof. Stienacker teaches the material in such a thorough manner and the different topics in such a naturally progressive way that it became easy to pick up with the right work. Just make sure you're doing the psets - the exam questions are very much structured like them (in terms of integrating different concepts, etc.), and it helps to have done similar problems once before! And go! to! class! I skipped a couple lectures for sickness, and it took me hours to make them up on my own rather than have learned them in class. Of course Prof. Steinacker accounts for such things with her attendance policy, but all I'm saying is don't skip class just because you want to! It's a lot to make up! ",

Personally, my math background is very weak and i found it basically impossible to keep up with the prof in lecture. Even if you go to office hours/study hall every day, it can be hard to shake a feeling that you are the only one struggling to comprehend the material conceptually/ that you are kinda stupid when seeking help from T.A.'s or the prof. \r\n\r\nI think I may have had more success in the course if the homework problems were more structures such that a problem was divided into steps that would eventually lead you to an answer. I felt that a lot of time was wasted on homework problems trying to decipher what the question was asking and not knowing where to start. Problems like this showing up on the exam is far, but having all problems be so unstructured in the homework truly made the psets unnecessarily painful. \r\n\r\nAs nice of an instructor as Adriane is... I'd recommend that my fellow math noobs and/or people who did not take AP Physics in high school take 170 instead, I hear those kids don't suffer as much. ",
