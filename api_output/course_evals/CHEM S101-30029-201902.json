            "\u00a0The course covered a lot of material, which was a positive and negative thing. I learned a lot from it but it was also very fast paced and hard to follow sometimes. It could be improved by slowing the course down a bit when needed. The demonstrations were very helpful in understanding concepts. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, I would. However, I would recommend it for students who are need of an introductory course in chemistry or need a refresher of chemistry topics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes,  but only if you have a solid background in chemistry. There are no prerequisites for the course, but the instructor does expect you to know some chemistry before hand. My lack of a chemistry background caused me to struggle in the course. ",
            "\u00a0Sure. I thing the professor of this course was kind and knowledgeable, and I still remembered my joy and happiness this course gave me. "
