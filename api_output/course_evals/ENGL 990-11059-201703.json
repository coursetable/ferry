            "\u00a0- we read widely concerning various issues and theories in pedagogy\r\n- we observed different styles of classes \r\n- we were able to practice teaching, both in an artificial \"lab\" setting of our own classroom, and as guests in the classrooms we were sitting in on \r\n- I gained more of a sense of what style of teacher I would like to be by discussing goals with my peers ",
            "\u00a0This class taught me about different aspects of teaching. In addition, I think it made me reflect on my scholarly ambitions and goals--what's at stake for me in pursuing a PhD. ",
            "\u00a0I can honestly say that I feel better prepared to begin teaching and have a confidence that I did not have before this class. The syllabus, the instructors, the teaching opportunities, and my peers all helped to create an environment of exploration and development and forced me to ask myself the hard questions about the kind of teacher I hope to become. ",
            "\u00a0Although it is hard to say without having put them into practice yet, this class inculcated more skills than I can mention--from leading seminars, to grading papers, to negotiating different student needs and handling the politics of the classroom.  It also encouraged us all to think deeply about the nature of our scholarship, its relationship to teaching, and the place of the humanities within the broader university ecosystem.  Jill and Margaret were exceptionally attuned to the potential dissonances between more practical problems (grading, leading a seminar, etc) and the theoretical difficulties to which they can lead, and which might inform the way we handle them (the politics of the discipline, the nature of authority in the classroom, etc).   I think it was a strength of the class that it left me feeling like those two registers were both deeply imbricated with each other and, for the most part, unresolved in their tension. ",
            "\u00a0- learned teaching strategies\r\n- had many opportunities to practice teaching and giving each other feedback\r\n- had great dialogue with classmates about teaching styles and challenges we may face in our teaching "

            "\u00a0- this course offered a great way to actually spend some time together as a whole cohort and discuss our goals as developing teachers \r\n- I really value having a team-taught course; it helps to have multiple perspectives on the reading or on how one might handle a classroom situation \r\n- there was a LOT of reading, particularly combined with the time commitment of also having to read for, prepare to teach, and attend additional courses that we were sitting in on \r\n- the practical teaching demos were very helpful; personally, I would have liked a lot more practical training, and could have done with a bit less theoretical reading ",
            "\u00a0The practicum was really helpful for me in many ways. I especially appreciated the time to design syllabi and the opportunities to practice teaching. The most useful thing, by far, was the experience of leading those ten-minute \"mini-classes.\" It was incredibly helpful for me to both get feedback on my own \"class,\" but to also observe how others ran their classrooms. I wish we had each been required to teach two of those classes (and, instead, had had to sit in on classes one week fewer, each unit, for example).\r\n\r\nThere was way too much work for this class. Tallying up the amount of time I spent reading for class, as well as sitting in on all the required outside classes, lectures, etc, preparing to teach three times, and meeting regularly with the instructors we were observing... it was easily the equivalent of one and a half classes. If not even a little more. In the future, I think having fewer readings assigned each week (which, incidentally, would allow us to have more time in class to discuss our observations), and only sitting in on three weeks of each class we observe, instead of four, would have greatly improved my experience / sanity this semester. \r\n\r\nThis all being said, I had a wonderful time in class and am really glad that I had the opportunity to think critically about the kind of teacher I would like to be. ",
            "\u00a0I think the strength and the weakness of this class is that it is so broad. Its challenge is that there are so many aspects of teaching--being a TA, practical concerns of classroom management, philosophical questions about stye and approach, etc. Sometimes it felt like we didn't have enough time to talk about it all, or that we bounced around from topic to topic. However, I'm so grateful that it is offered in the English department, it's been a very formative moment for me as a teacher and scholar. ",
            "\u00a0A really fruitful combination of practical teaching skills and critical theory/state of the discipline discussions. Margaret and Jill did an incredible job balancing these two aspects of teaching at the university level and facilitated discussions extremely well ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The teachers! What a grand gift for us to have two phenomenal instructors to guide us through our teaching practicum. Also, the syllabus they put together was exactly the type of reading guide we needed and will continue to reference as we head to the front of our own classrooms. Having an opportunity to observe actual first year classes and teach was also extremely beneficial.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There are no major weaknesses that come to mind. This was truly a powerhouse course. It could have been helpful to have more paper responding experience and learn some techniques. We did have one week of instruction but I wonder if there is a way we could have included doing some practice within the teaching sections we were assigned to. ",
            "\u00a0Many of its strengths I've already mentioned, but I would add or simply reassert that the variety of skills it sought to cover was a great strength.  It was comprehensive in the best sense, while leaving space for unplanned developments within the classroom and over the course of the semester.  It was, at times, admittedly difficult to stay on top of the quantity of work required of this class, particularly in weeks 2-8 during which we were reading not only for practicum sessions, but also for the undergrad classes that we were sitting in on.  Jill and Margaret were generally sensitive to the challenges this could present, which I very much appreciated.  They might consider, in the future, leaving out some of the readings that didn't end u p playing a particularly central role in our discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- great topics\r\n- useful assignments\r\n- useful insight from the lead professors\r\n- had ample time to discuss with classmates\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- two final syllabi seemed like too much\r\n- attending undergrad classes for four weeks at a time felt like too much \r\n- sometimes, we were asked to do more reading than we had a chance to discuss "

            "\u00a0Well, it's required for students in the English department, but I do think it's really a cornerstone of coursework and should be looked forward to by all English PhD students. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, most definitely. I am so glad this is a mandatory course for all English grad students. ",
            "\u00a0Since this is a required class, I'm not exactly sure how to answer this -- except by saying that it seemed like the students who voluntarily took this class benefit greatly from it, just as those of us who had to take it did.  I would take it even if for no other reason than to find a space to think collaboratively about what we're all doing in graduate school, what we think we might get out of it, and what we think other people might get out of the work we're putting in--if anything. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Its such a great opportunity to learn about teaching before were asked to do it ourselves. "
