            "\u00a0I have learned about analytical jurisprudence. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a good introductory training in analytic philosophy, which I found particularly useful as a newcomer to the discipline, and a sound introduction to the field. In particular, I improved my ability to look at legal systems in a clear way, without either a lawyer's or historian's analytical frame but rather with an analytical method. ",
            "\u00a0Teacher really helped understand the art of Constitutional interpretation ",

            "\u00a0If we had discussion groups and a once a week assignment, it would help us to engage with the material ",
            "\u00a0Scott Shapiro is an amazing and engaging lecturer. It is fantastic that he is such an expert in the field. Sometimes, it felt a bit redundant to read the primary material, then his secondary account from his book and then a second secondary account in lecture, although  I feel like it was sometimes necessary. ",
            "\u00a0Its strengths are in Scott Shapiro's ability to explain complex problems very clearly, and in the critical approach taken to each author. That makes it very effective at teaching the basics and ensuring everyone has a grip on them. I did feel, however, that the course was a little truncated. There was, for instance, no teaching of Fuller, Raz or Finnis, nor any Simmonds or Gardner. Having read these myself I felt they might have led to a fuller appreciation of the course material if they were included in the course itself. I appreciate there is limited time, but I felt the syllabus could have been a little more ambitious in the amount of reading set, and possibly could have sacrificed international law in favour of covering at least Finnis and Raz. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course could include more material on natural law instead of just the Dworkin and Greenberg reading. I would be nice to know more about authors in this field. ",
            "\u00a0This course is great in its depth of thinking yet presentation in an understandable way. ",
            "\u00a0I thought we could've gone through Hart / the first half of the class a little quicker; it often felt redundant to have both the primary readings, the reconstruction in Legality, and the lecture in class go over more or less the same material. "

            "\u00a0Yes, it is very well taught and very challenging. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course. This course gets into central questions in legal philosophy that have immense stakes. In this class, you ask questions like \"what is law?\" and \"how do we interpret the law?\" These questions seem pretty straightforward but they really are not, and they have major consequences on how courts resolve cases (e.g. the answer to the question \"what is law\" will tell you what things count as law (e.g. legislators' intent? morality? etc.) and so what will influence the outcome of the case).  The course overviews the answers given by canonical positivists (i.e. people who think the law is determined by social facts, such as conventions, etc.) and canonical naturalists (i.e. people who think the law is determined by both social and moral facts). Shapiro's analysis of these authors is amazingly insightful (his book is extremely helpful, clear and engaging). He also presents his own theory (the planning theory of law) and regularly comes back to it to show how it solves the problems that we identify in class with the other theories. It is always amazing when professors teach their own models and theories. ",
            "\u00a0Certainly, for someone looking for clear first steps in the field. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who is attempting to learn more about the art of judicial interpretation and even hermeneutics in general. Really insightful course. Scott Shapiro is the man. Great guy. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. A good opportunity to learn the philosophy of law. "
