            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the workshop sessions and wish there could have been more of them. I was also exposed to a lot of fun screenplays and movies throughout the class. More time could have been spent delving into the intricacies of a screenplay and discussing the different things that make a screenplay enjoyable or surprising. However, a lot of time was spent on lectures instead. "

            "\u00a0Totally! Especially if you're trying to figure out if you might have a thing for screenwriting ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It is a good introduction level crash course to screenwriting. It covered the fundamentals of writing a screenplay while forcing us to work out the kinks of our stories within a short amount of time, which is good writing practice for working with a tight deadline. "
