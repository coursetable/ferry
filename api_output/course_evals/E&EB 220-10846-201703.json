            "\u00a0This course provided me with a strong theoretical framework to better understand ecological phenomena, without confining itself entirely to math and formulas. I also got practice with synthesizing scientific papers and applying the theory to real-life ecological issues. ",
            "\u00a0this course sucked. prof Vasseur is boring and not engaging, he's nice tho. ",
            "\u00a0Interpretation of derivative equations. Mathematical interpretations of competition, growth, and predator-prey dynamics. ",
            "\u00a0Learned more about how to think about population dynamics and how interactions among communities shapes the environment we see today. ",
            "\u00a0It was a great basic introduction to conceptual and practical ecology. I learned first and foremost how much math and modeling is involved in ecology. But I also genuinely enjoyed the course material and felt like I learned a lot of useful stuff from the class, especially as a E&EB major. ",
            "\u00a0This class not only allowed me to explore classical ecological dyamics (food-webbed, population dynamics, etc.) but also policies related to conservation and preservation of species and the anthropogenic determinants of climate and biodiversity change. I also appreciated learning about use of modeling in ecology, as my previous courses always resented things conceptually but assigned theoretical literature that was quantitative in nature. This class functioned to bridge that gap. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more in this class than I did in most of my other classes this semester.  I learned a lot about mathematical modeling and theory.  I also learned what ecology was--I thought I knew at the beginning of the course, but my assumptions were wrong.  I learned about how to solve multi-part questions that forced me to integrate various different concepts.  I also learned about writing scientific papers, as most of my other papers that I had written were social science or humanities papers. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about ecological models and biome classification. I also learned of ecological concepts and experiments done to test them. ",
            "\u00a0This course teaches the fundamentals of ecology including concepts such as population models, trophic interactions, and environmental change. It was particularly useful for learning how to use and interpret simple mathematical models to derive meaning from physical systems. It also gave me a much fuller understanding of how humans are currently impacting the environment. ",
            "\u00a0In this course I learned a lot about studying ecology and the state of the environment today. I also learned a whole lot about predicting population sizes and dynamics mathematically. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the principles of modern ecology. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about mathematical models of ecological interactions, which I found interesting and hadn't encountered before. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the patterns that occur in nature and the ways in which models are both useful and limited in their ability to predict natural outcomes. The model-based approach of this class required both that I understand the underlying mechanisms that drive these patterns and the pure math that is used. ",
            "\u00a0A general understanding of ecology and the dynamics of population interactions. "

        [
            "\u00a0The entire class was focused on models, primarily population models.  Though I understand that teaching these is important, I wish that they were a much smaller portion of the course.  This was an intro course and I had never taken any ecology classes before. We did one lecture on a review of biomes and that was all the review/basic ecology taught.  The class should focus less on models and more on qualitative and interesting aspects of ecology. ",
            "\u00a0I quite enjoyed general ecology, and felt that the mathematical approach to ecological theory was appropriate and typically not excessive. Professor Vasseur's lecture were organized, well-paced, and enjoyable, and he presented quantitative material better than any other professor I've had here. There was a strong arc to the course that connected all of the material in a way that made sense. The workload was generally manageable, and the exams were challenging but not insane. The bird lab was a bit of a joke and could have been designed much better, but other than that, this was a day-to-day enjoyable course that I got a lot out of. ",
            "\u00a0Too much math. Prof Vasseur doesn't stop to explain maths, and he claims the course is introductory. Teach simpler maths if it's meant to be an intro course, or if it isn't do not claim it is! Sometimes, the way non-white people were depicted in this course was orientalizing. ",
            "\u00a0This class was very applicable to the real world and much of the material built on previous material. What I disliked about this class, but is just a given with ecology nowadays is that most models really aren't great models of real-life so it's sometimes hard to make sense of things. ",
            "\u00a0Very math heavy, much more than I thought it'd be. A lot of hard concepts and the grading could seem extremely arbitrary. Tests are hard and I get that it's important to push students, but sometimes it felt like we were going from step A to Z and skipping literally every step in between. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were great and pretty engaging. I think the grading system is a little weird -- even though there were a bunch of assignments for the class, I wish there had been even more because it feels like my grade hinges on a couple of big assignments. ",
            "\u00a0The course was interesting, and lecture was relatively engaging. Professor Vasseur was an able lecturer and presented material in a way that was understandable. The avian niche ecology assignment seemed pretty unconnected to what we were doing in class in its scope (it asked us for statistical analysis that we never learned about in class). Early in in the course we were also expected to use R, and there was no preparation in that area, so the first section assignment was a major challenge. ",
            "\u00a0This course was strong for the following reasons: interesting and engaging lectures, challenging material, a diverse array of assignments including problem sets and papers, hands on data analysis with the bird lab.\r\nThis course had the following weaknesses: section did not relate very clearly to what we were learning, we could have had more practice problems in preparation for the midterms and finals. ",
            "\u00a0While this course was instructed fairly well in lectures I felt the overall structure of the course was not well done. Considering the weight they had in grading, problem sets felt vague at times, leading to possible misunderstandings. And I never felt comfortable approaching our TA's for help because while knowledgeable, they did not seem the best at fulfilling a TA's role in helping the students. Because of this I felt much of the writing for papers and what not I was left to learn and execute on my own. The class was interesting, and I really loved the guest lecturers talking about specific aspects of their research, I just feel more assistance outside of class would be helpful. And while I am aware part of the problem lies on me not seeking it, but I never really felt comfortable doing so. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course did a really good job introducing what ecological research looks like and how important discoveries in ecology are made. I think the course could benefit from 1-2 additional (easy) problem sets to give us practice in analyzing models. I would really have liked one lecture tying all the different populations models together (e.g. logistic growth, Lotka-vVlterra models, metapopulations, etc.) and summarizing what models can be used in what situations/combinations. I particularly enjoyed the latter 3rd of the course related to trophic cascades and environmental change as well as the guest lectures. I also liked the more mathematical foundation of the course. ",
            "\u00a0This course is strong in that we learned a lot about ecology and it seemed to cover a broad range of important topics. However, it sometimes felt disorganized. ",
            "\u00a0This class covers a lot of different topics and does so pretty well for the most part. Additionally, Professor Vasseur is an excellent lecturer.  However, I do have a few complaints. First of all the first lab report did not connect well with the material covered in class and seemed to be too long of an assignment for the amount learned. It would have been better to have had another Pset instead of that lab report, especially because the quantitative aspects of the course require more practice than the psets allow. Additionally, the discussion section needs to better support the class; little information could be gained from section, and I often questioned if the. Purse needed a section at all. ",
            "\u00a0The course should be advertised with a heavy focussed on math. I'm not strong in math and so I would have taken another course in its place. ",
            "\u00a0Having so many different types of assignments made this course very difficult and was not conducive to learning the material. We had problem sets, midterms + final, a lab report, and what was essentially an essay since it was a lab report but analyzing multiple other scientific reports. We were given very inadequate help preparing for each assessment. The problem sets were supposed be good practice for the exams, but they were so challenging and seemed to be so unrelated to our lecture material that I felt unprepared for the midterms. The TAs were very nice and clearly did research related to ecology, but neither of them seemed too well prepared to help us succeed on our assessments. This class just felt much more difficult than it should have been, particularly as a (and compared to other EVST) core requirements. Professor Vasseur was captivating, and I actually did find the lectures interesting, but the structure of this class really needs to be re-examined. ",
            "\u00a0I really loved this class. I thought that Dr. Vasseur did a fantastic job explaining the processes and the ways that they were translated into models. He was very careful to explain underlying mechanisms and not simply present the models in a vacuum. I thought the biggest strength of this course came at the end, when we broadened our view to consider whole-scale global patterns and issues that we are facing today in conservation. The guest lectures about ongoing research was interesting and was a chance to apply what we had learned previously in the course. Moreover, I felt that all of the assignments were purposeful and practical and the tests did an excellent job of testing the material. ",
            "\u00a0Not as quantitatively heavy as one would expect it to be. Examinations throughout the semester are structured well. ",
            "\u00a0I felt three lectures a week was excessive. Two lectures would have gotten the same information across and not required us to have class on Friday. Additionally, I wish there were more practice/applied problems in class using the mathematical models and equations we had learned/assigned homework problems due for submission. In all, it was a good class and the lectures were interesting. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This class sucks, but you'll have to take it if you're EVST or EEB - a real shame in my opinion.  Vasseur is a really nice guy, but the class is horrible and revolves around modeling populations in predator-prey and competition situations, which is super boring and needlessly complex.  I had a bad TF as well.  I think 2/3 of the people originally in the class dropped it before the end of October.  There were like 12 people left at lectures by the end of the semester.  There isn't any point in my writing this because nobody outside of EVST/EEB will ever take this class, but just know not to take this during a semester with other difficult/boring classes.  You'll have a bad time if you do. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to others who are genuinely interested in E&EB or environmental studies (those searching for a science credit should look elsewhere). The overview this course provides comes in handy in many future courses in these subjects, and it's also quite fun and interesting in its own right. The material is a bit on the challenging side but overall remains quite enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0If you are an EVST major, do not take it. Talk to the DUS and find another course that will cover your requirements. ",
            "\u00a0I mean I assume if you're taking this you have to. If not, then I would make sure you're really interested in working with models because it is very much skewed towards that. Also, get ready for arbitrary grading ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in ecology, take it! But beware it isn't all about fun animals and cool stuff (though there is a fair bit of that). ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would recommend this course.  It is not a gut! This course is challenging (though certainly not impossible), and as such is very rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if General Ecology fulfills a requirement you have. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class! It is a super interesting introduction to ecology - be aware however that the class is much more challenging/mathematical than one would expect. Be willing to invest a significant amount of time trying to understand models introduced in the lecture and reviewing lecture notes. ",
            "\u00a0I would probably not recommend this course unless necessary. E&EB is not my major and I found this course extremely challenging and not very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to another student unless the course structure was changed. However, I would recommend Professor Vasseur as a lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0I would not reccomend this course because there was an inadequate resources for one to fully meet the desired expectations each task. Particularly there was little guidance as to what qualified as an acceptable first lab report. The course could provide more guidance to ensure students know what is expected for final pieces of work. ",
            "\u00a0Obviously, if you need to take this for EVST or an equivalent major, then take it, you'll get through, but I did not enjoy this course nor did I think it added to my EVST knowledge since i felt i knew much bout it already from AP Environmental Science expect for the mathematical models. It was lots more math than anticipated, and even though Professor Vasseur said it would be less math intense than last time he thought this, it was way more than expected. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. This was my favorite class that I took this semester. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a great overview of ecological concepts!  The lectures were all super interesting and the lab reports were fun and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0If you're an E&EB major, you have to take this class. Yay! It's on the milder side for introductory lectures, and actually fairly interesting, even if ecology isn't your cup of tea. The psets are easy, the midterms are fair, the lab reports are difficult. "
