            "\u00a0Strengths: great professor, interesting content\r\nWeaknesses: p-sets, preparing for exams\r\nThe p-sets required a deep understanding of Stata, something that all students lacked (but I understand that this was Professor Jensen's first Yale College course and that he may have overestimated our background knowledge).\r\nMoreover, the exams were reasonable, but since there are no required readings, you either had the material to study for in your notes or you couldn't study. Maybe the professor could post a list of all the topics that we went over so that you can make sure you have it covered in your notes. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The problem sets are reasonable and actually enjoyable because you're applying knowledge to real-world situations. Professor Jensen is also a really engaging professor who works hard to help his students understand the material.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This is the first year the class was taught, which meant that the material was kind of all over the place. At times, we did class-long brainstorms/discussions, which made it unclear what was material we needed to know during the midterm and what was simply brain exercises. The midterm also tested a lot of information that we covered very briefly (in these sort of brainstorms), which was pretty frustrating. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: fascinating host of material, awesome prof, lectures were actually very engaging and I liked that there was no textbook because it meant that we actually learned everything we needed to know in class, which was pretty transparent! Lunches with the professor were a lot of fun, and overall it was a lot more enjoyable than a class like this could have been due to the range of anecdotal information provided by the professor, and the relatively low quantitative requirement. \r\nWeaknesses: Very disorganized class - why were there 4 TFs?? Unclear if there even needed to be one TF because section was not mandatory and when we went to get help with the PSets they didn't know the answers and used other students' answers to advise their peers...I think Professor Jensen may have spent a minimal amount of time writing the PSets and there were loads of errors in the way that they were written which led to students wasting a lot of time trying to work out what he actually wanted. Also the exams were straightforward but out of 28 points - they could have been out of 100 points and required us to go into more detail, but instead we have a situation where a 24 is a B or something like that, so it was easy to feel that one's grade was somewhat arbitrary. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the in class lessons were very interesting a substantive.  The psets felt very separate from the rest of the course and could have been more focused on the information we learned in class rather than stata. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly Jensen sent this course into a complete 180 from the catastrophe that it was before.  This was legitimately one of the greatest courses I have ever taken and I came in dreading what it would be given the course ratings of the past.  Strong student engagement, fun energy, very flexible and understanding of student needs.  This course was fantastic, my only nitpicky recommendations being to perhaps dedicate less time to student input and also the P-Sets were rather intense given that almost all of us had very minimal experience with Stata prior. ",
            "\u00a0I was honestly not looking forward to taking this class and had to because it was a requirement for the major. I had heard negative things about the course in the past and was not as interested in development as I was in security. This all changed after taking the class, it was one of my favorite classes at Yale. One weakness was that the problem sets were a bit harder, especially as they heavily relied on previous in-depth experience and knowledge of Stata, which many students did not have. ",
            "\u00a0The information from lecture was not overbearing, which enables you to actually have a comprehensive understanding of it. The exams are written in a very straightforward way that tests what youve actually been taught, and theyre not excessively hard (unlike many Yale exams that make you feel defeated and then are hugely curved). Problem sets were tougher if you are not super familiar with Stata because its not something we went over in class, but Prof Jensen offers a a lot of support and help. ",
            "\u00a0The problem sets were very hard and assumed a knowledge of stata far beyond what most students had. That said I feel much more confident in my applied statistical ability. Professor Jensen is very impressive but I wish the course had slides or materials aside from his handwriting on the board. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Robert Jensen is an absolute gem, so glad Jackson had him teach this course because he turned it from one I thought would be my most hated to definitely one of my favorite classes this semester and maybe all of Yale. He's approachable, funny, explains concepts clearly, and above all is extremely accomplished in his field. You wouldn't think just by being in his class that this man once taught at Wharton. The course introduces interesting concepts you probably never think about when the word development comes up - such as insurance for farmers. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The \"international\" aspect of \"approaches to international development\" does not get dealt with as much. We didn't cover aid or transnational institutions, for example. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course is much too broad. I believe this course would be much stronger if we focused on a few case studies throughout the semester instead of jumping from region to region. ",
            "\u00a0This class is very interesting and the material is timely. The organization is great! ",
            "\u00a0It was fine. I wish he had focused more on case studies of development, had a clearer format for the class, and gave us more feedback on our growth and  room for improvement. ",
            "\u00a0Very cool class! Super neat, and prof jensen obviously cares a lot about it ",
            "\u00a0Very engaging lectures. Perhaps there could be more connections between the problem sets and the lectures. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Jensen is an incredible lecturer, is so knowledgable, did a lot of his own research, and its very clear he cares so much about his students and their success. ",
            "\u00a0The structure of this class is deeply flawed. We are taught about economics of development, a quantitative subject from a quant-focused professor, in a qualitiative way where we are asked to regurgitate answers in list form. To make this class actually worth our term, teach development from a qualitative, anthropological perspective or teach an economics-based, quantitative class for development. This class tries to make everyone happy (both security and development), and it fails at teaching anything as a result ",
            "\u00a0While this course offered a good introduction to some of the key themes of international development economics, I felt it was lacking largely with respect to practical application. The case studies came only in bits and pieces and without the presentations I felt there was not much room for critical thinking about how countries developed or how different contexts might lead to variable outcomes. I feel that more of a focus on tracing histories of either countries or particular development programs would greatly improve this class beyond surveys of concepts. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed professor jensen's lectures and learned so much in class. I think the course structure is generally very good. However, I would suggest providing students with a copy of the notes from class or putting them on a powerpoint because missing something can have very negative repercussions on the exam. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: really interesting unique material\r\n\r\nweaknesses: organization and availability of notes ",
            "\u00a0As an intro class,  I thought it was excellent. No real weaknesses--except that maybe at the beginning, when Professor Jensen would take input from students, it wasn't clear which was \"correct\" and which wasn't. The professor received the feedback around the midterm and corrected for it in the second half.\r\n\r\nProfessor Jensen, a leader in the field, was a strength as he always had insightful answers to questions in class and set up the course to cover the key concepts in development. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed how the course began with an assessment of how to measure poverty, inequality etc. I think this was one of the strongest aspects of the course. I also really enjoyed learning about how insurance, savings and credit markets can help ease poverty. Although I enjoyed all the different components of the course, it felt more like we were examining three different sub-classes rather than a cohesive class where all the chapters come together for one big learning. I would have really liked if there were an overarching theme for the semester. ",
            "\u00a0It was amazing! Perhaps the grading should have been clearer from the beginning of the semester, but that can be easily fixed. ",
            "\u00a0Would have preferred for some of the material to be slightly more substantive. A lot of lectures basically went like \"here's a topic, here's some research, we don't really know if this method for dealing with poverty works or not\". One method might be to make the course more quantitative, much like the beginning of the course. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this class. I think everyone should take this regardless of their major and really did learn a lot. Only weakness was that I felt like at times the class would get off topic and we would end up in a black hole spiral of random subjects, but even that was interesting. ",
            "\u00a0This is an excellent course. Lectures are engaging and organized very well. ",
            "\u00a0This course could have leaned more into the technical elements of Stata, and it could have done more to provide arguments for solutions to poverty rather than discredit today's best guess for how to solve it. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: one of the few lectures I actually want to go to--like would enjoy actually going to\r\nVery well-organized\r\nExams somehow managed to be a good mix of memorization and analysis\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes discussions got too long/drawn out but that got better as semester progressed\r\nsometimes sporadic scheduling (of no fault to the professor)\r\nnot much feedback for improvement on PSETs ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Jensen did great things with this course. He explains things clearly and is always available for extra help ",
            "\u00a0The course consisted of interesting, useful material, but more adherence or better explicit connection to a syllabus would have enhanced the learning experience. ",
            "\u00a0The material was great, and Prof Jensen is great. I wish there would have been more assignments so that the class didnt depend on so few grades. I also wish there was a little more organization to the class. ",
            "\u00a0I think one test should have been replaced by an essay ",
            "\u00a0I appreciate that the content was really interesting. Professor Jensen knows his material very well and has lots of field experience to share with his students. I do wish there was more feedback on student performance throughout the course. The course itself was great but it was hard to know how you were doing grades-wise because the only grades we actually got were from the problem sets. I also wish that there was a little more STATA preparation for the problem sets. I got the feeling that people understood the problems conceptually, but struggled to actually do them because they didn't know the right STATA code. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The course covers a large amount of material without requiring large amounts of reading. The lectures are interesting, engaging, and informative. The course builds a solid understanding of the basics of economic development. The course is also well-tailored to those with both more and less econometrics/statistics knowledge. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Because so many theories were raised and then disproved, sometimes it was difficult to distinguish between what actually was supported by evidence, and what had been disproved. ",
            "\u00a0Prof Jensen was excellent, one of the best at Yale. The major drawback was jsut how slow the class went sometimes, to the point where it wasn't worth paying attention. that and the psets. End the psets. They are dumb, have nothing to do with the class content, and don't teach you anything. In general, @Global, you can't expect students to know stata after one semester of AQA, and we certainly aren't gonna learn more through 3 psets in an unrelated class. Either make a seperate Stata class (a la stats 230 for R), just let students learn R instead, or let Stata go completely. Anyway this class is great though. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Jensen was pretty good overall, but the course material often felt detached from the realities of work in the field. Development in general tends to reduce everything to economic terms, which was frustrating at times throughout the course. Also, discussions often went long with students brainstorming possible explanations for empirical phenomena for half the class at times with little resolution or definitive answer from the instructor by the end. This sometimes put us behind in the syllabus and left students more confused than satisfied. "

            "\u00a0Yes!!! I learned so much and the workload was average. This course had such a bad reputation when it was taught by other professors, but they've finally found the right one -- Professor Jensen is fabulous! He really cares about his students and wants us to all succeed.\r\nMoreover, this class addressed many topics outside the traditional purview of an economics course (e.g. gender, female empowerment, and nutrition). I would recommend this class to non-Global majors too! ",
            "\u00a0If this course becomes more well-organized and you're interested in working in development, yes. Otherwise, probably not unless you're a Global major and need this as the requirement. The first year probably wasn't the best to take it, but Jensen is a great professor and does interesting work. ",
            "\u00a0This has the potential to be a truly fantastic class. I was a Global Affairs snake who used to be interested only in ruling the world and not curing world poverty, so I figured that this course would be hugely boring - not only would the quantitative side be dry and difficult, but the qualitative material would be dull and dithering. NOT AT ALL - Professor Jensen revealed the ways that development policy can have very tangible effects on welfare, and the theories underlying initiatives to solve inequality are beautiful in their own right. I had always figured that international development was ineffective, and that only people in positions of power could make a different on poverty around the world, but the level of detail that Professor Jensen went into on studies throughout the developing world completely proved me wrong, and he did it in a very fun and engaging manner. I am ready to start looking more into the field of development and completely changing my mindset around global affairs. The class really could be special if only Professor Jensen spends more time planning it out; it was a little unfair to have students wasting time working out what he wanted when he could have spent a little more time making his instructions clear. This is not to say he did not care about the students - he met with everyone who wanted to see him, and hosted lunches for all the students in the class, so he definitely was committed to the students. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. This course has received bad reviews in the past, but was much better this year because of Professor Jensen. The lectures are interesting, engaging, and informative, and the course builds a solid understanding of the basics of economic development without requiring large amounts of reading. The course is also well-tailored to those with both more and less econometrics/statistics knowledge. The problem sets are time consuming, but Professor Jensen is very willing to help. I really enjoyed this course and learned a lot! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This was, I thought, an excellent class in applied economics. Even if you have no interest in development, a great way to learn about how economic concepts play out in the real world. "
