            "\u00a0I learned quite a bit in this class actually, despite being very challenged by the material. I learned about unions, intersections, mapping, proofs, and quite a bit about Finite State Automata, context-free grammars and Turing machines. This was all new to me pretty much, so I enjoyed learning it, especially the latter half. I just wish I performed better. ",

            "\u00a0I think the strengths of this course are that the professor Robert Frank is pretty engaging and explains things well in office hours and in class. The course textbook was good too. However, there was a lot of information to remember and connect and not understanding one part will mean that you don't understand later parts that build heavily on the previous parts. However, that is to be expected given the type of course. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes it went really fast, but I dont have a background in math. Having the textbook to refer back to was very helpful, as was taking many detailed notes and asking questions in section and office hours. "

            "\u00a0Yes, definitely. Even if they audit. I learned quite a bit and am now interested in finite state automata. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I think the material is useful for anyone. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. For students in linguistics, this really puts things (grammar and language) into a new and interesting perspective. Even though the course is very challenging I would still recommend it. "
