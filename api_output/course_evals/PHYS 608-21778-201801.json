In particular, learning about approximation methods in quantum mechanics also taught me new ways to think of the mechanism of quantum mechanics. ",

            "\u00a0I think it should be removed from the required first-year courses and be offered for quantum-oriented students. Not particularly useful/necessary for some of us. It's ridiculous how much time that we spend on quantum and then how rapidly we have to fly through EM. Sakurai and Napolitano is like a third of the size of Zangwill and yet we spend 1 term on EM and 2 on QM. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The lectures were taught very well, and the homework and exams were well-aligned with each other and with the focal points of the class. Overall, this was the most well-structured and best-taught class I have had in grad school so far.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Every so often, we spent a lot longer on algebra than it seemed like we really needed to. I wish we could have learned more about second quantization. Some homework problems were also very algebra-heavy for seemingly no reason. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were very good, but sometimes got lost in problems that were interesting, but difficult to generalize.\r\n\r\nI was somewhat disappointed that we didn't do corrections to the hydrogen atom (such as fine and hyperfine structure), but recognize that that was probably due to the hydrogen atom not being taught in the previous semester.\r\n\r\nAlso, scattering was not covered in class in the depth needed to do the homework problems. ",

            "\u00a0The course was awesome, almost everything about it is a strength! But maybe it could be improved by having the same instructor teach both QM1 and QM2 so there is no overlap time and we can pick up where we left off better. ",
            "\u00a0The grading policy when it came to homework was counterproductive. With a 50% penalty on late homework, the policy encourages students to turn in incomplete assignments for the sake of turning them in on time instead of taking a few extra days to finish. It discourages us from completing the homework, which negatively impacts learning from the assignments. ",

There were both questions that followed from the material taught in the lecture and questions that required students to learn from external sources in the problem sets.  This also made solving the problem sets a good learning experience. ",

Jack is hands down the best instructor I've had at Yale so far and even though I don't work in a quantum sub-discipline of physics, it has been one of my favorites because it is executed so well. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course (not that it matters, because we are forced to take it regardless). The course was very well-taught, and did not make a lot of assumptions about what we had seen before, which was really helpful. ",
