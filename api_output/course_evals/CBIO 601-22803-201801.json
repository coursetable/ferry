However, there were instances when the duration of the class sessions seemed a quite long and seemed to drag on. I would recommend potentially shortening the class time. I would also like to have more seasoned faculty present. It would be interesting to have one session be on NIH grants and funding and how grants are evaluated with potentially a mock grant review session. "

            "\u00a0With some modifications, I would recommend it. I would perhaps shorten the duration of the course and I would try to increase the amount of dinner with faculty after the presentations. This would allow more students presenters the opportunity to engage with the guest faculty and instructors and would incentivice students with their presentations. "
