            "\u00a0The course is really what one makes of it based on the practicum assignment.\r\nWith regards to the class time, having some stock/frequently encountered problems to discuss might prove useful rather than having the students come up with them. ",
            "\u00a0I think this was a great experience. I really appreciated the opportunity to get hands-on experience and I really liked my practicum preceptor.\r\n\r\nI would like to make a comment about the format of the final presentations. I appreciate the rational behind splitting us into smaller groups, and I think that was a good choice because otherwise we would have had to sit through a lot of presentations, but I wish our examiner, Henry Dove, had been better prepared. He seemed not to understand the structure of the practicum and commented several times that it seemed like a waste if there wasn't a final report, even after we explained that we had written a paper about the experience and made presentations in our practicum settings. He also commented that he wished he had been given the slides in advance, which would have been possible since we submitted the slides two days before the presentation. If he had had the slides in advance, that might have made the process go more smoothly. Several times he interrupted the presenters to make comments or ask questions that he should have known the answer to based on the presentation. I felt like it detracted from my experience of my peers presenting. I did enjoy hearing about what my peers had done during the practicum. ",

            "\u00a0Excellent program. Loved the YNHH - Office of Strategy and Management. My preceptors really cared and wanted to show me everything possible.  I felt bad because of the 1 day a week commitment, doesn't allow for continuous work on a particular project as one would hope.  It may be just the natural limitation. ",
            "\u00a0The success of this course depends on the practicum placement organization and preceptor. Some placements are extremely well organized and have hosted many students so their system is seamless. Others are hosting students on the fly which makes for a challenging experience. ",

My practicum was with YCOS and it was very structured, but we also had less of an opportunity to work independently or direct the project because we were joining an existing department. I think there were pros and cons, and while I think this was a great choice for me, it is good for future students to be aware of that fact. ",
