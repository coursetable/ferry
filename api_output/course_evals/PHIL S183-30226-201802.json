            "\u00a0I developed my reading and writing skills through taking this course. I learned to write papers for philosophy, and by doing so, also improved my ability to think. With regards to my reading skills, I read many challenging works, which improved my comprehension abilities. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about several classical and contemporary philosophical theories and their applications to new moral dilemmas arising from recent technological developments. I also learned how to write a good philosophy paper. ",
            "\u00a0As I have never taken a course in Philosophy before, I have gained many insights in terms of philosophical thoughts and ethic debates. ",
            "\u00a0The most important of the skills that I developed in this course is of successfully making arguments to establish my claim. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a deeper understanding of the philosophical tools used to determine the morality and admissibility of different technologies. I greatly improved my understanding of contemporary debates with respect to AI, autonomous vehicles, geoengineering, privacy and data usage, and even art. ",
            "\u00a0My critical essay writing skills certainly improved. General knowledge of the philosophical issues increased substantially, though I had discussed some before. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: discussions, essay prep\r\nWeaknesses: too little time ",
            "\u00a0One weakness of the course was the fact that the philosophical theories that were seen in the readings were only briefly explained during the class. It would have been nice to gain a better understanding of the theories.\r\nAlso, there was a fairly large difference in abilities of the students, with some Yale students and some high school students. As a high school student, I felt that I was not able to contribute as much to the class since it was more difficult for me to fully comprehend the readings. However, it served as a good challenge for me.\r\n\r\nOne strength of the course was that the topics discussed were interesting and relevant to our lives. \r\nAlso, the seminar aspect of the class allowed me to hear the opinions of other students with regard to the reading material. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Rich class discussions; interesting readings; edifying assignments; great advice on writing; brilliant professor.\r\nWeaknesses: None. ",
            "\u00a0I believe this course fits pretty well students with prior knowledge in Philosophy and very good communicating skills. For them, a full-time discussion course will definitely be exceptionally rewarding.\r\nHowever, as for me, I oftentimes find myself confused in the course of the discussion. I think if the instructor could lecture more and teach us some basic knowledge in Philosophy more systematically, I will be able to grasp the material better and possbily faster. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is that the course discusses a wide variety of topics in ethics and provides a clear overview of these. The biggest weakness is that it lacks a clear system of concepts, about how concepts and arguments in ethical theories are put forward in this way and how they interact with other concepts. ",
            "\u00a0This course was fascinating and entertaining. Professor Daniel Moerner fostered an excellent environment for respectful and interesting discussion. Students were able to safely bring up new ideas and debate different viewpoints. By the end of the semester, every class period was filled with laughter and it was clear that everyone felt engaged with the material and with each other. It was clear that the material was thought-provoking as students left class still conversing about the ideas brought up in it. Although philosophical discussions tend to be jargon-laden, this class ensured that the technobabble was kept to a minimum.\r\n\r\nThis was a summer class, which comes naturally with a few weaknesses. Class periods were three hours long, which can be tedious no matter how enthralling the discussion is. This could be improved by longer breaks to stretch or walk around, or even class in the courtyard for a nice change of scenery. Also, for an every-other-day meeting patterning, there was a lot of reading to do. The class covered such a wide variety of topics that it felt \"a mile wide and inch deep\" at times. \r\n\r\nThat being said, this was a fantastic introduction to philosophy for anyone who does not have a philosophical background.  Daniel provided helpful instruction about how to write a philosophy paper, and I left class feeling confident that my abilities have improved and that time is well spent. Daniel is also a very fair grader, and will help you to work through any problems that you initially have so that by the end of the course you are guaranteed to succeed. ",
            "\u00a0It addresses a wide range of issues, but in sufficient depth that nothing felt underdeveloped. The intensity of classroom debate was especially beneficial. ",
            "\u00a0I am not a good writer for paper. I can not express myself in a way that everyone can understand easily. Also, I sometimes make many technical mistakes when writing due to a lack of experience. But I find myself enjoy learning philosophy and that I sometimes have good ideas. ",
            "\u00a0It could use more paper workshops. I know that was hard to incorporate due to the short time we had for the course, but it would have been helpful.\r\nI enjoyed all of our readings. "

        [
            "\u00a0Yes, if the student was interested in either philosophy or technology. If not, no. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I would say that some of the readings are quite difficult, but that it is definitely worth it. They are interesting, and the class allows you to develop ideas about the world, and about certain technological dilemmas facing the world. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. It's interesting, challenging, and engaging. It serves as a great introductory philosophy class, though I imagine philosophy majors will also learn a lot from it because much of the content is very unique to new technology. I emerge from the class more informed about the world around me, and I feel intellectually equipped to approach the novel philosophical questions that my generation will encounter. I also learned a great deal about making good arguments, and I have so much more confidence in communicating my ideas to others via both text and speech. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students who are interested in Philosophy and probably good at making philosophical arguments. However, if they are not really good at drawing logical argument from a relatively subjective subject, I will make sure they consider thoroughly about what they could gain from taking this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes because the instructor has a clear teaching plan and would adjust the plan according to progress. The instructor has a perfect way of explaining complicated concepts and gives extremely helpful feedback. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I would recommend this course. This is an excellent introduction to philosophy and philosophical writing. You will be introduced to a wide variety of different ideologies, all of which have real-world application. I admit that I felt a bit contemptuous of philosophy before taking this course. To me, philosophy seemed magniloquent and unserviceable to concrete issues. This class, on the other hand, was very down to earth. It put philosophy in the context of contemporary issues and made it relevant and interesting. Grading was fair and allowed for correction if any mistakes were made initially, so don't worry if you have no previous knowledge of how to write a philosophy paper. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is approachable to people without philosophical knowledge but still interesting for those with experience. ",
            "\u00a0Yes.The course is interesting and eye-opening ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's good even for students without prior knowledge of philosophy. (I had no philosophy background and was still able to fully participate in class discussions.) The reading was a lot heavier than what I was used to from high school, but I adjusted to it quickly. "
