            "\u00a0In this class, I learned a lot about how to properly work in a lab setting. Specifically, organic chemistry lab techniques, such as filtration, IR spectra, and extraction, were incredibly useful to learn, as I am planning to take the second half of organic chemistry in the fall. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of practical skills and even life skills through this course. I am extremely impressed at how well I was taught in this course during such a short period of time. ",

The requirement to write experimental plans ensures that students know what they are doing and why throughout the experiment.\r\nWeaknesses: The number of formatting requirements for all assignments and especially for lab notes can detract from productivity. ",
            "\u00a0Fantastic all around. No complaints whatsoever. ",

The experiments are interesting. Expectations for submitted work are made clear, and the grading is fair. The formatting requirements for all submitted work can be annoying, but the assignments themselves are straightforward. ",

Also, it did not feel as intensely compressed as the orgo lecture. The pace was very comfortable. I would definitely recommend it to students who have to take orgo. ",
