            "\u00a0My writing skills developed through our daily responses and the multiple drafts of our final paper. I gained exposure to new forms of dance and filmmaking that I would not necessarily have seen otherwise. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to analyze texts and experimented with college-level writing. I also experienced what seminar-style classes are like at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I feel like I improved my writing skills as well as my ability to analysis and understand film and especially movement on film. I feel like I have a whole new understanding of movement and the intelligence and skill behind said movement. ",
            "\u00a0I developed skills to watch, analyze, interpret, and create dance films of all genres and aesthetics. I learned how dance and film have both fundamentally influenced society and humans' perceptions of themselves and their world, especially in the media-saturated age that we now live in. I have seen how these two mediums are constantly being re-defined and challenged, and how they are used in connection with other areas such as politics, psychology, sociology, and physics. In addition to the intellectual exploration, I gained practical skills through the movement exercises and choreographic strategies, as well as the hands-on film projects. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me incredibly deep insight into a unique intersection of culture, and the broad reach of our topics helped to carry that narrative through several decades. I came away feeling highly educated on a topic that I never really approached before, and already that newly picked up information has been relevant outside of the classroom. I also feel as though my analytical writing improved greatly, due in no small part to the helpful feedback I got, as well as my eye for cinematography. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a greater understanding of the relationship that exists between movement and the camera, as well as a comprehensive look into the history of dance portrayed on film. I developed a greater critical mindset when viewing, discussing, and participating in filmed dance. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to view films and make films in cinematic ways. "

        [
            "\u00a0The course is well organized through history. The readings are interesting but at times, a little long for the next class. I also wish we had more experience developing our own dancefilms, as that part of the course was very fun and I learned a lot through hands-on challenges. ",
            "\u00a0The content of this course was very interesting. I found it to be engaging to read about and talk about. Because I have never had any experience with dance theory, some of the concepts that the course is based on were not as heavily discussed and defined as I would have liked, but overall, I found the content to be understandable. ",
            "\u00a0I feel like the strongest part of this class was the interaction between theory and practicing these theory. I felt most engage during the discussion of the artist theorist and during the hands on assignments and movement. I feel like the theory could even be more clearly applied to the hands on assignments. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are the small, intimate class size and the wide array of fascinating and well-curated material. Professor Coates is a kind and engaging professor who brought expertise through both her knowledge and lived experience in the dance industry. Another strength of the course was the hands-on element, which included interesting movement exercises at the beginning of each class and film workshops with talented filmmaker Alla Kovgan. A weakness of this course is that so much of the grade depends on the essays and there could be more training in the writing aspect of the course. ",
            "\u00a0This course was fascinating in the way that it blended two unique subjects and had a theme running from beginning to end. The readings and videos we watched were all very strong, and I loved learning about the various choreographers, dancers, and directors we came across as a class. My only wish was that there had been one more medium sized writing project somewhere during the year, which perhaps could have come in place of a few of the weekly responses. Other than that, I thought the class was very well structured! ",
            "\u00a0The course gives students a very comprehensive study of dance on film and covers a lot of material. The movement laboratories were very helpful in creating a context for students to think about dance not just in theory but physically, and the film studies gives students hands-on experience which really creates a more fulfilling course. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to the right student. It is very demanding, and so if you are not passionate about the material, it might not be worth it. You should like what you are doing if you are spending that much time working on it. It is also a nice, small class to take during your first semester at Yale. It is a unique experience to be in such an intimate class with a very accomplished professor right when you arrive on campus. ",
            "\u00a0This a cool course to take. It explores a pretty niche area of humanities that most people likely do not realize even has its own realm of theory. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly highly recommend this class to anyone interested in film.  It is extremely hands on and allows for a greater understanding of how movement interacts on film. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student. This course challenged me to think about the media I consume more creatively and consciously. It allowed me to dive deep into two mediums, dance and film, which I had always enjoyed but never studied before in an academic context. After studying them, I have a much deeper appreciation for the history of both mediums and their role in pushing each other to expand and innovate. In addition, I have a better understanding of the role of art as a tool of experimentation and exploration in conceptualizing important ideas and relationships. This course will change the way you think about how film and dance can affect humans' experiences of their world and society. I always looked forward to going to class for the interesting exercises and fascinating discussions. ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course to somebody with a vested interest in either dance or film, but would probably suggest those who do not find either subject interesting to steer clear given the nature of a majority of the work. I would also warn those not willing to experiment with movement in class to find something else, even though I found that to be one of the most engaging and useful elements. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, even if the student has no background in film or dance this course is an amazing option. Unlike other courses, this class provides a wonderful outlet for students that is stimulating both creatively and intellectually. Very few courses offer the same in-depth study of this subject matter with a professor that is both enthusiastic and very well-suited to teach the class. Each student leaves the course with a much greater understanding of the subject and a personally crafted dance film. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely, its a good class for anyone to take especially since it offers either a writing or humanities credit and it doesnt require a lot of writing (only 2 papers). Its also an interesting course topic. "
