I wish the course could be a little more organized. The files on Canvas are not labeled well and it is difficult to find readings or presentations. ",

Guest speakers from different field provide a broad perspective of how to approach similar issues with different solutions.\r\nWeakness: the content is not solid knowledge or not technical enough. Assignment is a systematic review, but we are not really taught how to perform meta-analysis in order to write a proper one. This systematic review is more like a review article, with some logic inside. Course materials need up-to-date statistics, because the data seems not fresh. ",

The systematic review was the course's greatest strength in my opinion. I appreciate that I walk away from the course with a tangible work product and new skill set. My only criticism is that assignment expectations were usually unclear, and I think a rubric would have been useful. ",

A strength is that we had wide range of guest lecturers who offered really unique perspectives on obesity that helped me clarify my own opinions and approaches to the disease. I quite liked the class structure, although sometimes the number of students made it difficult to have discussion structured into the class. ",

It was really helpful as I had not ever written a systematic review before.

The instructor brings speakers from different areas working on obesity so we can gain knowledge on how obesity is treated in different settings (i.e. surgery, pharmaceuticals). The class reveals lots of misconceptions on obesity prevalence, nutrition, and physical activity, etc. The systematic review was a great practice on technical writing, and the presentations based on the reviews were informative and was a great learning experience. ",
            "\u00a0This was such a great comprehensive review of approaches to the prevention and treatment of overweight and obesity in the US! Dr. Irwin is such an awesome instructor who keeps it real, and the experts she brought in for guest lectures enriched our learning experience. One of the best parts of the experience was the diversity of students, ranging from MPH to MS to AP and more. I thought I knew a fair share about how to get people to eat better and exercise more, but this course expanded my frontier of knowledge in this area multi-fold. The experience of writing a systematic review was also great, both for people who had never written one before and for the seasoned folks who might actually be able to publish their final product! ",

She was helpful in spending the time with me to help determine a topic for my systematic review and provided useful feedback. I thought that the course material was relevant to the course topic. I think that linking the reading a little closer to the course lectures may be helpful, but independently I thought that the reading was useful in and of itself. ",

            "\u00a0Dr. Irwin is very accessible and more than fair when it comes to grading. I appreciate her passion for the field she works in and her genuine interest in discussion points brought up by students. The only weakness I can think of is that when guest speakers come, her questions are very polite, and I think she let the guest speakers off a little too easily-- for example, the claim by the bariatric surgeon that New Haven does not have a food desert went unquestioned. I think we could have had a really interesting debate on this point, but instead we went back to revisiting different types of surgical methods. ",

She is a good story teller while she is lecturing, and she is also a good listener. She pays attention on the presentations from the speakers and student presentations. She positively takes the ideas from students during class. You can stop by her office whenever you want (if she's there), and receive encouragements and feedbacks from her. She is always enthusiastic! ",

I would recommend it as a course for one interested in learning about obesity, and also interested in potentially developing a systematic review manuscript for publication. ",

We learned everything from gastric bypass surgery to pharmaceutical interventions to policy initiatives for tackling obesity. The systematic review, while perhaps daunting as a whole, was divided into a series of individual assignments and gave the opportunity to learn how to conduct and write up a systematic review from beginning to end. ",

The major deliverable (a literature review) was a good opportunity to build practical skills while researching a topic of interest relevant to the class, and getting feedback on that review from an expert in the field was invaluable. I would recommend it. ",

Obesity is such an epidemic and we all should know something about it. The lifestyle interventions will not only be helpful in obesity intervention, but also other chronic disease. In addition to academic development, this class can make an impact on healthier personal behaviors. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, this is great for anyone with an interest in learning more about the interventions, research and prevention efforts in the realm of obesity. Such a pressing issue and such a great course to be exposed to a broad range of approaches. We wrote two editorials and a systematic review in chunks, so the workload was engaging and manageable. Dr. Irwin is great about providing timely feedback! Overall, would recommend! ",
