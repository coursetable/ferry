            "\u00a0MATH 350 is worth taking. It requires time, but it is the most well-taught math class I have taken at Yale. I had taken MATH 235 earlier and I fully understood what I had done in 235, because I took 350. I got a better understanding of group theory and ring theory. This was the class where I learned how to approach and write proofs. I also learned a lot from my peers by listening to their questions in class and discussing problems with them. ",
            "\u00a0This is a survey of topics in abstract algebra.  The first two-thirds or so of the course is group theory, and the last third is a whirlwind tour of ring theory and other commutative algebra. ",
            "\u00a0I learned basic group/ring theory. ",
            "\u00a0In addition to learning the basics of abstract algebra, I also developed an understanding of and intuition for proof methods in algebra and developed an appreciation for the beauty of the subject. ",
            "\u00a0This course has an absurd amount of content, but a lot of it relates back to elementary school \"facts,\" except with rigorous proof this time around. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about algebra, especially group theory. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a truly prodigious amount of math this semester. MATH 350 covered the basics of group theory and ring theory in an engaging and effective way. I also gained a lot of practice with proof-writing through completing problem sets. I also chose to learn LaTeX in order to typeset my problem sets for MATH 350, which is a useful skill to have. Beyond the classroom, Professor Auel offered me insights into what my future in math might look like. ",
            "\u00a0350 deals with abstract objects and structures that are the generalizations of things we've been dealing with for most of our lives (integers, reals, primes, polynomials). On top of that, a bunch of new examples are thrown in, including the quaternions and Gaussian integers. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a deeper understanding of abstract algebra and the tools need to further study the area. More specifically I gained a thought process to solve problems related to Set, Group, and Ring theory. ",
            "\u00a0I learned quite a bit of abstract algebra!!!! I also definitely improved at writing proofs and constructing arguments because the content of the class was so axiomatic. This is definitely the most elegant area of mathematics I've ever been exposed to and I gained a lot of insight into what the world of algebra looks like. ",
            "\u00a0I have never learned so much material in one course. We went through Group theory, Ring theory, modular computation, and fields, each in excrutiating detail. I feel like my brain is still on fire. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about groups, rings, and fields; I also learned how to manage my time effectively and to ask for help when I was struggling. ",
            "\u00a0I think this is the first serious college math course I've taken. I've learnt the art of writing proofs, of structuring my logic and thoughts and of managing my time. I've learned to incorporate mathematical inquiry into my daily life by literally thinking about math problems at all times, especially during boring CS lectures. In all seriousness, I felt like a reborn person with new ways of looking at numbers and algebra after taking this course. ",
            "\u00a0SO MUCH!! I learned about abstract algebra ",
            "\u00a0Abstract Algebra will most definitely test your work ethic, but you will gain many skills along the way. The problem sets are a great way to improve your proof writing, both Asher and Dummit and Foote split up proofs into logical parts to help you along the way. Also, abstract algebra is just a necessary course for so many fields of mathematics, I do not see how any high level math student can get away with not taking it. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about groups and rings, and understand them at a deep and fundamental level. I also developed my mathematical intuition and proof writing ability. ",
            "\u00a0In elementary and high school, we were taught an assortment of number systems: the integers, the rational numbers, the real numbers, and the complex numbers. I always wondered what was special about these number systems, and why we used them. In Abstract Algebra, I learned about an assortment of different number systems, and how to classify them into different types of groups, rings, and fields. I learned what features belong to some but not others. For example, the integers are an additive group but not a multiplicative group; and the real numbers have both additive and multiplicative inverses (except for zero) and are a field. After taking the class, I feel that I have a better understanding of number systems in general, and I also got to see some of the math underlying linear algebra. Finally, I learned Latex, and I am much better at thinking and writing like a mathematician. ",
            "\u00a0Improved my ability to work with groups, and rings, and to study math on my own. There's just so much material to abstract algebra that I spent so much time just learning all these different definitions to even know what a problem set question is asking. This was very different from past math classes. ",
            "\u00a0You will develop strong proof-writing skills if you didn't already have them, and learn more than you ever imagined you'd know about group theory (which is a good thing). ",
            "\u00a0This is a survey course in abstract algebra. Theoretically, the first half is supposed to be group theory and the second half is supposed to be ring theory, but it's more like the big steak is group theory and then ring theory is a light dessert. ",
            "\u00a0Very solid introduction to abstract algebra. My brain feels just as crammed with insane amounts of algebraic stuff as I would have expected. Algebra deals with a whole lot of structure, so it's not surprising that my perspective and mathematical \"worldview\" went through a lot of refinement going through this class. "

            "\u00a0Prof. Auel is the best math professor I have had in the seven math classes I have taken so far. He is very careful with his statements and the use of terminology, prepares lectures and is the only professor I have encountered in the math department who is able to understand the questions of students from the first time they state them. In some other math classes I have had trouble getting my point across, whereas Prof. Auel understood questions right away. The problem sets are long and I think that if some problem sets have been shorter, particularly number 8, we would have had more time to think about them and understand them. However, Prof. Auel is a great professor. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are very good and engaging. The homework is difficult, but it really makes sure you understand the material. I don't know what weaknesses the course has - I think it's great the way it is. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: teaching, engagement of professor and other students.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: workload. ",
            "\u00a0Very strong course. Maybe a little bit less work would benefit the students - some of the problems on the problem sets don't contribute as much to the students' understanding as much as the time they occupy. ",
            "\u00a0There is just so much content to get through, but it somehow all turned out fine in the end. ",
            "\u00a0This class provides a really comprehensive introduction to algebra. I have learned so much. However, I feel the Psets were still too long even with only starred problems. Some of the problems take a really long time and it sometimes feels like overkill when you fee like you're working on a never-ending Pset. ",
            "\u00a0Well organized: problem sets were useful for getting a handle on the material, the lectures were interesting and fit in well with the reading, and overall the structure of the course felt coherent. ",
            "\u00a0This class is very well-structured and well-taught. Professor Auel is an excellent lecturer who writes good problem sets and fair exams. The content of the course is interesting, and also obviously very important for math majors. The problem sets are very long and time-consuming, but in the end this is beneficial because they ensured that I spent enough time with the material to really understand it. Professor Auel is very helpful during office hours, and the peer tutor Jason Gaitonde was also a great resource. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course: Auel's teaching, the TA, the material. Weaknesses: the last two weeks were super rushed compared with the rest of the course, so pacing at the end could be better. ",
            "\u00a0There are a lot of strengths to the course - the Professor is very well-spoken is great at explaining concepts and providing examples. The work is challenging yet not impossible and the material is very interesting. One weakness I felt was the lack of a TA figure, besides the peer tutor, as well as the sheer number of hours needed to be spent in completing a pset. The workload at the same time made the class cool, but was difficult to keep up with throughout the entirety of a semester. ",
            "\u00a0The problem sets are incredibly time consuming, but definitely a STRENGTH of the course. I gained so much from staring at problems for hours each week and working with friends in trying to solve them. Of course, this is part of the main strength of the course which is Professor Auel, an AMAZING and very organized professor who is a fantastic teacher!! He is very methodical in his teaching and the assignments he gives out, in that the homework was always relevant and expanding upon what we did in class. \r\n\r\nI honestly cannot imagine how the course could be improved. ",
            "\u00a0This course is nothing short of wonderful. The lectures are crystal-clear and build on each other perfectly (slack off, and you'll fall behind in less than half of a week!), the problem sets reinforce necessary information and concepts into you, reand the midterm and final were perfect tests of our understandingtensp with nothing unfair presented in them. Professor Auel has crafted the perfect Intro to Algebra curriculum... ",
            "\u00a0This course taught a ton of material, which was great, but it was concentrated in the last three or so weeks. If we had more time to absorb some of the most difficult topics - such as ideals, PIDs and UFDs, etc. - it would have been really helpful for the final exam. Professor Auel is a very conscientious and engaging professor, but the problems sets are a ton of work (often 30+ hours). 350 required a lot of me and it constantly challenged me. Overall, it's a great class that I'm glad to have taken. ",
            "\u00a0The strength and also weakness of this course was the amount of information taught through the course. It was a strength because in the end, it felt like I really learned a lot, but it was a weakness because each week was very overwhelming. I think it would have been nicer if we could have slowed down somewhat so each concept could really sink in. But I really did take away a lot from this class. ",
            "\u00a0Hardly can I think of any weaknesses of this course. \r\nProf Auel is not only an amazing professor and an excellent teacher, but also, he is literally the nicest person I've ever met. Classes are very well structured and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Asher Auel is absolutely amazing. His lectures are interesting, clear, easy to follow, but also crammed full of information in every minute. This was the only class I did not feel even the slightest urge to look at my phone during class. Asher also made himself super available to his students at office hours, often going over to keep discussing either the homework, random interesting math, or life in general (he also came with us to lunch after a review session for the final). The material was interesting and beautiful, problem sets really helped you engage with the material, you grow close to the people in your class. Tests were very fair. Great course!!!!\r\nWeaknesses: Can't think of much... Class often started and ended 5 minutes later than it was supposed to, so we still got the full 50 minutes but people who had a class afterwards were pretty rushed ",
            "\u00a0Very organized material. Textbook is generally helpful. Professor Auel is fantastic. Peer tutor and other students create a great community. I wish problem sets were shorter as sometimes they feel unnecessary long and much more difficult than any other assesment in the course. ",
            "\u00a0This course really challenges you to think hard with its abstract material and difficult problem sets. It is overall a very rewarding experience and I feel that I have learned a lot. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strengths of Math 350 are the curriculum and the professor. Prof. Auel is a fantastic lecturer, the textbook is good, and the material is really interesting. I honestly cant think of what to take out from the curriculum, and Im loath to ask the professor to go any faster (since the class was already difficult) but in future years I think the class should cover modules, since they give insights into the foundations of linear algebra. Fortunately, Prof. Auel was nice enough to do a bonus class about it. The main thing I would change is to modify the workload a little bit. I dont mind working hard for the class, and I liked having challenging proofs, but I think some of the work was busy work (for example, having to manually verify all of the relations in a field of order 4). Cutting those out would make a huge difference, and honestly would give me more time to learn the concepts. You could always replace them with test your understanding problems similar to the ones on the exams, to see if we really understand the math were doing. ",
            "\u00a0Asher is great. The lectures are great. The psets are long, but it's ok. Basically, it's a lot of work, but if you go into the class knowing that, you'll be ok. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Auel maintains great pacing through classes and always keeps the website organized and up to date with upcoming assignments, office hour schedules, etc. \r\n\r\nI wish he'd post lecture notes, though, since the book gets pretty dense sometimes. Also, he introduces connections to linear algebra, which is great, but these seem catered to people who've taken his Math 225 class prior. It would facilitate learning a lot if he went over some terminology (vector space, characteristic matrix, etc.) before diving in. Finally, I'd retain material much better if he occasionally did a high level overview/refresher of past material, since much of the theory is cumulative. ",
            "\u00a0STRENGTHS: Really challenging and interesting content. Clear and passionate teaching. WEAKNESSES: Problem sets were counterproductively long...I feel like I would have learned more if I didn't have to BS so many proofs due to lack of time. Even the graders couldn't keep up and often let obvious errors in my problem sets slip, so I didn't really learn from my mistakes, known or accidental. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: well, since abstract algebra is definitely something you either want to or have to take as a math major, this class is as good as it's going to get. Asher is, well-known by now, an amazing teacher, and the class is extremely well-structured in literally all aspects, befitting of an algebra class. There is literally no outstanding flaw I can come up with regarding the class' mechanics. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Asher crams quite a lot of material into one semester, and as a result, some of the more abstract stuff that seems super technical and mechanical can be difficult, and since we usually don't have much time to walk through the long-winded motivations for each aspect, a lot of it can end up being tedious. I would say that this is most true for the last part of group theory and the problem vanished for me once we started ring theory. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this to a student who will have time to for this course. It is crucial to read the book and the problem sets take time. I attended Prof. Auel's office hours and the peer tutor's (Jason's) office hours regularly and it was worth it. I understood a lot in this class by asking questions and taking time to think about why a statement was true. ",
            "\u00a0YES!!! Abstract Algebra with Professor Auel has been my favorite class at Yale, hands down! He's an amazing professor and clearly loves what he does. He really cares about all of his students and wants everyone to do well. If you're a math major, you should definitely take this course. If you're not a math major, but are interested in the topic, consider credit/D-ing it, because it will be a LOT of difficult work - however, it's definitely worth doing. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course overall, and I would 100% recommend learning algebra from Professor Auel.  The only problem this year was that we would sometimes get bogged down in lecture and fall behind the syllabus.  This meant that the end of the course was a bit rushed, and we still didn't get to quite everything.  Homework is substantial but not as ridiculously heavy as its reputation would lead you to believe. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in higher level math, you should probably take this. Otherwise, it is probably not worth taking because of the extremely high work load. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely. The subject material is beautiful, even if it is incredibly difficult, and Asher is the best math teacher I've ever had. ",
            "\u00a0If and only if you are a math major. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. It is so interesting to study different mathematical structures rather than the regular old real numbers like I have been used to. There are so many insights to be gained, and it is like exploring a completely new area of mathematics. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class if you're interested in algebra, or mathematics in general. There is a decent amount of work, but I got a lot out of it in return. \r\n\r\nGetting out of (another) class on a Thursday afternoon, grabbing food from the food carts and then heading home to get started on the pset---I always felt uplifted then at the prospect of working on some pleasant math without distraction; and while this mild glow transformed always into a something more frantic/desperate as the evening wore on, the feeling of finally finishing off a last problem whether late at night or even in the morning in the shower always made the nighttime tension worth it. ",
            "\u00a0This is the best math course I've taken at Yale. Professor Auel is absolutely wonderful, and algebra as a field is a lot of fun. It's true that there is a lot of work for MATH 350. The problem sets are really, really long--anywhere from 15 to 30 hours a week of work. But Professor Auel's lectures are AMAZING, he's always willing to answer questions in office hours, and he cares an enormous amount about math undergrads at Yale. The peer tutoring system is also really helpful. And in the end, having such long problem sets ensures that you really learn the material. If you're a math major you probably have to take this, and you should look forward to it. If you're not a math major but you love math and/or Asher Auel, also take this class! It's a good time. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This course was so much fun. Asher is something of a cult hero at this point, and his class is generally very organized. You'll be amazed at how much you can cover. Yes, the workload does get pretty high, especially near the middle of the semester. But it's well worth it, and the tests and grading are pretty fair and you learn so much math. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in exploring the foundations of mathematics, for sure take this course (or at least shop it!)- and take it with Auel if you can! 350 takes familiar objects (matrices, polynomials, and real numbers, for example) and generalizes them to abstract objects (groups, rings, and fields, respectively). It is a ton of work (took me about 8 hours/week of reading and proving things, followed by 4 hours/week of writeup), which is worth keeping in mind if you do decide to take it. With respect to prior background, I took 225 and 250 beforehand, and felt fine about the proof-based nature of the course. ",
            "\u00a0If the student is at all interesting in mathematics or learning more theory and logic, Abstract Algebra provides an amazing step toward that. Throughout the class you are forced to write proofs and formalize arguments and you become great at finding the right argument and putting them down into a coherent proof. If you want a chill semester, don't waste your time. ",
            "\u00a0TAKE THIS COURSE!!! It's such an elegant and exciting of math, and you've probably never had anything like it. Yes, the problem sets are super time consuming, so if you're not really interested in math or proof-based learning, it might not be worth your time. But otherwise, I took away so much and learned some amazing results. The class also develops a really close community (much closer than that of math 230/231) and by the end of it I was so grateful for that. \r\n\r\nEven if you're not a math major, I think this class is worth taking. You derive everything in group theory basically from the ground up, and then venture into rings. I found the entire thing captivating. ",
            "\u00a0You are not considered a mathematics major until you've taken this course. It is a beautiful form of mathematics that we are seldom exposed to earlier than university, and it would be a shame for a mathematics major to miss out on the opportunity to learn it in (dare I say) the best possible environment. Everyone is trying to get through it and pass, and despite being surrounded by some of the smartest mathematics students you won't find harmful competition. The mean on our first midterm was an 89%, and trust me when I say that it wasn't an easy test - the students are just THAT into it. You'll get to know them well when you do problem sets late into Friday morning, and you will develop a great relationship with Professor Auel by going to office hours.\r\n\r\nIF YOU DON'T TAKE THIS COURSE, YOU WILL REGRET IT.\r\n\r\nThat said, be wary what other classes you take this with...this will constitute most of your work each week (15+ hours, at minimum), so don't be like me and take it along with two other QRs and three other electives. Still, the grading is VERY nice - Professor Auel himself recognizes the hard, hard work necessary to take the class and definitely factors that into his grading. ",
            "\u00a0For intended math majors, I would definitely take this class if Professor Auel is teaching. It's a really beautiful variant of math that generalizes and conceptualizes ideas from middle school (we prove the fundamental theorem of arithmetic in the last week). But know that it's a lot of work (more so than even 230/231), and it's more difficult conceptually than 230/231 as well. ",
            "\u00a0If you're willing to work very hard for a large payoff, then I would recommend this course. It takes up a lot of time and effort, but you really learn a lot. Professor Auel is also an amazing instructor and a really nice person to work with. I would definitely take this course under him again. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely recommend! If you are a math major, you'll probably have to take it, but with great pleasure. If you are not a math major, I'd definitely recommend taking it as well for you'll gain some crucial insight into higher level math and really get to enjoy the benefit of a liberal arts education. It's a demanding class, but I promise you'll love the experience and feel intellectually fulfilled when turning in each pset. A friend of mine took this course two years ago, but he loved it so much that he regularly sat in lectures just for fun, and besides the fact he's like a genius, he still remembered a lot of the course material--the enlightenment is real. ",
            "\u00a0If you're a math major, YES YES YES. However, if you're a math major you're probably taking it anyway regardless of my recommendation ",
            "\u00a0It depends. If you are a student whose chief enjoyment is academics, this is the best course I have taken at Yale so far and I couldn't recommend it more. If you are more concerned with work-life balance than anything else, this is not the course for you, though you will be missing out on an exciting learning experience and interesting material! ",
            "\u00a0I recommend taking this class if you are a math major, as abstract algebra is pretty essential. The course is taught very well and it is a worthwhile experience. ",
            "\u00a0Anyone insterested in math should take this course, especially with Asher. ",
            "\u00a0Take it iff you study a mathematicial science ",
            "\u00a0This is a really, really hard course. The stuff you will learn is beyond the realm of normal human understanding, and you won't be able to talk about it to anyone who isn't a mathematician. ",
            "\u00a0Math 350 is a phenomenal class. If you are a math major, this class will not only teach you algebra but also make you a much stronger proof-based mathematician. If you are not a math major but you like math, this class is a bridge from the math that you learn in school to real math that mathematicians do. Prof. Auel is an excellent lecturer and his passion for math is contagious. At the end of the class, even after working hard, we were still excited enough about algebra that we asked him to do a bonus class on modules during reading period (and about 10 people showed up!) I want you to make an informed decision, though, and you should know that while Prof. Auel gives out good grades, that this class is a ton of work. The weekly psets generally take 15-20 hours. You can drop or omit one  if the class doesnt change, I would drop Problem Set 8 (semidirect products), which took 25+ hours. The psets do have a bit of busy work, but mostly they consist of interesting proofs and you will become a much better mathematician if you do them. I do recommend typing them if possible, I learned Latex for this class and it was a good decision. Also, definitely go to peer tutoring sessions! You unfortunately will miss out on our wonderful peer tutor, Jason (who is graduating), but I strongly encourage you to get together and collaborate on the psets. ",
            "\u00a0Ya! I'm not a math major and kind of took this for fun, I got a lot out of the class even in regards to just how I think about math. It's a lot of work though, so be prepared for that. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class with Professor Auel if you can!! I realized after the first few weeks that abstract algebra isn't that interesting for me, and while the book is super dense, Professor Auel does an amazing job of synethesizing material from the book and presenting the core concepts in a more understandable way. He also often pauses to marvel at how some theorem we just proved is \"crazy\" or \"beautiful\" and you can really see how much he loves the material he's teaching! ",
            "\u00a0Would definitely recommend this course but it deserves a wide berth in your schedule. Don't take too many other tough courses simultaneously. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but if you plan on having a life outside of math this semester, you're screwed. ",
            "\u00a0Well, for a lot of you, you have to take it. In some senses, it's the best you can hope for from an intro abstract algebra class. For those excited for algebra, you'll be satisfied as long as you keep up with the work. For those not looking forward to taking abstract, Asher is one of the best people to teach this class, and maybe you'll come out with a bunch of new insights. "
