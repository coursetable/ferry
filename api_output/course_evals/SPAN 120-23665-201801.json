            "\u00a0The level of improvement I saw in my own Spanish-speaking abilities was amazing. I got so much better at it and I really understand the grammar better after this semester. I learned two major grammar structures--the imperfect and the subjunctive. Even though it was a lot of work, I really felt like I learned a lot about the language and some of its literature. ",

            "\u00a0This course, like Spanish L1, is very organized. The day-to-day syllabus is easy to follow and is very helpful. One thing I would say to improve the course is to put estimated times on some of the at-home assignments. There were some times when I would give myself one hour to complete something and it would end up taking three. Having an estimated time would help in preparing students to dedicate the right amount of time to some assignments. ",

I feel that I would have preferred to finish with the textbook, then move onto all the readings as a way to really practice all that was learned and put it all together. ",

            "\u00a0More listening practice should be incorporated. ",
            "\u00a0The textbook for this course was very good. My teacher was also amazing. This course would improve if the structure at the end was changed to incorporate fewer extra activities and more time for content review. ",
