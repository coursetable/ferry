Bu Dinny and Pak Indriyo have both been awesome, interactive teachers. They make the class fun and love having athletes like myself in class. The course could use a bit more structure in terms of its order of taught topics, and clarity over which of these topics will appear on subsequent tests. But overall, the positives of this class surely outweigh the negatives. One of my favorite classes here at Yale. ",
