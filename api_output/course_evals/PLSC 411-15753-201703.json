            "\u00a0This class was exceptionally helpful in teaching insights from classical economics that a normal economics curriculum leaves out. Reading authors like Smith, Ricardo, Marx, and Hayek provided us with rich insights and a different view of how to think of economics and politics. I also learned quite a bit about different development approaches, as well critiques of those approaches. Finally, the writing assignments helped teach students how to engage and critique the seminal readings we were assigned. ",
            "\u00a0I thought very critically about the issues and benefits of both a capitalist free market and a planned economy. We read classical economists towards the beginning of the semester and looked at a historical few examples of both socialist and free market utopias. I changed my thinking a ton throughout the course of the semester, and I have a much better understanding of critiques of capitalism as well as the issues that alternatives to capitalism face. This is an understanding that I have wanted for a long time, and I am extremely glad I could develop it in this class. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a strong understanding of the history of economic thought and development economics. I also improved my writing and analytical abilities, particularly when critiquing different economic papers and works. ",
            "\u00a0Through this course, I developed a diverse vocabulary and toolset that has helped me analyze market- and state-led approaches to development. "

        [
            "\u00a0The strengths were definitely the readings, which provided multiple viewpoints on markets and socialism, allowing students to come to critical and sensible conclusions through their own thoughts and great class discussions.\r\n\r\nI think the course could be improved by introducing a possible research project which would allow students to delve into one subject more deeply. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Excellent teaching, fun and engaging classroom dynamics, appropriate and well-chosen readings, as well as very interesting content.\r\n\r\nWeakness: I wish we covered Milton Friedman and monetary policy more in depth. ",
            "\u00a0This class was one of the best that I've taken at Yale. What really distinguished it to me is the exemplary way that it balanced different disciplinary approaches. There is an excellent mix of economics, sociology, anthropology, and political science, and Professor Nattrass manages to weave all these different fields together in a cohesive way, allowing each of them to produce subtle and insightful critiques of the others. This element of the course helped me build a vocabulary and toolset that has allowed me to better articulate my own doubts and critiques of development models. The course was also made much better by its small size. "

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course. It gives students insight into approaches to economics that are left out of traditional curricula. Any EPE, Economics, or Political Science student should be reading writers like Smith, Ricardo, Marx, and Hayek in their original text. This class provides a way to do that. Students will be exposed to fundamental arguments in favor for and against capitalism, critiques of development, and mixing of politics and economics. Overall, this is an interdisciplinary and highly stimulating course. Would recommend, however, that there be more lecture and less student-led discussion at the beginning of seminars. ",
            "\u00a0Perhaps the most valuable class I've taken at Yale! This class was the first opportunity I had to grapple with the question of how to run an economy and examine the historical examples of free market capitalism and socialist planning in a rigorous academic setting. That said, the readings were not too long at all, and the workload was very light: four reading response-type papers and two five page papers for the whole semester.\r\n\r\nIt is definitely disappointing to me that I hadn't had the opportunity to explore the questions posed in this class earlier, but I guess it shouldn't be that surprising given the hegemony of the neoliberal assertion that \"there is no alternative.\" On a campus pervaded by a religious faith in the free market broken up by pockets of abstract anti-capitalism, this class provides a much-needed dose of history, reality, and critical thought. Everyone at Yale should take this if they have the chance. This class's subject matter is absolutely fundamental to the future of our world. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely would, as long as Professor Nattrass is teaching it. She made the class excellent. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. What really distinguished this course for me is the exemplary way that it balanced different disciplinary approaches. There is an excellent mix of economics, sociology, anthropology, and political science, and Professor Nattrass manages to weave all these different fields together in a cohesive way, allowing each of them to produce nuanced and insightful critiques of the others. This element of the course helped me build a vocabulary and toolset that has allowed me to better articulate my own doubts and critiques of development models. I can't recommend this course highly enough, although part of me hopes that it remains a hidden gem because the small class size definitely positively impacted our discussions! "
