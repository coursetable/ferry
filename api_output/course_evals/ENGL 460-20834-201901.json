            "\u00a0I produced two poetry sequences throughout the semester. I pushed myself as a poet to break form, grapple with greater meaning, construct a \"history\" of images within a poem, and write fearlessly about the self. ",
            "\u00a0I gained more careful and detailed reading and interpretation skills, developed my poetic aesthetics, and was able to appreciate even more different writing styles and approaches to writing poetry. I became more confident in writing longer poems than I ever had before, and I got better at taking and making use of constructive criticism. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to effectively workshop poetry and hold discussions about other poets (of all ages and backgrounds) works in order to create a collaborative space that encouraged improvement of skill. ",
            "\u00a0Hearing feedback from Claudia! We also watched films, looked at artwork, and experimented with other genres/mediums, and I learned how to incorporate more experimental forms into my poetry. ",
            "\u00a0I created two longer poems over the course of the class, one orbiting the topic of borders, peripheries, and margins, and one using some kind of archival material. In this process, I worked with feedback from my classmates, Prof Rankine, and Emily Skillings to whittle down, revise, and clarify what I wanted to be taken away from the poem. I have improved as a workshop participant as a result of this class, attuning myself more finely to the parts that need tightening in a work - and have also definitely honed my critical eye on my own work. ",
            "\u00a0Claudia and Emily were passionate and generous readers. Workshop settings can be stressful, and the two of them played off each other to give fair, kind feedback. ",
            "\u00a0I was exposed to different forms of art and poetry, which helped me develop the knowledge necessary to improve my own writing. "

        [
            "\u00a0The weeks when we were workshopping felt the most alive. It was an honor and privilege to hear my classmates' work and give them feedback. The practice of having classmates write letters to the poet being workshopped was super instrumental to my own development; the 1:1 workshops we had with Professor Rankine were also very helpful and encouraging. Our TF, Emily Skillings, was very accessible and helpful whenever we had any questions. I loved the themes of the class: \"Borders/Margins\" and \"Archives,\" and how these themes were loose inspiration-jumping off points for our work. We were allowed a lot of freedom in the direction we decided to go with. ",
            "\u00a0There is a great balance of readings and workshops, both of which really help the writing process. ",
            "\u00a0Overall the course was really enjoyable and well structured! I liked the division of the semester into reading and workshopping, although I felt that the two sections could have been better tied together. The one on one feedback from Professor Rankine was incredible, and I felt so lucky to get to work with her! I did wish though that the class had fostered more of a sense of community, and that we had spent more time discussing each reading. ",
            "\u00a0The readings were all incredible, and the assignments also great. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Claudia Rankine. Hearing feedback from such an accomplished poet was so great. The workshop formats were also very helpful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Perhaps hearing more detailed feedback from instructors. After a while, the workshop format became a bit rushed. I think focusing on one workshopped poem (instead of two full-length poems) over the semester would give everyone more time to provide more cohesive, constructive feedback on each other's poems. Also, we were asked to purchase a lot of books, but didn't go over them much in detail -- perhaps PDFs of excerpts would be more helpful (and much less costly). ",
            "\u00a0The format of the course is entirely different from Louise Gluck's version of 460; rather than having new work due every week, in this class there are 2 poems due throughout the semester, each on a different (very loose) prompt. I found that structure to be a strength in that it centered the revising process - something I've found I rarely end up prioritizing with any work at Yale. The readings/viewings assigned were to inform our understanding of each prompt, and the discussions based on them was always enriching. At the end of each of the two units we had 3 weeks of workshop on the first drafts of our work, and over time the group developed a workshop dynamic that felt natural thanks to the structure of the class. It's hard to pinpoint any weaknesses - all I can think of is that we would sometimes be told spontaneously to come in the next week with something like a page of our next work. If there were more intermediate due dates for the poems, it might help to get even the briefest feedback along the way and keep our thinking on track. Including more writing-generating ideas and activities in some of the class sessions might also improve the course - before getting to workshop at the end of each unit, it does start to feel more like a poetry seminar. ",
            "\u00a0I wouldve loved to be able to see the other students final poems, if possible! ",
            "\u00a0I loved reading works from a wide array of poets and artists, but I would have appreciated a little more feedback/practice. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes! It had been a long time since I dared take on the mantel of \"poet\"--this class gave me the courage to do that once again. It helped me rediscover my love of poetry and I think I have grown exponentially as an artist. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Claudia and Emily (her assistant) are both very wise, the readings and media are diverse and interesting, and the class environment is warm and conducive to discussion and workshops. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Its a great course to develop confidence and skill in reading and writing poetry. I would recommend it as a second poetry class after a more intro level class like ENGL 135 or ENGL 246. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If youre a writer who has never explored writing poetry before, dont shy away from this course. Youll learn so much and meet so many amazing young poets. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Such a valuable experience to hear from Professor Rankine and other talented students. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would strongly recommend it! The structure of working on only two longer poems per semester makes this class equally suitable for someone who prioritizes poetry as an academic pursuit as for someone who has more of a peripheral interest. It really helps you learn to revise, rework, and be open to criticism. The combination of seminar-style discussion and workshop discussion, as well as the consideration of multimedia sources, prevented it from ever getting dull - and Prof Rankine facilitates a trusting, open, and relaxed environment. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely. The feedback on your work is extraordinary, and its amazing what the other extremely talented writers in the class come up with. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - whether you have published a book of poetry or have never written a single poem in your life, this course will help you become a better poet. "
