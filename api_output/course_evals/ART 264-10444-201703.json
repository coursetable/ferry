            "\u00a0Learned about the history of typography and gained fluency in the vocabulary for discussing typography. Learned about specific typefaces and their unique characteristics. Worked on projects (books and posters) that taught and refined use of typography. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the principles of type design and type setting, the history of major typefaces, and gained skill in critiquing my own work and the work of others. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about book design and typography ",
            "\u00a0I learned a ton, and I would not be able to list everything in this response. This course covered a broad spectrum of content, including but not limited to: basic typographic history, typographic manipulation, information hierarchy, book-binding, poster design, etc. ",
            "\u00a0This class really trains your eyes to notice and understand the details of typesetting and typographic compositionit's kind of incredible how much more critically I can look at typographic design after this course. It also forces you to be incredibly thoughtful about the intention behind design, and design ideas: I'll never put something on the page just because it looks nice ever again. "

            "\u00a0This course is very well taught and can be valuable to anyone. The projects are great for developing typography skills and are organized in a good order.\r\n\r\nI would have preferred for one project to end before the next one began in order to not have to juggle multiple projects at once. In-class discussions and critiques often went by very slowly: this part of class could be adjusted. ",
            "\u00a0If you do the reading, you'll learn a ton about typography. I think the reading is crucial because it gives you the technical information you need to do well in assignments, because we often ran out of time to get into that kind of information in class. We sometimes had a hard time sticking to schedule in class because critiques would run over. We didn't receive any letter grades on assignments during the term; if you want to know how you're progressing, you need to ask. Overall this was a really strong course on typography; Alice will make sure you learn a lot and cares about your individual work. ",
            "\u00a0Very intensive, but you learn a lot throughout the course ",
            "\u00a0This course helps develop a lot of important design skills needed for the success career life after college. However, I found that the class could have been better organized to better facilitate student learning. This became especially apparent towards the end of the semester as we were given less and less time to do more and more work. Normally this wouldn't be an issue, but it seemed like this wasn't the way the class was intended to end and instead felt like an unfortunate byproduct of a poorly organized first half of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed our assignments and thought that Alice gave us really insightful feedback on our work. Classtime was nicely divided between crits, instruction, lectures, and viewings of books in Alice's collection. \r\n\r\nI do wish that there was a more concise time limit on crits because I noticed that we often ran out of time (due to the sheer number of students in the class), and sometimes the same people were always left out because they were a little less aggressive about sharing their work. I also wish that we had slightly less time for our chapbook and slightly more time for our last movie transcription project. The final week of this class was extremely stressful because we not only had to complete our movie transcription poster and book, but we also had to prepare for the final crit and polish up our type diaries for submission.\r\n\r\nI also wish there was a clearer rubric for how Alice graded our projects, and I would've liked to receive grades throughout the semester without receiving them all at once after the semester was over. There were projects where I didn't do as well as I would've thought, and it would have been nice to have the time to approach Alice in person and talk about her grading rationale/where I could improve.

            "\u00a0Please take it if you enjoy designing anything with text and/or if you love books. It was a wonderful wonderful course with the most helpful, supportive, and considerate instructor. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you really care about typography and want to make sure that you use type properly in your designs. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely reccomendatipn if you have the time and are willing to put on the effort necessary, because if you do, you will get amazing work from the class ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially if you're unsure what it is that you want to do with design after graduating. ",
            "\u00a0Sure- it's a good fundamental course for grasping the history and application of typography. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Alice is so wonderful and pushes you to really be critical about both details and overarching concepts in your designs. A definite must-take if you're interested in typography even a little bit. The projects are also really engaging and clever. You'll learn so much! "
