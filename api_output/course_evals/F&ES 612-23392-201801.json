I feel I have a much deeper understanding of how these different systems complement each other, and why landfill is still a solution we need to depend on given capacity, cost, regulation, etc. factors that are at play.

I liked taking this course and the Material Flow Analysis course in the same semester as I felt them to be complementary. I am significantly better informed about Waste Management issues now and will contribute to how I approach that part of my life differently than I did before. ",

I have a much deeper understanding of why waste diversion and recycling rates have not improved the way we would want them to, particularly in the U.S., and some of the methods that could be leveraged in helping us reach levels of higher performing countries.

            "\u00a0On par with what I was told about last year's class -- this course jumps around a lot and covers a lot of ground. Deepening an understanding or specific skill is contingent on being a 3 credit and engaging a personal research project. As a 2-credit student, the overview -- though at times frustrating because of the lack of cohesion between class lectures -- was perfect and exactly what I was looking for. ",

The whole system was more complex than I realized, there was a lot more to learn than I expected, and it was more interesting than I expected. A really pleasant surprise! ",
            "\u00a0The knowledge, skills, and insights gained in this class somewhat align with my expectations. I  learned various theories in the class and how the system works or has been working for many years. I was expecting the course to take a deep dive into current problems related to waste for example e-waste, textile waste, circular economy, and carbon credits generated from waste especially agricultural/food waste.

            "\u00a0The organization of the student presentations can be better. Speaking for my group, we were not clear on what the teacher for the day was going to present on therefore our presentations overlapped significantly. ",
            "\u00a0I think the reading selection could be greatly approved. I think that the discussions were overall engaging but the readings sometimes seemed either too broad/general or extremely specific . I felt that some of the broader issues around waste management, such as environmental justice and public health, could have been recognized more. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of this course is the plethora of material covered, and the expertise of each of the professors and guest lecturers. This allowed us to have dynamic conversations and explore certain aspects or details that were important to students. I also really enjoyed the group presentations and analyzing a difficult problem that is of high relevance today.\r\n\r\nI feel that the course could have been a bit more structured, as I felt we re-looked at certain topics multiple times across separate weeks. Covering all of recycling across a few classes (one after the other) before moving onto another method would have been helpful. ",
            "\u00a0While the course as a whole is a strong one, I felt that one weakness was that the lectures were somewhat \"modular.\" In some cases they built on each other, but at times it seemed like the topics each were siloed. The reading responses also became slightly repetitive. I'd prefer more variation in the weekly assignments. Overall, I think the pacing and structure of the class sessions are well-planned, but I had some trouble connecting and engaging with the lecturers and topics. My favorite classes were those that had visible applications, and clear takeaways for industries or best practices, whereas I was a bit bored by topics that were focused more on overarching systems as a whole or highly-specific materials and categorizations. I loved all four lecturers' enthusiasm, but at times had trouble matching it.... ",
            "\u00a0I liked how the class was organized by topic and the four professors complemented each other well. The amount of feedback should be improved. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of the strengths and weaknesses were covered in my final paper. Overall -- strength: flexibility in how engaged a student could be (2 vs 3 credit option). Weakness: lack of cohesion between sections. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: great professors. Really engaging content. Course is well run. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the expectations of students are not clear up front (i.e. the student run portion of the class is a little murky, as well as the lack of a formal prompt for the final reflection paper. The class is long, and looking at powerpoints for three hours can be challenging. I would have loved for this to be a twice a week class, where the topics are a week long and two individuals/researchers look at the same issue from two different perspectives. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: breadth of topics covered , flexibility of choosing 2/3 credits \r\nWeaknesses : lack of consensus among the instructors on several topics , some academic papers were very old ",
            "\u00a0A strength of the course is the 'systems thinking' approach that is used to address the waste management system. In light of this, one of the ways that the course could be improved is by spending more time at the beginning on a system overview. When focusing on individual system waste elements, it sometimes felt hard to see the forest through the trees. This problem was compounded by the necessity for a waste manager to compare a range of options when designing a system. More time spent comparing waste management options to one another (in terms of cost, challenges, and environmental outcomes) may help to crystallize core takeaways. Also, some feedback on weekly assignments should have been provided. ",
            "\u00a0The content was good and the format good, nice mix of things we were required to do/complete. Nice to have a field trip. Regarding improvements, the instructors were not particularly responsive and I think students could benefit from more engagement from the instructors. We got NO feedback on how we were doing until grades were posted for some of our assignments on the evening of May 13th. Way too late to help us during the semester. I don't know what others' experiences were in this regard but during the semester when I reached out to instructors for feedback I generally got no response. That's not helpful.\r\n\r\nI also was wondering about the time commitment required by this course as compared to other 2 credit courses I had or have had. The class time for this course was 2 hours and 50 minutes weekly. And we had weekly reading and response requirements, a field trip, required group work (in-class presentation and a paper) plus a final paper (even for the 2 credit option, a longer one was required for the 3 credit option). My other 2 credit courses were either 1 hour and 20 minutes once a week (one was 12 weeks and one was 6 weeks) or 1 hour and 50 minutes once a week (for 12 weeks) and the reading requirements about the same, paper requirements less extensive. So the workload for this one seems high. And having 3 instructors made the lectures, and ultimate feedback we finally got, uneven at best. ",
            "\u00a0Better lecture style ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were all great and I enjoyed most of the readings. I also really liked the field trip to Quantum Biopower. While I enjoyed my group assignment and felt that we did a good job, the quality of group presentations varied. Perhaps this could be improved with clearer instructions and expectations. I also didn't have a sense of how I was doing in the course because we didn't receive feedback on any assignments until after classes ended. I didn't even realize our reading responses were being graded. It would have been nice to receive feedback on these or to at least have some kind of outline of expectations or grading criteria. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of this course are the multiple teachers, so you have different perspectives and expertise, visiting lectures, and the interesting nature of the material. I enjoyed the optional research credit as well. \r\nI wasn't sure how I felt about the in-class presentations from students every class. On the one hand, giving presentations is a good skill to practice. They also gave some good insights into different aspects of waste. However, some groups were more experienced presenters than others, and this affected how I absorbed information and how interested I was. Maybe students could be given more advice on giving good presentations, or steered toward the resources at Yale that exist to help make presentations more exciting? \r\nIt was also hard that the class was offered in one long block once a week. There are pluses and minuses to this -- but often it made the class feel very long. ",
            "\u00a0It was great to have so many different lecturers all speaking on their areas of expertise. That makes it a bit harder for week-to-week cohesion, but that's a price worth paying in order to hear so many different (well informed) voices. ",
            "\u00a0The class is a good overview of the waste management system which I believe everyone has some degree of information on how waste management works. The course should take a deep dive into the current problems and its solution and how companies are making a business case out of it. There were many discussion on the waste systems its issues and challenges, and I believe that took a significant time of the class. There was hardly any discussions on the solutions or the approach. This task was left to students groups and the student research projects which I believe did a great job in their own capacity. \r\n\r\nIn my view, the course is also not structured properly, If we know that there's a waste hierarchy, we should approach the class in that format, touching the issues and opportunities for each level of the hierarchy. After few weeks, the concepts and theories were repeated continuously in the class. For example, we had multiple classes on waste treatment and disposal for the different waste category but only one class on waste prevention and reduction, this was consumer behavior class. \r\n\r\nThe readings given for the class were academic journals, conference paper, chapters from books, and NGO reports. In my view, the readings only provide the reader with the academic viewpoint of the waste systems in a most boring way which mostly talks about the problems and has numbers, chart, and figures that no one remembers. I believe that the readings for the class should include case studies focussing on each level in the waste hierarchy making the business or the policy case on waste management. "

            "\u00a0Understand that you will leave the class with a clearer understanding of the numerous challenges of waste management, but with not as much a grasp on best practices or future solutions. ",
            "\u00a0I recommend taking the 3-credit option as it allows you to take your in-class learnings into a real-world example. I felt the class concepts really came together for me while researching and writing my research paper.\r\n\r\nI also recommend doing all of the readings, especially if the material is new to you, to absorb as much as possible from the lectures.

            "\u00a0This course is useful and relevant to a number of student interest areas at FES, including food, energy, and business. It's also a great course to take as a 2-credit option for those who have a big workload with their other classes. ",
            "\u00a0This class has a pretty low workload and is interesting. I recommend taking it if you want to learn more about waste! ",
            "\u00a0If your goal for the class is to learn about the problems in waste management which I believe you already know to some degree, take the course to expand it. If you're interested in current issues and the business case of waste management, the class only spends few hours on that. If you like an engaging class, where people talk a lot, this is the class for you. "
