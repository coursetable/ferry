            "\u00a0Gained a useful insight about Emerson, Dickinson and Melville through well-selected readings, thought provoking classroom discussion formats and useful homework assignments. ",
            "\u00a0In this course I engaged closely with works by Emerson, Dickinson, and Melville - three defining authors of the American literary canon. I learned about the concepts they were all reckoning with in conversation with each other. ",
            "\u00a0I gained the ability to deeply analyze and understand the grander ideas of three of America's influential authors. I also gain greater life insight as well as general skills in deep reading. ",
            "\u00a0In this class, I became more familiar with the works of three influential American authors, and I gained experience reading writers of different mediums (poetry, essays, fiction) alongside one another. I also really think my close-reading skills improved over the past few months. ",
            "\u00a0I think that my ability to engage deeply with a text was greatly increased. I have a better understanding of how to approach the American Literary tradition as a whole. I also discovered that I love Emerson and will continue to read his work. ",
            "\u00a0Rigorous entry into three key American writers. A conversation on the poetics and ideals in a newly democratic community ",
            "\u00a0More than deepen my knowledge of Emerson, Dickinson, and Melville, this course underscored for me the value of close reading. Professor Demings habit of paying close attention to the specific words that these writers use opened up their texts to new realms of significance that turned reading into an active and creative act. Instead of merely understanding some of Emersons ideas or Dickinsons motifs, I came away from this course with a method for approaching any book that, far from enchaining me to what it ostensibly says, frees me to linger over its hidden meanings and implications.

            "\u00a0Great reading selection of longer and shorter pieces, essays and secondary criticism, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I thought the response papers were great and provided structure to the course. The syllabus was also great, and I enjoyed having a good chunk of time to become familiar with each writer.\r\nWeaknesses: it would have been nice to have a little more secondary scholarship to think about in relation to the primary texts, I think. ",
            "\u00a0It was incredibly engaging and was not a class you could just sit by in. It felt as if every student were deeply involved in the environment of the course. I thought it was disappointing but understandable that we didn't get to discuss everything we read. ",
            "\u00a0The readings are incredible. There wasn't a single assignment that I wasn't excited to read. Professor Deming also does a great job highlighting how the material ties together. There aren't many dropped threads thematically in the syllabus.\r\n\r\nOne weakness is that the secondary readings are concentrated in the first half of the course. Some of my favorite readings were short essays/articles that complemented the primary readings, like Adrienne Rich's piece on Emily Dickinson. I think it would be great to assign some more of those for the second half of the course -- like on Moby-Dick and Bartleby. ",
            "\u00a0This course has a major strength where many other English classes fail: the amount of reading required is not crazy. There are points when it gets less doable - when we read Moby Dick it was especially tough - but overall, this class does a great job of focusing a large amount of time on a small amount of content, which I loved. Another great benefit of the class is that it is truly discussion based - everyone participates, and the professor does not dominate discussion. This seems to be pretty rare, but it is exactly what I look for in an English class, so it was great for me. ",
            "\u00a0Every component was well structured  the leading pair, the conversation, the pace of the reading. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course lay in the intensity of class discussions. While the texts themselves can be found in numerous courses, what made reading them in this one more meaningful was the way that Professor Deming shaped discussion to focus on themes of reading, interpretation, and voice. The courses incorporation of multiple genres also helped to keep discussions fresh and dynamic.\r\n\r\nOne suggestion for improvement might be to better incorporate the questions of the correspondent into the class. While we often discussed the respondents essay in some detail, the correspondents questions at times seemed to pass unnoticed. Bringing these questions more to light might help bolster the courses emphasis on actively interrogating texts and responding to their answers in kind. "

            "\u00a0If you're interested in engaging at a high level with some thought provoking writers, this is a fantastic class to take. Professor Deming welcomes non-English majors, which makes for really fruitful in-class discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Take this course - its not too difficult and the readings are genuinely interesting if you have an interest in american literature ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend to another student. Great professor and it was nice to get to dig deep into a smaller amount of material instead of getting a cursory glance of a lot of material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This class is a well-run English course that will expose you to rewarding readings, strong teaching, and thorough writing feedback. This class was not only fun to be in, but I think it makes you better prepared to tackle other Humanities/English/History courses at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to another student. It was one of my favorite courses that Ive taken at Yale, and especially the unit on Emerson was one of my favorite intellectual experiences ever. Professor Deming genuinely cares about each individual in the class, and he creates an environment where a lot of the discussion is focused on the students, which is something Ive been missing in a lot of my English classes at Yale. I actually know the name of everyone in the seminar, which is far more rare than it should be in my experience. Highly recommend. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially in unexpected ways. If you are at all interested in the transformations of American literature or literature in general, this is a great entry point into discussing the philosophical and ethical potential of texts. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. Not only do Emerson, Dickinson, and Melville themselves have a lot to say, but the way that Professor Deming approaches them makes their words relevant, not just to English majors, but to anyone invested in living an examined life. Whether one has read the courses texts before or not at all, Professor Demings thoughts on them and his ability to draw out the thoughts of students, renews their meaning and relevance. "
