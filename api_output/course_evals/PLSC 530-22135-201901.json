            "\u00a0This class was fantastic, probably my favorite class this semester. Jonathan is such a great lecturer, he always makes jokes, keeps the audience engaged and motivated. His explanations of the statistical theory were also super clear, he always had powerpoints ready. His lectures were also fantastic. He always had a code prepared for the class, we could follow along while he was lecturing. The examples were always interesting, and I feel like I had understood everything we needed to at the end of the class.\r\nThe homework for the class were also super relevant, and a great application of what we saw in class. The midterms were also a good way to check on what we learned. And I really enjoyed the freedom to choose data for a final project.  All the lectures are video-captured, which is good if there is something we missed from class, but not a lot of people showed us in class, which I think is a shame because Jonathan is such a great lecturer!\r\nPiazza was also a great ressource for the course. And the TA team was also fantastic. ",
