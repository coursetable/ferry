            "\u00a0Learning to really listen to music and evaluate a show critically. Having more knowledge of the history of the art form makes me approach shows differently now. ",
            "\u00a0Ability to write about music and test persuasive righting. \r\nCritical listening ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the history of musical theater as a mode of performance, musical analysis, critical approaches to theater-making, and commercial considerations for Broadway-bound shows. ",
            "\u00a0This is an extraordinary class for anyone interested in performing, writing for, writing about or working in theater. Throughout the semester, you'll listen to and dissect approximately 40 soundtracks while reading between 60 and 100 pages per week. Though writing the two papers (one 5  10 pager and one 10  20 pager) was valuable, I found class discussions to be even more useful. This class gave me so many useful tools for dissecting musical theater  language, history, even the ability to pick out significant musical cues  and I'm so glad I took it. ",
            "\u00a0Learned so much about analyzing music--music vocabulary, voice styles, and trends. Writing a whole paper about one song was a wild experience. ",
            "\u00a0If you have any interest in musical theatre, history, or both, you must take this class! It's the best of both worlds. You will not regret it! ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about the art of musical theater and its creation and evolution with American society from the first book musical to the present. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the trends, historical significance, and musical evolution of the American Musical Theater tradition starting with Showboat in 1920 up until Hamilton today. I learned about what makes the genre inherently American, and which composers defined each generation of musical theater. I learned about what makes good musical theater and how the genre has evolved to fit today's society. I also learned how to critically analyze a score through both a musical lens and a narrative lens. ",
            "\u00a0I dined insight in how the art form of American Musical Theater was/is formed and what tends to work and not work. "

            "\u00a0One of the strengths of the course is Professor Egan! He's the coolest guy. He's like this nice dad who loves musical theatre and getting to know all of his students. A real gem. \r\n\r\nOne weakness (or really, potential weakness) was the way each class time was actually structured. I think it'd be interesting to experiment with the class being a true seminar (sitting around a round table together, with professor gently guiding instruction). The way the class is formatted now is a bit like law school, in that it's a lecture where the professor will randomly call on people to contribute. The students definitely talk a ton, so it is like a seminar in that regard, but it still felt very lecture-y, like we were trying to prove a point he had already planned out. This isn't necessarily a bad thing (I learned to stop being intimidated by being randomly called on, which is good!) but it might be interesting to see what a more student-guided class would look like.\r\n\r\nAlso, the class could also adopt more points of view in each class period. We tended to stick more toward analysis of the actual shows, but it could be interesting to zoom out more frequently and analyze what American historical events may have been impacting how theatre was being made. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: The organization ",
            "\u00a0This class was all strengths and no weaknesses! The only thing that might make it even better, I think, would be engaging with more dimensions of musical theater (race, class, gender, and sexuality, for example). I understand that the class is introductory and thus more macroscopic than those lenses, but I think they could enrich the material even more. Nevertheless, what a fantastic semester! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were the subject matter - musical theater is such an amazing thing to study.\r\n\r\nWeakness might be the readings- I feel like they didn't add to the course as much as I wanted. Dan Egan was where all the insight was! Didn't need the readings! ",
            "\u00a0There was a wide variety of styles. I was exposed to the key works of the genre. Lots of reading in addition to listening to scores. ",
            "\u00a0amazing course, extremely well structured. material taught in an efficient and engaging way. Dan makes himself very available to you and has incredible knowledge of the field. a highlight of my time at yale. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Every week the homework is listening to incredible musicals and reading relevant and intriguing secondary sources. We get to see a musical on Broadway and apply to it class themes! Dan is one of the best teachers I've ever had, and he speaks so intelligently and openly about musical theater. The workload is completely manageable, and Dan is such a fun teacher to talk to. \r\nWeaknesses: Readings aren't discussed to the fullest extent, and Dan's teachings can sometimes feel too planned. There is little room for extended discussion because he wants to cover a lot in one period. ",
            "\u00a0The class covers many shows and provides exposure to many that one may not have had prior. However, it is extremely fast paced and at times not very easy to follow in lecture. "

        [
            "\u00a0Yes! But definitely know that it is not your typical seminar-style class, and that it is more analysis of each show than history, in some ways. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It is a great chance to explore a passion, or learn about something new, both while developing writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0\"American Musical Theater History\" was fantasticone of my favorite courses at Yale (and perhaps even my favorite). As a non-theater major, I feel so fortunate to have learned from Professor Egan and musically-inclined classmates. The course includes really fantastic reading, listening to several scores each week (which ranged from \"Anything Goes\" to \"Gypsy\" to \"Spring Awakening\"), and a trip to see a Broadway musical. (We saw \"Hello Dolly.\") I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning more about how music, dance, and drama work together to achieve something unique and moving. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely!! Beyond the usefulness, it's pure fun. ",
            "\u00a0I LOVED this course. I hadn't had the opportunity to study musical theater at Yale yet, and I thoroughly enjoyed tracing musical theater trends and styles from 1927 Showboat to today's hits. ",
            "\u00a0Oh yes. My major is something completely unrelated to this class but it was SO fun. Definately need to put a lot work in to get the most out of it, but it's worth it. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing class. Teaches you to look at musical theater like we look at other art forms. Musical theater is incredibly well-planned out and integrated. A collaborative art. ",
            "\u00a0Yes Yes Yes Yes!!! If you like Hamilton, TAKE IT. If you like any musical, TAKE IT. Dan is one of the best teachers I've ever had and he makes the class accessible for any level of theater geek. I'm a composer and performer, and I took the class with many english, history, and urban studies majors, so it was refreshing to get opinions and insight from people who weren't necessarily as exposed to musical theater as I was. But if you are a theater geek like me, you will think about theater in a completely different way. You will write about some of your favorite shows, and you will make sense of a genre that is incredibly diverse and always changing. ",
            "\u00a0Take this curse if you want to learn more about musical theater history, especially if you want to work in this field. Dan Egan is brilliant and very helpful. "
