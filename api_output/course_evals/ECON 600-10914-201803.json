The one-page summaries required by Phil Haile provided a good accountability mechanism to ensure I at least understood the broad strokes of the paper before attending the relevant class.  I also enjoyed Phil's somewhat philosophical lecture on modeling and estimation.  Both instructors gave good lectures.  \r\n\r\nIt would have been nice to have feedback on the problem sets.  I don't expect it's feasible for the professors to check our code for errors and bugs, but I do believe that they have knowledge vastly surpassing mine when it comes to writing code and especially solving the practical issues that arise in these models, and I would have liked for them to have directly imparted more of that knowledge (as, for example, Cormac O'Dea does in his class).   In the absence of a posted example solution code, some high-level comments about correcting common mistakes and following best practices for efficient coding might be useful. ",

I decided not to take the field exam because I don't see myself doing IO research, but I'm really glad I took the class. It offers good methods training and exposure to material that every economist should know, like discrete choice models and production function estimation. ",
