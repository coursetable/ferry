            "\u00a0Amazing class.  It is a pretty time intensive one because of all the reading, so I'd recommend either Credit/D or having plenty of time to read.  But Ambassador Ford is FANTASTIC! He cares about everyone in the class, is willing to meet outside of class, and has immense experience in this area.  Take this class if you get the chance!!! ",
            "\u00a0GLBL 460 teaches students how to analyze and to critique influential episodes in American foreign policy--both historical and contemporary--in order to build an understanding of how good foreign policy should be conducted. Both American and foreign players' national interests, strategies, and tactics are examined in thorough studies of some major foreign policy \"turning points\" for the US. By the end of the class, students learn about the different schools of thought in foreign policy, strategies for designing policy, and historical knowledge of some of the most important (best and worst) instances of American foreign policy--very useful as reference points for what works and what doesn't! ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the history of American foreign policy, broadened my background knowledge of different regions the US has operated in, gained a general framework for understanding policy decisions, and improved my writing skills. I also learned more about the different schools of thought in international relations. ",
            "\u00a0While I learned a ton about American diplomatic history and foreign policy throughout the past couple of centuries, I think the most important thing I learned from Ambassador Ford and this course as a whole was the framework of objectives-strategies-tactics that can be exported to just about anything beyond foreign policymaking and analysis. It was also really great to get to hear about Ford's experiences as a diplomat and why, for example, communications problems the class identified in foreign policy might have happened, or what principal's meetings might actually look like. Really, a treat. ",
            "\u00a0By taking this course, I've learned about a number of historical foreign policy events, spanning from the founding of the United States to today's current geopolitical challenge with Russia and China. Not only have we analyzed and studied the events as history, but we've also tackled major themes of foreign policy, from the difficulty of navigating the bureaucracy, to the alignment of interests, strategies, and tactics, to the tensions between civil and military leaders. Thus, these themes have become tools to analyze foreign policy decisions, as well as tools to make such decisions in the future. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a ton about certain major events in American foreign policy. But more importantly, we were taught wonderful lenses for analyzing foreign policy decisions (interest, strategy, tactic). ",
            "\u00a0Great class on the inner workings of the American foreign policy establishment. The class dives into how political theory effects diplomacy and international action. ",
            "\u00a0We explored various major events in diplomacy in U.S. history and analyzed them through the framework of interests, strategies, and tactics. The professor's personal experience and broad knowledge, plus the curious pursuit of the students led to great class discussions. "

        [
            "\u00a0The seminars sometimes seemed to drag in the beginning.  As the course progressed, the content became more interesting, but the first few classes were quite dull.  I think that bringing more personal anecdotes to class would strengthen the course.  We can read biographies of Ben Franklin on our own, or pick up books at Barnes and Noble.  It isn't everyday that Obama's Ambassador to Syria stands up to tell you about his area of expertise.  Your (Ambassador Ford's) experience is what makes your class special, and you should put it at the center of the course. ",
            "\u00a0The class is incredibly well designed and well run, and the structure of both the syllabus and the seminar discussions was a huge strength. Each week focuses in-depth on one case study, most often through a single book and occasionally through several articles. The case studies are arranged chronologically, which gives a great sense of how American approaches have changed over the history of the republic. There's a good mix of successful and unsuccessful cases, and the ability to focus on one case per week allows students to gain a very thorough understanding of each. Ford is very methodical in running seminars, never letting discussions stray too far from the task at hand. Each class, discussion centers on who the major players were, what their goals and interests were, and how they went about achieving those goals. After establishing the basic facts--which can be trickier than you think, given how complicated interstate politics often is--Ford welcomes both praise and critique of how each player handled the case. Ford's syllabus is filled with incredibly written and enlightening pieces about historical events everyone knows--the Marshall Plan, the Vietnam War, the invasion of Kuwait. Overall, the class is guaranteed to provide every student with a measured and highly analytical lens through which to think about contemporary American foreign policy. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Ford is well-versed in the material, allowing for outside perspectives on our readings. He also is very accessible to students to further discuss the topics of the course, review assignments, and get professional advice. The end-of-semester debate on multipolarity is also a highlight. The reading load is pretty heavy, which can result in some students participating less in discussion (one potential way to work around this would be having students write small reading responses or something). The student presentations are also very topical and interesting. I liked that the approach of the course was very rigorous-Ford would ask follow-up questions-unlike some of my other foreign policy seminars that just turn into off-topic debate on current events. ",
            "\u00a0Ambassador Ford and the syllabus were fantastic, really. The only thing I would have changed would have been to make the expectations for the presentation and the two papers more clear. A lot of us were confused about what to do for our in-class presentations, and this wasn't really clear until people had already started to present or our first paper was due. I also think we could have received more feedback on these assessments (I was one of the first people to present and didn't hear much beyond initial reactions, e.g.). In any case, this is absolutely an example of a course at Yale that first, fills a curricular hole in that Yale doesn't really have foreign policy history courses, and second, benefits greatly from a former practitioner as instructor. One of my favorite courses yet at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n(1) Professor is energetic and passionate about the material\r\n(2) Most of the books assigned are fantastic\r\n(3) We were able to analyze foreign policy through the \"interests, strategies, and tactics\" perspective\r\n\r\nA few suggestions moving forward:\r\n(1) Spend less time summarizing books - most of the seminar is spent dissecting the details (like a book club, almost) but I wished the books had served as jumping points for broader discussions on the topics/themes. \r\n(2) Connect student presentations with seminars - while it was great that students were able to pick their own topic, I wish they had tracked a bit more with the course; seemed quite random\r\n(3) Cut out the Franklin text! More time to talk about China, Russia, the ME, etc. \r\n\r\nBut overall - a great course! ",
            "\u00a0There were many strengths to this course. First, I appreciated how we tackled one foreign policy event a week, and there was a sense of progression from week to week in the analysis of these events. Second, I loved the variety of modules we applied in class. From seminar discussion of the readings, to weekly presentations from students about a specific foreign policy event, to the debate we had at the end of the semester. Third, I appreciated Amb. Ford's teaching style, which was very active for a seminar, and led us through discussions, making sure we hit on all of the important points he wanted to raise. In terms of weaknesses, or suggestions for further improvement, I would have liked more discussion throughout about the camps of thought, and how that impact decisions made in the government--thus, more emphasis on Realists vs. Neoliberals vs. Neoconservatives throughout the course would have been great. Other than that, no other weaknesses. This course, as a whole, was fantastic. ",
            "\u00a0Overall really wonderful course, hard to think of weaknesses!! I really enjoyed almost all the books (I would say Ben Franklin was less interesting) and thought discussion was really well facilitated. I especially loved student presentations -- thought that was a great way to expand our knowledge! \r\n\r\nMaybe could be interesting to see a few more book/events that involved female diplomats and politicians (or written by female authors). ",
            "\u00a0I loved the discussions. But the book a week is a lot to handle in terms of reading. ",
            "\u00a0I don't think there are really any weaknesses -- the course is fantastic. The readings some times may be long but it is a great investment of time. ",
            "\u00a0The course was great. The only suggestion I have is that I would have appreciated if we spent only one week on Franklin in Paris and this might have allowed for a week on something on the Civil War or another topic in USFP. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes!  If you have the time to read everything, take it for a grade.  If not, take it Credit/D.  Take this class for the teacher rather than for the content alone. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely recommend this class. Robert Ford is both a phenomenal professor and also a ridiculously accomplished person from whom to learn. As the former US ambassador to Syria, his insights about current American policy in the Middle East (and his quips about personal interactions with Obama, Kerry, and many other well known politicians) are really interesting. The material is interesting even for those who aren't interested in a career in IR, given both that it covers well-known historical events like the Vietnam War and the first Persian Gulf War and that it has immediate relevance for contemporary American politics. If you care at all about the current state of the world and America's role within it, this class will give you insight into how we came to act as the global superpower we are today and how we might conduct our foreign policy in the future. The reading is never particularly difficult (although it can be long), and you definitely don't need a background in global affairs or polisci to take the class. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! If you want to do anything in government or international relations, take this. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a gem. One of the best I've taken at Yale, I'd absolutely recommend this course if it's offered again. Ambassador Ford and the readings were fabulous, and (after a few weeks of kind of awkward seminars) I think we all ended up fairly engaged in discussions and the class ended up feeling like more of a cohort. Ford really cares about making sure that students understand frameworks and examples of policy challenges, and that we're all doing well outside of the class; it was always nice to just chat at office hours, and he often made himself available beyond office hours via email, phone call, etc around the times of our papers and presentations. That said, this is a course in foreign policy, not really a liberal-arts style seminar (we didn't, for example, dive deep into the history surrounding foreign policy crises or what was happening domestically), and we did clearly focus on the policy and policymakers. It felt very practical, and I can't imagine a better person to learn about all of this with than Ambassador Ford. One of the few non-GLBL majors in the course, I was a little out of my element, but I'm absolutely glad I took the chance. ",
            "\u00a0Great course - spending seminars with Ambassador Ford was a pleasure. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Ambassador Ford is a great professor who truly cares about the wellbeing and performance of his students, and runs a great class! The material is engaging, and seminar discussions will never go around in circles, as Ford actively guides discussion to hit all the main points that he wants us to touch on. We learn about one foreign policy event a week, and the reading is always manageable. Furthermore, the workload isn't too demanding, as there is weekly reading, a presentation, and two papers throughout the course. This was a very fun course--Amb. Ford's insight as not only a great professor, but also an experienced practitioner, really adds to the experience. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Professor Ford is an incredibly interesting man and actually a wonderful professor. He assigns interesting readings (almost always books, which is really refreshing compared to tons of essays as is more common at Yale) and gives students a clear, easy lens to analyze foreign policy. It's a fair amount of work (~200-300 page book per week, two 3,500 word essays on topic of your choice, and student presentation), but definitely felt worth it!! While each week has a specific topic, there's also a lot of room to students to explore topics of their own interest through essays and presentations. ",
            "\u00a0If youre interested in foreign policy then yes! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Take the course for the opportunity to learn from Professor / Ambassador Ford. He is incredibly knowledgeable and will challenege you. He is very invested in his students and willing to take the time to help them advance. Additionally, being someone who spent his entire career in the foreign service, Ford has many \"war stories\" worth hearing. ",
            "\u00a0Want to learn from an Ambassador? What to know what real diplomacy is? What to apply history and current events together? Then take this class! ",
            "\u00a0The class was a great evaluation of American foreign policy from the founding to the present. Prof. Ford was incredible at structuring discussion so that you came away from each class feeling that you learned something beyond what was discussed in the readings. The assignments were enjoyable and Prof. Ford (although he wasn't in NH all week) made himself available to help students. "
