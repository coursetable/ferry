            "\u00a0I gained a deeper understanding and appreciation for the sociological study of race and inequality in the United States as represented by historical and contemporary literature. ",
            "\u00a0In this course, Professor Anderson has brilliantly painted the picture of Blackness in America.  We learned about how this history and in many instances, its erasure, has influenced US race relations and urban inequality today. Professor's Anderson's body of work has reaffirmed my understanding of the social organization of Black urban dwellers of the \"iconic ghetto\" as well as its juxtaposition to \"white space.\" This course has helped me understand how my own particularities can be seen as a strength when coupled with ethnography. Through the support and guidance of Professor Anderson and Kalfani, I have realized that I, too, can shed light on the local experiences of the racialized underclass. It is through this lens that I hope to pursue my own work and continue to strengthen my ethnographic field work abilities. But beyond that, I am deeply appreciative of the mentorship and guidance that I have received from both Professor Anderson and Kalfani in my own research and understandings. They have gone above and beyond to help me understand what ethnography is and how it can be applied to the \"truly disadvantaged\" in this society. "

            "\u00a0The course provided a broad survey of exciting literature and texts by many wonderful authors. It would be great in future semesters if students were given more opportunity in class to engage one another intellectually when discussing these materials. Additionally, I appreciated that Dr. Anderson was attentive to student needs/concerns and allowed for us to engage issues happening outside of the academy in our intellectual engagement with course materials. ",
            "\u00a0More conversation in class could really strengthen the course. ",
            "\u00a0The readings and lectures in this course complement each other temporally, substantively and contextually. The articles helped bring context (i.e. Becker, Hughes, etc.) to Professor Anderson's historical and contemporary work of inequality and Blackness in America. I appreciated Professor Anderson's honesty, or rather \"realness\" when discussing these complex issues. His perspective was grounded in his reality and it was refreshing to learn about how his experiences have shaped his reality as well as those he writes about. This is important since his work brings a different perspective to the academy, contributing to a new narrative that is often ignored or poorly understood. It was a privilege to listen to invited speakers, such as Elijah, who through his poetry, ethnographically paints the picture of his lived experience. The only minor feedback I would add is that in terms of the course syllabus, it would have been helpful to have concrete due dates of assignments in advance. "

            "\u00a0Yes, I think that all students at Yale would benefit tremendously from learning from Dr. Anderson, particularly in the social sciences and humanities. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. This course places urban inequality in context: it just doesn't speak of the phenomenon superficially, the course places inequality in the context of US race relations as well but also grounds it in an understanding of globalized market that creates the conditions for economic disenfranchisement. This goes counter to the \"blame the victim\" paradigm. The narratives that we read about in class help the reader (or the student in this case) contextualize poverty and ground our understandings in the many forms of racism and white supremacy that have taken shape throughout history and continue to oppress to this day.
