            "\u00a0This class was an intensive introduction to economics. I had never taken an economics class before this, but learned a lot from the class. Although the material moved quickly, Professor Koker is awesome at connecting and relating all the concepts. Although it took a lot of effort outside of class, I feel like I gained more from Intro to Micro than a lot of my other classes this semester. ",
            "\u00a0Obviously, the biggest takeaway from the class was microeconomics, but Tolga took the class farther than that, apply the concepts of microeconomics to real life scenarios including time-management. Tolga taught us skills on how to survive and thrive in college and in the world beyond college. That is how the class should be taught. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing! Learned a lot about econ and life! ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the basics of microeconomics supply and demand, consumer behavior, optimization, market structures etc. I don't think much depth was achieved in the lectures, but I did learn how to use techniques to solve rather simplified problems (after all, it's an introductory course). ",
            "\u00a0This class taught me that people who know economics see the world a little differently than people who don't. Human behavior is of course very complicated, but economics helps make sense of it a little bit. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided an excellent introduction to microeconomics and guided students through everything from decision-making tactics to needed calculus in order to solve profit maximizing problems. It emphasized the application of math over just learning the math itself, which helped me enjoy math more than I have from any other course. ",
            "\u00a0I developed knowledge of microeconomics and many real-world applications of economic concepts. I learned how to utilize multiple different resources to learn the material, including the textbook, lectures, lecture videos, outside resources, and office hours. ",
            "\u00a0This class was life-changing. I learned so much about the economic theories and laws that go into our (rational) decision making. My outlook on the US and global economy has been forever changed and I think I would like to major in Econ because of this class. ",
            "\u00a0Economic intuition and mode of thinking, consumer optimization problems, market structures...basically all the material in this class was new to me. ",
            "\u00a0The most important skills I learned from this course are the importance of developing a good relationship with the professor, time management, and developing a more quantitative way of explaining human behavior. ",
            "\u00a0I have learnt a lot of core economics concepts and feel comfortable with most of the material I have been taught as part of this introductory course. Alongside the mathematics concepts I have also learnt quite a lot of theory behind economic behavior and some of the psychology that goes hand in hand with this kind of decision making. ",
            "\u00a0Learned basically the entirety of intro micro. "

            "\u00a0The strengths of this class were the professor and the small class size. Because ECON 110 is a seminar, I felt like I had more access to my professor which really helped me throughout this class. Professor Koker is insanely intelligent and extremely accessible. Students can email him anytime or attend his office hours which are super helpful. Unlike many professors, Professor Koker genuinely cares about the success of his students. His jokes in class were great and he knows more random facts than anyone I've ever met. Truly one of the best professors at Yale. \r\n\r\nThe biggest weakness of this class was the curve. There are only two exams that determine your final grade, and they are graded on a pretty harsh curve. Overall, however, I feel the benefits of this class out way the harsh grading. I would much rather take a B+ in an interesting class than get an A in a boring lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- The Professor: Tolga is very engaging, and it is very obvious he loves what he is talking about. He is very easy to approach and makes the class far more enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0Great teacher! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Covers a lot of topics in a short amount of time, and gives people a rather broad overview of what microeconomics is.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Tolga tended to oversimplify his explanations and definitions, and really only taught students enough to do well on the exam; I don't think he provided us with any more knowledge than was necessary. Lectures are somewhat useless as they are less thorough than the textbook and cover less. You learn more from reading than you do from showing up to class. ",
            "\u00a0The course was well-organized: I felt like I could compartmentalize what we'd learned. I'm also really glad I took the seminar and not the lecture - I saw the homework for the alternative, and it was mostly just really complicated math. \r\n\r\nHowever, it was not always clear what material we needed to know from the book. There were several concepts in the reading (ex. game theory as applied to 'hawks/doves' in a population, the Chamberlain model, and an in-depth understanding of spatial modeling) that we didn't cover in class and didn't really have to know for the exams. As a time-saver, it would be nice to get a list of skipped topics. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this class is the support system provided by the professor and the tutors, both of which helped me learn how to do the problem sets and understand the various applications of the equations. The necessary math intuition to immediately grasp all of the possible ways of solving the problems is a weakness in this course, even though calculus is a prerequisite. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Koker was enthusiastic about providing extra help and answering questions. His office hours were especially valuable to help with the problem sets. The lectures were engaging and Professor Koker's real-life examples caused me to think about the world in new and fascinating ways. There were many interesting connections between economic concepts and the world that I would have not have thought of without the class.\r\n\r\nA weakness of this course is that so much of the final grade depends on the exams and it is very difficult to recover a grade if an exam doesn't go well. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths: The teacher, textbook, and other resources. Tolga is an amazing teacher who is extremely helpful. The textbook is also relatively easy to read and there are TAs who are available for office hours. In addition, Tolga genuinely believes in all of his students and wants them to do well. \r\n\r\nThe weaknesses: I don't think there are weaknesses of this course, other than the curve. ",
            "\u00a0Major strength is great teaching and support. The textbook was clear and well-integrated. The problem sets were at a good level and helped me learn. \r\n\r\nWeakness is sometimes the lectures moved to quickly when introducing new concepts. At times, felt like I was asked to memorize or just follow steps when it would have been better to spend more time explaining the underlying math. (e.g., double the slope when doing profit maximization? I somehow missed the justification ((if one was given)) the first time and was lost for the next two weeks until someone gave me a 2 minute calculus explanation) ",
            "\u00a0The class was very well structured, Professor Koker efficiently allotted time for lecture and discussion. \r\n\r\nThe class seemed to me like a non-intro course - the students who took microeconomics in high school definitely had an advantage over those who did not, for the class went at a relatively rapid pace potentially causing the student to have to reteach himself concepts learned in class. ",
            "\u00a0Great course! Super organized. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I would HIGHLY recommend this class to any student interested.Professor Koker is amazing, and you will have a much better experience in the seminar than in the lecture. Many students are discouraged from taking the class because of a tough curve, but I honestly feel like the class was worth the difficult grading. There are certain classes at Yale that are worth taking a lower grade and ECON 110 with Professor Tolga Koker is one of them. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to a friend. The professor is amazing, and the class material is highly applicable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Tolga is amazing! ",
            "\u00a0Tolga does his best to make sure his students are engaged in learning. He has expansive experience in teaching the subject, and constantly attempts to find the most efficient ways for the students to absorb the materials. This course is best for those seeking to take introduction to microeconomics. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to go into econ you probably have to. Otherwise, youll definitely learn some interesting concepts and see the world in a new way, but much of the class is math and graph based so dont expect a lot of content on economic policy or too many real world examples ",
            "\u00a0From what I've heard, the seminar version (110) is much more engaging than the lecture version (115), which is probably true, but I don't think 110 was that thorough. Students were overconcerned about exams, and Tolga was a little too focused on catering to the students' needs (oversimplified definitions, explanations). However, if you want to see what economics is all about, and need an introductory course before you hop into the rather difficult intermediate-level courses, 110 is your best bet. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student because of the small class size, the emphasis on understanding between professor and student, and how it acts as an amazing baseline to future economic classes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, while the exams were difficult, Professor Koker is an engaging lecturer and truly cares about his students and their learning. As long as you space out your studying, you will be able to learn the large amount of material. The week-to-week workload is not much at all, especially if you go to office hours for help with the problem sets. However, you can run into trouble if you fall behind on the material and wait until before each exam to start studying everything. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to students who are willing to invest a lot of time into it. If not, then it probably isn't a good fit. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah I would say take it over the lecture since it's so much more fun and engaging. You just have to be prepared to actually study outside of class and not let yourself fall behind. ",
            "\u00a0If the student is serious about pursuing economics, this seminar styled class is the best fit for intro microeconomics - if he or she is not planning on pursuing economic study, I would recommend the lecture. ",
            "\u00a0I would say that this is a necessary course for further economic education and is a helpful course for anyone looking for grounding in basic economic theory. It is perhaps more interesting than a standard intro micro course because of the behavioral theory behind the concepts - it was not just dry maths. I would recommend it but only if you are genuinely interested in economics, otherwise you will find it laborious. ",
            "\u00a0Take it! The instructor is great. "
