            "\u00a0Learned a lot about Irish culture ad history, and about modernism ",
            "\u00a0I definitely improved my literary analysis skills and my general knowledge of the Irish Literary Revival. ",
            "\u00a0I became far more familiar with the Irish literary canon, especially the ways in which Irish history finds its way into works that I would normally only encounter in contexts that weren't specifically Irish, which definitely gave me a much appreciated different perspective on what we read. "

            "\u00a0Honestly one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. The reading list cannot be beaten, I was basically given the opportunity to read a bunch of literature I wanted to read anyway and then discuss it with a very engaged professor and group of fellow students. Unlike other seminars I've taken, the workload was never overwhelming, which really allowed us to delve in deeply during discussions. ",
            "\u00a0This is a FANTASTIC course. Take it take it take it, even if you think you don't have much of an interest in the material or you've read some of the books before. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this course. The texts were fascinating and there was always a lot to discuss, which was great. Sometimes the amount of reading for a week was daunting, but other than that I have no complaints at all. ",
            "\u00a0More assignments would be good. However, the material itself and the professor (Joe Cleary) are huge strengths. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I think this course was very strong, and got much stronger as the semester went on. The discussions were lively and productive, the readings were fascinating, and Professor Cleary did a great job of giving us the context and background information we needed to engage more fully with what we read. The only weakness I can think of is that, especially earlier in the semester, the discussions tended to get a bit derailed when dominated by specific people. Professor Cleary definitely got better at moving the discussion forward in these cases by the end of the semester, but more of that early on would definitely have made the class more fun. "

            "\u00a0Definitely, I already have! ",
            "\u00a0Irish Lit is an amazing English class. Professor Cleary is amazing, the reading is interesting and unpretentious, and the students that choose to take this class are great. If you are looking for a highly engaging English course, I strongly recommend Irish Lit. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this class! The readings are all very interesting (even if Ulysses is a huge slog, it is a worthwhile text) and the Irish Literary Revival is a very cool period and movement to learn about. Joe Cleary is great and really cares about the subject matter!! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely take it. Joe Cleary is (genuinely) awesome, and the material is fantastic. Watch out for Ulysses, though. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student! It's a fun and somewhat eclectic mix of readings, and Professor Cleary spreads his enthusiasm about the work we read to the whole class. In the case of our class, discussions were very lively, and almost everyone put a lot of energy into engaging with what we'd read. "
