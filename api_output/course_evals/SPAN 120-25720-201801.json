            "\u00a0Reading, writing, listening, and speaking in the past, future, and present using both the indicative and the subjunctive. Talking about health, technology, the city, the environment, and the workplace. Learning about Latin American culture. ",
            "\u00a0I learned intermediate level Spanish ",
            "\u00a0I developed the ability to speak Spanish more conversationally than I had before. I learned many new forms of grammar and tenses, and a lot of new vocabulary. I also developed a better ability to read and comprehend in Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0I've become more fluent in Spanish and gained greater insight into Spanish-speaking countries histories and cultures. ",

This includes movies, role-playing activities, interesting readings, and cultural videos. Overall, the course's strength is definitely in its efforts to increase student engagement and in its ability to teach students things beyond reading, speaking, and writing. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the organization and quality of the content  in the curriculum\r\nWeaknesses: not enough communicative activities in class to prepare us for the oral evaluation. not enough time to take the final exam ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: oral presentations, listening activities, teaching grammar\r\nWeaknesses: Reading comprehension. The level at which we were expected to read and understand certain stories, books, and articles was too high for the class. I struggled with understanding what I was reading most of the time. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoy the small class size. I also think the various methods used to teach (such as oral presentations, written exams, speaking in class, reading literature, etc.) help to create a better, more well-rounded course that facilitated student learning. ",
            "\u00a0The course is good at teaching you lessons and new grammar but not set up as well for actually learning everything.  Every day is a new lesson and while they are not necessarily individually challenging, there is not enough time set up for reviewing, talking, and using the Spanish to incorporate the grammar structures.  There also isn't enough opportunities for additional practice as you essentially do all the problems available in the book and online.  This class just has a high volume of grammatical material to go through and it sacrifices a lot of general fluency to do so. "

            "\u00a0Yes! SPAN 120 is not hard nor require much time commitment IF you have good study habits. On top of that, it is rewarding as it is really in SPAN 120 that you begin to use foundational knowledge of Spanish as a tool to access other cultures. ",
            "\u00a0I was concerned going into this semester because Professor Vazquez had lower reviews than the other professors, but she is very nice and grades very fairly and im glad I ended up in her section. However, I think your experience will mostly depend on how much you like Spanish. ",
