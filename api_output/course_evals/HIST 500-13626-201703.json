            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the methods of research and investigation used by historians in fields outside of the early modern period. Not all of them can be applied to my work, but I have definitely found some that will prove beneficial. I also learned about some of the major works and ideas in history that I had previously been unaware of. ",

            "\u00a0A broad grounding in historiography outside my subfield. Working with a wide spectrum of secondary literature was very thought provoking and offered me critical distance to reflect on the purpose of our discipline. "

            "\u00a0A core strength was the \"introduction assignment\" in which each participant chose a book of central importance to their respective subfield. I felt that this was a very effective means for each of us to get to know one another's work. In the future maybe this assignment could be expanded so participants could present on a secondary source and a primary source of central importance to their own research. "
