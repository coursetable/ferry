            "\u00a0A critical understanding of the role of race and racism in a myriad of American institutions ",
            "\u00a0i gained a lot of broad knowledge about the different interventions into theorizing and discussing race. i feel like i've gained a good overview of the literature out there as well as the different types of methodologies used to do this research. ",
            "\u00a0One of the main skills I acquired in this course is the ability to think critically about the production of scholarship that relates to the history of races and racial formation. Through the critical journal assignments, I was tasked with identifying main arguments of monographs and how each chapter of the book helps construct said argument. I learned how to offer insight on how five or six different books connected with each other, based on theme, method, or field of study. This includes thinking critically about the sources used in constructing an argument. \r\n\r\nI gained knowledge related to the history of racial formation in the United States. From a variety of fields, such as anthropology, literature, performance studies, history, and politics, this course exposed me to a variety of leading scholars who dedicate themselves to elucidating the effects produced by racial politics. \r\n\r\nAnother skill I gained was the ability to talk succinctly about a specific book, in order to summarize the author's thesis, background, process, and significance. From elevator pitches to short academic presentations, it is important to know how to explain long, complicated books in a few short sentences. This class helped me with this task. \r\n\r\nLastly, through the final assignment, I learned how to design a college-level course by constructing a class syllabus. This exercise allowed me to synthesize a whole field/subject of study into a single course. I learned how to put authors and texts in conversation with each other, in order to provide students with complex and nuanced understandings of the history of indigenous borderlands. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about a number of context and historical events that have shaped racial formation mostly in the United States over the nineteenth and early twentieth century "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The structure of the course is excellent, providing for thematic engagements with race and race-making across American history and culture. ",
            "\u00a0The multi-book choice list was such a strength, but perhaps requiring those who deviate to read a review of the book of the week could be a way to bring us all on an even more similar page? ",
            "\u00a0i appreciated that the syllabus was designed to give us some flexibility as to which texts we wanted to commit to for the week. this was also great in the classroom as we were able to learn from each other. one drawback to this is that the discussion was a bit difficult to manage as all books had to be summarized, and the main points of discussion focused on the assigned text of the week. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the many academic fields that were engaged in this course, through both the material of the course as well as through various backgrounds of those taking the course, made this class truly generative and rewarding. I valued everyone's engagement with the texts and subject material. Also, the ability to gain knowledge about five-six different books per week was helpful for making lists for oral exams. \r\n\r\nAnother strength was the task of reading and summarizing the published reviews on a given book. Learning how to gauge the reception of specific scholarship,  and how that reception differs from field to field, journal to journal, was revelatory on the requirements and expectations of specific academic fields.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes becoming involved in the class discussion when you didn't read the main book of the week was difficult. However, I understand two hours is very limited amount of time to talk about one book, let alone six. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, i really did have so many takeaways, especially following the midterm. The conversations we had in class really pushed me to think about race and its formation in even more expansive ways that feel integral to my future work. ",
            "\u00a0definitely! i appreciate the difficult questions that the instructor poses and the types of conversations that the course material instigates. i also feel like the course allowed us to think about professionalization in a very natural way as we discussed methodologies and other decisions throughout the writing process. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course is great if studying the history of race or interested in expanding understanding of how race and racial thought pervade all aspects of life. This class is definitely recommended! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think this course is important for anyone that is working on race in their work. "
