            "\u00a0I learned how to extrapolate the most information out of articles without necessarily reading the whole thing. Sometimes we had complex, long articles and it didn't make sense to read the whole thing so I learned how to just take the most important information from the articles. I also learned so much about how information is construed in the media and the class has made me so much more aware of the things I see in media now. ",
            "\u00a0Learnt about interesting topics through the readings, but not much in the way of writing: style, structure, etc. The knowledge/skills/insights learnt are entirely dependent on the section teacher and topic of the section chosen, so the same cannot be said for all 114 sections. ",
            "\u00a0This class really helped develop my writing skills and get a taste of what writing at a college level should be. I realized the importance of revision in particular.  Everyone should take a 114 to improve their writing. ",
            "\u00a0I developed the skill of formulating a claim and subclaims for an essay and how to support these claims in a clear way. ",
            "\u00a0How too better write papers ",
            "\u00a0This course has significantly developed my skills as a writer and a critical thinker. It has taught me to properly develop ideas and relay ideas to a reader. ",
            "\u00a0you learn how to frame your argument well ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write more clearly, how to recognize a tension within the text and form a claim (thesis), and how to conduct research through Yale's resources. "

            "\u00a0This course was intriguing and we learned a lot of interesting things, but sometimes the work felt overwhelming, especially during the beginning of the year. Maybe we could have had a bit more of a transition period. ",
            "\u00a0The material covered in Media Frenzy was very interesting but unfortunately the course was not structured well. It was split into four modules; although they all shared some common aspects, they did not form a coherent class, meaning the readings applied only to specific weeks and could not be referenced from multiple perspectives. The course also offered very little in the way of 'learning how to write', which is to be expected from an introductory English class. We were required to write 4 papers, and to meet with the instructor multiple times throughout the semester, but never received targeted feedback about formulating a thesis/claim and arguing for it, whereas we spent almost two full classes learning how to quote from and cite sources, which really could have been googled if necessary. The papers are supposed to be of the same format/type across 114 sections, which resulted in the prompts/questions seeming forced and, at times, only distantly related to the readings they were supposed to reference. ",
            "\u00a0The layout and structure was helpful in easing us into writing and overall the 114 curriculum is great. Yahel as a professor also was extremely engaging and invested in the class.  She really wanted all of us to improve and cared about making our writing better.  She was always available to meet with outside of class to discuss ideas and brainstorm ways to start or improve papers.  This was very helpful for my own writing. At times the class felt like we were all learning together, Yahel included, especially in terms of communicating how to revise our papers.  So at times, there was a disconnect in her expectations and our ideas and understanding of her feedback.  Throughout the semester this did improve and I feel that in future classes this won't be as much of an issue.  The material itself was very interesting and you could tell Yahel was very passionate about true crime and sensationalism. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were the meetings with the instructor before every papers due date and the high level of engagement with the instructor and students. ",
            "\u00a0This class was very good in working with students personally to better their writing skills. The class could focus more on writing skills and less on readings. ",
            "\u00a0the teacher  is amazing but the course is very intense ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course was the professor and the weakness was the course itself. English 114 has a flawed curriculum. Students, who are majority first years, are thrown into an environment which questions their ability to write and prompts them to re-evaluate everything they've known about writing. I understand that \"college-level\" writing is more advanced, but not to the level of spending hours trying to find a \"claim\" and feeling like your writing does not meet the unrealistic standards set by the course. The papers are spaced too closely, forcing students to start the readings for a whole new section without finishing their previous papers. This course can improve by making the last paper due during finals week and consequently giving additional time for the previous papers. This would also give students time to really evaluate their former papers and improve their writing. The course was extremely intense (and frustrating) during the first 2 months then more relaxed towards the end of the semester. Instead, the course can be more consistent and steady with improved deadlines. "

            "\u00a0Yes! It was an interesting class and it helped me with my writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you need a relatively low-stress writing credit. No, if you actually want to improve your writing and learn to formulate a strong thesis -- in this case, choosing a section taught by a professor/someone who has far more experience teaching 114 over a graduate student is absolutely vital. ",
            "\u00a0Everyone should take a 114 at least once so yes for sure, and if this is one that you get into, Yahel is a great professor. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to other students who want to improve their writing skills and who are interested in true crime new stories. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course does a very good job of teaching students to be better writers. ",
            "\u00a0if you like crime and media, go for it ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend this course to other students who are interested in the specific English 114 section being taught (aka, Media Frenzy). If you are just looking for a WR credit, or if you've heard \"great\" things about English 114... don't take this course. It's not worth it. There are many more enjoyable WR classes that are less intense. This class is catered towards first-year students. If you are not a first-year student, I do not recommend taking English 114. Although English 114 itself is organized very poorly, this specific course, Media Frenzy, covered very interesting topics and the instructor was great. If you are interested in crime then the content of this course will be interesting. Take that with a grain of salt though, because the course still follows the English 114 guidelines and is very fast-paced, which subsequently makes the Media Frenzy section less enjoyable. "
