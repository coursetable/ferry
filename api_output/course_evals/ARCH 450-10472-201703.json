            "\u00a0This was an amazing studio with realistic yet whimsical projects. Best studio at Yale so far ",
            "\u00a0I took the liberty of using this course to pick up some fabrication skills. \r\nI learned how to mill, some stuff about plaster, some photoshopping of photos, and general model-making stuff.\r\n\r\nI tried to learn some balance between making a project construct-able and making a project creative. ",
            "\u00a0I feel that I developed significantly as an architecture student throughout this course. I learned how to analyze, discuss, and produce in productive ways, which was a new and very positive experience. ",
            "\u00a0As the first of two advanced undergraduate studios, the class is geared toward helping us develop tools and methods as architects and designers. We explored three very different but similarly challenging and excellent projects, with our semester final project the most complex assignment Ive  yet undertaken as a designer. Turner and the teaching staff made it a priority that we were the captains of our own ships and our design explorations and experiments were supported, but left up to us to successfully realize and represent. No hand holding, just encouragement and insightful feedback and pushes to consider other ideas just a remarkable and productive way of learning. This class will be hard to beat. "

            "\u00a0The structure of the class / the teaching staff is incredibly supportive of your own interests /  encourages personal exploration. I almost wish the class weren't so open-ended. Sometimes I wish I got a little more direction. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the freedom Prof. Turner Brooks gives in the deliverables, the design process, the style of the project, and even in some cases the assignment itself, if a student is really enthusiastic about completing the project with a different program in mind.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses? Not sure. If you aren't good at pacing yourself independently, yo will have a hell of a finals period. If you aren't really motivated, you might not get out of it as much as you could in terms of going outside your comfort zone. I tried going outside mu comfort zone and fell into a few dead-ends that only time constraints could pull me out of. ",
            "\u00a0This class is so wonderful. Not only was this my favorite studio, but it was one of my favorite classes at Yale so far. Every project was inspiring. I do wish we would have had more time for the second project, as many of the final products were unfortunately underdeveloped. ",
            "\u00a0I dont know what could better, truly. This class was a treat.\r\n\r\nHowever, a simple logistical issue that would help all undergraduate studios: please include the mandatory Friday class times in the course schedule in OCS, YBB, and just in general in the registrars office. The assumption in all undergraduate studios is that we have 2 hours of class M, W, F, and the course credits / official hours should reflect that understanding. Classmates who have Friday course conflicts should know what they are getting into without having to jump through extra, unofficially official hoops. "

            "\u00a0It's an incredible, rewarding, enjoyable, amazing reward to surviving junior year. Turner is inspiring and makes the hours spent in studio entirely worth it. After considering dropping the design track, this course has made me want to pursue architecture as a career. ",
            "\u00a0I recommend studio courses in general because there is something to say about taking ownership of a project with the guidance of people who specialize in what you're doing.\r\n\r\nThat said, I'm broke and spend $1500 this semester. ",
            "\u00a0If you're taking this, it's because you have to, but it is such a great course. Enjoy it and make the most of it, because it will truly change your studio experience. This studio is like a prize for having made it through junior year. ",
            "\u00a0This is the best class experience Ive ever had at Yale bar none. Turner and the teaching staff really made it a priority to help our class explore as designers without sacrificing the rigor of our ideas or the projects he chose for us. The studios organization was flexible enough, but by having each part of the semester anchored in the three projects, I never felt adrift. Have fun, and relish being able to have so much say over your work!! "
