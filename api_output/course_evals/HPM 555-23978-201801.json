Was more useful for understanding an organization than for actually learning new skills. \r\n\r\nIf you have multiple students at the same place, please be careful about not having one mentor the other. At times, it felt like I was being asked to mentor my colleague, which both put me in an awkward position and took time away from what I wanted to learn in my limited time.\r\n\r\nOverall, an amazing experience however!
