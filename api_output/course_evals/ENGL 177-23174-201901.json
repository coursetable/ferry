            "\u00a0I learned much about Medieval Drama and Christianity ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me almost everything I know about medieval literature, and certainly everything I know about medieval drama. It was a wonderful plunge into the history, theology, and literature of the medieval period, and I found out endlessly fascinating things about medieval culture that I had never known before! The discussions, too, were extremely interesting - I think that all of us were deeply engaged with the material and the course, and I always really looked forward to class time. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about the traditional of Medieval plays (their performance, content, etc.) and their relation to both contemporary criticism and contemporary art. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed learning about York Cycle plays and the traditions that underlie liturgical plays. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about how to read and interpret medieval dramatic texts as well as to think critically about medieval texts through a modern lens. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: Incredibly knowledgeable professor who is very kind and thoughtful. I very much enjoyed when there were creative opportunities in the essays. I also especially enjoyed when we read modern works that were based on Medieval plays. \r\nWeaknesses: The readings and the bi-weekly blog posts were definitely a lot of work. Maybe considering making the blog posts weekly or cutting down on some of the readings? ",
            "\u00a0The course is extremely good at offering a comprehensive overview of medieval drama and, thereby, offers a specific and yet encompassing look into medieval culture. I think that the ways that theory on drama, Christianity, and history intersected with the plays we read really helped me to understand and contextualize the things that the plays were doing. I wish we could have seen more visual performances from and about the medieval period, but I understand the logistical constraints that prevented us from doing so. ",
            "\u00a0Great course overall  well designed integration between the medieval drama and contemporary interpretations. Thoughtful discussion about the theater in its context, with great secondary sources that shed light on the theater, which itself is sometimes a bit rough. The assignments build well on each on each other, and the progression of the course works well. I would only suggest that the expectations for the in-class presentations and the blog posts be explained more specifically, as it was difficult to determine the standard for them. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was a great survey into a field I knew virtually knew nothing about (and, by extension, was a great course on Christianity). While I loved the discussions, I do feel that sometimes classes became repetitive as we frequently relied on the structure of reading, blog posts, and in-class discussions. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed this course. Perhaps we could have earlier started with the discussion method where we all direct the conversation instead of Professor Brantley having to make connections across comments. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed being able to read works from an often-neglected era and was often delighted by how resonant they still are with our times, as well as how they diverged from \"modern\" conceptions of literature. I think the class's biggest weakness is that everyone was operating based on vastly different levels of knowledge of the medieval period and Christianity in general. I have taken several Catholic theology classes, and yet I'm not particularly well-versed in medieval theology and did find myself confused at times. I could tell from class discussions that many people in the class had little to no working knowledge of Christianity, which is a problem when we're reading plays that are more often than not explicitly Christian and staged in an entirely religious manner. As a result, discussions were sometimes incoherent, as everyone was trying to analyze these plays through various anachronistic lenses (i.e. postmodern literary theory), none of which really analyzed the plays on their own, usually religious, terms. ",
            "\u00a0I think it might have been helpful for more Christian theology to be explained in general at the beginning of the course, so that students could be made to feel more comfortable with the content of the medieval plays we read. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this to another student interested in Christianity/Medieval plays or anyone who needs to satisfy the Medieval requirement. The plays were not too difficult to read. Definitely a significant amount of reading per week ",
            "\u00a0This course is a wonderful way to fulfill your medieval requirement! When I first walked into the class, I was not excited; I thought about medieval literature and culture the way that a lot of people do, as somewhat boring and simple. The literature, theory, and discussion of the class, however, quickly proved me wrong, and professor Brantley's own energy and enthusiasm pulled me and the rest of the class into a whirlwind of conversation that was at once deeply engaging, endlessly fascinating, and eye-opening; I'm actually, curious to learn more about medieval culture, and look forward to taking another class in it! ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would definitely recommend this class  this is certainly a great class to fulfill your medieval requirement, but more than that I found myself consistently surprised by how much I enjoyed the course. The medieval theater may not always be the best theater, but the discussion of it was quite fruitful, and the modern theater interpretations we read were excellent, honestly some of the best theater I've ever read. The academic discussion was rigorous but not intimidating, and Prof. Brantley did a wonderful job leading the class. ",
            "\u00a0it is a decent medieval credit. prof brantley is great! some of the texts are really interesting. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to learn about a cool, esoteric dramatic tradition, this is the class for you. You read interesting plays and, by extension, learn a great deal about the history of Christianity and its relation to performance arts. ",
            "\u00a0Its a great course and a wonderful medieval credo for an English major! ",
            "\u00a0Medieval stuff in general gets a bad reputation but it's actually pretty interesting and transgressive in its own way. A good course to fulfill the medieval distribution requirement. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because it really helped to inform my understanding of what came before early modern English literature. "
