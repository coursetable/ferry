            "\u00a0I got much better at drawing. I learned about contouring, value, perspective, and gesture. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to observe and interact with objects from the perspective of an artist, mainly utilizing charcoal and graphite to draw perspective, still lives, models, and more. We also dabbled in other mediums like ink, collage, and conte crayon. ",
            "\u00a0I'm definitely more comfortable drawing now. I don't know if my level of technical knowledge has increased in a huge way. That wasn't really Troy's style of teaching. But he did teach us what makes an interesting drawing. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a lot of skills in drawing from life. I had a lot of drawing experience before this class, but I mostly only did small things from imaginations and didn't really try to do anything out of my comfort zone. I learned how to produce a lot of work in a short amount of time and not be afraid of things that I was unsure of. ",
            "\u00a0I bettered my drawing skills by a million! I have always struggled with perspective and filling the page, but this class challenged me and helped me practice those skills. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to draw shapes and lines, and how to shade and add value to drawings. Troy's approach to teaching drawing was very methodical we started by learning to draw contour lines, then moved to shading in pencil and charcoal, learned a bit of ink and collage, and ended on figure drawing. It was very helpful to build on each of the previous lessons, and great to see concrete progress each week. "

            "\u00a0Strengths - Good intro to drawing. Weaknesses - Artists of varying previous skill level all grouped together and presumably evaluated on the same criteria. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the survey aspect of this class, as we tried a lot of stuff. I also enjoyed how pieces were observed based on improvement and vision, and overall everyone was really positive about everyone else's work.\r\n\r\nThere were a lot of still lives in this class, to the point where it was getting sort of boring, and I wish we could have used color more in our pieces. ",
            "\u00a0I wish there was more technical instruction more focus on proper form and technique (back to the basics). However, I really do admire Troy's teaching style overall. I learned that there's great value in just jumping in and making a lot. You definitely get better that way. I loved the exposure to a wide range of media. ",
            "\u00a0I liked that there was a wide range of assignments and mediums. Even someone with a lot of experience drawing would have the opportunities to learn new things, and everyone who took the class improved a lot. I also think that the pace of the class was good and went in a certain order that made things easy to learn. The homework was sometimes time consuming, but that comes with any art project or class. I also wish we had more critiques but we only had a limited amount of class time and they could sometimes be awkward. ",
            "\u00a0I think the instruction during class time was very helpful and individualized, it was a bit of homework, but great and really challenged the practice of the skill that was reviewed in class. ",
            "\u00a0I wish we had gotten more specific guidance on basic drawing techniques. I didn't think it was helpful to look at powerpoint presentations. I think that at least in the beginning the drawing assignments should be specifically geared towards developing specific techniques. I also wish we had gotten more concrete criticisms of our drawings. ",
            "\u00a0A big strength is the sheer amount of drawing you have to do, which by default will make you improve.  The homework assignments were always different and challenged me to draw on a much bigger scale and practice different skills we were learning. One weakness was that there wasn't always concrete feedback on the homework assignments  I sometimes felt like I had to ask about specific things for the instructors to address them. "

            "\u00a0Definitely. It's not a gut, since if you want your drawings to be any good then they'll take time, but it's so much fun to get better at drawing and to end up with some pretty cool artwork at the end of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Even if you don't have a tone of experience with drawing, Troy is super supportive of everyone's growth, given that they put in the effort. ",
            "\u00a0It's a fun class. There's not much technical instruction, more learning by doing. A highlight was seeing my classmates' work  there were a lot talented artists! I learned a lot from them. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it to another student who is willing to put in the work to improve and produce quality work. There sometimes was a gap in how much effort people put into assignments with some people clearly spending a lot more time than others, but they were rewarded by improving more than people who didn't try as hard. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It definitely strengthens all of your drawing abilities and develops all of your techniques. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It's a lot of work but really fun break from other types of assignments. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone, regardless of artistic ability. I came in only able to draw little cartoons, and now I'm confident in my ability to draw and shade the things in front of me. Taking an art class was such a nice change of pace from writing papers and doing problem sets all the time, and it was one of the few courses I've taken where I've seen a concrete improvement in my skills/knowledge by the end of the semester, which was incredibly gratifying. It's very much a class where you'll get out what you put in, but you'll want to put in the work and be so proud of the things you can create. There was a lot of work outside of class, but it was only as much work as the time I decided to spend on it. Troy is a great instructor and a wonderful person. His approach is fairly traditional, which is nice because each of the lessons builds on a previous one, so you learn lines, then shading, then different mediums, and then a bit of figure drawing. He always wears wide, layered clothes, and once in December he was wearing red pants and a red jacket with wire-rimmed glasses and he said he looked like Mrs. Clause. It was very charming. "
