Professor Peters would start each lecture with an \"In the News\" segment. He would find a news article (and encouraged us to send him ones we found as well) about macroeconomics topics in the real world. For example, we covered topics such as Brexit, the Green New Deal, how technology is affecting unemployment, etc. ",

            "\u00a0A strength of this course was the constant tying-back of concepts we covered in class to news stories, as it truly emphasized the practicality and significance of the content we were learning. Too often in economics classes, we get bogged down in mathematical equations and forget that the models we study have relevance to the real world, but this class did an excellent job of balancing both the nitty-gritty mathematical details and the real-world examples. The main weakness of this course was the heavy weight placed on all of the exams, particularly the final which was worth 50 percent of the final grade. I believe that having so much of a weight on one exam is unfair, and it might be better for there to be two midterms for the class in order to spread out the weighting of each exam. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Peters tries to engage his students during the lectures through frequent questions, which I appreciate.\r\nWeaknesses: More preparation for exams could be offered. ",
            "\u00a0This is a rigorous course that well prepares students for Macroeconomics. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Existing sections allowed for study groups to form, which helped with the challenging problem sets.\r\n\r\nCons: The Slides have a lot of hidden information in terms for assumption for models, and do not provide enough information to explain the nuances of macroeconomics. In lecture, the professor only hints at these assumptions and hidden calculations through anecdotes or casual statements, which makes it incredibly difficult to catch and understand. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Prof Peters is great\r\nWeakness: TAs are really bad ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the material is very interesting and applies to what I read every day in the news. Professor Peters demonstrates this by bringing in news articles to class often. The problem sets and exams provide new real-world scenarios to apply the theory and skills we've learned in class. ",
            "\u00a0I really wanted to like this class, but ultimately felt that it was difficult to tie concepts together. For example, I didn't really get how the separate lectures on consumption, investment, the Phillips Curve and so on ties together, until the very last lecture on the AS-AD model when Prof. Peters provided a summary. I wish that this overview was done earlier, so we know how each component fits into the larger framework. I think the lectures themselves are also very big-picture and I wish we spent more time talking about the math (and how economic intuition connects to it), because this was mostly tested on the exam and we need to get the math part right to be able to adapt the models to new situations. \r\n\r\nThe exam questions also felt very tricky and didn't really test how well we studied, but how fast we can change our models to suit the modifications on the exam questions. The True/False questions also tend to be tricky and test the finer details of the concepts in class. Perhaps this was the professor's aim, but it really disadvantages students who might've prepared a lot practicing PSET questions or reviewing the slides, but can't have the light-bulb moment that connects the dots together during the exams. \r\n\r\nIn the earlier portions of the class, I also felt slightly uncomfortable when the professor made comments about how India is decades behind the US and (a direct quote from the slide) \"India today is as rich as the US in 1880.\" Maybe this comment might be right in a strictly economic sense, or through GDP calculation, but it just gives a grossly wrong impression to students that the US is somehow more \"advanced\" than a country like India. Especially with the comment about India today being like the US in 1880, it just gives a wrong perception about how societies in developing countries exist right now. In addition, we also take as given how the lack of TFP, or the lack of capital in particular countries make them \"less\" than the US, which consistently occupies the number 1 spot in our development accounting models (so all countries are analyzed in comparison to the US, perhaps reflecting how US-centric the field of economics is). But, the question is: what made these countries lack TFP/capital to be able to achieve a level of long-run growth like the US? Even though it's a macro lecture, some insertion of economic history, such as the impact of colonialism on the lack of TFP/capital in developing countries, e.g. Daron Acemoglu's research on the impact of colonialism on economic institutions, or Melissa Dell's research on the persistent effects of Peru's forced mining labor system, can give a more balanced perspective. Perhaps this is a broader critique of economics as a whole, but I hope that these small adjustments can be made. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: detailed lectures, good sections, approachable material. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: exam questions were often unnecessarily algebraically complicated versions of past homework problems or unnecessarily simplified (to the point of confusion) ",
            "\u00a0Professor Peters is honestly one of the best professors I have ever had. He is a very engaging lecturer who explains all the material very clearly and poses questions to the class to encourage participation/discussion. He also always tries to connect the material to the real world by providing examples (for example, he starts each class with a news article that relates to macroeconomics). The psets/exams were also very fair (except for the final, which I found to be very hard). We did the psets 1 week behind the lecture, which meant that once we started the pset, we had already finished learning the material for the pset, which was helpful. I also had a great TA (John) who explained concepts very well and did example questions in class. Therefore, the psets were not too challenging. ",
            "\u00a0It's a great class for finetuning economic intuitions and learning to make theory-grounded arguments about real-world data. Please use more rigorous math (even just a wider use of basic calculus would make things simpler and more elegant). Also, the professor isn't the best lecturer, and he poorly understands what we already know. For example, he'll ask the simplest question and then sit there for 5 minutes before someone gives the answer everyone already knew to begin with. Not a huge deal though, and overall still a good class. ",
            "\u00a0This course could be GREATLY improved by the provision of lecture notes by the professor. The professor said he would have lecture notes IN ADDITION to slides in his syllabys, but only provided slides for students. As the slides were not very detailed, I would sometimes spend hours confused/trying to glean information from the slides. If there were comprehensive lecture notes in addition, I would have wasted much less time trying to figure out what the professor was trying to say in his slides. I would have appreciated the professor honoring the syllabus. ",
            "\u00a0The course is super interesting in my opinion. I love the content. Course is challenging in that it is just really hard. Psets often take you way outside your comfort zone of what was discusses in class, as well as lecture. But that made it all the more fun to conquer. ",
            "\u00a0The lack of TA office hours in the beginning of the semester was a hindrance to completing the problem sets. Moreover, the exams were constructed in such a way that error propagation was not taken into account for grading and the core concepts of the course were not tested so much as algebraic derivations. ",
            "\u00a0I wish there was greater standardization of grading of problem sets. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were a little hard to follow at times, and I wish the slides were more detailed. ",
            "\u00a0Professor was very good at explaining concepts, but I wish he focused on the math a little more. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths include the structure of the lectures and how Professor Peters progresses the class through macroeconomic theory before taking the last few lectures to talk about disparity and poverty--two very important topics that often get neglected. Some of the weaknesses include the setting of the lecture in Sudler Hall, where is is often dark and where noise does not travel well. This makes it somewhat hard to be fully engaged in a long lecture at times. ",
            "\u00a0The information was clear and well-structured. I found the lectures to be slow-moving in comparison to other economics courses I have taken. ",
            "\u00a0After close to a half-dozen courses in the econ department, this course made me realize how badly the econ foundation sequence needs to be overhauled at Yale. I feel like I learned conceptually very little in this course, mostly just some extra bells and whistles on the same models from intro macro. The material is not taught in an interesting or memorable manner, and the psets are mostly about solving proofs and doing Excel busywork rather than applying the content in interesting ways. Professor Peters is a savvy and thoughtful professor, and the fact that even he can't figure out how to teach this content in an engaging way is a serious sign that the content itself needs to be changed. I think the econ department should spend some serious time re-evaluating which concepts are worthy of being included in this course. ",

While the math is not incredibly complex or challenging, it still is a major part of the class. If you are looking to build your economic intuition, then perhaps another class is better suited for you. This class, however, still taught me quite a lot and I am very happy that I decided to take it. ",

After taking the intro sequence, I wanted to learn more about economics even though I knew it wasn't going to be my major. This class introduced more advanced techniques but no new concepts that could lend the insight into the world of our economy that every citizen should have. ",
            "\u00a0If you're an economics major, yes you need to take it.\r\n\r\nIf you just want to understand general macroeconomics, I recommend not skipping the introductory class, as you will be taking the class in Econ or Econ + Math majors who have far more econ experience than you otherwise. ",
            "\u00a0Maybe. There are a lot of interesting concepts in here-- but I personally didn't really like the class. The economics curve in general is pretty stupid. You're probably taking this for your major, so it doesn't really matter. If you're pretty interested in like how the central bank and economy work, the second half of this course will be pretty interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Even though the final exam kind of destroyed me, this class is a fair one. Michael Peters and the teaching fellows (shout out to John Findlay) work hard to answer questions and to clarify confusing parts of the material. If you're going to be an Economics major, you'll have to take ECON 122, so you might as well take it with Michael Peters. He's a really endearing person, and you can tell he's got a passion for making the field of economics better with every lecture. ",
            "\u00a0You would only take this course if you are deep in the economics sequence, but I would still recommend it because it is well-taught, interesting, and feels like you are learning about concepts that have relevance to the world ",
            "\u00a0Yes, macroeconomics is a part of all of our lives. This class gives you a toolkit to understand the many moving pieces of our economy. ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely!! I know the micro/macro sequence in the econ major is usually very dry and people usually just want to get them over with. However, I really loved Intermediate Macroeconomics. It is much more interesting than microeconomics because you do less math (the occasional derivative) and you can see how the material you're learning can be applied to / connects to real world events. For me, I enjoy classes that are less theoretical and actually have real-world applications. This class also changed the way I view the world. For example, we attempted to answer many open-ended questions by learning the various models (are countries rich because they have more capital or tech or both? Why is the typical American 10 times richer today than 100 years ago? How did we escape the Malthusian trap? What caused the financial crisis in 2007? How does the Fed use monetary policy to affect the economy?) Therefore, I think the material we learned is incredibly important, even if you are not a econ major. It gives you better insight into how the world works. Professor Peters is also a really great professor. ",
            "\u00a0It's an easy and fun class that will help you develop your knowledge of macro, and it's primarily useful for public policy students (or finance snakes, as the case may be). If you're at all interested in macro theory or prefer more rigor, I'd advise taking the math-intensive version. ",
            "\u00a0I would, if the student is interested in macroeconomics. I thought at times the questions on tests went beyond the scope of the class, and gave those who had taken more economics classes outside of this one a greater advantage. However, I ended up really enjoying this course and rediscovered why I took the course when studying for the exam. ",
