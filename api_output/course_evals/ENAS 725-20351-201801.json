            "\u00a0I learned about how a synchrotron beamline operates, and gained in depth knowledge of all the spectroscopic and imaging techniques available on the beamline. This course was great for introducing us to the capabilities of the synchrotron beamline and also what techniques can be used to solve particular problems. "

            "\u00a0The strengths are that experts in each area from Brookhaven National Lab come to lecture, making the course unique and very informative. \r\n\r\nThe weaknesses are only that the problem sets varied widely in difficulty, with some being more reasonable than others. ",
            "\u00a0-Strengths = broad range of topics and applications\r\n\r\n-weakness = greater focus on experimental design/technique applications on assignments would have been more helpful ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was very strong overall. The one area that could improve is the amount of mathematical analysis done with each technique. I'm a big fan of understanding the math that governs physical phenomena, but a single lecture is not enough time to cover both the extent to which the technique can solve certain problems, and also deriving the math behind how the technique works. A little bit is good, with links to the math references being good out of class assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: expose students to all kind of characterization technique based on synchrotron. Most of the talks are clear and well-organized. \r\nWeakness: Less introduction on basic background of X-ray and relative topics "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to all students in the hard sciences at Yale. Brookhaven is very close to Yale and is a great resource that every student and PI should look into. Additionally, all the techniques described exist as lab machines as well, and serves as a good intro to the techniques themselves. ",
