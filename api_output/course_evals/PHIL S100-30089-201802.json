            "\u00a0Changed parts of my attitudes of life. Provided insights about the society we live in. ",
            "\u00a0I've learnt how to connect profound philosophical question with our daily routines, and think about a philosophical topic thoroughly. ",
            "\u00a0Philosophy concepts ",
            "\u00a0I learned about ancient and modern philosphies and their significance to real life. \r\nI acquired skills such as reading difficult texts, participanting and preparing for class, formulating reponses, being openminded. \r\nI have a new insight on philosophy but most importantly on life, as most of the knowledge we covered is lifelong and relevant. ",
            "\u00a0I developed analytical thinking skills, as well as writing skills. I also widened my knowledge in philosophy which is something that I had never done before. This made me a more well rounded student and broadened my learning spectrum. ",
            "\u00a0Since this is my first philosophy class, it opens up my mind to see a world of questions and opinions. I learnt to know how to think and disscuss with others like a philosopher. And I saw how interesting philosophy is. ",
            "\u00a0This course , firstly, is a philosophy course, which really offers lots of intellectual challenges towards my value and overall perspective on my whole life. Follow the step of philosophy history, I get insight in distinct ideas about \"happiness\" from different philosophers of different history period, under different society background. Then during-class discussion and Professor Vogel's instruction really help me further and profoundly interpret and reflect on every specific topic of classes and the meaning of happiness. The course, indeed, is not just about, or even is less about teaching methods and means of acquiring happiness, but it opens a mysterious door and presents you a big picture of the meaning of life, encouraging you to think actively about it, and to some extent be more clear about the direction of future.

            "\u00a0Strengths: Great content. The focus on Ancient Greece is really interesting. Nice use of films. Great class environment.\r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: We go off topic. Don't address all of the readings. ",
            "\u00a0As far as I'm concerned, the course is perfect. ",
            "\u00a0More interactions, less lecturing ",
            "\u00a0I think my performance with assignments and in the class room was adequate for the course, philosphy requires participation and intellect to rebuttle or support the claims made by others, I am very confident in what I say and belive. \r\nI couldve done better in punctuality (in class) and preparing better for the discussion ",

            "\u00a0Yes. It was a fantastic course that changed my perception in life. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend the course to any student who wants to be challenged, who wants to dig deeper into the unknown and come away with a far better understanding of our human nature. There simply aren't enough kind words to describe the Professor. It always makes our job, as students, far easier and engaging when the Professor is so clearly passionate about the coursework. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I would recommend it to others. The professor is a really nice person who is always willing to talk with the students. When asking him questions, professor Vogel answers it carefully and patiently. Jennifer, the TA, also works very hard, through whose feedback I always learn a lot. Overall, the course is very interesting and worth taking! ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would. Because this helps with intellectual perception of this world through our minds. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would. Even though the title can trick someone into thinking the course is minor and will not benefit a students career without applications or means to do something, it is a misconception. Philosphy should be an integral part of every curriculum and the focus happiness makes the class exciting and intriguing as we all (or most of us) strive for it. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to any student who is looking for a challenge. Especially to high school students who might want to mayor in philosophy or any college student who does not know much about philosophy because of how clearly Prof. Vogel explains. ",
            "\u00a0Of course! Professor Vogel and TA Jennifer are so nice and patient to teach us and help us to develop our own opinions! This class is really interesting and helpful! "
