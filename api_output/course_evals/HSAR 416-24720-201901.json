            "\u00a0This was the first time this course was taught so I think the organization could use some work if it is taught again. We weren't able to cover all that we wanted in the time allowed. I think it would benefit highly from a different time, Friday morning probably hindered the number of people that would take it. However, the guest speakers were a strong point. I also think we would have benefitted more from less discussion of the readings and more time spent on lecturing. "
