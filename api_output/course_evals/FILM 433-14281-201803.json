            "\u00a0Pretty much the only thing I learned was about the method of domestic ethnography in film, which I could've gotten from one single reading in the syllabus. Besides that, I learned a bit about each of the course weekly topics through the readings and films. ",
            "\u00a0As someone who had little background in film before this course, I feel like I learned a lot about documentary filmmaking as a craft and how to better analyze films in an academic setting. I really enjoyed the focus on family histories and the wide selection of topics was refreshing and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0This was an amazing exploration of personal documentary films as primary sources of and directs responses to various political and social movements. ",
            "\u00a0Documentary analysis, research. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The syllabus looks very exciting and class readings were great, but class discussions were very shallow and not thought-provoking. I also wish they were more directed to critically engage with the film and get closer to the film (ie discussing specific scenes, methods, etc.) rather than what was basically summary. The class was disorganized and the syllabus was constantly changing. It often felt like the TF ran the course, and I personally felt the TF's insights more thought-provoking than the professor's, which often seemed like generalized abstractions. Just not that academically strong or focused. ",
            "\u00a0The assignments were all tremendously compelling, and the blog was a great feature.  Having a student lead each week's discussion was very helpful and could maybe have been started earlier.  The film selections were all incredible. "

            "\u00a0Yes! It is a wonderful course and Thomas Allen Harris is a treasure. If you have any sort of interest in film, you will love this! ",
            "\u00a0This was one of the best classes I have ever taken in my 3 years here.  Professor Harris is so insightful, caring, and competent.  The course readings and our discussions of them were always eye-opening, and I really appreciated the diversity showcased in the text selection.  Even though I don't usually consider myself a creative person, the projects were all compelling and really pushed me into deep exploration of myself and my family. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone interested in documentary film and/or anyone interested in looking into their own family history. I hadn't really seen many documentaries before taking this class, and it was a great experience to learn about another type of filmmaking. It was also a lot more personal than most other classes, and many of the assignments applied directly to my own life/family history, which was a unique experience. "
