            "\u00a0I learned how to compare theatrical texts, integrate my literary understanding of a play with my understanding of its cultural context, and how to examine the historiography not only of plays but of how theatre history has been told-- or how it has failed to be told. ",
            "\u00a0I got better at comparing plays over the course of the semester, particularly adaptations. My appreciation for adaptation grew as a result of this class, as did my knowledge of theater history from around the world. ",
            "\u00a0I got a broad overview of theater history up through the 17th century. This class covers a wide variety of regions, but doesn't really dive deep into any of them because there really isn't enough time to do more than skim the surface. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so many interesting facets of theater history, and it deepened my appreciation for the craft! ",
            "\u00a0I learned about different global traditions in theater, from antiquity through the Renaissance. ",
            "\u00a0I did learn a wide breadth of information about theater on an ancient and global scale. ",
            "\u00a0I read many important texts and theater theory. ",
            "\u00a0Pre-1700 plays and thoughts on theatre and how we can understand historical contexts through adaptations. ",
            "\u00a0I developed my note-taking skills for a lecture class, as well as study strategies for memorization-based tests. In terms of content, I learned a lot of theater history and the pattern of how historical context may affect theater-making. ",
            "\u00a0Studied plays from prehistoric dates up to 1700 CE, from a multitude of cultures ranging from Chinese acrobatic performance and Classical Greek Tragedy to Aztec ritual performances. Particular focus on adaptation and historiography, influence of cultural elements on performance styles, distinctive elements of each genre. ",
            "\u00a0I learned some fun facts about theater history, and I was exposed to some plays from various cultures before 1700. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the history of theater in different cultures and the ways in which theater can convey historiography. ",
            "\u00a0A knowledge of drama from before the modern era, and concepts with which to analyze it. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a very broad, sweeping exposure to the history of theater and performance from basically the beginning of performance through the 17th Century. I was exposed to a lot of fundamental foundational theatrical and theoretical texts from styles of theater from around the world and across time that I may not have actively sought out otherwise. The emphasis on adaptation made me attuned to how the impacts of the classical and older texts are still playing out in contemporary theater. I think that I learned how to read a play not necessarily overall more analytically but more so through the lenses of the theoretical texts we read. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about theater history and what motivates the making of various theatrical adaptations ",
            "\u00a0The main thing discussed in this course, or at least the key concept that stayed constant throughout, is adaptation and how it is done, effectively or not. This was definitely interesting to see how the original text stayed the same or changed when adapting and also if the adaptation added any insight on the original and what it added about society in general. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about different interpretations of theatricality and historiography ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the development of theater around the world. ",
            "\u00a0This course covers the basics of theatre history, theory, and plays from theatre's origination to the 16/1700s. Most papers and performance topics centered around adaptation which was actually a great way to make the very old text feel relevant to us as theatre makers now. ",
            "\u00a0I obtained an understanding of the concepts of theatricality, historiography, and adaptation. I developed a broad, basic knowledge of theatricality from the beginnings of humankind until the seventeenth century. I learned that playwrights use adaptation as a vehicle for reclaiming and rewriting history. I learned how to use theatrical works  in particular, adaptations  to examine how we tell history. "

            "\u00a0The readings move quickly, but the depth and breadth of the plays we studied gave me such a fabulous opportunity for exposure to new performance cultures! One major strength of this class is its variety. ",
            "\u00a0While interesting, this class is incredibly fast paced and as a result, I sometimes checked out for some of the material. I think slowing the pacing down slightly and creating more small assignments for students to engage with the material in a tangible manner would be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0This course gets pretty repetitive. You read a play and a theoretical reading and then you go to a lecture about the material. My favorite part was the lecture--my TF was engaging and really pushed us in our conversations. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Interesting topics, great discussion, awesome projects\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There is no need to have a final AND a final paper AND a final project. Also, we should be analyzing theater literature based on its impact, not memorizing dates and names. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the variety of both our readings and our assignments. I think it's a good format to be able to do papers, tests, and studio projects also. However, most of the material was extremely uninteresting to me. There is so much good theatre from this time period, and yet the focus of the class on \"adaptation as historiography\" (whatever that means) was extremely limiting upon the scope of what we could study, and forced us to study plays that were not at all emotionally or intellectually compelling as well as adaptations of these plays that were completely lacking in craft and artistic purpose. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes this class can feel more like a chore than my life's passion. \r\nThe lectures tested my attention span, the tests tested my memorization, the papers tested my bull, and the studio performances tested my patience. ",
            "\u00a0Since it was a survey course, we were expected to read a lot for each class. We went through the material very quickly, so we never got a good grasp on any source. The group projects were fun, but felt rushed. ",
            "\u00a0There was A LOT of information in class, all of which was helpful and interesting, but it was hard to keep up some times. I really like the studio performances that the different sections had to put on. ",
            "\u00a0The course is rich in content, but its format does not require a high level of engagement to succeed. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Diversity of cultures covered, interesting material, engaging lecturing style, very reasonable assessment policies. The studio performances at the end of the semester were the highlights of the term.\r\nWeaknesses: Unreasonably high reading load, professor unable to cover all the material in a lecture, a non-trivial fraction of the material left undiscussed. ",
            "\u00a0This course has far too broad of a scope. As a result it is incredibly nonspecific in what is actually taught. ",
            "\u00a0At times it felt like certain subjects were covered very quickly and didn't have enough time to actually engage with the type of theater before covering the second part of material. I also think there should be more time covering the prompts for the different papers, since in section it felt like there was a lot of confusion over the expectations. I enjoyed the different plays we read and having a section where we could take the time to explain things that the class didn't have enough time to cover. ",
            "\u00a0Discussion section was a major strength of the course, and very enjoyable. Another strength was the required performance we all had to see. This semester we saw YSD's As U Like It, and it was hands down the best production I saw this semester. A weakness, which I agree with from an evaluation I read before I took the course, is that there are 3 major assignments (a paper, a test, and a performance) right around the midterm and then again during the finals period, and the proximity of all these things makes it difficult to devote as much time and energy to each separate one as I'd like to. I'd spread them out more if possible. ",
            "\u00a0This course is tedious and often boring. I felt like a robot typing as fast as I could because the info in the lecture was not in a PowerPoint. There is also not a large enough focus on theatrical cannons outside of Europe, and when there is, it is generally just one play and one lecture for an entire culture of performance ",
            "\u00a0The course covered a lot of interesting material from a wide variety of places and time periods, which was great. Given the volume of material covered, the course moved quite fast. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are the level of detail and diverse scope of theatre practices covered. We co red China, Japan, early Americas, France, England, etc. \r\nThe weakness is the repetitive format. Every class, a lecture in the same format happens, and students visibly were not always engaged. ",
            "\u00a0This course, as the name suggests, successfully provides an understanding of basic theater history. I like that the lecture is relatively small, and I like that we were divided into discussion sections of ten (roughly). I absolutely loved adaptation works and performing them within our sections  it enabled me to get to know the other students in the class, inside and outside my discussion section. I appreciated the study guides and in-section study sections before the exams. \r\n\r\nThe weakness of this course, as its name suggests, is that it does not provide a thorough understanding of any of the concepts we cover. All of the lectures must be delivered very quickly in order to maximize the information imparted to the students in the little class time allotted for the course. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to any student interested in theatre, anthropology, history, or literature, because this was truly an interdisciplinary course. We had the chance to exercise critical analysis skills as writers, but also as performers, and though the class is primarily focused on history, the contemporary adaptations we read gave insight into the relevance of these texts in the modern world. ",
            "\u00a0I would not. While I learned plenty, I think it would be more beneficial to take classes with more depth rather than breadth. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you're looking to take future theater classes at Yale. It's a requirement for the major and I think it is helpful to be exposed to so many different varieties of theater, but if you're just looking for a humanities lecture to fill a credit, then I wouldn't recommend this. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah, it's an interesting class. You learn a lot, and it really introduces you to the theater community on campus. ",
            "\u00a0If it is a student who enjoys looking at theatre, a subjective art form, through an objective lens, I would say \"go ahead.\" If it is a student who either does not know much about theatre or otherwise enjoys theatre for its subjectivity and commentary on the human experience, I would say, \"Please do not take this course as it will make you either think theatre is terrible if you do not know much about the art form, or it will make you question your lifelong love for theatre and your goals to go into the theatre as a career.\" ",
            "\u00a0Only if you want to be a theater studies major. ",
            "\u00a0If you are a prospective Theater Studies major, you should take this course. If not, you shouldn't. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Its a good class for getting to learn about theatrical work from different parts of the world and how they are still relevant today. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if they are interested in theater and are self-motivated (ie. if they trust themselves to do all the readings). ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend the course. It is an interesting and engaging one and the professor and TFs made a clear and sincere effort to make the course as interesting as possible. It was well organised and planned, while still being flexible enough to adapt to student interest. The reading is a little unreasonable, but skimming is sufficient. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a requirement of the major, and in any other situation, I would not take it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student thinking of majoring in theater studies. You end up learning a lot about theater which is very cool, even though at times it could be hard to engage with the material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, though it seems to mostly/only be taken by prospective theater studies major who need it as a prereq. Just be aware that you actually have to Get To Lecture at 10:30 AM. RIP. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to or are considering majoring in theater studies (or want to know more about the history of theater), take it. Although it's not the best class, and it can be formulaic at times, the readings assigned are really important things that I'm glad I have now been exposed to. ",
            "\u00a0Nope, but you need it for the theatre studies major ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student looking to learn about the development of different theater forms. ",
            "\u00a0I would only suggest this class to a theatre major or someone who is VERY interested in theatre theory. The workload is a bit hefty, so don't take this class unless you have a genuine interest. ",
            "\u00a0I would. It provides a good foundation of knowledge for future theater classes, as it is intended to do. "
