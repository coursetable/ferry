            "\u00a0This course offered a strong survey of modernism as it pertains to American and British writers of the early twentieth century. ",
            "\u00a0This course was my first real foray into modernist literature. I hadn't read most of the items on the syllabus before entering the class. The class also offered me greater insight into those works I had already encountered. Professor Cleary would often bring back recurring themes such as expatriation, art, and war throughout the class. These themes allowed me to see the works discussed not simply in a vacuum, but rather as engaged in a larger modernist tradition.The once-a-week nature of the seminar challenged me to prepare in advance of each meeting; Professor Cleary's weekly emails and online forum discussions required of me a greater level of engagement outside of the classroom than I have been typically used to. I appreciated that Professor Cleary demanded that we remain involved in the material even after our weekly sessions were over. The two writing assignments, especially the final 15-20 page paper, pushed me far out of my comfort zone as a writer and challenged me to engage meaningfully with the texts we had covered throughout the term. Over the course of the term, I have unquestionably grown as a thinker, a reader, and a writer. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a sense of Modernism as a literary movement and how that movement was inspired or interacted with the historical events of the early twentieth century. This was my first exposure to thinking about literature in relation to history, and I found the experience broadened my view of the ways we might talk about and interpret literature. ",
            "\u00a0I am sure that I will be still realizing how much I learned in this class for several semesters to come. The class balanced a broad syllabus with detailed class discussion and a useful range of secondary sources, so that every week I felt encouraged to be thoughtful and ambitious in my analysis. The size of the papers was a useful challenge as well, encouraging well researched and thorough arguments. ",
            "\u00a0A much deeper understanding of the general themes and trends of the \"modernist\" movement. Stronger writing skills and greater analytical reading ability. "

            "\u00a0Joe Cleary is one of the smartest, best prepared, and most attentive professors I've ever had. I don't have complaints about the course. My only suggestion might be to include on the syllabus some of the smaller weekly requirements (Canvas posts, etc.) that were by no means excessive or unfair but simply at times a surprise. (For instance, I sometimes had a hard time posting by Monday nights because I hadn't known going into the course that I'd need to and so hadn't arranged my schedule properlymy fault, but a heads up probably would have allowed me to prepare more fully for discussions.) ",
            "\u00a0This is an excellent class. The course's main strength is Professor Cleary. He is a strong discussion leader who dedicates a lot of time to his syllabus and his students, both inside and outside of the classroom. \r\n\r\nThe course itself is undoubtably strong. The texts covered are very impressive and the entire syllabus served as a strong introduction to modernism. However, I felt as though the class sometimes struggled in its pacing. The syllabus is jam-packed and might benefit from some thinning. The things we read this semester were really really (really) challenging and I would often leave seminar just beginning to feel comfortable with the texts only to realize that we had to move on to something else for next week. Dedicating two sittings to certain works (as opposed to just one) might benefit the course. For example, I would have appreciated two seminars each on Eliot and Yeats. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were an excellent syllabus, good class discussions, and fantastic feedback given on essays. I'd add that the readings were ambitious in scope and length, although that's to be expected for a senior seminar. Can't think of any way it could be improved! ",
            "\u00a0There are more strengths than weaknesses in this course. There were times when the reading for the week was too much to fit into a 2 hour class. I might have preferred to focus on specific aspects of some of the poems we read, rather than summarize entire poems. Professor Cleary's lectures at the start of each class were consistently very helpful in providing necessary historical and literary context for discussion. Professor Cleary made clear that he valued each student's opinion in an encouraging way, but discussions themselves sometimes tended towards understanding plot, leaving less time to analyze. The reading discussion questions introduced a few weeks into the semester, and the questions Professor Cleary sent each week, helped prompt deeper thinking about the texts before coming to class. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes Prof Cleary asks difficult questions that lead to fairly long silences, but he does really make people think and he is very engaged in students' opinions. ",
            "\u00a0I address the strengths in my recommendation to take the class. So I'll just put weaknesses here even though this class has more strengths than weaknesses. This course tackles quite a hefty topic. I'm not sure my class was ever quite able to make the connections and draw that throughlines that Professor Cleary wanted us to. Modernism is a complex topic, and I don't think we quite untangled it (which is maybe to be expected). I guess I didn't feel like I had the contextual and historical knowledge to really understand all of the themes we were aiming to grapple with.  But I also think our class was full of pretty quiet students, which might explain why our conversation was sometimes stilted. "

            "\u00a0Yes. Professor Cleary takes such care with his commentary. He is a fine professor and a supportive, generous, good man. ",
            "\u00a0This is a really wonderful classProf Cleary is brilliant and a great seminar leader and the books were consistently engaging. But you should be prepared to put in the effort! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course really more for Professor Cleary than for the class itself. He is an excellent professor. You shouldn't miss the opportunity to study with him. The class serves as a useful introduction to modernist literature. You read Conrad, Verne, Hemingway, Yeats, Joyce, James, Eliot... what more could you ask for? It's a great reading list with an excellent instructor. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course, both on the strength of its reading listyou have to like literary modernism!and the commitment of its instructor. No other professor has provided better feedback, led better discussions, and generally allowed for such a warm, open environment of intellectual inquiry in class or in office hours than Prof. Cleary. Even if you're not interested in Pound, Eliot, Yeats, or James, I'd still give the class a shot for Cleary alone. ",
            "\u00a0This is a fantastic course -- both a survey of classic modernist texts and an in-depth examination of the historical contingencies which framed and stimulated them. The syllabus is carefully constructed and discussions are always lively. Plus you should just take anything you can with Cleary. He's the best. ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus is incredible, but I would really recommend this course for Professor Cleary. The title for the course and the authors discussed can seem daunting, but Professor Cleary approaches the material and the class with such kindness and with such a clear attempt to have every student understand the material, that what could have been an intimidating course was in fact a formative one. Class discussion itself could sometimes become forced, but that is as much on the students as it is due to any other factor. I left the class not only having read some of the big names in modernism, but intellectually encouraged and inspired. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but be prepared to do a lot of reading and write weekly reading responses that are somewhat challenging. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course for Professor Cleary alone. He is absurdly dedicated to helping his students. He gives more feedback on papers than any other professor I've ever had besides creative writing classes. He has greatly helped my academic writing. He hand wrote multiple pages of comments for each paper we turned in. And when we submitted discussion posts before class, he would sometimes send individual emails in response to what we had written praising or pushing back on our work.  It's clear that he cares deeply about the intellectual development of his students. It's too bad then that our class discussions were sometimes slow. I would recommend looking carefully at the syllabus to see if the books really interest you. They didn't seem to legitimately interest everyone in our class and were sometimes long and dense. So not everyone read them which hurt our discussion. "
