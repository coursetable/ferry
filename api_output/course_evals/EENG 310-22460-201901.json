            "\u00a0I gained an intro of signals and systems with a very mathematical framework. ",
            "\u00a0This course covers the fundamentals of signals and spends a lot of time analyzing the way systems respond to signals and how they can be tuned for a desirable outcome. We talked about impulse response, step response, laplace transforms, z transforms, the transfer function, system stability (4 different methods to evaluate stability), the Fourier Transform, and modulation. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about block diagrams to better understand and represent systems. We also learned the relationships between transfer functions, impulse response, and frequency response. Much of the other material covered focused on topics we learned before (Nyquist, Fourier Series/Transform, Z transform, etc) but in greater detail. Our final project topics offered a customized topic to learn, but will be oftentimes be an application of the material in class or another topic with which Prof Narendra is familiar. Our class had topics such as drone physics, predator/prey positioning, GPS geolocating, hybrid car optimization, solar water filter optimization, sound editing, neural networks, and electrical stimulation used for pain management. "

        [
            "\u00a0Strength is the importance of the topic and its relevance to basically everything. Project was also a good point.\r\nPossibly weakness is its focus on math if you don't have the background for it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend uploading notes and other documents to Canvas. There was no canvas page for this class. ",
            "\u00a0The course started out slow and picked up throughout the semester. I think the course could be improved by holding weekly TA sessions to go over some of the material covered in the course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The psets were fairly reasonable and not too much work if one paced themselves/asked for help.\r\nLecture notes were well-written and the progression of the material made a lot of sense. \r\n\r\nWeakness: Professor Narendra's teaching could be more focused "

            "\u00a0Yes, it is interesting and relevant to many fields. Just be prepared for difficult, math-y homework sets. You will also need to come in to Prof. Narendra's office very often to talk about your final project. ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend this course to any STEM major. Prof Narendra is absolutely incredible and genuinely cares about his students, something that is pretty rare these days. He has an open door policy and encourages you to come talk to him about anything (course related or not). ",
            "\u00a0For the most part,  I would only recommend it to those who need to take it. It's conceptually difficult even for electrical engineering majors and Professor Narendra is a difficult character to work with, and I don't think that it's worth the semester-long frustration if it's not a requirement. The final project was the best part but what we learned from that experience can be learned elsewhere honestly. "
