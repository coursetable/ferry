            "\u00a0I learned more about the civil sphere and have since been more readily able to identify its influence. ",
            "\u00a0This course really broadened my perspective on social issues, the movements that arose to combat them, and how they manifest themselves in society, both in the past and the present. This course allowed me to really unpack the social dynamics that underlie these issues and understand why these dynamics exist in the ways that they do. I have learned to see society and the issues that affect it in such a deeper way, and after taking this course I feel like I understand many of the social dynamics, particularly social inclusion and exclusion, that I have questioned in the past. I can say, without hesitation, that this course has really changed the way that I see society and the world. "

            "\u00a0The readings were good. Professor didnt always facilitate discussion though. ",
            "\u00a0The course material and professors were both top notch. However, at times, weekly readings of hundreds upon hundreds of pages felt overwhelming. ",
            "\u00a0Since the course only meets once a week, having discussion questions was very helpful to guide and stimulate meaningful conversation . ",
            "\u00a0There are so many strengths to this course! The readings were all so incredibly interesting because they really analyze the dynamics that constitute social issues and social movements in ways that are easy to understand and very eye-opening. They articulate the nuances of society in a way that makes everything make sense; after reading the readings, I felt like I understood the issues they addressed in a very clear way that is also applicable to other issues that weren't necessarily covered in that particular reading. Class discussions were also very interesting and meaningful in terms of really unpacking the framework of issues and how society deals with them. Every class began with Professor Alexander giving an overview of the issue or topic at hand for the week, which was very helpful and insightful because we use his \"civil sphere\" social theory throughout the course to understand all of the issues and societies that we address. We then had discussions about various aspects of the material that were very engaging and effective in solidifying the material. I will say that sometimes class discussions fell a little flat in terms of participation, and I think that has a lot to do with the particular group of students in the seminar. There were times when it was hard to get the ball rolling because people wouldn't say anything or really know where to start in terms of discussion, so I feel like one way to improve that could be to have students, with each weekly reading response, ask one question at the end that could be referenced in class so that the discussion could be started if students didn't have anything to say at the beginning. It could be interesting to have students facilitate the class discussions sometimes, instead of relying on Professor Alexander to explain everything before we could discuss the readings and the material. It was also a really amazing experience to be able to read manuscripts of very recently published works in the realm of civil sphere theory research, because it really felt like I was engaging with the forefront of this field. It was an extremely special experience for me to be taught about this theory by the creator of the theory and to be able to read THE current research in this field. All of the material was incredibly relevant to current societies, both American and foreign, and it was amazing to have the opportunity to understand the issues of the present moment, rather than analyzing them retrospectively.

            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0I would. Its a deeply philosophical course and one I would deem crucial for most. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely!!!! I would 100% recommend this course to another student, and I already have! This is a course that everyone should take if they have the chance because it really broadens and deepens your understanding of society, not just in America but in a variety of countries around the world. It gives you the ability to really unpack and understand the complexities of social inclusion and exclusion, as well as the dynamics surrounding social issues and their lifespan in society. This course provides an outlet to think about and discuss prominent social issues through a sociological lens, understanding the underlying principles of these issues and the ways in which social groups have tried to ameliorate them and expand the boundaries of social inclusion. This class teaches students how to be socially conscious and aware of the roots of social issues, as well as the potential ways to fix them. I truly think that everyone should take this course if they can because it changed my understanding of society. This was one of the absolute best courses I have ever taken and I am so glad that I took the chance to take it, because my understanding of the world has been enriched because of it. "
