            "\u00a0I greatly enhanced my ability to sign in a more creative manner, and improved my usage of facial expression/body movement when signing. I gained knowledge of more concept-related signs, and learned how to sign in a more Deaf fashion, rather than an English one. ",
            "\u00a0I expanded my ASL vocabulary, and improved my fluency in the language and grammatical structure of ASL. I also learned about the various forms of ASL literature as well as Deaf history and culture. ",
            "\u00a0This class greatly increased not only my sign language vocabulary, but my understanding of ASL grammer, my comprehension, and my ability to communicate through sign. ",
            "\u00a0I bettered my ability to express myself creatively in American Sign Language. This course pushed me to let my guard down when it came to creative expression in ASL. "

            "\u00a0Weaknesses of the course: running out of time for future projects because the class spent too long focusing on current projects/in-class activities\r\n\r\nStrengths: group brainstorming, in-class activities, general class environment ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Great for learning about ASL literature.  The historical perspective at the beginning of the course were a good way to start, and the process of class activity and coming up with our own version of each type of story/poem was fun and educational.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Because vocabulary and grammar weren't the focus of the course, I think at the end of the course these skills hadn't been enhanced that much. Considering it's only a level 3 course, it would be nice to have a little more review of vocabulary and grammar along side the projects. We definitely picked up some vocabulary in day-to-day classes and in coming up with our personal stories/poems, but usually we would learn the word in that context and it wouldn't come up again so it wouldn't stick in the brain long term. ",
            "\u00a0This class had great strength in the way Prof.Tanner promoted and facilitated student interaction. Working together as much as we did, and communicating entirely in sign as we did so, our ability to communicate with and comprehend sign increased greatly. Working together also created a real sense of comraderie and friendship that made the class significantly more enjoyable, creating an atmosphere of collaboration and support, and propting us to meet frequently outside of class and converse in sign, giving us even more practice. "

            "\u00a0Yes! I believe everyone should take a course in sign at least once, especially this class. Learning about sign, especially when taught by someone as patient Jessica in such a welcoming environment, can really open the eyes of other individuals to both the Deaf experience and the beauty of a wholly visual language. I would recommended this class in particular because it really enables students to focus on creative expression, which can be difficult, but is definitely challenging (it allows students to grow as signers immensely). ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Learning ASL is a very unique experience. It requires you to think in a way that is entirely different from anything you have probably done before. It is also incredibly eye opening to learn about Deaf history and culture, and to realize how little the average American is taught about or exposed to Deaf history and struggles.\r\nEven if you've already finished your language requirement, I would still highly recommend taking ASL if you can. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course and any course taught by Prof. Tanner to anyone. It was incredibly enjoyable, and the material we discussed and our subsequent experimentation with different forms of ASL literature made the topic absolutely enthralling. I felt more committed and invested in this class than I have in any other course so far. Not only was the class fun, it also was incredibly informative, allowing us to be creative while learning about ASL and ASL literature. Not only did I enjoy this class the most, but I also learned the most in this class as well. Prof. Tanner is absolutely wonderful, and cares tremendously about all of her students and their academic progress. She managed to make learning a language a creative endeavor, and encouraged us all to use what we learned outside of the classroom as well. I cannot speak highly enough about this class and about Prof. Tanner. "
