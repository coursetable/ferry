            "\u00a0I learned a lot about literature post 1500. ",
            "\u00a0This course is really a boot camp in literary analysis and interpretation. You have to deal with so many different texts in so many different styles. Its pretty cool. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me an overview of the central works, movements, and themes of the Western literary canon.  It taught me how to critically analyze literary texts and write papers on that analysis.  I learned what kinds of literature I was particularly interested in, which allowed me to gauge my general interest in the field as a whole. ",
            "\u00a0For the first time in my life, I learned to appreciate the aesthetic and philosophical nature of literature, and the story of how the novel became a genre. I particularly honed in on my writing skills and improved my ability to convey ideas in a more powerful way, as well as in a more concise and sophisticated fashion. More importantly, I was able to understand how a DS seminar should function in the literature track: read a passage, talk about it with peers while taking notes, and seeing how that passage connects to the larger work. This pattern was at the heart of my insights for this seminar. ",
            "\u00a0Literature is a strange beast. You'll encounter bits of history, nuggets of philosophy, musings on life, a wide variety of writing techniques... the list is endless! But the most valuable thing you'll take away is an understanding of \"close reading\"  how to meditate on passages, digging through diction and squaring themes, really wrestling with the text to draw an infinite bounty of meaning from it. The fundamental premise of \"close reading\" transfers to most any domain of life. "

            "\u00a0Incredibly well organized and effective at arriving at discussions of key elements of the texts. ",
            "\u00a0I think they expect us to read way too much too fast and that means that we often dont get to read most of the material and that leads to weaker class discussions. Its absurd to read 5 novels in 5 weeks. ",
            "\u00a0It all moves a little too quickly but that definitely keeps it fresh. ",
            "\u00a0This course has a phenomenal syllabus, but literature is a very large field.  Even the overview of some of the texts we read seemed kind of surface-level, especially for the smaller novels. I felt Hadji Murat could have been taken off the list. I think it would be difficult to really improve the syllabus apart from that, and perhaps a solution to the problem of depth would be to admit the weakness of the course and run with it. Specifically, to focus more on students particular interests in a field or topic and show how each novel is part of a broader literary trend, not just to focus on the individual works themselves. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Valuable discussions thanks to the leadership of my instructor, informative lectures, rich conversations with peers\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not many. One point of interest in the last seminar concerned the coherency of the DS Literature syllabus. I'm not sure if this issue can be solved since you can make DS Literature a 20 book course and still seem arbitrary, but more thought to this concept and thinking through how the works we read matter in relation to each other could help. ",
            "\u00a0+ You'll read **a lot** of really great books. You'll fall in love with them, and become acquainted with many of the great stories of Western Civilization.\r\n- The relentless pace of reading, though it enables D.S's comprehensive coverage, will often prevents you from engaging with the depth you might like. This is the irony of D.S. Literature: you learn what \"close reading\" is, but amidst the hundreds of pages assigned each week just don't have time to apply it, except in section!\r\n+ You'll also read Don Quixote. Don Quixote is absolutely fabulous! "

            "\u00a0Yeah this ones worth it. Its definitely hard but super rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a great intro to literature, although it is part of DS so I cannot recommend it to someone solely interested in literature. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, DS Literature second semester was much more fulfilling and rewarding than the first, perhaps because of my seminar and professor. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. We can quibble over the relentless pace, but it achieves something absolutely remarkable: a survey of the themes that have preoccupied humankind since Petrarch  tracing, with one's fingertip, the evolution (and creation!) of feelings. Did men always pine for unrequited love? Or was it invented? Did people only start feeling bored around the time of Flaubert? These are fascinating questions. And the works you'll read are absolutely beautiful. You may not love everything, but some will amaze you beyond expectation. "
