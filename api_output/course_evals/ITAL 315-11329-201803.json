            "\u00a0Interesting overview of the history of the Catholic Church and Catholic thinking. ",
            "\u00a0Good background on history of Catholic thought. I am Jewish, but I thoroughly enjoyed the course because the readings were really engaging. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a deep and substantive knowledge of major Catholic thinkers from early Christianity (Augustine) to the modern day (Dorothy Day). I read key texts to the formation of the Catholic Church, primarily from non-clergymen. I truly walked away with a more nuanced and fully formed understanding of this institution and its continuing legacy today. ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge of critically examining text as well as historical developments and how they relate and influence the Catholic Church's Intellectual Tradition today. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about foundational controversies and their resolutions as part of the Catholic Intellectual Tradition. I also learned more about the Catholic view of God and some fundamental beliefs about God's nature which I didn't know before this course, despite being a lifelong Catholic. One class started out with a fun \"quiz\" about whether certain beliefs were orthodox Catholic beliefs or heretical and no one managed to answer all of the questions correctly. I think this just demonstrates how much there is to learn in a class like this.\r\n\r\nI also gained an appreciation for some elements of Philosophy which I had never been exposed to before and naturally came up in this class. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to become a better historical and philosophical writer and how to read philosophical texts. ",
            "\u00a0Very interesting survey course of Catholic philosophy across history. I now have a valuable understanding of the Catholic Church's positions in history, as explained by writers of each period that the professors eloquently explained. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read primary source documents from the Catholic intellectual tradition and understand them in context. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me how to approach tracing an intellectual tradition, rather than just an individual or a location, through history. It was enlightening and rewarding to navigate one topic (theology) using the tools and methods of a different discipline (history). As a history major, this course was invaluable. It covers a large breadth of history (~2000 years) with a narrow focus and manages to provide meaningful insights even over such a vast body of work. ",
            "\u00a0critical thinking ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely excellent class. It is the right mix of interesting material and manageable work-load. Best class I've taken so far at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0We learned a TON about the history of the Catholic Church! It was very very interesting to read the giants of the Catholic Intellectual Tradition ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about Catholicism and the history of the church. The course covered a wide range of material from the Gospels to modern day spiritual novels and encyclicals. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to do close readings and short essays. It was great to learn about the Catholic intellectual tradition, something I was taught being raised in a Catholic home attending Saturday Catholic school, ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the Catholic Intellectual Tradition and read some of the important works that helped define the tradition throughout the centuries. ",
            "\u00a0A knowledge of the intellectual development of Catholic thought from the 1st to 20th centuries. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a good survey introduction to the catholic and Christian tradition, from the early church fathers through to the role of Catholicism in a modern intellectual context. We learnt about the key thinkers and how the church interacted with other political movements over time, transitioning from a focus on matters of dogma to the Church's social role. Helpful for studying history from a thematic perspective. ",
            "\u00a0a general understanding of the canon of texts that make up different periods of Catholic history ",
            "\u00a0The course provided a captivating survey of the catholic tradition overall. We read some of the most important texts ever written and studied their importance in the historical contexts in which they were written. I learnt how to better understand difficult texts and came to appreciate religious literature overall. ",
            "\u00a0Early Church history, medieval history, the Reformations and Enlightenment, the great impact of Catholicism on the West. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the history of intellectual thinkers in the Catholic faith tradition. This class isn't like a religious education class and is almost like a theology class. We covered the different periods of Catholic thought from the 1st century to the modern day. I learned about many important figures in the Catholic church, and we learned about and read from many saints, clergy, monks, etc. It was interesting to see how the church developed and changed, especially how the Church's perspective on the problems the world faced throughout history.

            "\u00a0Grading seems to be somewhat biased based on TA and thus inconsistent throughout the class. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were the wide array of thinkers incorporated into the Catholic intellectual tradition, both read and invited to speak. I learned a tremendous amount about the people who built the Catholic Church as we know it today. Some weaknesses were poorly structured discussion sections. No two TAs offer the same depth in section. Ultimately, I believe it all evens out. I did change section through the semester to learn more. ",
            "\u00a0The course should not rotate guest lecturers and professors as much as it did. I felt no consistency in the arc of the course as a result. ",
            "\u00a0Great class! Super well-taught, interesting guest lectures and fun sections! Only downside was the length of many of the readings. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the lecture format with 3 professors and plenty of guest lecturers. This semester, about one third of the lectures were interesting guests who were experts on the specific topic we covered that week. Honestly, I enjoyed the weekly readings, but I think a lot of people did just fine without reading all of them. Having discussion with the actual professors is also a big strength of the course. ",
            "\u00a0The Catholic Intellectual Tradition's strengths lie in the lectures and the syllabus. All the lectures were really fantastic, and the syllabus was well-chosen. My section, which was run by Prof. Eire, was also really interesting (although some of the students could have participated more). I think the course could be improved by layering church history on top of the intellectual history that is the focus of the course. ",
            "\u00a0The readings, lectures, and discussion section were all interesting and complemented each other. Even more reading could be assigned, though, to give a fuller picture of the tradition. Sometimes I found Professor Mazzotta's lectures hard to follow (I could hear what he was saying, but the content was over my head). ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the guest lectures and the selected readings. I loved the way the class had three professors who alternated lecturing, and I thought that provided a comprehensive perspective to the works we were discussing. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is definitely Professors' Eire, Mazzotta, and Brenzel. Each of them is able to lecture on the area in which they are the most qualified (literature, theology, history), and this keeps the course meaningful as we moved between the different focuses. The one weakness of the course would be that some guest lecturers would not engage with the weekly topic or the broader arc of the course in the way that the actual Professors would. I believe the number of guest lecturers should be reduced. ",
            "\u00a0incredible professors and such caring people ",
            "\u00a0It was a wonderful course which had plenty of interesting readings, great lectures and good messages. Unfortunately the end of the course was a bit different and discontinuous from the rest of the course. ",
            "\u00a0This was a great course! I really liked all the guest lecturers. One weakness is that the discussion sections were very different between the discussion leaders. ",
            "\u00a0The readings are great, but the lectures could be a little more engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting information, brought in professors to talk about topics they specialized in\r\nWeaknesses: some of the professors brought in strayed off topic ",
            "\u00a0It provides good overview and requires no prior knowledge. However, this can make it a bit dull for Christians or those with a rudimentary background in Christianity, because the analysis by other students is limited by their lack of previous engagement with the ideas of the texts. ",
            "\u00a0The course contained interesting reading material and the structure was generally clear and coherent. It was especially interesting towards the second half of the course where the focus shifted onto Catholicism in a modern context. However, the lectures were often fairly unstructured and often ran over and were difficult to follow. At times, some lecturers tended to ramble or refer to material that was not in the course readings or generally applicable to the course. This course could be improved by having fewer guest lecturers and more lectures from professor Eire, who was by far the best lecturer. It would also have helped to get more feedback and guidance on the essay assignments, as this was pretty much the only area where academic rigour and originality was tested at all. ",
            "\u00a0The professors are excellent. Professor Eire's section was so engaging. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the richness of the assigned readings, which, although difficult to read at times, were eye-opening. I had never read authors such as Augustine or Pascal for example, and I am now happy to had a very solid understanding of their works. I also liked how we approached the catholic tradition through a literary lens. The main weakness of the course is that we didn't always have time to delve into all the texts, and I therefore found myself not understanding certain parts of lecture and section. I would propose reducing the quantity of readings as to allow students to really dive deep into everything we study in the course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: This is an incredibly unique class to take at Yale. It is unlike other history classes because you are not exactly having monotonous lectures on a chronological series of events, like other history classes I've taken. Instead, you approach historical Catholicism through reading the primary sources of prominent Church leaders, philosophers, theologians, and others. I enjoyed this aspect very much. The lectures are different each time, owing to the number of guest lecturers. One goes to class without knowing exactly what to expect for that day, which keeps the course engaging. Weaknesses: There were several points I became lost, because we FLEW through centuries in a matter of a couple weeks. I loved the beginning of the course when we focused on the early Church at a reasonable pace, and I retained much of that information. But the end of the semester, things got very confusing very quickly. Luckily, you are not expected to keep all of it straight. ",
            "\u00a0At times it felt the course was a little poorly organized. I never got feedback on one of my papers and turned in almost all three papers and the midterm without receiving any grades. Additionally, the lectures sometimes felt sped through or disconnected. It was also very possible to complete the papers and to an extent the exams without attending lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting and engaging lectures, interesting and pertinent material, an interesting lens from which to view history, especially European history.\r\nWeaknesses: difficult, long and excessive readings. They warn you that you will be reading direct sources and texts in this class at the beginning, and I, unfortunately did not heed this warning. I thought I would be fine, as long as the readings were interesting, I would have no trouble reading them. The readings are all interesting, don't get me wrong, but reading and interpreting religious texts was more difficult than I anticipated. Expect at least 100-200 pages of reading per week. The reading the early texts felt like trying to decipher computer code at times. I also feel like the assigned readings could have been cut short to the most important points that we learned in class. There was a stark contrast between my comprehension of the lectures and my comprehension of the assigned readings. It also felt like to understand this class I needed to have a basic understanding of the Classics, Greek philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle, and writers like Homer and Virgil, who are constantly being brought up and referenced by the authors who we do read. For someone who had never learned about any of them before, I felt like this was not adequately covered at the beginning of the class.  I felt it was difficult to contribute to discussion sections, because I hardly understood the readings apart from their main points. There is a considerable amount of writing in this class for a class that is not a writing credit. "

            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! Take this even if you arent Catholic! Great useful background for history. ",
            "\u00a0No and beware of past recommendations of this class. I think it used to be taught differently but I would NOT recommend this course to other students in its current form. Despite the pretty interesting premise/content, this was somehow one of the most boring classes I've taken at Yale. I think part of the problem is that Carlos Eire only gave four or so lectures, and only his were truly engaging. Because of all the different guest lecturers, it was hard to feel like the topics discussed had a true narrative arc. Instead it just seemed we just discussed topics loosely connected by Catholic thinkers.  \r\n\r\nBasically, I wouldn't take this class for the simple fact that after a whole semester I still couldn't tell you what the Catholic Intellectual Tradition even is. ",
            "\u00a0YES YES YES. In the second part of the semester, I came to really appreciate how much I was learning about Catholicism, history, and even myself. On a personal note (this course stresses the role of autobiography in the Catholic faith), this course changed my life. I was raised Catholic, received the sacraments, but explored non-denominational Christianity at Yale. This course marked a return to my faith, bolstered by truly just a better understanding of what Catholicism stood for. I am really grateful that courses like this exist at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! Great course! Super interesting and engaging. You definitely don't need to be Catholic or have any experience with Christianity before taking the course to get a lot out of it! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. I looked forward to all of the lectures and enjoyed all of the readings. The discussion section wasn't the most exciting thing ever, but it depends on which professor you have it with and mine was still pretty entertaining each week.\r\n\r\nThe professors and guest lecturers are an amazing aspect of this course: Eire is an expert on this stuff and has also published some award-winning memoirs and is very funny and friendly, Brenzel is the former Dean of Admissions and Head of TD so he is also extremely friendly and helpful and he gave some well-organized, memorable Philosophy lectures, and Mazzotta is so passionate and knows so much about literature and Dante that he is just amazing to listen to. Whenever these three don't feel they can adequately cover a topic, they bring in a guest lecturer who can.\r\n\r\nIf you're Catholic, you've almost certainly never been exposed to most of the topics and readings. If you're not, they are very approachable and all of the background knowledge is explained during the lectures. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Catholic Intellectual Tradition is a terrific course, with awesome professors and TAs, and a great syllabus. ",
            "\u00a0Awesome 5th class if you're looking for something interesting to learn about even if you know very little going in. The readings are long, but understanding the key parts of each is made possible during section, which made the work very manageable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this to anyone interested in European history, religion, or philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student. The professors and the TAs are all wonderful, and the course is truly one of the best I have taken at Yale. If you are at all interested in faith, history, the Western tradition, or just attending a great lecture, take this course. If you are not a person of faith or of the Christian faith, the course is still very rewarding and focuses on the history of the Catholic tradition rather than pushing the faith. ",
            "\u00a0yes! it is one of those truly different courses at Yale ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. ",
            "\u00a0Totally! It is a great way to learn about the Catholic Intellectual Tradition, regardless of your faith background! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, especially if you are Catholic! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would. I would recommend this to those that are interested in learning more about the Catholic faith. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because it was incredibly interesting and well-taught. Additionally, many people have an incorrect view of Catholicism of not being \"intellectual-based\" and this helps show all the great thinkers involved. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to learn more about the Catholic faith and don't have a lot of background knowledge, definitely take the course. Furthermore, if you want to read a lot of important primary sources, this is a useful course. However, if you are already familiar with Christian doctrine and the Catechism, skip to a higher level class. ",
            "\u00a0It is a good survey course but won't change your life. Unless you actually have an interest in Catholicism and intellectual history, there are better courses out there as most of the lectures were fairly dry and scattered. Expect also to be in class with students who are Catholic themselves or are medievalists/ex-DS as they will have a lot of background knowledge already. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, you don't need to be Catholic to enjoy this class and get a lot out of it. ",
            "\u00a0If you are curious about the catholic tradition then absolutely. The course is a good way to get a sense of how christianity has developed and its importance in history. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This class is a unique experience and a privilege to take. You will not find other classes like it in terms of its structure, not to mention that the content of the course is something rare to come across in other classes at Yale, making it extremely interesting. One definitely does not need any experience with Catholicism whatsoever to take the class. By the end of the class you will see the incredibly great impact of Catholicism on the West and the world as a whole, something you have probably not encountered learning before. ",
            "\u00a0Only if they are really intrigued by the course material and willing to spend at least 4 hours a week reading. I was intrigued by the material, but I still found the readings to be a bit unbearable. The readings are challenging, but in truth, I think most students hardly read half of them.  Actually, I wish I took this class Credit/D/Fail because it is interesting and I learned a lot about my faith, but I think I would have enjoyed it more if I was less stressed about the readings and essays and exams.
