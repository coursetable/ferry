            "\u00a0The class is very well structured and the classmates all help each other to succeed. Xu laoshi creates a very comfortable environment for all of us to share and be open to one another. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are that its pacing is very good and its subject material is interesting and varied.\r\nWeaknesses are that the textbook itself is unclear about some things and the lessons aren't as organized as they perhaps should be ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are definitely Professor Xu's teaching style, she was very clear in her explanations and helped us each step of the way. The textbook itself has a large selection of words so sometimes it gets difficult to remember all of them! ",
            "\u00a0The scheduling was a bit off, and sometimes like last semester homework, quizzes, essays, and final projects would pile up on the same day. ",
            "\u00a0This course focuses on formal/written Chinese, so there is less of an emphasis on conversational Chinese. Although there are fewer opportunities for discussion, you are still expected to know how to speak the language and participate in class. As this is the first year on the three day/week system, the pacing of the curriculum could be better, but Xu Laoshi said she would try to make the workload a little lighter in the future, and I think what it was this year was already better than the five day schedule. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very engaging and really increased my confidence in speaking Mandarin. I used to be hesitant to speak because I was not good at it but this course really improved my vocabulary and pronunciation. The only weakness of the course is the textbook because it had many mistakes and there were scheduling conflicts. The lessons felt really rushed at times because it seemed like we were trying to cover so many topics. If the timing of the courses can be figured out, it would improve the course. "

            "\u00a0I think Chinese 153 in terms of content wasn't a big help in terms of learning more conversation, but it discussed some interesting points of culture. ",
