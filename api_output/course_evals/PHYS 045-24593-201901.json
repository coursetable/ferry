            "\u00a0A good selection of various physics topics, including some cutting research that's happening at Yale right now. We covered a pretty wide variety of topics, but did not go into depth. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about both artistic styles and mediums as well as theoretical and experimental physics. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about art history and an overview of some cool research happening right now. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to analyze art while also learning about the connections between physics and art. I also learned a bit more about fundamental physics. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a huge amount of knowledge on many different areas of theoretical physics and how it has informed and been informed by art over time. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a great introduction to the world of physics for those who have never taken a physics course. We covered everything from relativity to emission spectrums to supernova. The class opens your world to a whole new understanding of how science interacts with society, particularly art, and how the mix of physics and art is much more intuitive than expected. ",
            "\u00a0I was able to understand various physics concepts that were previously alien to me. ",
            "\u00a0A vague understanding of a lot of complex physics concepts. ",
            "\u00a0In ways I'm still sort of trying to figure this out. We learned a ton of physics that I was not expecting, everything from quantum theory to relativity, and while it was interesting I sometimes felt like the whole \"meets the arts\" portion of the class was missing. Though the trips to the art museum were amazing, we focused immensely on the physics half and a little less on the arts than I was expecting. That being said it was listed as a physics class so I guess I shouldn't be that surprised. I don't know I guess it was more of a shock than anything else. ",
            "\u00a0Basic knowledge in astrophysics, quantum mechanics, and how physics relates to art. "

            "\u00a0For strengths, I really enjoyed that many classes were in the YUAG and one was even in a Yale physics lab. These settings really brought our curriculum to life. Also, it was very cool that we would be able to Skype call or even bring to our class real scientists and artists that we read about, and speak to them directly. For weaknesses, I would say the lectures were a bit long sometimes since the class is about 2 hours long. ",
            "\u00a0A strength was the duality between both science and art. A weakness was the difficulty and extent of the readings in relation to what we talked about in class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Fun and engaging course.\r\nWeaknesses: Not all readings felt relevant. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are brilliant teaching, fascinating guest speakers and really compelling course material with a solid structure.\r\nWeaknesses: the gravity of the final fusion project came as a bit of a shock to some, and no training is given in the actual production of art. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The course was a great survey of basic physics concepts, though I wouldn't recommend to students with a heavy physics background. Professor Mocsy was incredibly kind and enthusiastic, and the class blended a fabulous amount of different sources and types of engagement, like lab visits, skype calls with nobel laureates and artists, gallery visits, etc. \r\nWeaknesses: The reading/work for the class could have been more structured, and some articles we received were super technical that it was difficult to understand what we should take away from them. Additionally, the quizzes had some information that was very briefly covered in class, or not at all it felt (not a lot though). ",
            "\u00a0We went through a lot of material very quickly, a lot of the knowledge we gained was surface level and we werent able to really delve into the topics. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: The visits to the YUAG were amazing and the reading selection was great. Weaknesses: The physics in \"physics meets the arts\" were never actually taught to us. We were expected to learn everything we needed to know from the readings, then ask about what was confusing. Without the guidance of the professor, however, I was never sure what to focus on or what exactly I needed to understand. The physics portion of this class felt like a free for all, which made studying for the quizzes even more difficult. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are the attempts to combine to things that are usually very very separate. In going to the art museum and learning to look at art in a new way I was fascinated by the scientific portions, but toward the second half of the semester we lost all the art aspects and really only focused on this physics which was slightly disappointing. ",
            "\u00a0The course can be better organized. Meeting in the YUAG was very fun. We had a lot of guest visits/skypes in the class, but sometimes I feel like it is better if the course was organized in a way that we could learn more physics in class. A lot of the learning was done through homework readings and going over lecture slides on our own because we didn't get to over them in class. "

            "\u00a0Sure, especially if you are a humanities person with not too much science background, it's manageable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, overall I had a fun time, and I truly learned a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was a very enriching process ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! The course changed my life. I have developed a complete obsession with physics, and feel like I've come to understand so much more about the way the world works and the way humanity has related to that world and described that world through art. Fantastic teaching, overall an amazing experience. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. Especially to anyone with little to no background in physics who wants to discover more about the field, especially if you're a creative. The fusion project was a great way to finally allow yourself to work on a creative project, especially in the whirl of \"normal\" reading/writing/pset schoolwork. Since it's a first-year seminar, it also developed a really great community. ",
            "\u00a0its good for people who arent STEM oriented. ",
            "\u00a0I would not - it seems like a fun class (and has the potential to be amazing) but it was a bummer because most of our physics education came from the readings when our professor was already one of the best physicists in the world. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course needs a few more test runs before I would recommend it to another student. I think overall it was fascinating and we learned so much cool stuff but the path of the class isn't totally clear and sometimes was a little all over the place. I would've loved a little more structure and sense in some of the lectures and decisions made, but I think it was all very fascinating and has the potential to be an amazing class. ",
            "\u00a0If you are not a sicence/STEM person, it is worth the science credit. This course is super interesting as it looks at physics through the lens of art. It does not involve any calculation since it focuses on understanding the physics concepts. It is very reading/writing heavy because of the weekly reading response and the amount of homework (mostly readings) we have. "
