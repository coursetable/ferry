            "\u00a0As a non-major, I most appreciated the opportunity to expand my vocabulary and analytical toolbox for approaching the academic study of music, broadly-conceived. I also found this course to be a wonderful place to explore the paradoxes and complexities of globalization and cultural change. Whereas anthropology classes talk about this in a theoretical sense, this course provided places to apply relevant theoretical models and test their merit against contemporary artistic practices. ",
            "\u00a0You gain vocabulary and conceptual skills towards understanding musically and sociologically a variety amazing of non Western Cannon music traditions, via case studies in indonesia, india, West Africa, Cuba, and Jamaica. Perhaps the biggest thing to be gained from this course is an introduction to amazing styles and recordings you probably have never heard before. You also get exposure to amazing masterclasses from visiting artists each unit. And the skills Veal provides for contextualizing musical within broader social and political themes are really sharp.

            "\u00a0Fewer topics covered in more detail, or less test-oriented attitude toward subjects. ",
            "\u00a0Great material, terrible presentation. Lectures were unorganized, readings were redundant with minimal new information. Wikipedia was more useful.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting part of the course was the lectures on Jamaican music because that was actually organized.\r\n\r\nPLEASE USE SLIDES WITH WORDS ON THEM SO WE CAN SPELL THINGS IN OUR NOTES ",
            "\u00a0The course is, to put it bluntly, a structural nightmare. Lectures are disorganized, there is no communication between the professor and the TFs, and ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the structure of the class! Rather than the world music classes that I hear about from my friends at other universities, the course is set up in four three-week units so that you can go in depth with four different musical cultures. It made each unit more enjoyable than I imagine one day would have been, and provided a great model for how to introduce yourself to a new musical culture! ",
            "\u00a0I think the course is good, and the fact that musicians came to perform for every unit was incredible and so valuable. The class was quite big and not everyone was super engaged, so sometimes discussion suffered. ",
            "\u00a0If we set aside the concern that a survey of multiple traditions is probably not going to delve into any of those traditions in a satisfying way, this class could be much improved solely from an organizational standpoint. Expectations for the quizzes are not made clear. It is disadvantageous for learning when students are pre-occupied with succeeding on the assessment, and a reasonable solution for this is to make the requirements for success - the format and criteria for success on the quizzes, namely - clear. Under such improved conditions, students can enjoy learning the material without stressing about \"how much they need to know\" for the quiz. \"Should\" students be so concerned about grades?  Maybe not, but we are, and if one is concerned that students are preoccupied so, rather than debate the symptom, create the stress-reducing but no less intellectually demanding class setting of having clear expectations. The strengths of 351 and 352 are partly in the level of organization of the classes and the clarity of the guidelines.\r\n\r\nAlso, please label the listening samples more clearly, or have an accompanying document that details them, with clearer information about the sample. I understand that the point is to be able to identify the tradition or style, but it's hard enough to do that with random samples on the quiz, let alone when we're supposed to be learning from examples that aren't themselves well labeled.\r\n\r\nThere were many times in lecture (towards the end of the semester) when we asked Professor Veal to repeat himself. It actually would be much more helpful if he just spoke more slowly the first time, because often the second time was still to fast to catch everything. \r\n\r\nProfessor Veal also often tried to lighten the mood by commenting on our frustration. Generally, poking fun at Yale students for being exasperated is all well and good (and often deserved), but usually there's a reason for that exasperation, and in this case, it was the lack of organization of the class. ",
            "\u00a0The content of the course was good. Wish there were room in the major requirements for more classes like this one. ",
            "\u00a0It was sometimes difficult to locate traditions in time with such cursory overviews of each region. I would have preferred the opportunity to explore more in depth some of the traditions, which would be more possible if the music history curriculum were more balanced across global regions and eras. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: takes all musicians outside of comfort zone\r\nWeakness: a little disorganized and stressful at times because it was difficult to tell what material we should be retaining. ",
            "\u00a0The class has such good material, but it's wasted by the instructors who would rather be pretentious and perform like scholars. The instructors hardly ever decided to actually instruct us. Rather they spent their time fishing for the answers to questions we were not aware we should be asking, while never really informing us with regards to the actual material. I felt like the lectures and the sections were a waste of my time. Especially section. Why show up to section with no answers and leave with no answers? I can do that on my own time, in the comfort of my own room. Jacqueline Georgis in particular was so condescending that it was difficult to maintain a respectful attitude towards her. ",
            "\u00a0The class was disorganized, tests were unclear and unnecessarily stressful, and readings were loaded with terminology that we were expected to memorize but will promptly forget in a few months. We had a take home exam for one of the tests, which I thought was a much better mode of assessment because it forced people to do some of the reading (only a few people were doing it).\r\n\r\nGuest artists' performances were fabulous, and by far the best part of the course. ",
            "\u00a0For a survey course, I think Dr. Veal did a great job balancing depth with breadth. Lectures were enjoyable, guest performances were wonderful, and the content was generally interesting and well-presented. \r\n\r\nFor weaknesses -- Dr. Veal touches on Third World Studies and other post-colonial theory, but we never engage with these texts directly, which I think is a missed opportunity. Also, the assessments held students accountable to the material, yet they could have benefitted from further tightening in terms of consistent format and study tools. A vocab list for each unit would be so easy to make and so useful for students. ",
            "\u00a0This course tries to move through too much material in too little time, and the result is a totally insufficient and extremely superficial knowledge of several music cultures. It is not designed to actually promote understanding of these cultural systems. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are: the awesome content (well chosen case studies, amazing recordings, good readings), compelling lecture, format that mixes lecture and discussion, the special presentations from visiting artists each unit, and overall the fact that this course (or at least the collection of courses Veal teaches) is unique in the music department which highly underrepresents non-white music traditions.\r\n\r\nThe weaknesses: 1) the task of teaching \"world music\" in one semester to a group of 30 students is an impossible one, and a preposterous one when you consider the three semester \"music history\" sequence it run alongs side, which only deals with western art music. Veal makes a good decision to divide into distinct units and not tackle too much, but even so the pacing doesnt allow for the depth the music deserves. \r\n2) negativity from the class. Some people are there because they are enthusiastic about the material and have opens minds. Others are there because it is required for the major and you can feel that in the room. classical music buffs think the whole thing is secondary to the primary education their getting on Brahms and Bach. However, you cant really blame them, because the strcucture of the department as a whole also dictates that this course is secondary. \r\n3) Section at times was very bad. It would review material from lecture, which was nice but in the long run turned the class into just a frantic scramble to learn all the buzzwords people thought would show up on the tests. In this one case 353 could learn a lesson from music 351 and 352, in which section is used to go deeper into specific music examples. ",
            "\u00a0On two occasions in class (once with guest Stan Scott and once when discussing African music) we had the opportunity to sing the different parts of the music we were discussing. Building this component into the Carribean and Indonesian units as well (if appropriate) would be an exciting addition to the course. ",
            "\u00a0The largest strength is the power of the music. This is music that's begging to be listened to and studied. The class was an introduction to a whole bunch of stuffmuch of which (Indian classical music, Cuban music, Mande music) I'm excited to keep exploring.\r\n\r\nThe largest weakness comes from fact that the class is made up of a strange coalition of students. In reductive analysis, there are two main camps: there's a small but vocal minority of cultural theorists with a lot of postcolonial theory vocabulary but next to no musical vocabulary, and on the other hand a bunch of music majors who can talk about music but are constantly tripping over themselves trying not to phrase things offensively while using a vocabulary they barely understand (and may have little interest in understanding). Compounding the problem is that a good majority of these music majors are, frankly, really dragging their feet about paying any critical attention to music that's outside of the classical canon. So this is the conflict set up in the class. But it unfortunately developed into a really unfortunate class vibe as the semester went on.\r\n\r\nI don't think I can offer any ideas for solving the problem other than obvious, clearly unoriginal onesstarting with, students have really gotta come in with way more open minds. But prof/TA's can also offer much more clear expectations from the beginning of the course. Hopefully this would minimize the kind of discussion where people gleefully pounce on other folks who might be trying to say something intelligent, but are maybe going about it in a naive or misinformed way.

            "\u00a0Not unless necessary for the major. ",
            "\u00a0In no circumstances should you take this course. I was required to for the music major. They just changed the major so you will not have to. Do not take it. ",
            "\u00a0Yale is expanding the world music and ethnomusicology requirement of the music major, so hopefully there will be better alternatives to this class in the future. Take this class only if you absolutely have toyou'll enjoy the music at the very least. ",
            "\u00a0I would STRONGLY recommend this class! It's really enjoyable, relatively relaxed (except for the research paper), and has completely changed the way I think about music. Dr. Veal is a great professor and does the most he can to facilitate student learning. Each unit of the course also features actual musicians of the musical culture being studied brought in for a live performance! ",
            "\u00a0This class felt very disorganized. The four units (India, Indonesia, West Africa, and the Caribbean) were too short to really learn anything substantial. Professor Veal often talked too quickly and used unnecessarily flowery language to describe simple things, making lectures pretty confusing at times. We often had no idea what would be on the test until we went to discussion section the day before and got a summary from our TFs. The class unfortunately seemed to attract quite a few students who liked to hear themselves talk, but I guess that can change each semester.\r\n\r\nI took this class because of the music major requirements. I ended up dropping this class the week before reading week. I am no longer a music major. Would not recommend, but the new music major probably won't require this course anymore. ",
            "\u00a0This is a good primer on a few genres of world music. Professor Veal is very engaging in his lecture style and very knowledgeable. It doesn't go very in depth on any one topic, but that is to be expected in a survey course. Sometimes the assessments didn't seem like the most productive way to process information. Overall, it was very interesting, I learned a lot, and the professor tied together music and history in a compelling way. ",
            "\u00a0Having heard through the grapevine that this course will not be required for the music major starting sometime in the near future, I would strongly recommend that students elect to study a single non-Western tradition in depth, rather than take this course. I believe that surveys on non-Western music can be well executed, but as amazing a scholar and teacher as I've heard Professor Veal is in other settings, this was poorly organized, and students will probably be able to access more intellectually stimulating and rewarding experiences in another class. ",
            "\u00a0It's definitely eye opening and I think it's important for music majors to take, so I would recommend it. I do hope that the structure improves though so it is less stressful. ",
            "\u00a0Unless you're taking it as a requirement for the major, don't take it. It's really sad that I have to say that, because the material itself is really interesting! But Veal, Stephen, and Jacqueline make the class insufferable instead of enjoyable, to the point that I dreaded coming to the class and to section. Even though I loved the material! That's how bad it was! If the class description interests you, read and listen to the material on the syllabus on your own time and don't take this class. Don't waste your time. ",
            "\u00a0Take it!! Everyone needs to take more humanities classes at Yale, and this is such a meaningful way to explore new kinds of music that you haven't heard before. ",
            "\u00a0Probably not? I didn't get very much out of it that I enjoyed beyond its being required for the music major. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I suspect the music dept. offerings are going to change soon but at this point in time it is one of the only music classes I would unequivocally recommend to music majors and non-majors alike. More people should be exploring this material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the cultural, political, and musical perspectives the course offered are necessary for any music student. ",
            "\u00a0Awesome class/material, just kind of unorganized. "
