            "\u00a0It was a great learning experience as we had to engage individually with the material (rather than having it all handed to us). ",
            "\u00a0The only weakness of this course is that because students prepare the lecture, sometimes lectures are confusing. ",
            "\u00a0The normal iteration of MATH 480, where students teach one lecture at most, probably wouldn't be very fulfilling as a senior requirement. The iteration I took with Sam Payne only had 5 students, which meant we each had to lecture four times. Because of this, I got a lot out of the course. However, we were also expected to write, solve, and grade problem sets, as well as post solutions for them. As a whole, we had a significantly higher workload than expected.  I liked the level of engagements that the problem sets provided, but I probably would have preferred a slightly smaller overall workload. In the future, if a 480 professor follows Sam's course model, they could cut down on the number of problem sets. "

            "\u00a0This was one of the most effective math classes I've ever taken. Sam is a really great teacher and mentor, and the feedback from both professor and classmates really improved the quality of my teaching. There really is no better way to learn than from teaching others, and this is really the best way to have a capstone project for math seniors. Don't be scared off by sections with more work, because the more you put into it the more you get out of it. ",
            "\u00a0Historically, this class is pretty chill. You give a lecture (maybe two) and then listen to other people for the rest of the semester. This section was...not super chill, to say the least. Sam Payne followed Yair Minsky's model of MATH 480 (see the Spring '17 iteration of the class), which meant we had to assign and solve problem sets on top of preparing for lectures. On top of that, only 5 people took this section, so each of us was expected to give four lectures over the course of the semester. I got a lot out of this class, but it was also a lot more work than I'd bargained for in the 2nd semester of senior year. If you're taking 480, chances are your experience will be drastically different from ours. But you should check your syllabus, just in case--if it's like ours, be prepared for a high workload. "
