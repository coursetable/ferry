            "\u00a0I gained an understanding of the arc of Western thought over the last ~125 years and a greater appreciation for the historical and philosophical antecedents of today's prevailing ideas and debates. I learned how think about thinkers from both a philosophical and historical perspective. ",
            "\u00a0Learned more per minute in this class than I have in any other class. I really learned the core ideas of the most famous 20th c European thinkers, and the threads that tie them together. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot of surface level information on many philosophers since the Enlightenment. ",
            "\u00a0The course enabled me to gain a broad but superficial understanding of some of the major figures in European intellectual thought. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about countless European intellectuals and philosophers. I learned critical reading skills, how to be participate effectively in group discussions, and how to be clear in my writing. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the ways in which different thinkers were informed by their historical moment and how they learned from one another ",
            "\u00a0This course was a great introduction to the main channels of continental thought since modernity began with the Enlightenment. While giving the ideas their full due, it was also faithful to its listing as a history course, which I think allows for a deeper understanding of the philosophical texts themselves through context and chronology. This class taught the useful skills of dissecting challenging and dense texts, putting authors and sources in conversation with one another, and articulating complex ideas succinctly and clearly. Writing skills and analysis were also developed. ",

            "\u00a0I learned about so many philosophers it was incredible. After attending Professor Shore's lectures, you begin to see the way they relate to one another. In other words, you start to see the history of Western thought as a story. The class has only been over for a couple of days and I have already applied some of the knowledge I have learned to real, everyday discussion ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about the big questions of European intellectual history. I saw how each author fit into larger conversations and built upon other authors' work. The questions of subjectivity and rationality we confronted in the class helped me immensely in thinking through my ER&M and literature classes. ",

Tracing the progression of these events through time allowed me to think critically, finding connections between thinkers of today and yesterday. ",

We did not delve too deeply into the theory (which I would have liked to do), but we rather learned just enough of each thinker to get their main points and terms. In doing the readings, I learned how to read and analyze very dense and complicated philosophy. ",

In all seriousness, this is a fantastic course and Marci Shore is brilliant. It's probably best for students who do not already have a deep knowledge of intellectual history/philosophy, but I'd imagine that even hardcore philosophy students could benefit from seeing these thinkers in historical context the way Professor Shore does. ",

",
            "\u00a0This was a survey course learned about great intellectuals and their main ideas, as well as historical context and biographical information, but not much past that. In the end, HIST 271 was exactly what I thought it'd be. A grand overview of the stage of intellectual thought since the time of Kant (the Nietzsche bit in the title is a bit misleading). ",

            "\u00a0This is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Marci Shore is a great lecturer and I really liked that she didn't use slides. The exams were very fair because she gives sheets with the terms/quotes you need to know. The midterm essay was fun and interesting to write. I'm a STEM major and this class was a great way for me to get involved in the humanities. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Shore's lectures were generally excellent and engaging. However, I found that the midterm was far too rushed in class and the second half of the course felt much more disjointed than the first. ",
            "\u00a0Strength I think would be the quality of teaching from Shore and the TAs. I found the lectures incredibly thoughtful, relevant, and structured. Weakness would probably be that after spring break, the course lost its linear trajectory and got a little confusing. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting thinkers. Weaknesses: a terrible topic for a big lecture. Readings were dull and it was clear no one really did them for section, and the class was too big to get much out of the ideas or really connect with the material. ",

I often left lecture bewildered as to the basic content of the course. It took office hours, individual review, and study groups to fully understand the material. ",

            "\u00a0The midterm was extremely challenging because of the time constraint. I found that 50 minutes for 6 IDs and an essay was quite unreasonable, and because of the time constraint I was not able to think critically about the essay question, but rather just had to regurgitate information. ",
            "\u00a0We got to read primary texts of famous philosophers. Also, the lecturer is phenomenal and makes the material interesting and like a narrative. \r\n\r\nWe did not know what was expected of an in-class history essay. Given that this is a survey introductory course and many people have not taken an in-class essay exam before, it might have been helpful to provide guidelines and samples of history essays. ",

Prof. Shore lectures well and the readings provide good insight to reinforce the material.\r\nThe classes could get a little confusing to students unexposed to the material. Ensuring that clear timelines of eventsespecially the more unfamiliar ones from Eastern Europeare laid out would have helped immensely. ",

            "\u00a0Marci Shore is the best!!! Her lectures are like story-time from childhood. She has the best analogies to understand the philosophy and makes the theories easier to understand. In lecture, she provides multiple strategies to understand each thinker and provides the best stories about her children and and personal stories of hers from when she was a student.\r\nThe biggest weakness of this course is that we are unable to spend a lot of time on each thinker, and we just learn enough for an interesting comment at a cocktail party.

I realize this is a side effect of having such a broad syllabus but cutting down the number of authors may allow for more time to be spent on the more difficult parts of the course. ",

            "\u00a0Marci Shore's lecturing is the real gem of this course, and I think she's done the best job she can in selecting primary source readings that are relevant and understandable (which is really saying something when you consider the incomprehensibility of a lot of philosopher's writing). My only complaint is section. I think that I didn't necessarily have the best TA at leading discussions, but in general I think the section felt to much like a philosophy debate rather than an intellectual history discussion. I have no idea how that can be improved, but maybe just have a better outline for TA's to lead discussion with. ",

Reconstructing some of the authors' thoughts in section would have been immensely valuable, but I always felt like we were too superficial, which I think was because the TAs were not that much more familiar with the authors than we were. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: You learn about the most important thinkers, basically from the Enlightenment through the 20th century. While, as other reviews note, this may help you out at cocktail parties, it genuinely introduced me to new perspectives that I'm sure I will continue to think about for the rest of my life. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Excellent syllabus, engaging lectures, and my TA was strong, both helpful and directing sections well. \r\nWeaknesses: Not enough of the grade is determined by the Credit/D deadline to make decisions on the course. Would have appreciated less breadth and more depth at times with respect to the material (i.e. only focus on 19th and 20th centuries as opposed to Enlightenment). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The handouts were very helpful, and Professor Shore sent us a lot of supplementary emails about extra events we could attend if we were interested. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the lectures felt like Professor Shore kept on repeating ideas over and over again, and I think she could've made better use of the time we were together, sometimes. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures are fun and informative, but they always left me wanting to learn more because they often lacked substance. Section discussions are engaging, but there will be no in-depth discussions of philosophy or theory because they are meant to check that you've done the readings and gone to lectures. ",
            "\u00a0Recordings of the lectures would be extremely helpful as it was hard to catch everything the first time around, especially without typing on a computer. The lectures were generally fantastic! ",
            "\u00a0A good coverage of important European thinkers of 19th-20th Century, we learnt about their key philosophies and how they interacted with each other. The content is very eye-opening however it is a pity that we could not go in depth for each thinker. Most of the time our understanding of the philosophy stops at what is covered during lectures. ",
            "\u00a0Since the course had a wide scope, we didn't get to dive into too much depth but the key concepts were covered in sufficient detail for a good understanding. Overall, lectures were interesting and enjoyable but some lectures were significantly better than others. I think students might better engage with the material through more assigned essays rather than just one essay and two exams. Many of the ideas require a lot of thought and in a timed exam setting students may not be able to present interesting and complex arguments. ",

She was a fantastic lecturer! Her weekly study guides/lecture notes were also very helpful for following along with the material. Some of the ideas were a little over my head, but I think that is the nature of the subject material more than the lecturer. ",

I could have gone for a little more explanation of the organization of the last few lectures. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: lectures are awesome. I'm always excited to hear the next one.\r\nWeaknesses: It's a survey course, so understanding of some thinkers is going to be a bit sketchy. I would have liked help digging into the harder readings (Hegel, Heidegger) more line-by-line rather than hearing a nice exposition of their thought and then not being able to connect it with the reading really. Also seemed like there were some big missing thinkers (Schopenhauer, Kierkegaard, Wittgenstein, all Analytic Philosophy). These may not be professor Shore's areas of expertise, but would have been nice to at least mention them and hear how they fit in. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very strong lectures, Professor Shore is extremely engaging and makes complex subject matter accessible.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: moved very quickly but expected from an introductory survey course, readings varied in length and difficulty week by week ",
            "\u00a0lectures were good but section was lacking ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: (Somewhat ironically for a class that ends with skepticism of all narratives) Prof Shore has a very strong narrative thread in her lectures from Enlightenment to Deconstruction. Her lectures are extremely engaging and she manages to make complex thinkers easily understandable ",
            "\u00a0The lectures given by Professor Shore were definitely the highlight of this course. They were 90% engaging and really left you with a lot to think about after each one. It would help if the handouts with the names highlighted the most important names and not just everyone Professor Shore mentions. ",

First of all, Marci Shore has to be one of the most brilliant people on the planet. She is an incredible lecturer. I left most of her lectures with my jaw dropped and with goosebumps. The readings were difficult but not that long and were so incredibly interesting. The assignments were manageable and very intentional (not at all annoying, you never feel like you are doing busy work). I feel like this class changed my life. The material that you learn is so applicable to everyday life. ",

We are an intellectual bunch of people here at Yale, and it is endlessly valuable to have a basic understanding of not only the basic theories that have informed Western dialogues in the past two centuries, but also the context out of which they arose. Regardless of where you go in life, these ideas will be useful at cocktail parties at worst and in everyday life at best, in the case of a career in the humanities. ",

It will really make you see the world differently. The lecturers are almost like mini performances - everyone claps at the end. I got a lot out of this class. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely loved this class and I think it was the perfect way to cap off my senior year. Professor Shore is wonderful and the lectures were so clear, enjoyable and insightful. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Best class I've taken at Yale, hands down. ",
            "\u00a0One of the best history courses I have taken. The lectures were incredibly and every idea is placed in an overarching dialogue. You cannot escape dialectics. Your understanding of History will be all the better for this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes -- it's a good fifth class if you come to lecture and keep up with the ideas. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class for someone that wants a good overview of western philosophy. It was engaging and intellectual stimulating. Marci Shore is a great lecturer who is able to bring the material and relate it back to the contemporary moment. The readings are actually pretty interesting and the section discussions are productive. The only complaint is that this really is a survey course so don't expect to really know the philosophies in and out, but rather just the general idea. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Must take. ",
            "\u00a0Everyone should take this class. The only downside is your friends will get annoyed with you saying everything is a Hegelian dialectical. In all seriousness though, the course was fascinating and shockingly applicable to daily life. Really gets you to think. ",
            "\u00a0Not really, it's kind of a bland course, especially for such interesting material. Would've been much better in a seminar! ",
            "\u00a0Yes take this course! I am not a history major, but I found that the ideas expressed by the various thinkers have definitely influenced the themes I write about in my creative non fiction. Essentially, it gives you a framework by which to analyze the world around you. You'll find that many of the concepts addressed in class apply to what you see on the news, and you'll be able to give a name/origin to what you are observing. ",
            "\u00a0YES! The lectures are impenetrable, but if you put in the effort to understand the material, you will be rewarded with a much deeper understanding of pretty much any conversation in the humanities. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I think if you are unsure as to what you want to study in history, this is a good survey course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I think this is a great class, but maybe not for a STEM major just trying to get a HU credit. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! An amazing class, even for people who think philosophy isn't their thing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the material helps motivate many ideological trends and history events in the past. The class puts all of history in perspective. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. The lectures are all very interesting and engaging and the workload is very reasonable. ",
            "\u00a0yes, if they want to take it ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take Intellectual History! It's an insightful course that you will learn from even if you are already familiar with the philosophers. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Take this class if you want a great introduction to modern philosophy and understand the Western intellectual tradition. Marci Shores lectures are captivating. ",
            "\u00a0Intellectual History was fantastic. I dont particularly like philosophy, but I loved the way in which Professor Shore presented itas a series of historical trends and developments. ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely! Be prepared to be confused for a while until it all clicks. During the semester, I had points where I grew frustrated with the unintelligible writers (e.g. Derrida), but it paid off. It just takes time to percolate (Professor Shore is right about that one), but once it all comes together, it is fabulous. It really addresses the largest themes of modernity. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely it provides a perspective on the big questions of life ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0This is an interesting course but you need to do the readings to get the most out of the course. Can be a good fifth credit and is not a lot of work for a Cr/D. ",
            "\u00a0Its a good fifth credit, but it isnt going to revolutionize your life or way of thinking. The class is interesting enough to not dislike it, but I wasnt a huge fan either. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Take this course! Even if it just CREDIT/D. Professor Shore gives you the tools to take on historical and intellectual figures that are notoriously challenging and difficult. ",
            "\u00a0this class blew my fucking mind ... I would call it a don't-miss ",
            "\u00a0Yes, take it as early as possible! Really helpful background info going in to all other humanities courses at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course is absolutely worth taking. I'm definitely not a philosophy person, and to be quite frank I'm still not, but having at least the basic understanding of continental philosophy that I've gained from this course has already benefited me in other courses. Marci Shore is a fantastic lecturer, and the reading load isn't particularly heavy and always feels relevant to the course (even if it is dense and somewhat incomprehensible sometimes). The paper is annoying, but not particularly bad, and the exams were definitely fair. Overall 11/10 would recommend. ",
            "\u00a0Yes; it provides an interesting background in continental philosophy to those who either do not know anything about it or want to approach it in a new way. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class. Marci Shore does an amazing job at providing solid familiarity with canonical thinkers of the modern Western tradition. The questions that the class goes into have very consequential stakes, which is why this class is one of the best classes Ive taken at Yale. The class essentially throws at you the crisis of Modernity: what happens when we kill off God and have to deal with the massive epistemological, ethical and ontological void that it brings along? Europeans desperately tried to fill this void for about a century, a journey that is both extremely insightful and moving to reconstruct. Marci Shore does an amazing job at making you feel the angst, pain and frustration that goes along this history. This makes the class depressing at times (if the first half of the class does not make you a nihilist, then either you have an unshakable faith in God or youre not taking the death of God seriously; I am now convinced that secular morality is impossible), but some comforting ideas can be found along the way (I personally found solace in French existentialism). ",
            "\u00a0Aww helll yee. You get exposed to so many different ideas that have shaped the course of history, which will generally make you more knowledgeable, and hopefully inform your outlook on life and the world. Also, people freaking clap at the end of Professor Shore's lectures she's so good. Lastly, the readings are excellent (with the exception of Husserl because he was a great thinker but a crap writer), but you can certainly do well without doing all of them, and probably even any of them, if you really don't have the time. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, Professor Shore is an amazing lecturer and the material is both very fascinating and important. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Lectures were amazing and Marci Shore is a Yale Gem. TAKE THIS BEFORE YOU GRADUATE. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to other students; its particularly useful to those earlier on in their Yale careers, but even as an EP&E major whos taken quite a few political philosophy courses I still got quite a bit out of this one through exposure to philosophers outside of political theory. The course covers European Intellectual History from the Enlightenment onwards but more particularly since Nietzsche and the Death of God. Lectures are engaging, my section leader (Carolyn) was quite good, and the readings are definitely worth doing. I took this in a busy semester, but I may suggest not doing so as you will get more from the course if you engage more fully. ",
            "\u00a0Yes; I feel like we go through college hearing about thinkers like Nietzsche and Arendt and such but don't really understand their ideas. I guess it's easiest just to pick up a book and read about this kind of stuff, but if you're looking for a relatively laid back fifth course, go with this one. ",
            "\u00a0I can't recommend this course to anyone with a background or a deep interest in the subject matter, particular those who have studied philosophy. The course offers a great reading list, but ultimately treats interesting philosophy in a basically unphilosophic way. You come away with a handful of scattered notions about the thinkers studied, but none of the meat of their thought. That might sound like a tall order, but I think it would be within the reach of a different professor. And if the philosophical substance wasn't there, at least we could have had a good biographic understanding of the authors. But even this was lacking. \r\nWhat is perhaps most disappointing is that the course fails to convey a sense of the rigorous connection from author to author, as if we hadn't even grasped the *beginning* of the question of making an intellectual history. Doing an intellectual history is a philosophic act and Professor Shore is not a philosopher, after all. ",
            "\u00a0I'd absolutely recommend this course. Fantastic overview of philosophy since the enlightenment. The lectures are superb, and the material I learned in this class was applicable in all the other classes I took this semester. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommended. A good overview of the important philosophy movement in the last century and a good jumping board from which to explore the individual thinkers in depth. Many of the philosophical thoughts also prompted self-reflection about what is the meaning of life. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0Yes!  Super fun and almost no work ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! This was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Marci Shore is absolutely amazing, engaging and makes some of the most difficult thinkers accessible. Definitely take this class. ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend this course to anyone and everyone. ",
            "\u00a0I would most definitely recommend it. This has been my favorite course at Yale - no other class captures the essence of intellectual development and recounts the wonderful narrative of Europe with such acumen and taste. ",
            "\u00a0This class gives you an incredible foundation of knowledge about all the major thinkers in European history since the French Revolution. Would strongly recommend. Knowing a little bit about Hegel, Freud, Foucault, etc, is incredibly helpful for every major at Yale. Shore is also a great lecturer- some I will remember for a long time. ",
            "\u00a0A great overview of contemporary intellectual thought touching on all the major thinkers of the 20th century. ",
            "\u00a0100% or more. These lectures are a phenomenon you don't want to miss. I got a really solid understanding of the Enlightenment and some of its key legacies, of existentialism, structuralism and post-structuralism from it. Recommend to people from any major. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. It's a perfect way to get real insight into a tricky topic and learn from a stellar lecturer and expert in her field. Material is interesting and it won't take much time away from your other obligations. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this class to any humanities major looking to get a broad foundation in major intellectual themes throughout 19th and 20th centuries. I am very happy I took this class my sophomore year to inform my future studies in the history major! ",
            "\u00a0yeah it's a great intro to modern philosophy if you haven't taken any before ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend this course because it will provide a foundation for seminars that focus in on a more specific topic. ",
            "\u00a0The singular best class Ive taken at Yale. A definite must take. Shore is a one-of-a-kind Professor. Each lecturer received applause and deserved it! Absolutely a must take if you want to sound fluent on 19th century thought. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. HIST 271 is an excellent survey class on continental philosophy. Prof. Shore is a fantastic lecturer who is able to fashion a narrative with anecdotes and philosophical arguments. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Take it and listen to Prof. Shore's incredible lectures. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! ",
            "\u00a0YES. TAKE THIS COURSE. It gives a great foundation of Western intellectual history. All the readings (yes ALL THE READINGS) are very engaging and fun to read! ",
            "\u00a0If youre willing to do the readings (which you should TOTALLY do bc theyre the best of the best), take it. If you dont want to read, audit the class or take it credit/D. Marci Shore is phenomenal. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course in a heartbeat. Of course it is not for everyone. I recommend it to students with an appreciation for big ideas, and for conversations between thinkers. I think a certain enjoyment of ideas is needed. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It fills in a lot of gaps in both one's historical and philosophical understanding of the 20th century. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This class is so much FUN. I know that for most of us, reading Heidegger and Husserl and Havel are not really synonymous with something fun. Yet, it was so  much fun to learn what intellectual movements shaped Europe, and how they responded to one another. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it helped map the intellectual history of the Western world as we know it. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student if they are interested at all in intellectual history. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Completely changed my perception of the world. "
