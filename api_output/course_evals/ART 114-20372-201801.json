            "\u00a0Basic drawing skills. Also, the course changed my perceptions of drawings entirely. They're something I CAN make instead of something professional artists create. ",
            "\u00a0greater drawing abilities ",
            "\u00a0drawing, critically viewing other drawings, spatial reasoning ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to draw -- not necessarily specific techniques, but how to look at things like an artist, approach different mediums, and grow more confident in my abilities. ",
            "\u00a0Drawing skills, and ink ",
            "\u00a0I got a lot stronger in my drawing, especially my drawing with charcoal. I learned to be less apologetic and not to erase. ",
            "\u00a0It was really good for concentration and I improved my drawing and creative thinking a lot ",
            "\u00a0The basics of thinking about drawing as a tool of expression and how to not be too caught up with yourself to enjoy the creative process. ",
            "\u00a0I think I learnt to be a lot more confident with the lines I made in my drawing, and remembered how much patience it takes to draw. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to observe the world around me in greater detail and build my own representations of that world on paper. ",
            "\u00a0This course supplied me with skills and insights that have not been as easily available to me in the regular academic classroom setting. Drawing taught me  the ways in which my mind can be used in different ways by learning how to be present to the moment and patient with myself. The course exposed me to the creative side of myself that is often repressed due to strict academic demands of university. "

            "\u00a0very free form and not very structured which can be good in an art class but also allows a lot of room for not being very engaged, especially since the class is about 2 hours long! ",
            "\u00a0excellent, great . perhaps more one-on-one time with TAs ",
            "\u00a0Coming to class twice a week and listening to Robert Storr speak about drawing, famous artists, and even life advice was an incredible experience. Even though my class was quite large, I got a lot of feedback from him and Camille, our incredible TA. I loved when he pulled up relevant examples from art history that gave us a lot to think about as we drew. I only wish we had more clarity on our sketchbook -- I didn't understand the expectations and what the purpose was for it over the semester. ",
            "\u00a0A little repetitive ",
            "\u00a0This course was a great place to explore drawing in a fairly unstructured way, with some feedback from the professor and TF. I found it a little dry at times and we were pretty dependent on which models could come and often ended up just drawing our instructor and TF. ",
            "\u00a0Too long too much talking sometimes ",
            "\u00a0Nothing bad to say about it, might pick better days to draw outside. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated how the course did not assign any homework, I do wonder if it would have been useful to have more feedback along the way. But at the same time I think that might have made us more self conscious in a way that would have made it harder to draw. ",
            "\u00a0I wish the section I was in had more homework. I dont think I got as much as I could have out of the course without it. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this course was very effective. A strength was the variety of media we used for our drawings. A way it might be improved is by slightly more technical guidance and feedback from the teaching team. "

            "\u00a0Yes! Two hours twice a week can be a lot, but Professor Storr is genuine, intelligent, nice, and helpful. ",
            "\u00a0if you've never drawn before, this class won't give you much direct instruction.  professor storr is very, VERY hands off and won't give you much direct feedback.  most of the learning you'll do will be through practice, but honestly that's sort of how art skills are generally best gained so it's not a huge deal.  if you've taken drawing classes before and you like very unstructured art classes, this class could be for you! ",

            "\u00a0I would totally recommend Basic Drawing to any student, especially people who aren't art majors. It just engages a totally different part of your brain and changes the way you think. There's not a lot of work (so little outside of class), the class is very accessible, and you will be pushed in rewarding ways. Do it! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, was a fun class ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is a good course to take if you want to come in twice a week and just draw for a few hours, and not really have to worry about it beyond that. ",

            "\u00a0Absolutely, if you can get in, take it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely, Rob was an incredible teacher and I loved taking basic drawing with him. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I recommend taking this class with Robert Storr! If you are interested in learning about drawing, you will definitely improve with practice during this class. He's pretty hands-off, and there's no homework other than keeping a sketchbook, so it's a great, chill way to learn, though you won't get very much feedback on your work. As a second semester senior, it was the perfect class to round out my semester. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!!! It gives you a new perspective on what it means to \"learn\" and it exposes you to different sides of yourself that you may not have known before. You learn so much about yourself, the world, and art. "
