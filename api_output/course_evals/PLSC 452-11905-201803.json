            "\u00a0I like how the class started with all sections going to the same lecture and then splitting. I wish we had been assigned TAs so I had felt more inclined to reach out for help. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength is BY FAR the recorded lectures/media library. They were crucial to my homework completion process, and I would always refer back to them, especially as a non-STEM major who usually struggles with so much information being delivered so quickly. I don't know if I would have passed the class without them, and I feel I not only passed the class, but dominate and understand the material. Prof. Reuning is an amazing and clear lecturer, so this helps us maximise the benefits from having him as an instructor. ",
            "\u00a0The course is overall very good. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked how the course was structured. The instructor incorporated fun review games, funny jokes, and ample opportunities to attend office hours. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a solid introduction to statistics. I feel much more statistically literate after taking this course, and feel more comfortable reading studies and research papers. However, I do not feel as if I gained any real computational skills. MiniTab essentially does all of the work for you, so there isn't much that you learn outside of that. Additionally, the constant refrain that it is necessary to take more courses in the department to learn how to do things for real, or understand why things work the way that they do, was incredibly frustrating and disheartening for someone who only planned on taking intro statistics. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The TAs are extremely helpful and active. Johnathan is a very understanding professor. The recorded lectures are a HUGE plus. \r\nWeaknesses: Problem sets can range from relatively difficult to surprisingly difficult. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course is super well-oriented to facilitate learning. Between all of the online resources, the TAs, and Jonathan's willingness to help us in any way we needed, the whole S&DS 102 staff were amazing at what they did. Even if you missed class, it was not difficult to catch up on learning some of the material. While I do not feel like I learned everything that was taught, that was partially my fault for not putting as much work into it as I should have. But, when I needed to study or do a PSet, I had a ton of resources at my disposal. I think they could improve by providing more example problems on Canvas. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths in this course are: the professor, he was so engaging in class and so informative; the TAs, they were extremely helpful in Office Hours; the Problem Sets, they were always a good level of difficulty and highly related to what we had just done in class. There were no weaknesses of this course. ",
            "\u00a0It was way to easy to get an A in this class without actually learning very much. The open note homeworks and exams and the watchable lectures combined to make it possible to just skate through the semester figuring out how to do the work just when it needed to get done. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course is that it teaches you how to analyse statistical data in basic ways, which is very important for STEM and non-STEM majors alike. If you work hard and spend lots of time on the psets then you can easily get at least 90s on them. \r\n\r\nHowever, this course progresses very very quickly, so you really need to stay on top of the coursework and lectures. Also, the midterms are much more difficult than the psets and ask you to apply your knowledge in new ways which can be extremely challenging. ",

            "\u00a0Very clear, helpful instructor and tas ",

            "\u00a0I thought the instructor was amazing. I think that more equitably spaced office hours could help, but truly, the class was really well conducted and the PSETS were helpful in understanding the material. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Reuning-Scherer went above and beyond to make everything about this course convenient. We could sit in our dorms and watch lectures that he helpfully recorded for us, and 2 out of our 3 major tests were take-home. There were also multiple TAs office hours every day, so we could get help whenever we needed it. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the professors charisma and how interesting the subject matter is. The weakness is absolutely the computer program, MINITAB, that we had to use. It does not run natively on Macs and I had to buy a flash drive in order to be able to use any of the data we needed for the problem sets. ",
            "\u00a0Very fast paced and sometimes hard to grasp because I had little background in stats. ",

            "\u00a0strengths: recorded lectures, helpful TAs like Colin and Gena, posted detailed slides early in advance to annotate or print out or just for general reference, the examples JRS would give in class, can get minitab for free through yale so you didn't have to pay anything to take the class, multiple resources for help\r\n\r\nweaknesses: felt like we were tested on things that weren't explicitly mentioned or explained in lectures, some of the TAs weren't helpful and once even gave me wrong advice soon before the psets were due, massive lecture size, the first 5 weeks as S&DS 100x and the last weeks of the semester splitting up into different sections was a little confusing ",
            "\u00a0strengths - recorded lectures that are super clear and engaging, straightforward tests\r\nweaknesses - more resources for psets ",
            "\u00a0This course was very well-structured toward facilitating student learning, the professor and the TA's were excellent and made the class material extremely approachable, even for those of us with minimal or no stats background. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is that Jonathan teaches in a very understandable and engaging way. I really appreciated the fact that he recorded all of the classes and provided us with additional recorded material to review. The weakness of the class is possibly that we went through material extremely quickly, but this was acknowledged the first day of class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths = the freedom with watching lecture and taking tests online - better way for me to learn\r\nWeak = none ",
            "\u00a0JRS is hilarious, so the lectures are fun. I also think a strength is office hours. Most of the TAs were really helpful. I think the class could maybe be improved by slowing down lectures. I barely retained any information from lecture itself. "
