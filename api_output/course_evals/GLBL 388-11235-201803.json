            "\u00a0I learned so much about the political determinants of US foreign policy from the Truman presidency to the present day. Governor Dean changed the syllabus so that we needed to write three policy memos, and I felt that I improved with each one, and by the third knew how to write them succinctly! ",
            "\u00a0The politics behind crafting foreign policy; how to write effective and concise policy memos; how to avoid group-think and strive towards long-term thinking ",
            "\u00a0Howard is very focused on conveying and teaching real world skills he feels we'll need to make an impact and be successful in any field we enter. Though the course is of course focused on discussion and reading, he was emphatic that we learn to write really good policy memos, and gave great feedback on that front. He even replaced the usual midterm paper with two more policy memos in order to give us more practice since he felt we weren't as strong as he'd have liked us to be. In addition to memo writing, Howard hammered in what he felt were life lessons learned from a career in politics, and the very unique experiences he's able to draw on. Though they can get repetitive, they are undoubtedly useful and I'm sure to draw on some Howardisms in the future. ",
            "\u00a0This course really helped improve my writing skills, on both research papers as well as memos. ",
            "\u00a0How to analyze presidential policy and decision making, as well as how to prepare concise policy memos ",
            "\u00a0This course provides a valuable historical survey of key moments in 20th American foreign policy. While the readings were phenomenal and are certainly pieces that I will go back to and reread for my own edification, the policy memos were one of the strongest learning opportunities the course presented. I quickly learned to synthesize a large quantity of information into a concise and well-organized brief that is undoubtedly a skill I will take with me wherever I end up in my career. ",
            "\u00a0Deeper insight into foreign policy ",
            "\u00a0Definitely learned how to streamline analytical writing. Professor Dean is very focused on ensuring one's work product is direct, to the point, and effective. The three policy memos we wrote were excellent exercises in this kind of decisive writing. \r\n\r\nThis course also provides excellent insight into the ways in which political decisions are made, focusing on the personalities/characters of the leaders in question, as well as the structure of bodies like the National Security Council. You definitely come away understanding far more about the practical aspects of governing. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a variety of skills from this class, most importantly, the value of long-term thinking in formulating foreign policy. This course also taught me how to write a clear, concise policy memo. I learned a lot about the structure of the National Security Council and how important decisions are made inside the White House. Finally, we discussed a great deal of history surrounding U.S. foreign policy in the 20th century. ",
            "\u00a0This course covered a number of different presidencies, engaging with the individual qualities of the presidents themselves as well as the broader issues in forgone policy that they had to grapple with, such as promoting democratic values and human rights as well as waging just war. This course was very helpful in developing practical skills such as writing policy memos, learning about the processes of diplomacy such as being in the NSC situation room or working with international bodies such as the UN. It was also very informative in developing teamwork skills, both around the seminar table, and in the group final project. The course also gave great insights into the importance of personal relationships in the higher echelons of governance. ",
            "\u00a0General overview of american foreign policy from Truman to Obama, focusing on the defining foreign policy decisions of each administration. The class was generally more focused on the leadership styles and characters of each president rather than nitty gritty historical details; it was almost more of an examination of how interpersonal dynamics dictated an administration's relative success (or failure) in the foreign policy arena. "

            "\u00a0It was an excellent class, the opportunity to spend two hours every week discussing foreign policy with Governor Dean was amazing and it was something I looked forward to every Monday. The course assignments were interesting and well targeted towards what we had studied, and the outside speakers and special classes were a lot of fun. Perhaps the class could have benefited from a little more structure in each class - I'm not sure I could pinpoint what exactly the key points of Reagan's foreign policy were, for example, even though we spent a lot of time discussing him as part of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Governor Dean himself. He is very approachable and is always willing to help his students. The class also provided close interactions and opportunities for discussions with important people in the field of foreign policy. \r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the quality of the class discussion is not as good as it could be. Encouraging students to more actively engage with the readings by asking them to post some discussion questions online before the start of class could be a good idea. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are definitely the guest speakers, simulations, office hours and class dinners that Howard made sure were a focal point of the course. A weakness of the course was that discussions often lacked structure, and that though there were overarching themes and interesting conversations, I can't say I learned anything new about foreign policy or history through the class. It was more of a practice/themes/biographies curriculum, though that ended up being what I loved most about the course. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was extremely informative, interesting, and very well-taught. ",
            "\u00a0More structure and more comprehensive analysis of each president's foreign policy would be helpful. At times the course was too unfocused and presidents' foreign policies were reduced to a single issue in class discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Howard has a lot of knowledge and insights\r\nWeaknesses: it is a lot of reading that isnt really discussed ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: (1) Splitting the writing portion of the course into three 2-page memos was a fantastic decision. I saw my progress improve rapidly over the course of the three assignments, and found our discussions of what made a strong policy brief along with Governor Dean's comments to be very helpful in honing my approach. (2) The reading list is fantastic. I wish I had had the time to dig into each piece in depth, but nonetheless they provided an excellent foundation from which to understand and approach difficult policy making decisions.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The one main weakness I'd cite was the apparent lack of structure to the class discussions. I found when I sat down to write the memos that our discussions hadn't quite prepared us to understand some of the core tools common to foreign policy decisions. A discussion of key takeaways or strategies from each of the Presidents/units would be an excellent start in understanding how to apply some of their insights to our own work/lives. In addition, perhaps focusing the discussions more on the substance of decision making as opposed to a substantial amount of time on the discussion of personalities of the people making the decisions would be useful. All in all, though, a wonderful learning opportunity! ",
            "\u00a0Great speakers ",
            "\u00a0Class discussions were awesome; Prof Dean did a great job of pulling people into conversation. Guest speakers were one of the highlights of the course (Samantha Power, Jake Sullivan, Samantha Barry, to name a few). Reading assignments could sometimes be a little lengthy; condensing those might encourage students to read everything more fully. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed taking this class. Howard is a real character and has so many incredible insider stories about politics. He is happy to meet with students all the time and often took us out to get crepes and coffee which was so nice. The class really came together, largely because Howard fosters a fun and lively environment. The guest speakers are another highlight...we got to speak with Samantha Power and several other notable figures. \r\nIn terms of improvements, I think the course would benefit from having more structure. The guest speakers and National Security Council simulation were all great, but the courses with only class discussion sometimes felt like a book talk. It was nice having an opportunity to discuss about what we found interesting in the books we read, but I would have enjoyed having more structure and specific takeaways from the timer periods we focused on each week. Sometimes it felt like the discussion would drift in too many different directions and we'd lose sight of the core topic of foreign policy. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very unique in providing many opportunities to engage with the instructor in detail and close proximity, from the seminar classroom itself to the numerous dinners and office hours held throughout the semester. Professor Dean was very accessible and gave good feedback whenever asked. He was also good at leading seminar discussions such that everyone felt they could voice their opinions honestly and freely. \r\nThere were not many weaknesses other than the course felt at times a bit disorganised and became somewhat repetitive towards the end. It would have been helpful to have more in-depth reading material and more guidance at the start in writing policy memos and policy papers because there was almost no guidance whatsoever in this area. As a result, the practical skills developed in writing high-quality policy and research papers felt quite lacking by the end of the class. ",
            "\u00a0This was definitely a result of the guest speakers' availability (they could only come at certain times in the semester, so the rest of the class had to be altered to accommodate them) but the sequence of classes felt a little random/discombobulated. On a more general note, occasionally discussions would completely veer off topic (and not in a productive way)--it would be nice if classes were a little more focused. Overall, though, I really enjoyed this class and thought that Professor Dean did a great job moderating the class. "

        [
            "\u00a0Definitely - if you get accepted, this is an awesome class that brings with it a very engaged academic environment. I am someone who loves to get by in classes without doing the readings....and I think I could have done this in this class as well except I realised one class that I was missing out on such an amazing discussion that I made sure to be as prepped as possible for all the other classes. It is not too hard, but the skills learned (such as how to write policy memos) were incredibly useful, and the insight from a veteran policy maker himself was very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Take the course, if you can! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! The course is so interesting and the connversations with Professor Dean are quite engaging. I would highly recommend! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Maybe not if unstructured classes and more humanities-style discussion is not for you, or if you want to get into the nitty gritty of American Foreign Policy, but if you want to talk broadly about American leaders and leadership in the 20th century, and try to connect those lessons to the present, this is a great place to start. Howard makes sure to set the tone relaxed and friendly, and the class actually gets a rapport going, which is very nice. I definitely got much better at memo-writing, and got a much better understanding of the nitty gritty of politics from an insider's perspective. Howard also really makes an effort to get to know and mentor his students, and it's much appreciated, and reciprocated. Overall, very fun and interesting! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, if you are passionate about history and politics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, great class. Howard is the man! He's so committed to his students, I felt so good learning from him. ",
            "\u00a0Howard's wisdom and personal experience make this a great course for anyone interested in working in government or any aspect of foreign policy. However, the class would benefit from more structure and a more comprehensive analysis of each president's foreign policy. At times the course was too unfocused and presidents' foreign policies were reduced to a single issue in class discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, Howard offers an interesting perspective on foreign policy through a domestic lens ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course! Be prepared to be flexible in the discussions. Howard often jumps around to related anecdotes and ideas that speak to the material in different ways, which was initially frustrating as I'd envisioned a more concrete analysis of the case studies we dealt with. That said, the course quickly grew on me, and his genuine desire for everyone to learn and do well was refreshing and rewarding. The material is phenomenal and the policy memos, although challenging, were an incredible chance to get your hands dirty in highly contentious world issues that occupy the top minds of the world. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Wonderfully comprehensive course on foreign politics. Professor Dean is incredibly engaged and dedicated to his students. Class discussions, readings, and guest speakers all fascinating. Your analytical writing skills, perceptions of political decision-making, and ability to simultaneously examine foreign and domestic politics will definitely improve and evolve. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested in learning more about foreign policy and politics. This course is really about meeting some really amazing speakers and picking Howard's brain to learn from all of his incredible political experience. ",
            "\u00a0This course is great for the opportunity to interact closely with Howard Dean, who has a lot of knowledge and life advice to offer. It is also a good chance to learn how to work in a team in an academic context and you get to meet a lot of interesting students and speakers. However, you don't really learn much in terms of writing skills or anything of real academic depth so by the end of the semester the class feels a bit overstretched. Quite typical of global affairs seminars: cool people, kind of a gut, but people pretend it's academically rigorous. ",
            "\u00a0This was a very solid course. It's definitely not life-changing as far as the material itself goes, but getting the chance to get to know Professor Dean and some of the guest speakers was pretty great. In short, take the class with the understanding that it's not like an incredibly rigorous examination of American Foreign policy, but that it's still valuable for both the people you meet and for the various lenses that it teaches you to examine foreign policy decisions through.
