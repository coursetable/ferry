            "\u00a0I learned about the world of global governance and the gaps that create major ethical issues. ",
            "\u00a0In this course, I learned all about the \"governance gap\" of multinational corporations. I also learned all about the different actors that are meant to hold businesses accountable in a globalized economy. For my final paper, I wrote about Brazil's reticence towards bilateral investment treaties, and dove deep into international tribunals and arbitration, and why host countries may be hesitant to engage in trade on such terms, given that those tribunals often side with corporations. ",
            "\u00a0How transnational corporations work and  the main issues in the field of corporate governance. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very out of my comfort zone, but I learned so much about international law and business. This course certainly broadened my perspective on the world. I learned so much new terminology, topics and ideas through the readings and case studies. I really enjoyed this class. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the history of business ethics, the global trade system, multinational corporations, CSR, and current business ethics questions. I also learned how to analyze business cases and legal cases. "

            "\u00a0This course was awesome. Structured great, taught well, facilitated discussion and learning. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Very organized, mixture of case studies and readings, regular reading responses, structured discussions with ample time to make insights and engage with other classmates.\r\nWeaknesses: There could be more in-depth discussion of the political motives behind these international investment norms, sometimes the course readings got really arduous with all the legalese. ",
            "\u00a0The assignments are well spread put, the reading responses help you keep engaged in the readings, and the readings are actually quite useful for completing the course assignments. ",
            "\u00a0The readings were very interesting and informative, but a bit too long. I found myself struggling to complete all the readings each week. I enjoyed each class discussion though and thought the people in the class were incredibly intelligent and engaging. I also thought this course had a steep learning curve for people who didn't take a prior class in one of the topics, making participation in the seminar a bit daunting. I remember feeling very overwhelmed at the beginning of the class, and a bit throughout the semester. I wish there were more resources available to those who weren't as familiar with the subject matter. ",
            "\u00a0This class is really interesting, fun, and engaging. We had great class discussions about current business ethics cases and potential solutions and Professor Acorn's explanations and insights were really helpful for understanding and contextualising the readings. The paper topics are pretty open and allowed us to choose our own topics and write about things we were particularly interested in. "

            "\u00a0Yes. Take if you can fit it in your schedule. Professor Acorn is the best! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to any student interested in business, corporate social responsibility, international affairs, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This course opened my eyes to a field of study that Id never encountered before and if nothing else its good to be aware of the workings of transnational corporationswhich have a major impact on our world. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would certainly recommend this course to another student. It is the most interdisciplinary class at Yale, and interweaves topics including IR, business, law, political science, ethics and more. Any student from any discipline should take this course because it will expand your world view and the topics in the class affects everyone. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this class! The weekly readings are interesting, the class discussions are usually animated and the class doesn't run out of topic, and Professor Acorn's teaching style is very clear, engaging and helpful. Her weekly contextualising introductory class presentations, discussion guidance, and helpful insights make this class very fun, intellectually stimulating and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, well taught seminar on an interesting subject ",
            "\u00a0This course is well organized, develops a useful framework for understanding the different weaknesses on governing MNC's, and how different methods may be employed to address these issues. It is a reasonably well-run discussion, and people generally have done the readings because of the required responses. There is a lot of flexibility with the papers, but the professor is also willing to help you develop the idea. Would reccomend. "
