            "\u00a0Aside from improving my grammar and writing, conversational skills are thoroughly developed in this class. Class sizes tend to be small, so conversations with individual classmates and with the class as a whole are encouraged. A week did not go by without the class learning about a different cultural aspect of Italy and its people, so those interested in improving their Italian and learning about the culture would benefit from this class. ",
            "\u00a0Culture and history of Italian ",
            "\u00a0I finished learning all the tenses in Italian! Both my oral comprehension got better (thanks to the Italian movies we watched and discussed) and my writing. I learned a lot about the Italian culture. I also had a chance to read amazing short pieces of Italian literature. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The strengths of this class is that foundational concepts in grammar and conversation are improved through minor daily assignments. The workload was never uncomfortably high, and you build upon your skills with each class. The course is conducted in a low stress environment where frequent feedback from the professor is viewed as constructive. Different forms of Italian media, both historical and contemporary, are a staple of this class, so engaging with these works was always something to look forward to. ",
            "\u00a0More focus on grammar ",
            "\u00a0I think we should have even longer discussions about Italian culture, Italian history and politics. This will not only be good for practicing speaking Italian more fluently, but our experience of the language will be more grounded. ",
            "\u00a0It is distinct from L1-3 courses and feels genuinely like a class that students opted to take, as we did, rather than as a mandated language requirement. "

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I took a year off of taking Italian and was terrified to jump back into it. Simona provided immediate feedback to me on the first day of class and every class that followed, but always in a constructive and polite manner. The workload is low aside from the class meeting daily, and there was never a day where I dreaded to go to class. If you are looking to improve your skills in Italian, do not hesitate to take this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes simona is great ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend taking L4 Italian to anyone who is interested in improving their Italian. I love the balance between grammar learning and cultural exposure. The number of people who are in your section drop from 15 to 6, which gives everyone more time to engage in class and get personal feedback on their growth. \r\nIt is also fascinating to read the works of Italian authors you know and love in their their original language!!! \r\nWe also got to explore the Little Italy in New Haven which made our experience with Italian even more tangible and grounded. We discovered a new part of New Haven that we haven't before! "
