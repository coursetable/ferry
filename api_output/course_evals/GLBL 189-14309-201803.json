            "\u00a0I gained an understanding of how to develop and execute a health research project. I improved my scientific proposal writing skills, as well as my presentation ability and class discussion skills. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a ton about research methods in global health, made headway on my individual global health capstone project for this upcoming summer, practiced scientific writing, and got to engage in meaningful discussions about ethics in global health. ",
            "\u00a0Literally nothing -- this class was terrible and useless. ",
            "\u00a0how to write a research proposal ",
            "\u00a0I learned about writing a proposal for global health research, as well as some methodology and ethics. ",
            "\u00a0Methods and ethics of research ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write a scientific research proposal, which methods can be best applied to a given research question, how to build a relationship with a research mentor, and the ethical and practical challenges of implementing various study designs and how to overcome them. ",
            "\u00a0You learn how to write an entire research proposal over the course of the semester with the possibility of carrying the research out over the summer. Professor Curry and Diksha were really great at breaking down each step of the process, from brainstorming ideas at the beginning of the semester to providing resources for more specific research plans at the end of the semester. "

            "\u00a0Professor Curry is amazing, and Diksha was a wonderful TA. I liked how applicable the course material felt to the real world, and it also felt like the readings were relevant. Additionally, both Professor Curry and Diksha gave thorough feedback that was incredibly helpful. I liked that the class helps you build up a whole research proposal, but I wish we had devoted more class time to each step of preparing the proposal. For a lot of the time, I felt a little overwhelmed by the process, especially since I knew that I might actually conduct the project and so I wanted to do it right, but I also knew that there was a chance I wouldn't conduct the project and thus hesitated to reach out to potential faculty advisors or partner organizations. That being said, Professor Curry did a great job of ensuring that any concerns or areas we wanted to discuss further were brought up in subsequent classes. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength and biggest weakness of the course is how personalized it is. On one hand, I got really thoughtful feedback and guidance on a project that was meaningful to me all the way through the semester. On the other, the assignments were all tailored to someone who locked down a summer research opportunity right at the beginning of the semester, and I, like a bunch of other people, was not able to, so it felt like the class served a drastically different function for me than it did for the first camp. It wasn't that I didn't get anything out of the assignments, but I wish there were clearer infrastructure for how to juggle making headway on my summer while also working through and benefitting from the assignments. It almost might have been better if we had to do the assignments as an exercise only and also just got support as we tried to find summer opportunities. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Puts aside some time for your to write a proposal.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Bad course discussions, unhelpful readings, very little support to complete a project, very little learning, unavailable prof/teaching staff, arbitrary grading. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: It was really helpful to have Professor Curry's connections when I was looking for a research mentor. Diksha (the TA) was great because she was always available for any questions.\r\nWeaknesses: The material covered in class rarely felt relevant to our research proposals and everything felt way too abstract.  Sometimes the class felt like a 2 hour tangent. While they were always interesting, I wasn't sure that I really took that much away from them in the long run. I wish we spent more time workshopping our classmate's proposals or having guest lecturers or something.  I felt like I would be better off spending that time working on my research proposal. Also, the deadlines at the very beginning of the semester were very hard for someone who did not have a research mentor or project yet. Professor Curry and Diksha were as flexible as the could with the deadlines, and I really appreciated this, but it didn't seem like the most efficient way to format the class. I wish that they were more \"advisors\" and less \"professors\" and each person could establish their deadlines based on their proposed project (since so many people in the class were doing such different kinds of research.) ",
            "\u00a0Professor Curry and Diksha were definite strengths. They were great instructors and I really enjoyed coming to class. I wish that there was more lecturing and less discussion, just so that I would have learned a little bit more. ",
            "\u00a0Very manageable workload, Leslie Curry is an awesome, kind professor. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated that the course encouraged us to find faculty and research mentors early on, since it encouraged me to connect with an organization that helped me design my summer research. I also really appreciated the opportunity to get feedback from our peers during class to hone our research questions and aims. Additionally, I enjoyed the guest speakers we heard, particularly the opportunity to hear from and ask questions of past students who had gone off and implemented their proposals. One thing I wish I had more clarity about at the beginning of the semester was whether or not we were expected to implement these projects over the summer. I think it would have taken off some pressure to know that I could change my mind and write a completely different proposal after the class was finished. ",
            "\u00a0I think the experience of this course overall was great, but at the beginning of the semester, it can be a little stressful when you are trying to reach out to potential faculty mentors for your project or potential partner organizations. That would be my only noted weakness of the course, how sometimes it can feel as though you are trying very hard to write a good in-depth proposal but it may be frustrating waiting for outside contacts to follow up. I do think that Professor Curry and Diksha were very helpful in terms of the support and resources they provided for all students. They were fantastic, and tried their best to help when students needed it! "

            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone interested in conducting health-related research. I felt that the skills and knowledge I gained were extremely valuable, and I liked that by the end of the semester, I had an actionable proposal that I could actually take forward and conduct over the summer. The course is well-taught, and the material is digestible and practical. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Even if you don't get to execute the project you propose in this class, it's a great chance to learn from the inevitably amazing minds that study global health, Dr. Curry, guest speakers, and your peers alike. ",
            "\u00a0No! This course is terrible. Take literally anything else, or even just take one fewer credit and work on a proposal in your free time. Bad teaching, bad readings, bad discussions, unhelpful teaching staff etc. ",
            "\u00a0Only if you're seriously considering research! Come in with a project idea and support in mind. ",
            "\u00a0If you're looking at this, you probably have to take the class to be a Global Health Scholar. It's a lot like the other global health classes I've taken - a professor who is an amazing and open person, but a class with little structure or material covered. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the course, but it is difficult to have a summer plan in September, and sometimes it feels like a waste to write a proposal for a project that you won't be doing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you want to get practice writing a research proposal, Leslie gives great feedback and is very helpful ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend the course to anyone interested in conducted a global or public health related research project over the summer. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students who are interested in carrying out global health research and are ready to be very engaged with the process of developing a proposal. "
