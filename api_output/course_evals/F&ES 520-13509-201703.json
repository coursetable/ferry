            "\u00a0I developed knowledge of some the foundational theories for studying society and environment, and skills for critically engaging with these theories and applying to my own work through short writing assignments and weekly discussion. The final research paper was especially valuable in putting the course content to work in developing research and writing skills around my own academic interests. ",

I gained the understanding that environmental problems are inherently social problems. We discussed the limitations of science as a discourse. We also learned about the biases in social science research and the difficulties involved in undertaking such research. "

Professor Dove provided not just a theoretical framework for this concepts but also examples of their application in order to gain more practical experience as well. ",

It was a great introduction to these concepts for people who have never had any experience with them. I cannot think of any real weaknesses regarding the course. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures for this course are finely tuned, interesting, and excellent resources for learning the course content. Readings are well selected and discussions are always engaging. The only thing I would change to improve the course is to include more peer to peer time for workshopping and discussing our final research papers. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Michael is an excellent lecturer. I looked forward to his lessons and to attending class each week. The final paper provided me the opportunities to develop my thesis and apply the concepts covered by the course. Wen (the course TF) was excellent. She was always available to answer questions and her insights added a lot to the class and to office hours. Karl Zimmerer was an excellent guest speaker. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The group discussions, which are led by students in the class, were frequently poorly led and not engaging. Frequently, the discussions felt like an opportunity for students to make statements about their own thoughts; disconnected from previous statements. I wished the discussions proceeded more like conversations. \r\nI would have liked more feedback on the three memos I submitted throughout the semester. ",

We read a lot of stuff by middle aged white guys.  \r\n\r\nReadings from guests lecturers were hit or miss.\r\n\r\nDiscussions sometimes seemed rambling, or unfocused\r\n\r\nStrengths\r\n\r\nRelaxed environment, open intellectual inquiry was encouraged\r\nGreat readings. good lectures. thoughtful selection of materials.

            "\u00a0This is one of the best classes I have ever taken, and has already been hugely influential in how I approach the rest of my studies and research at FES . If you are at all interested in the social sciences and critiquing conventional environmental discourses, do not miss out on it! ",
            "\u00a0This course is a big time commitment. Be prepared to do a lot of reading, and start working on your final paper early. Don't be turned off by Michael's approach of reading his lectures--he is really interesting, and not at all boring. Overall, I would definitely recommend this course. ",

From an outside perspective it's incredibly beneficial for the immersive quality of it, but can quickly leave one feeling submerged at points. ",
