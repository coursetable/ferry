            "\u00a0The readings for this seminar were fascinating. I find intellectual history meaningful in a way that most history seminars are not. There are serious questions here about what happens when two ideological systems--one (historically Christian) for governing the individual, the other for governing large groups of people--overlap or collide with each other, and what happens to political ideology--what meaning politics can have--when it is no longer assumed that human beings can be improved, or when we cannot come to a consensus on what that improvement might look like. ",
            "\u00a0This course offers a solid foundation in the history of political thought. I learned a tremendous amount from this course, but to distill it as best I can: it taught me to consider the histories we read in their context, and led me to treat histories of political thought as expressing political commitments/political theories themselves. It also served as an excellent overview of some of the best historians and theorists of the 20th century: meinecke, friedrich, shklar, pocock, and foucault. In effect, it felt like good training in how to think like an intellectual historian. ",
            "\u00a0This class allowed me to develop my ability to unpack the deeper arguments embedded in a history of political thought. It also taught me to appreciate complex historical analysis. "

            "\u00a0It was made clear from the outset that this would be a challenging course, and that thorough knowledge of the major works of political theory would be required. That was certainly the case. I spent a lot of time struggling to describe to other people exactly what it was that we were doing. The best I could do, which I think is reasonably accurate, is that we were seeing how writing about political theory--not just political theory, but the study of it--changed across time, usually in response to contemporary problems (how to construct a federal state, how to preserve the values of a state in the face of communism/terror, how to limit the powers of the state and its capacity for violence). Historians of political thought have emphasized various strands of that thought, and interpreted political thinkers differently, usually in the course of finding precedent for their own opinions, but also for the pleasure and interest of seeing how traditions of thought emerge and interact with each other. I think it would have been useful to have a bit more history--to see what was going on politically at the time Gierke, Meinecke, etc. were writing--though I suspect that this might have been in some of the secondary readings that I skipped. The most enjoyable part of the course for me was applying the themes we'd studied to my own research. I'd say that this seminar was a cross between a reading and a research seminar. That's a very useful format, and one that we ought to use more often, particularly since reading seminars are usually tailored to the professor's interests and involve writing a literature review, which can get a bit old; while research seminars, on the other hand, aren't much more than writing workshops, once everyone gets going on their individual research. Weekly reading responses were a good way to gather my thoughts before the class. ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus was excellent, and the sequence of thinkers it covered came together in a very helpful genealogy. The secondary materials that were included were excellent and did a lot to frame our class discussions. The only weakness of the course was the number of pages assigned each week. It often meant that there were many questions and texts we didn't have time to cover, and (in my case) it took time away from the term paper I was working on throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0The class covered a rich set of materials, but it was not always clear how all the materials related to each other. This is in part because of the heavy reading load. I think the course would be improved if Professor Nakhimovsky spent the first class outlining the readings we'll do each subsequent week and what we should be looking for in each assignment. "

            "\u00a0Yes, but only to one who is very interested in intellectual history and prepared to do a lot of high-level reading. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course was incredibly challenging but also incredibly rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0This course was possibly the best I've taken at Yale. The syllabus was incredible, and the discussions that professor Nakhimovsky led were very engaging. The group of students in this class was fantastic, and professor Nakhimovsky offered a lot of support and feedback on the term papers we wrote. The course provided an excellent grounding in intellectual history and the history of political thought not only in terms of the materials it covered but also in terms of the questions it taught me to ask of a text. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I absolutely would! Anyone interested in political theory should take this class, for it prepares you to engage with a substantial domain of recent work in political theory, especially from those who write on empire and state sovereignty. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Professor Nakhimovsky's syllabus was excellent, and the class discussions were unusually productive. A must-take for any student interested in German or European political thought. "
