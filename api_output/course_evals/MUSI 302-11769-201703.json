            "\u00a0A wonderful, engaging, and thoughtful professor makes this class fun and exciting. I was always glad to learn something new, even though at times it could be tough. I learned a lot about music and how notes relate to each other and themselves. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of practical skills in this class. Professor Harrison helped us develop a basic level of mastery in 1st through 4th species, and then we extensively covered sequences and the composition of inventions and fugues. I genuinely feel that I have a mastery of these basic concepts after taking the course, and would feel confident expanding upon this knowledge with more advanced study and applications. ",
            "\u00a0This course has helped me dramatically with my hearing. It invites you to hear music (all music, not just that of Bach) contrapuntally, and this has been extremely useful. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me how to navigate and appreciate the principles of tonal counterpoint. It was an exciting - \"puzzle-like\" - way of engaging with music, and makes listening to, and performing, baroque compositions more meaningful. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0We, as a class, were pretty unprepared for sequences, so we probably spent more time on them than Professor Harrison wanted, but we still ended up doing everything he wanted (I think). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n-Professor Harrison is a master teacher. He makes classes fun and engaging, and never intimidating, but always is challenging his students. You never felt scared to participate--you felt excited to do so. \r\n-you come out of the class with practical, essential, fundamental musical skills and knowledge\r\n-it's a fun class! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n-should be a two-semester course--so much to cover, so little time! ",
            "\u00a0Professor Harrison has clearly thought deeply and continually about the design of this course. He sets you up well to complete the assignments, although sometimes I felt as though we were expected to start working before we had covered some of the most helpful information/done practice analysis in class. I think if each of the assignments were pushed back by a class period, we'd be a little more prepared. He was always quite in touch with our concerns and responded with thoughtful supplementary materials and explanations to aid our understanding. The texts on counterpoint are somewhat arcane in their prose, and I found that additional online resources were often necessary to decode the core ideas, but with time and attention, the course materials would have been enough, I think. The design of the class is presented in a way that is deceptively simple, and you need to make sure you make enough time to really sit with the assignments. "

            "\u00a0I didn't think I wanted to take this class, but I would absolutely recommend it to any music student. I would, however, warn non-music students from taking it because there is a lot of expected knowledge before entering. ",
            "\u00a0If you aspire to compose, conduct, perform music influenced by or from the western canon in your life, I would definitely recommend taking this course. It covers a broad overview of basic contrapuntal skills, and will genuinely teach you to compose in a style that emulates that of Bach. You will learn 1st through 4th species counterpoint basics, and then, depending on how Professor Harrison is structuring that course, extensively cover some other interesting subjects (for us this year it was the study of sequences for many weeks, in other years I believe he mentioned spending more time on cadences), and learn to compose Bach-style inventions and fughettas. To top it all off, the class is fun. It's a good amount of work, but it's a refreshing change of pace from other classes. Here, you're delving into the rules and regulations of counterpoint in order to create beautiful compositions and, later, use counterpoint more freely in your own work or studies. I didn't expect to love this course or the study of counterpoint, but I came out wanting to study it more, and loving the course material. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. This is a great course to improve your hearing. Professor Harrison is fantastic and is a real personality to behold. ",
            "\u00a0MAKE time for this class in your schedule. It will be so much more worthwhile if you do. While one can push through the assignments and get a (half-)decent grade, this class requires a significant amount of time for pondering and puzzling in order to succeed and be intellectually - that's the nature of the material. It feels very mathematically-minded. The \"answers\", as it were, are not immediately apparent. "
