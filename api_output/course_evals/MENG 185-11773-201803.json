            "\u00a0I learned so much from this course, especially about the design process, but not simply the design process in theory, which is how other classes have been. I learned about how to design a project for a certain problem through identifying a problem, coming up with many possible solutions, and narrowing down and modifying those solutions. ",
            "\u00a0Impact analysis; how to create a bill of materials; design processes; how to utilize the machine shop ",
            "\u00a0How to go about bringing an abstract idea and concept into reality. ",
            "\u00a0Increased my ability to solve engineering problems in the real world. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the design process and the different steps to bring a final product to live ",
            "\u00a0An understanding of the design process, (different stages and ways to evaluate your progress and improve your design at each stage), general tool experience (machine shop, CEID), CAD experience (basic), knowledge about manufacturing, and simple engineering models. ",
            "\u00a0How to work in teams, intro to SolidWorks, intro to Statistics, and Intro to Statics. This was a very introductory course that gave you insight to many aspects of the Mechanical Engineering major. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a higher respect for teamwork and an understanding of how heavily team based engineering really is. Moreover, I learned how to present ideas as a team. ",
            "\u00a0Given that I had no experience with engineering before this class, it really helped me learn what to expect from engineering classes in the future.  I really enjoyed learning about the engineering process and working in the machine shop. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about how to work with a difficult group and manage a project team. "

            "\u00a0The grading system could be improved a little in the way that other members of your group did not have as big of an impact on your own personal grade. Also, having more time to learn solid works and how to machine would have been helpful. ",
            "\u00a0There's a lot to absorb and the class material has very little to do with the expectations and homeworks, only the exams. So spending more time discussing things relevant to the project we're working on would be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I think it would be more helpful if we had been challenged on our design more at every stage, driven to think creatively about how we could make it better with the time that we had. I would also have like to have had been forced to work more in the machine shop. I also would've liked more guidance about how to do thorough research. I did like how the course gave us a challenging product and it was kind of a \"figure it out\" kind of atmosphere; I feel more confident now about tackling things that I don't know how to do starting out. Also, great TAs and professor - a very welcoming vibe, while also feeling challenging. I liked how as we learned about different parts of the design process we were putting them into practice ourselves - felt like real learning. ",
            "\u00a0This is a class that requires you to work on the same team throughout the semester. If one person on your team does not contribute the way they are supposed to it affects all of our grades. I am not sure how we can address this because we are all supposed to be college students responsible for our own actions but, it is still frustrating when people in your team do not deliver. ",
            "\u00a0A straight would be the the helpfulness of the TA's and the benefit of having a small class; it felt really personal. The biggest weakness would be the gap between what we were learning in class and the lack of relevance to the labs and final project. learning about statistical calculations wasn't helpful in furthering our project. It was interesting ot learn and I believe very beneficial in the long run but it simply wasn't too relevant to the labs of the project. ",
            "\u00a0I really like how this class not only taught the design process but it also put it to work.  \r\n\r\nWhat I found difficult was staying in the same groups he entire semester. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I did not like this course. It was not well-organized, did not adequately teach the relevant information to the students, and made the semester unenjoyable by confining students to a team without letting them choose the team members. I found the CubeSat project to be boring and not an effective way to teach the mechanical process. Much of what we did for the deliverables was irrelevant when it came time for a final design. "

            "\u00a0Yes, I've learned the most about engineering in this class by far. ",
            "\u00a0MMMMmmmaybe. It's a lot of work, but it's also very cool work. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, great design course ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend this course - it was really fun and satisfying among all of the paper homework to be actually building something, and working with a team was really refreshing. It was also what I think I needed to get a little bump into the world of design, so that it feels like something I could actually do on my own time rather than some amorphous world that I had no experience with. I feel like I learned things I'll actually use :) ",
            "\u00a0YES! Kramer was an amazing professor. Her style of lecturing made class truly engaging and she was very open in her interactions with students. Class was honestly very fun and her teaching style is superb. We had weekly written deliverables that only helped us work closer to our final CubeSat so we would not be scrabbling last minute. I know that this was a problem with the Meng185 class last semester but we were given a lot of time and guidance to complete our projects which we then presented to NASA in a friendly competition at the end of the semester. Exams were straight from class and the slides she posted and before every midterm she would do a review session where the class did problems together. For every problem we got right she would give us a hint for what would be on the exam. Kramer was possibly one of the best professors I have had in the Mechanical Engineering department and reminded me why I decided to become an engineer. I wish we got to interact with her more in the lab but her TAs were amazing. Take Mechanical Design with Kramer if you get the chance. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, It was really fun and engaging. I would warn them about the large workload. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would.  But their enjoyment of the class would 100% hinge upon the group they were placed in. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to another student. It confined me to a team of people who were unable to work effectively as a group, and I even tried to meet with the professor to resolve the situation to no avail. The course was both unnecessarily challenging due to the large amounts of busy-work and because of incompetent team members. Unless you are certain you can have a good team, do not take this course.
