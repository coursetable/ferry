            "\u00a0In this class, I learned about the Arabic case system, gained the vocab to talk about politics/immigration, and developed my writing skills a bit. ",
            "\u00a0I got a more extensive approach to formal grammar than I had received in the past. ",
            "\u00a0I continued to work on my Arabic every day. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about Arabic grammar. ",

            "\u00a0I would like to see greater focus on speaking. Obviously its a grammar course but I worry that spending a whole semester focusing on where to put case endings and never speaking actually decreased my conversation skills. Also- I think a lot of the assignments were not well matched to the skill levels of those in the class. We were assigned very difficult listening and translation assignments that no one knew how to do so we would all take them to office hours were they would pretty much be completely done by the TA. and then Prof Aziz thought we knew enough Arabic to do the assignments and would make them harder. ",
            "\u00a0While this course does help you cement and develop your Arabic skills from L1-3, I felt it was much more disorganized than L1-3. Even though Prof. Aziz's syllabus outlines the work that's due every day, there was always confusion about what we would do in class. Every day, we did something totally different, and there wasn't a very big emphasis on speaking, so I felt that overall, my speaking skills suffered in this class. Furthermore, Prof. Aziz assigns every assignment of the online textbook, and this is super tedious. I would prefer if he would assign a few drills rather than everyone, since it doesn't feel edifying to do every drill. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are that Aziz is a very approachable professor. Weaknesses were the lack of structure for the class. I wish more of the homework was not on the website and that there was a clearer presentation of subjects for the class. ",
            "\u00a0This course is restricted in that it follows the Al Kitaab curriculum. However, the class itself is honestly just extremely painful sometimes. Ustadh Aziz is an amazing person but his explanations of grammatical concepts were extremely limited and I did not really feel that I learned anything besides what I taught myself. Homework assignments were very much rote and did not really allow me to actually practice the material. Instead of assigning the entire companion website, he should actually figure out what information we should really know and provide homework outside of Al-Kitaab. ",
            "\u00a0This course could add a bit more speaking practice, and go slower on the complex grammar topics. "

            "\u00a0Not really. I see it as a necessary evil if you want to learn Arabic. ",
            "\u00a0I like it, it depends who it's with. Check the syllabus to see what it's going to be like before you take it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to another student but would warn that a lot of the learning will fall on them. Aziz is a very knowledgable professor, but at times it was hard to make sense of grammar ideas and lessons at the level that he taught them. ",
            "\u00a0Aziz is a very sweet man but we didnt really learn much! His learning style is a lot more disorganized than Sarab ",
            "\u00a0Honestly, you have to take this class in order to continue with your Arabic at Yale but if you don't have to take it, I would honestly not. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend continuing Arabic, despite this course being very difficult. I think that the difficulty is not only because of the course and the professor, but because the grammatical concepts themselves are difficult. It is rewarding once you push through. ",
