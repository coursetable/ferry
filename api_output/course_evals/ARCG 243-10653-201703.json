            "\u00a0I learned how to critically analyze art and connect works to pieces within their own time period as well as throughout time. ",
            "\u00a0Learned to appreciate the influence of Greek art and architecture in LITERALLY EVERYTHING. Now that I know this material, I can't unsee the influences of Greek art all around me... ",
            "\u00a0This course was a fantastic introduction to ancient art. I came in knowing nothing about the period and by the end was very comfortable with the content. ",
            "\u00a0I knew nothing about HSAR coming into this course, and I absolutely loved it. I learned how to really analyze art beyond the \"wow this is so cool\" factor, and I learned how to write a HSAR paper. ",
            "\u00a0You learn the fundamentals of Greek art and architecture, and how it the rich visual tradition vastly transcends its ancient origins. ",
            "\u00a0HSAR 243 is the full run-down of Greek pottery, sculpture, painting, and architecture. I feel like I acquired enough knowledge to hold a conversation with anybody in the field, and I now know the classical underpinnings of Western art. Finally, my art historical writing has improved immensely thanks to the great feedback I received on the papers. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a thorough survey of Greek Art and Architecture, as the title suggests. The student is taught how to \"see\" Greek art from an academic perspective and to view these objects in the larger art historical narrative of the course. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a new knowledge in the area of Greek Art and Architecture. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about looking at ancient art and recognizing symbols and patterns. We looked at a wide array of media and time periods and I learned how ubiquitous ancient themes are in later art. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to analyze Greek structures and artworks as well as their cultural significance to issues contemporary to their time. ",
            "\u00a0Ive never taken an art history course before so I learnt a lot about sculpture, vase painting and architecture and to look at art in a different way. "

            "\u00a0Greek art is awesome and one strength is the review powerpoints posted. can't be improved-- loved it! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - loved the YUAG sessions, if anything wish we had more! Or wish we could explore the influences of Greek art / architecture on campus. ",
            "\u00a0This course is absolutely fantastic. Every aspect of it is maticulously planned and executed. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the lectures were fascinating- I never missed unless I absolutely had to. Can't think of any improvements! ",
            "\u00a0The readings are slightly unnecessary, as professor Gaifman will cover essentially everything in the lectures. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed coming to lecture every week and was glad that there was no section, considering Prof Gaifman asked questions in lecture. I loved that we looked at so many different views of each artwork; it felt as if I was actually seeing it in person.\r\n\r\nMy only issue with the course is the textbook. The Neer (especially the Neer) and Osborne readings were all solid, but I often felt as if I was just reading exactly what I would hear in lecture. It might be worthwhile to look into other readings that supplement the lectures, rather than repeat them. I would recommend a book (textbook or not) on the history of Ancient Greece -- as somebody without a background in classical studies, it would have been super helpful! ",
            "\u00a0The course is based on lecturers, along with unique opportunities to handle objects in the art gallery. the structure is coherent and well-organized. ",
            "\u00a0This course is great. The material is very interesting and each lecture has a new theme which builds off of the previous lecture. ",
            "\u00a0The course was well-taught and the expectations were clear. Sometimes the hour felt long or the lecture became repetitive, but it only helped to better my understanding of the material. There were not very many assignments and I would have liked to have a better idea of how I was doing throughout the course. ",
            "\u00a0This course was incredibly comprehensive and a strength of the course was certainly being able to go to the Yale University Art Gallery and doing some hands-on work. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely loved the class, so for me there werent any weaknesses at all. It was always super engaging and the slides were well presented. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing comprehensive account of Greek art and architecture that kept the students engaged throughout the semester. Strengths were amazing material, amazing professor and amazing TF. All around amazing. "

            "\u00a0Though I came into this class looking to just fulfill an \"ancient art\" course, I learned a lot more and had more fun with the subject material than I thought I would! What you learn in this class, you can really use and it will keep popping up in your life long after the semester ends. ",

Professor Gaifman brings so much love and enthusiasm to the course -- it was great to have a professor who was serious about scholarship and learning that also had a sense of humor. ",
