            "\u00a0I learned the basic concepts of music theory, while learning some interesting things about musicality. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to properly read and compose music from a Western perspective. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the fundamentals of music, especially about chords, basic chord progressions, and hearing intervals. I also learned a bit of piano skill and got to see how integral the piano is to studying music. ",
            "\u00a0Pretty much everything was new to me, and I feel I have a relatively good grasp of all of the material we covered ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read music, including pitch, tempo, roman numeral chords and figured bass, and cadences. I also learned how all these things work together in the context of real musical pieces. I also learned about composing music in traditional and non-traditional styles. I also learned a  little bit of piano, which was cool. Lastly, I also learned a bunch of cool facts about the history and different styles of music, which is very fun stuff. "

            "\u00a0The pacing was great for this class, and there really wasn't any weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0This course was certainly my most challenging due to how quick of a pace we moved at. Furthermore, there were many times where I found it difficult to keep up due to the pace. However, every lesson built on top of each other so I was always forced to revisit old material. This helped my process immennsly. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Homework was made mandatory in the second half of the semester; I would not have learned much if not for this; piano teaching was implemented halfway through the semester, which was cool (maybe start teaching about piano earlier on); the most basic elements of music (note names, what a time signature is, etc.) were covered but were covered very rapidly, to save time for more advanced things; lesson on jazz was really cool; compositions are great for learning.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Kind of easy; more emphasis on how to sight-read when singing would be great; needs more emphasis on the usage of solfege syllables when singing; needs more practice with hearing intervals; needs more exposure to non-classical music (pop music, salsa, reggae, etc.), even if such exposure is not part of the syllabus per se and is just anecdotal. ",
            "\u00a0It was incredibly helpful to have a piano in the room, as the professor could demonstrate the various concepts so that we could associate the sounds with the concepts. ",
            "\u00a0We started having specific exercises from the book assigned weekly after the midterm, which was very helpful. The compositions were also a really cool way of putting everything we had learned to use and made for extremely fun class meetings. I wish I had just a little more time to prepare for them though, we submitted at 11:59 on Sundays and performed them during the class meeting on the following Tuesday, which meant Monday nights were really the only chance I had to learn my classmates' pieces. Moving the deadline to Saturday at 11:59 would've been helpful for me at least. "

            "\u00a0Yes, if you are interested in music, I would recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0Sure! If you aren't that accustomed to music or, like me, are well-accustomed to music but don't know a lick of theory, this class gives a great foundation. The class was fun, well-taught, and informative, and it was a great break from my normally STEM-heavy schedules. Just make sure to do the music theory placement test first, to see if you should do this course or 218. ",
            "\u00a0I would, its a great foundation course for anyone interested in music (its also required for many music classes) and you learn a lot in a short space of time. ",
            "\u00a0If you have any interest in learning about music, I highly recommend this class, even if you have no prior experience in something music related! My advice would be to treat it like a foreign language, where you should be practicing ALL FOUR of the skills, reading (music) , writing (composing), listening (ear training!!!), and speaking (singing & piano playing), because every single one is important in general and to your success in the class. The great thing about music is that there are tons of free resources out there to help you get that practice. I would recommend downloading a metronome app, a piano keyboard app, and visiting musictheory.net often. My other piece of advice, especially for anyone who is new to music, is this: please don't be afraid to take some risks on your compositions; the grading on those isn't as hard as you might think, and you'll be rewarded with a good time if you submit something a little bit wacky.
