            "\u00a0Professor Siu is so knowledgeable and excited about the material. She breathes live into what we're learning and is able to answer lots of questions with exceptional depth. She also takes great care to make sure the theoretical continuities and analytic tools of the course come across, and that students learn how to use these tools in their learning. Occasionally discussions could have used a little more direction but overall it is an exceptional course. ",
            "\u00a0Not enough help on the final paper. ",
            "\u00a0It is difficult to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses because the course differed so much each week. This class could benefit from a different structure. I think I would have enjoyed it more had it been two lectures and one section a week. The topics were always interesting, and I felt I got so much more out of the readings if we discussed them in class, but some weeks we did and others we didn't. The readings were so great, but I never felt like we fully discussed them, especially in relation to each other. I think there should have also been more discussion of the relationships of different topics to each other and to the course as a whole. Having discussions in this class was overall difficult, and the class could have helped develop student ideas much better. I also think the assignments could be spaced out better. "

            "\u00a0Professor Siu is fantastic: so smart and excited. Take this course for a fresh perspective on globalization, and for the way she is able to breathe life into the material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes this is an entertaining course. Siu makes it more fun than it otherwise would be. ",
            "\u00a0It is difficult to say. Sometimes I really enjoyed the class and sometimes I was really frustrated with it. I would not recommend it in the seminar form. If it becomes a lecture, I would definitely recommend because the topics are very engaging. It is also a bit deceiving because there is very little work in the first half of the semester, and a lot during the second half so you just have to be aware and manage your time well. "
