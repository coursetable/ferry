            "\u00a0did not like this course. lecture was not helpful, and the material was not taught in an interesting way. The topic is amazing, but the way the material was delivered made going to class a burden. ",
            "\u00a0I learned pretty much every important thing in statistics, which was very helpful since I did not take AP Stats in high school. This course exposed me to a variety of statistical techniques used in analyzing data and the principles underlying statistics. When the courses branched into the different specialties, I learned a lot about the different ways in which medical studies are conducted, like randomized clinical trials and implementation science. This course gave me a great amount of knowledge about medical statistical analyses, which will be helpful when reading medical papers because I'll have the statistical insight into their conclusions and how they came to those conclusions. ",
            "\u00a0During the first half of the semester (10X taught by JRS), I learned a good amount of basic statistics. Material was taught clearly and he would often go over material if he saw that the class was confused. Psets were challenging but fair, and TFs' office hours were VERY helpful. Often improved my grade by 10/15 points after going to office hours, which is pretty great considering that at office hours they didn't give a single answer outright, only explanations. Pretty great TFs overall, and a very good intro to stats class.\r\n\r\nS&DS 105 is a different beast entirely; Russel-Barbour clearly has zero interest in teaching a class entirely on randomized clinical trials, and you can safely sleep through/skip every lecture without missing out on much. I say \"safely\" because even if you go to every lecture and take notes religiously, you will be able to answer approximately the same number of questions on the pset as someone who didn't come to any lectures or played Blossom Blast through the entire lecture while noshing on some pretzels (guilty). According to the TFs, RB has gotten much better about not expecting intro stats students to know advanced statistics, but there were a number of times where TFs would just have to give answers to the pset (and ***the final***) because there was no way we could have known them, given what was taught in class.\r\nThankfully, extra credit was simple enough - read some RCT paper and fumble through a 5 minute \"discussion\" in front of the class and you'll get 5/10 points (the psets are 25 pts). \r\nIn summary, dumpster fire. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths were the online lectures. There was less pressure and i actually felt as if i learned more through the podcast-like structure as well as the take home midterms and such. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the medical stats half of the course could have been presented in a more interesting way. The professor clearly has a lot of knowledge and has a personality but at times I got really bored because he just read from the lecture slides ",
            "\u00a0The course is very well-taught for how large of a lecture it is, there is much support for learning and all the teaching fellows and JDRS himself are very accessible. ",
            "\u00a0The first part of the course was very well organized and taught in a way that made statistics almost exciting. JDRS has a great energy, and he explains things very well. The second half of the course was not as well organized, and it was difficult to tell what the goal of the course was. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing teaching fellows. Lecture can be dry and the PSETS are impossible. ",
            "\u00a0The course is great for the first half before you split into sections. The medicine section was superbly boring. Professor Barbour just read straight off the slides and it was hard not to fall asleep in the classes. He would go on tangents not related to the material very often. I learned more at office hours than I ever did in class. ",
            "\u00a0The first part of the course was so well organized. The psets were a good length and helped facilitate learning. The second part of the course was very unorganized. A clear syllabus with pset due dates needs to be laid out and expectations need to be made a little clearer. Consistently posted powerpoints and objectives would also help. ",
            "\u00a0JDRS did a good job in teaching the basic principles and information for statistics, and I learned a lot from his portion of the course. He was very engaging in every lecture and was able to explain the concepts, regardless of their level of difficulty, with ease in a way that I, as someone with no stats background, could understand pretty well. When the classes branched out into their specific areas, I was so bored that I just couldn't pay attention in class without dozing off, so I ended up learning the material on my own time when I would go through the slides and work with other people in the class on the assignments. However, the material wasn't too challenging to learn on my own time. The grading in 105 was incredibly strange and strict; the questions never really specified what the graders were looking for in our answers since they were always very vague and broad, but I got a lot of points taken off by not saying some of the niche and specific things that they wanted. I think that they should be clearer in terms of grading guidelines and what they are looking for in our answers. 105 also felt very disorganized in every class, and the material kind of jumped around and sometimes did not flow very well, which definitely contributed to my struggles to pay attention and learn in class. ",
            "\u00a0The second half of the class was quite boring. However, the extra credit assignments helps to boost your grade. Also, you get lots of TA help which makes the class pretty manageable. ",
            "\u00a0JDRS is a great lecturer who makes even the most boring statistics interesting. However, his slides can be confusing at times due to their order and progression. Otherwise, the course was great with the exams and problem sets being very fair and straightforward, although you will likely have to go to a few office hours for help.\r\n\r\nThe second half of the class was the weakness. Professor Barbour's slides are not engaging in any way and his method of reading the bullet paragraphs on the slides is less than conducive for learning or even realizing what is important for the class. It was helpful to read real articles from medical journals, although it would have been impossible to realize what was important or strange about them without help from Sappho. ",
            "\u00a0I feel I have a better understanding of stats, but psets can take a while sometimes because figuring out how to use the software can be difficult at times. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are that all topics covered in class were engaging and interesting. The application of what we learned was explained immediately after a new concept arose making learning easier. One improvement would be a sort of pre assignment to make a glossary of medical jargon that is unfamiliar to most students in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: JRS is hilarious, online videos are nice if you can't make it to class, and a lot of weighting is on the homework, so you can do well if you try hard.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Kinda boring, many people don't come/aren't engaged because it's recorded, grading of homework was slow. ",
            "\u00a0lecture on videos were amazing! ",
            "\u00a0Its great how many office hours are available, it makes it easy to get help if you need it. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The first half taught by JDRS (he's awesome) and the staff of TAs that took office hours. The midterms and problem sets were also very fair and you had ample opportunity to do well in the class. A lot of opportunities of extra credit across both halves of the course was nice too. One of the midterms and the final exam was take home - this was awesome. The gaping hole of freedom in my schedule where the first half of the course was as soon as the second part (med stats) made my extremely difficult and intense Junior Fall much easier.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The entire med stats part - it's amazing for your schedule but I didn't feel challenged by the course at all. Prof Barbour is a really nice man and cared about the class, but he doesn't lead a very interesting section at all. All material and information needed for the Med Stats psets and the final were available on Canvas, so I eventually gave up going to lecture. ",

Overall, it's a good class and its worth knowing some stats. ",

It's easy to do well if you put any kind of effort into the first half of the course (GO TO OFFICE HOURS - this is key to getting 100 on almost all psets) and just look at the lecture notes of the med stats part (you don't even have to go to lecture!).
