            "\u00a0We talk a lot about immunology and then apply what we learn about the immune system to biomaterials and other innovations that exist and think about what could be changed to improve treatment for autoimmune diseases, cancer, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Learned more about immune function and related pharmaceuticals and medical device research being done to modulate immune function ",
            "\u00a0The majority of the content from this class was about general immunology with some biomaterials and applications packed in at the very end. The general immunology information stuck pretty well and the project was exciting and worked to synthesize the information that we'd learned. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about the basics of immunology and hoot engineer devices that can help support or suppress the immune system as needed. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting coverage of very relevant materials. I gained a much better understanding the the immune system and current approaches to engineering the system to treat disease. ",

            "\u00a0The material is cutting edge and very interesting but it wasn't presented well (lots of redundancy or missing information). ",
            "\u00a0The course was pretty disorganized, as Professor Fahmy was frequently late to class, so we fell behind in lectures. ",
            "\u00a0Strength\r\nInteresting material\r\n\r\nWeakness\r\nOrganization and timing ",
            "\u00a0This class is helplessly disorganized. We didn't really get through all the content that we had hoped to at the beginning of the year and so the pre-made psets and exams didn't always match up with what we had learned already. The weaknesses were primarily due to Prof. Fahmy's busy schedule, but a great strength of the TA, Sean, who really pulled through to communicate with us and teach us in review sessions. ",
            "\u00a0The material taught was very interesting. A potential way to improve the course would be to better organize the lecture slides and post them regularly on canvas. The way the material was presented was straight forward. We went over the experiments and papers for recent innovations in the field, which was very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0The class was extremely unorganized which made learning challenging. the professor was often late or did not show up to class (the tf was incredible and always was there but was not prepared for the absences). The topics were also covered in a sporadic manner.\r\n\r\nAssignments were confusing and poorly written. Oftentimes there were large knowledge gaps. \r\n\r\nThe professor and tf were extremely knowledgable about the topics and wanted students to be engaged and interested. They were always kind and willing to help the students understand a topic or change assignments. ",
            "\u00a0This course had incredible potential to be a unique class that combines biophysical principles with engineering applications in a rapidly growing field. Instead, the entire course was poorly organized with very little regard for planning out clear lectures that connected with one another. The syllabus was rarely followed, and most of my learning was done independently. Our TA (Sean) was absolutely fantastic in assisting students with questions, and he ended up teaching more than the majority of the lectures. This course desperately needs structure that would allow students to build upon concepts throughout the semester, like a textbook and a syllabus that is adhered to. I always find problem sets to be an effective way of synthesizing concepts from the course, and it was clear that the problem sets for this class were hastily written. The majority of the questions involved copying down facts from textbooks and online articles rather than critical thinking. \r\nAnother way to improve the course is to spend less time giving an introduction of immunological principles. We didn't need most of the information we were taught on immune cells and other concepts that typically require rote memorization. If the full lecture times are used, this part of the class could take only 1-2 weeks. The rest of the course could focus on the biophysics (the math behind how the immune system works) and the engineering, which is the reason most students take the course. Having discussions over recent literature by breaking the class into smaller groups once in a while would be a great way to engage students. "

            "\u00a0Conditionally, this course presents access to an excellent and comprehensive textbook and literature, as well as a good opportunity for project proposal. That being said, its very disorganized and will require learning most of the material outside of class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes for the learning material. No for the struggles involved to make it through the class ",
            "\u00a0The information learned in this class is interesting--the idea of hijacking the immune system is hot in the real world. Sean is an incredible TA. But, Prof. Fahmy's perpetual tardiness, disorganization, and general disregard for his students' (and TA's) time may be a big enough drawback to turn you off. By late every class, I mean minimum late 15 minutes, sometimes not coming to class at all. It was often infuriating, but Sean does a good job of teaching the material that is missed, although that should not be his responsibility as a TA. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very interesting. If you're into the immune system and want to learn about vaccines, tolerance, and the autoimmune disorders. The TA is also amazing! However, this semester the professor was sometimes tardy to class. When he did show up, he was very knowledgeable on the material he was going over. the discussion sets were not too difficult and theres a presentation at the end of the semester over a device that you propose. ",
            "\u00a0It was interesting material and kind professor but the poor organization was a substantial challenge. I would not recommend it for anyone that would be frustrated in such an environment. "
