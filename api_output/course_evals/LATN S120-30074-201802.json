            "\u00a0Over the course of five weeks I was able to grasp a better command of reading Latin; both poetry and prose. In addition, this course provided me with a review of Latin grammar concepts. ",
            "\u00a0This felt like the first time I read \"real\" Latin, which made all the grammar from the previous semester feel much more meaningful! I also found that focusing on the text, and getting a glimpse of these principles in the context in which they were written, helped me learn them much faster and remember them more quickly. "
