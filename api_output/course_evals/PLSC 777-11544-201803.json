            "\u00a0I thought the homework workload was fair. Kate chose interesting books and was very good at leading interesting class discussions. However, I think we could have read and discussed two books per week. The discussions were in depth to the point of being exhaustive, and I would have liked the opportunity to make more of a dent in the required reading list for the comp exam. That being said, Kate led a great class. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, it was an interesting course and Kate is a great instructor. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. The material is really interesting and the class sessions very participatory with a great lecturer. This course helps students to think about their current or future research interests and provides the instruction to help clarify and disentangle the questions and work needed at the pre-research phase.
