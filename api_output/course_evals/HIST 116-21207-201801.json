            "\u00a0This history course caused me to think about history in a much different light than I had previously. The ability to evaluate a historical event from the vantage point of the people living in the time period, as much as one can, is the most significant skill I have learned from this course. Being able to hold two (or more) different views of what occurred historically and critically evaluate them is another aspect of this course that I feel will stay with me. The ability to combine different historical interpretations of events and realize one may still not have all the answers or a definitive interpretation is really instilled in students. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the American Revolution through perspectives that I had never been exposed to before. Viewing this event through the eyes of not only white colonists, but also women, children, African Americans, Native Americans, and many other minorities was incredibly interesting. ",
            "\u00a0After spending a significant amount of time in high school studying colonial american and the Constitution; this class offered new insight and nuance to the events I thought I knew so well. It also offered a more holistic perspective of the revolutionary period. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my critical reading skills. I also improved my essay writing, particularly my argumentation and word precision. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a nice overview of colonial America, the American Revolution, and the very early Republic. Nothing I learned was particularly earth-shattering or fundamentally changed the way I viewed the American Revolution, though this class was thought-provoking and very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about American government and critically evaluating historical narratives. ",
            "\u00a0While I learned a lot of factual (and anecdotal!) information about the American Revolution, I think that above all I learned how to approach studying history in terms of reading primary sources and scholarly works, and writing about them as well. I learned to be critical about terms such as \"The Founders\" or even \"liberty\" and \"democracy,\" and to investigate what these terms mean and how they originated. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much in this course. Not only did I learn about the events of the American Revolution, but also I learned about the mindsets of the people who lived through it. I learned how to study history and enjoy the process. ",

I learned how the revolution developed over time as a social and political change. I also learned how it affected different groups of people, such as women and African Americans. ",
            "\u00a0Completely altered my perspective on the story of our nation's founding--which is often glorified in high school education. Loved gaining insight into different social, racial, etc., groups and realizing how their experiences were (or were not) changed by the Revolution. Also nice to learn more about the British perspective. ",

We learned about the time period through a more nuanced and thorough lens than we did in high school, which drew in more complications as to the characters and motivations involved, and less of a fuzzy glow around the whole thing overall.

            "\u00a0This class is an excellent and relatively comprehensive overview of the Era of the American Revolution. It is an excellent way to get a better understanding of both sides of a conflict, as Prof. Freeman is careful to provide both sides' reasoning and story. ",

            "\u00a0This class is a great introductory-level history lecture. I learned to process large amounts of written information (the reading is on the heavy side) and hold an academic discussion about history while still feeling like the class was accessible to those without prior history or humanities backgrounds.

            "\u00a0I think this course not only taught me about an incredibly impactful moment in American history, including how decisions made in the 1700's still influence our modern world, but also gave me a better understanding of history as a field. ",
            "\u00a0This course was helpful to learn about the American Revolution and how to approach history in general. I learned a lot about how historians approach historiography, which was really helpful. I learned about the specific events that happened during the American Revolution, but, more importantly, I gained valuable insight about the mindsets of revolutionaries, founders, and other Americans at the time, and how revolutionary the American Revolution really was. This class debunks a lot of common myths or misunderstandings that we have about the revolution, and focuses on groups that you won't learn about in your average U.S. History class, such as low-income Americans, women, African Americans, and Native Americans. I learned so much from this course and highly recommend it! It doesn't only help you learn more about pre-industrial history, but helps you develop many valuable insights. "

            "\u00a0The strengths of this course included the excellent (and thorough, yet manageable) reading list, the passion of the TF's, and Professor Freeman's vast knowledge and unique insights pertaining to the subject matter. I do think that the paper assignments for the course were pretty vague in terms of expectations and how they would be graded. ",

            "\u00a0The course has a lot of different readings from author's of different perspectives, which provides students with a more consummate understanding of the American revolution. That said, I found most of the readings quite boring and difficult to get through. Also, I feel like the class did not properly address the narrative of African slaves and Native Americans during the American Revolution. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: excellent lecturer (Professor Freeman), she's highly entertaining. This class largely focused on political developments rather than social or people's history, which I thoroughly enjoyed and appreciated. Weaknesses: lots of reading, can be very tedious and boring, and rather useless, so just skim it! ",
            "\u00a0This course benefits from a great professor and interesting lectures. The readings supplement the lectures well. The essays and exams are manageable and test your knowledge of themes and your ability to create an argument. ",
            "\u00a0One of the many strengths of this course was Professor Freeman's engaging lecturing skills. She was dynamic and enthusiastic, and in turn she made me excited about the material we discussed. I think one of the weaknesses is actually the fact that we don't discuss the readings in lecture. I understand that we have section in order to discuss the reading, but I think it would have really benefitted me to have seen how these authors and their conflicting theories about the Revolution were in dialogue with each other and how they related to the themes of our class. I would have loved to have heard Professor Freeman's insights on the reading and hear more about why she assigned us the readings she did. ",
            "\u00a0This course is fantastic. You must take it before you graduate. I am a STEM person and I took this my senior spring. It might have been my favorite course at Yale. ",

            "\u00a0The course is excellent. Professor Freeman has done a great deal of research and she constantly pulls from her findings to read journal entries from the people of the time to further what we learn in class. The course asks lots of good questions to think about, like how radical was the revolution? It dives deeper into this time period than other courses such as high school courses generally do. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Freeman is amazing, and she gives great, engaging lectures. I think the one complaint I have is that the course didn't always have a linear flow, and we would jump around in time occasionally (i.e. with Common Sense) which made things confusing. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were the amazing lectures, but I wish the notes would have been projected via PowerPoint. ",
            "\u00a0There are great lectures, although I think the assignments can be improved. I would argue that the essays were a little too high-school... writing a letter from the point of view of a colonist seems as though it does not match the high level of the rest of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Freeman is an amazing lecture! ",
            "\u00a0The lectures and section were both very strong. There was too much reading. I would understand if some reading was suggested and some was required, but it would be better if it was clear which portions of the reading were important so we could prioritize those, as it became clear in section and on the exams that some of the reading was simply superfluous. ",

            "\u00a0Really interesting lectures and low workload. The tests had really really obsure details that came up in one line in a reading maybe 5 weeks ago. Other than that though, solid class. ",
            "\u00a0I found the lectures to be superfluous to the class - the way they were structured was so anecdotal as to be almost not informative, and at times unengaging. Most of what I learned came from the readings and from section. ",
            "\u00a0I think this class is perfect ",
            "\u00a0This class was excellent! Prof Freeman is an excellent lecturer, and I think this class is great because it follows the entirety of the Revolution-- frombefore the 1760s to after the 1780s. I think the only way it could significantly be improved is by focusing a bit more on the actual War, which seemed to be completely sidelined. ",
            "\u00a0I think that this course is well structured, readings don't feel wasteful, and the TA'S were awesome. The only thing I wish was different is that for the second essay I felt much more prepared to write it after lectures on the subject and I think that'd be helpful. ",

The TFs are helpful and, although they can demanding depending on which one you get, are across the board fair with clear expectations. The one thing that I did struggle with somewhat was a disconnect between lecture and reading. Both are fantastic, but they seemed to be only loosely thematically or temporally connected. ",

My one complaint with the course  and not even a very big one  was the choice of prompts for our long essay: they were diffuse and completely uninspiring, especially in contrast to some of the fascinating questions that were raised elsewhere. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures are phenomenal, super engaging and entertaining in all aspects. Sections were a bit varied in their difficulty but generally were good forums in which to discuss and debate the material presented in class. I found the readings to be quite dull at times and not super necessary in understanding the class. The midterm was unnecessary tricky with a random identification topic that most scholars would have known and was very very briefly mentioned in the readings. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: incredible lectures, great readings\r\nWeakness: huge discussion sections ",
            "\u00a0I think the lectures for this course are OUTSTANDING. However, the readings are soooo long and dull at times. I really felt that the readings should have been cut in half. Even beyond the fact that reading so much is dull, there was no way to cover so much material in our weekly sections. I think the reading should have been reduced so we could more thoroughly engage with a smaller amount of sources rather than hastily cover such a breadth of material. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Freeman is a very captivating lecturer, and I thought her lectures were perfect in terms of having the right amount of content and introducing us to new ideas. I think the course is very well thought-out and set up well. "

            "\u00a0I would NOT recommend this class, but I'll admit I am in the minority. I will say that Professor Freeman is brilliant, charismatic, and kind. She is a great lecturer and she is so passionate and knowledgeable. Also, my TF Katie McCrudden was incredible as well. The issue for me was the content of the course. I guess I find American history kind of boring and uninspiring. There is so much reading and I found 95% of it very boring and difficult to get through. Also, I feel like the class did not properly address the narratives of African slaves and Native Americans. Lastly, I found the essay prompts kind of annoying and difficult to answer. The first one is a creative essay that tells students to pretend to be colonists and write letters to the mothercountry. Personally, I found the assignment boring and unexciting. Then, for the major essay, which was one of the most difficult and annoying essays I have ever had to write, we had to write a 7-9 page paper about the lessons the colonists learned during the revolution. I feel like the essay prompts could have been a little bit more pointed and a little bit more specific. ",

Don't take this class if you're looking for an earth-shattering reevaluation of the American Revolution, but take this class if you want a better understanding of the formative events of our country. This class centers around political events and developments, not social history, which was exactly what I wanted. ",

That being said, I was not convinced that the American Revolution actually deserved a full semester-long course, especially when that course did not include much discussion of non-white and non-male experiences.

There's only passing mentions of how the Revolution affected women, Black Americans, and Native Americans, and one lecture devoted to that topic with a few readings. It's not necessarily the professor's fault entirely--possibly a flaw by design because of the subject matter--but I found it pretty boring because I'm not interested in any of these white settler colonists.

For anyone who grew up in the US, or is just spending 4 years here at Yale and wants to know more about the history this is a must-take! Even if you took APUSH in high school, this will provide such a fresh perspective on iconic American Revolution moments. ",

            "\u00a0Take this class even if you're only mildly interested in the American Revolution. Going to lecture was easy because Professor Freeman's lectures were so interesting. You will definitely develop new insights about the Revolutionary War period and America in general. Highly recommend this course to a history major (which I'm not) or anyone interested in the topic!!
