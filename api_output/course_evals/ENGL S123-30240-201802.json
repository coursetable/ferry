            "\u00a0This course was a great way to look back at some of the fundamentals of creative writing that one forgets when working extensively on a long project such as a novel. While the fiction unit was primarily no \"new' knowledge for me, the poetry and drama units were particularly useful in reminding me of the various forms of creative writing that I don't daily engage with. ",
            "\u00a0good course ",
            "\u00a0I learnt how to pare down dialogue, edit my own work, and listen for the rhythm of sentences. ",
            "\u00a0By taking the Introduction to Creative Writing this summer, I have learned how to use my writing voice effectively to convey my imagination through creative writing. By learning extensively about three areas of creative writing-fiction, poetry, and drama-I learned a lot about each of the fields. In fiction, I learned more about how plot and characters really affect how readers perceive things in a piece of writing, and learned how to write effective dialogues that capture readers' attention and propel the story forward. In poetry, I learned about rhythms and rhymes in poems, and learned to write well by limiting myself in certain areas of poetry, as poetry tends to be extremely freeing when we first start to write it. In drama, I learned a lot about stage directions, dialogues, and emphasizing two characters' conflict to carry out the play. I also learned a lot from the guest writers who came to speak or spoke to us over the Skype call-it was a very enlightening experience. ",
            "\u00a0The procedures, skills and things to pay attention to when writing fictions, poetry and drama. ",
            "\u00a0This course enables me to grow as a writer significantly. I have gained quite a lot of practical knowledges about fiction, poetry, and drama. The course is taught from a writers perspective, which I find novel but useful. "

            "\u00a0I think it would be helpful to have each student get workshopped twice in this course. I know that is not exactly possible during the summer session, and perhaps it happens during the full term session, but if not, this is something I would recommend. ",
            "\u00a0i mean too much work, too fast for summer ",
            "\u00a0I loved the way in which Prof Spargo brought in the lecturers from the different genres! I also loved the texts that we were selected for us to read-I believe they showcased a variety of styles! \r\n\r\nThe only weakness would be the compressed time-I wish I could have taken this class when it was stretched over a 13 week period instead of a 5week period. But Pro Spargo still managed to help us get the most of the shortened session. ",
            "\u00a0Its overall greatly inspiring and beneficial with proper readings and practices. In the meantime, Id look forward to more frameworks. ",
            "\u00a0I cannot think of any weaknesses of this course. The strength like I mentioned, is that it did help me grow as a writer significantly. "

            "\u00a0Yes, particularly a student who is trying to discover what genre of creative writing they would like to work more in. ",
            "\u00a0yes credit d tho bc no graded feedback ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course, and specifically with Professor Spargo. However, students should be aware that the experience may be different and more rushed over the summer-for instance, I wish we had more time for the drama and poetry units. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course for anyone who is interested in creative writing, and want to study it more extensively. I myself started doing creative writing as a hobby about two years ago, and it grew to be one of my strongest passions now. So, if any student wishes to learn more about developing compelling plots, characters, and improving their writing skills, this is the course to take. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely, but should be to the ones with fair literature background and finds writing really enjoyable, for creative writing is a course that really requires some sort of gift and inspiration. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Anyone loving to seek guidance on the types of creative writing hardly taught in school will be satisfied of this course. "
