            "\u00a0Great course overall. Would recommend less emphasis on the textbook for daily instruction and a slight variance in the homework assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Daily homework, numbers practice\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Practice speaking\r\n\r\nI feel as though I've improved in writing, reading, and listening, but I don't think I've improved my speaking very much. Speaking is the most difficult part of learning a language for me, so I think it would benefit me to have more opportunities (both formal and informal) to speak for extended periods. "

            "\u00a0Yes! \r\n\r\nI really enjoy the language and Professor Dolgova and Ms. Nordgaard are both great instructors. They are both very willing to help outside of class and they put a lot of effort into ensuring that we get useful feedback. The workload is definitely manageable. "
