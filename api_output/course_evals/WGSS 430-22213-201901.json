            "\u00a0I learned how to do discourse analysis, how to think in paradigms beyond religion to think about gender in the middle east, i learned to think about cultural relativism/pluralism/imperialism and how they interlock. I read Foucault! and Said! ",
            "\u00a0I came into this course with a strong background in gender studies but very little knowledge of the middle east, and I feel like I'm walking out with a much better understanding of how the two topics intersect. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think analytically about questions of citizenship, and its intersection with gender, religion. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt a lot of different critical frameworks with which to understand the world. I learnt how to read Foucault a bit better ",
            "\u00a0I developed a deeper understanding and knowledge of gender and citizenship within the Middle East and North Africa. I learned how to critically engage with texts related to ethnographic research as well as gender theory. Altogether, I gained a high level of insight into not only the topic, but also the development of a variety of critical reading and learning skills. ",
            "\u00a0I greatly improved my reading, writing, and research skills in this course. I learned about colonial/Western influences on citizenship, and the impact orientalist attitudes and institutions have had on the Middle East. I have also gained greater insight into historical analysis, and how to research and study gender in the Middle East/North Africa region. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt different frameworks to analyse gender and citizenship issues in the Middle East. ",
            "\u00a0I took this class to gain a deeper understanding of the region as a whole, as I was taking another course that dealt with issues in the middle east. My expectations were more than met with this course. Not only did I gain a deeper understanding of gender, sexuality, belonging and citizenship issues as they relate to the middle east, but I was introduced to what I think are essential points of view when it comes to issues to gender, equality and power, such as Foucault and Edward Said's Orientalism. The variety of perspectives we were exposed to this semester also allowed me to develop a critical eye when it comes to examining discourse and allowed me to look at various issues not as matters of right vs. wrong, but as different narratives which are at tension with each other, and therefore need to be understood based on the elements and powers at play. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to properly and critically read and think. I learned to relate history and philosophy to modern-day issues. I also learned how to write an analysis for readings which I have not done for other courses. ",
            "\u00a0Analyzing popular news articles through the lens of political theory and anthropology theory. Using Foucault, Said as foundational texts to understand ethnographic material/case studies from across MENA region. Critical thinking, essay writing. Group discussions. "

        [
            "\u00a0I would rather have one more writing assignment and have the final be worth slightly less. I wanted more practice engaging the readings through writing. Also I would use Foucault differently on the syllabus, and think about including an interlocutor for us to talk back to Foucault. ",
            "\u00a0Reading the entirety of Foucault was the absolute most beneficial thing about this class. I could not stress enough how important it is. Also, Professor Pepi's constant encouragement and care for all of us was incredible, making everyone feel comfortable talking and sharing and thinking. I think conversely, maybe reading more of Said would've helped as well. I think another weakness is that, although it is clearly an advanced course, it often felt like a lot of information was being discussed and not everyone was on the same oage. ",
            "\u00a0The course was well-structured and well taught. There was a clear trajectory and a lot of different case studies ",
            "\u00a0This course was a seminar, and overall I felt that class discussions were very strong and engaging. However, we sometimes broke into small groups to discuss the readings, and the purpose of group work was not always clear. While it was helpful to discuss the readings with a few other classmates before starting a larger group conversation, I think having discussion questions or other forms of guidance would have made the group work more effective. ",
            "\u00a0This class was not what I expected, but it was excellent. I had never studied frameworks with which to analyse relationships of power and domination; I look at world events and issues from a different perspective now. I really liked the structure of this course and enjoyed reading  Foucault's lectures every week. I think that the Said can be more spaced out. I would have loved to discuss biopolitics in more detail. ",
            "\u00a0The size of the class could be a little bit smaller I think, and I think having discussions as to how the readings might relate to modern issues would be incredibly interesting. I really enjoyed the meetings where Prof. Pepi would give us a summary of the Foucault readings and we broke those concepts down together, as someone who struggled with foucault at first, I would have really liked to have that every week. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n-Excellent readings and balance of theorists, articles, topics\r\n-Loved the format of the check-ins and group discussions\r\n-Assignments helped in developing ideas for final paper "

            "\u00a0yes, if you are willing to do a significant amount of reading and have your assumptions challenged by Professor Pepi ",
            "\u00a0This was an excellent class for anyone who wants a better understanding of contemporary issues in race and gender politics in MENA. It is especially worthwhile if you are looking for a course that establishes a strong social theory foundation but still talks concretely about real-world applications of that theory. ",
            "\u00a0Anyone who is thinking about citizenship, nationhood, power, domination, etc, in the Middle East should take this course. Anyone in Global Affairs or Political Science should take this course. It is essential to understand the mechanisms of power and Orientalism that revolves so much state discourse in the present time. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Professor Pepi is super smart and really good at explaining difficult topics. She is really patient and I never felt like I couldn't ask a question. Reading all through Said's Orientalism and Foucault's Society must be defended was a really awesome experience, and something I think every college student should do at some point. The class covered a lot of ground and by the end, I felt familiar with the gender, sexuality and race politics of various Middle Eastern countries ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to other students. It was an exceptional seminar filled with learning and self-growth. Not only will you learn an extraordinary amount about the topic, but also about how our own understandings of gender, citizenship, and the MENA region have been built upon particular (and narrow) understandings of the world. This course completely changed my point of view. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course, regardless of a student's major/area of interest. I gained valuable insights into Western colonialism and its impacts on the Middle East, and I think this perspective can be applied to a wide variety of academic fields. This course taught me to assess Western or Euro-centric viewpoints in academia, and even though the course content was specific to the Middle East, the skills it develops are significant to a myriad of disciplines. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course, even if you are not interested in the Middle East. It has really changed the way I think about different world issues. ",
            "\u00a0This was my favorite course this semester. It was intellectually engaging, fun, incredibly relevant to issues we are facing today, and Prof. Pepi was an incredible instructor. I could not recommend this course enough. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This was the best course I took at Yale! I learned so much from the professor and class discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! "
