            "\u00a0I gained a fundamental understanding of basic concepts in music theory. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to distinguish musical intervals aurally, learning about composing music and learned more about analyzing music. ",
            "\u00a0You gain a strong background in the fundamentals of music theory at an approachable pace for complete beginners or those with prior music experience. From notes to scales, intervals, and rhythm, then to triads, dominant sevenths, and eventually cadence and tonal harmony, you can develop a proficiency with the basic principles that structure Western music. ",
            "\u00a0Lots of knowledge about the basics of music! I didn't like all of it because there are so many rules, but I definitely learned all of the rules! ",
            "\u00a0The course starts with learning how to read music (pitch and rhythm) to finally learning about musical cadence. You mostly learn about triads, inversions, and dominant seventh chords. But beyond all that, I think the course's real knowledge comes from seeing the inner workings of music and being able to listen to music that you like outside of the course and be able to pick up on the patterns we go over in the course. There's also music composition assignments that are actually really engaging and fun to do. ",
            "\u00a0I learned all the music theory basics--notes, keys, triads, chord symbols--plus developed my ear doing note and chord identification. ",
            "\u00a0Literally everything about music theory you need to know to begin the major. This class was amazing. "

        [
            "\u00a0The course is well taught, though the placement exams administered at the beginning of the semester may have placed me a bit too high. ",
            "\u00a0The entire class is laid out in the syllabus from Day 1 and has a very reasonable pace. Consistent practice assignments from the text are not difficult and reinforce material learned in class. Assessments are completely fair and require a small amount of preparation. ",
            "\u00a0High strengths of all of it. It was all good. Good amount of work, good level of difficulty, and I felt like I was progressing the whole time. There were 0 down points. ",
            "\u00a0There are no weaknesses, especially with Liam. There are so many strengths of this course, particularly in its ability to allow you to learn a lot without having to put in so much time that it diverts from your other courses. I know that a lot of people take this course as a 5th credit, and I understand that that usually comes with taking a gut course or a course you're not really engaged in but have an easy time getting through. This course is valuable, interesting, and engaging without the huge amount of workload. It's really the best course I've ever taken at Yale. One of the greatest strengths also is the music compositions, which applied what we learned while also being really fun! ",
            "\u00a0This was an absolutely wonderful course.  It was well-organized and extremely well-taught.  The lessons followed a logical progression, allowing us to understand new material while reinforcing material we'd already learned.  It was also well-paced--learning a lot of material at the beginning set us up to better understand the more complex lessons later on in the semester, which we took a fair bit slower.  All of the assignments were reasonable but helpful in retaining material, and lectures were clear, organized, and related directly to assignments and tests.\r\n\r\nI was very, very impressed with how this course was taught--probably the best class I've taken at Yale that requires learning rote material. ",
            "\u00a0No weaknesses, only strengths. It's pretty much standardized across TFs. "

            "\u00a0A must-take course if you're a casual musician looking to solidify basic theory concepts or just want to make more time for music in your life at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah because Liam is awesome sauce. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. I would HIGHLY recommend this course. It's the best decision I've made at Yale to take this. I can't imagine anyone taking this course and regretting it. Liam is amazing and this course is amazing. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely would, to any student interested in learning music theory--and particularly with Liam Hynes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you have any interest in composition of any genre, take this course. "
