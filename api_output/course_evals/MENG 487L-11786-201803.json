            "\u00a0This class taught me a lot about the design process by actually making us do it, so it was good to get some engineering experience. ",
            "\u00a0Most of what I learned was already covered in prior classes, jobs, or research. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a thorough, hands-on introduction to mechanical engineering design. You are assigned a topic and must come up with an engineering design that solves the problem you are given. You learn how to brainstorm ideas, come up with specifications, narrow down design ideas, research for parts, and ultimately must present a full CAD assembly of your solution to the professors. In the second semester of this course, you must build your proposed solution. ",
            "\u00a0That is a great question isn't it? As far as learning goes, its more of a brief review (sometimes) of concepts that you dove into in other MENG classes. Maybe how to work better in a team environment? I don't know man. ",
            "\u00a0Nothing. Maybe a little idea of planning a long project. However, this is not really true because we never knew what was due until a few days before so it was impossible to actually plan. It would be nice if the teachers knew what they were doing. ",
            "\u00a0Trying to stay afloat in a project that was boring and didn't interest us (though we are lucky compared to other people in the class). That's it. ",
            "\u00a0How to guess the existing expectations that professors hold even though they say there is no rubric ",
            "\u00a0This course is the culmination of the mechanical engineering major, and it focuses a lot on project planning and idea generation for the first part. There is also significant design that takes place. "

        [
            "\u00a0Strengths\r\n - I developed some project management skills\r\n - I developed some mechanical design skills\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n - Organization is horrible, with the two instructors asking for entirely different things and arguing about deliverables (not to mention other things) during class in front of students.\r\n - The ASSIGNED project topics were within \"conservation technology\" which not a single person in the class was/is excited about. It's almost like you mixed up conservation and sustainability. The fact that we weren't allowed to come up with ideas related to energy was utterly shocking. Students will NOT be engaged if you force them to work on a topic they are not even remotely interested in. Nearly all of the projects are about trash... it's actually embarrassing for me to explain the topic of my mechanical engineering capstone project to friends and family. If you had let us pick well-defined topics of our own, you would be working with an excited, engaged group of students. Instead, you get the apathy and disinterest that you have been seeing in class all semester. THIS is why Yale Engineering has a bad name. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is its long meeting times so that people actually get together to work on what they need to do. The weakness is probably the long and superfluous lectures as well as having two teaching professors, one teaching associate, and two TA's. With a design class I think it's just better to have one advisor, as when you have multiple advisors they can give you marginally conflicting information because the design process has elements of subjectivity. ",
            "\u00a0The capstone should be an excellent opportunity for students to apply their technical and problem solving skills.  To an extent this was true, but the course suffered from some major problems:\r\n\r\nDeliverables\r\n\r\nIt was mentioned at some point that the intention of deliverables was mainly to check and ensure our progress and our main focus should be on our project, not deliverables.  However, the way the course is setup runs counter to this.  Most of the grade is from deliverables, and we quickly realized that most of the points docked on each deliverable were from complete minutia like formatting by the TAs.  Comparing grades between groups, we realized that actual progress on project matters extremely little if you're going to get docked 10 points for arranging something the wrong way.  The focus on deliverables became a game of trying to peer into the minds of TAs.  Also, from team meetings, it seemed like Booth and Dollar had no idea where our grades came from as well, and were trying to figure it out as well.  Finally, there was very regularly conflicting advice and feedback between TAs vs Booth vs Dollar.  If you're going to be nitpicky please at least sort it out internally!  The grading should not be as it is now:\r\nD1 to D5:  TAs grade how much time you spent trying to appease them\r\nD6: Booth and Dollar grade how good your idea is * formatting \r\nFinally, the work of the course was extremely backloaded.  The deliverables should be shifted forward.\r\n\r\nProject Topics\r\n\r\nThis was the most disappointing part of this course.  At the beginning we were given a high level topic - green energy, and asked to think of ideas in our group.  Talking around, I think a lot of people actually had pretty interesting ideas.  However, you decided that they weren't good enough, and instead made us raffle for extremely limited topics which were frankly were in general much more poorly thought out areas of interest than the ones we gravitated around.  They were a mix of areas completely oversaturated with existing projects, and areas that no student group would ever willingly explore.   Restricting creative freedom in this way really diminishes a sense of ownership over the project (especially when Booth and Dollar would wanton suggest massive changes very late in the game).\r\n\r\nLectures\r\n\r\nSome of the lectures were extremely redundant with other classes, but this of course can't be avoided given not all seniors have taken the same things.  Polling the class more on what we want to learn would do a lot of a good though.  The CAD lecture for example I felt was very interesting.  Finally, don't contradict eachother/argue in lecture!  It's good parenting advice that parents shouldn't undermine eachothers authority in front of their kids, likewise for professors and students. ",
            "\u00a0This course desperately needs to be restructured. Too many cooks in the kitchen with no clear direction or leadership. ",
            "\u00a0This course needs to be more organized. Many of the deliverables were unclear and the grading was always very arbitrary. ",
            "\u00a0okay so while I think it has been a definite improvement to split the course into a year long project the way the teaching staff has been coordinating and working together has been AWFUL. Every time we meet, Prof Booth will tell us one thing and give us the go ahead, and the next week Prof Dollar will tell us it was a dumb idea. They took points off on a presentation for \"slight contradiction among teammates. Agree on your stuff *before* your present\". That's really interesting because at every lecture or every team meeting there was some bickering or back and forth between Booth and Dollar disagreeing on what better design methods, motors, approaches, career paths, etc were better. It was almost entertaining to watch and see what new argument would start each week. Please, just ONE clear, head instructor going forward. ",
            "\u00a0I liked working in a group. Mostly this class was a huge joke.  The professors and TAs had no idea what they were doing. They provided no support or guidance but rather used class and meeting times (When Dollar deigned to show up) to bicker among themselves. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: very little feedback and way too much work for a 0.5 credit course. grading never followed their published guidelines and they seem to take a lot of fun ruining people's grades. many of us don't think that they're taking their job seriously. ",
            "\u00a0This class is one of the few opportunities to do hands on engineering at Yale, however it is profoundly disorganized due to conflicts between the professors. There needs to be a unified grading rubric and the instructors need to settle their personal differences outside the classroom. ",
            "\u00a0Too many cooks in the kitchen faculty-wise. Also the deliverables are often pulled from previous classes and faculty may be somewhat unfamiliar with the contents.\r\n\r\nWish we could choose topics so we are more engaged. ",
            "\u00a0Aaron Dollar should not be allowed to teach the class. He was uninterested in our projects and couldn't even remember his students names by the end of the semester. Professor Booth, on the other hand, was extremely helpful even though he was the secondary professor for the class this semester. ",
            "\u00a0The ability and capacity of the students to pick their own projects can play a huge role in how much a student gets out of the class. The team basis compounds this doubly. \r\nMotivating projects & good team synergy would make this class great, but basically everyone is upset with their projects or their teams and this limits how much students are willing to do on their own. Combine this fact with a poorly organized class that is designed to give lots of freedom to the students and its basically a recipe for a terrible class. ",
            "\u00a0This course is well structured in terms of class time, as there is a short lecture but lots of time to actually work on the projects. The organization of the material of was a little hard to keep track of because there are two lead instructors. \r\n\r\nI think this course could be drastically improved if the project topics were left much more to the students, or if they were given to the students with much more direction. The in-between nature of the project selection for this year made it harder for students to be fully engaged with the projects. ",
            "\u00a0Very disjointed. Unclear grading bc rubrics and guides were from previous years and largely ignored. "

            "\u00a0Not a chance. I would recommend forgoing ABET entirely if this remains a required course. You will watch as your friends in other STEM majors work on their interesting and significant senior theses and projects while you are forced to work on a lame, dead-end project. ",
            "\u00a0This class is the senior final project class for ABET MechE, so I think those are the only people who are taking it. But a big part of this class is working in a group that was randomly assigned, so you have to be ready to work with other people very closely for a large period of time. ",
            "\u00a0Very limited topics, more emphasis on reports than progress, and confused structure.  If you're not abet, take medical device design or do research instead. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in working on a year long engineering design project. ",
            "\u00a0Nope. You probably have to take it for ABET though. Hopefully they will improve it. ",

            "\u00a0I hope they structure it differently in the future. Although its good that its two semesters now ",
            "\u00a0A good project and/or  a good team can make this class bearable perhaps even fun, however if you have neither then this class basically sucks. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to someone who is a Mech E major, or someone who wants a really rigorous engineering design curriculum. Otherwise, take a class on a topic you're more interested in. "
