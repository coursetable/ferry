            "\u00a0I definitely learned conversational Spanish very well and now feel comfortable holding a basic conversation. There were a lot of grammatical concepts covered, which can be challenging and difficult to remember, but overall, I feel like I absolutely got what I expected out of this class. ",
            "\u00a0More Spanish grammar, vocab, ways to speak. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to speak Spanish using many tenses. I became comfortable conversing about a wide range of topics. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to speak and use new aspects of Spanish grammar. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about Spanish grammar and cultural traditions. ",
            "\u00a0During this course, I learned multiple grammar concepts, vocabulary words, and cultural aspects of Spanish. Such grammar concepts included commands, subjunctive, preterit tense, imperfect tense, future tense, the past participle, etc. In addition, each of my classmates and I did a project on a certain cultural aspect of a Spanish speaking country. We also learned how to communicate more effectively in Spanish, and we also worked on our listening skills. ",
            "\u00a0Reading/writing/speaking spanish at the beginner level. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This was a great class. It's very well-structured and well-paced and conducive to student learning. There's a lot of oral and speaking practice, which I also found extremely helpful. ",
            "\u00a0It was good the way it was, I think the in-class presentations/projects developed oral skills well. ",
            "\u00a0The class has a lot of different topics which keeps it interesting but the online assignments were not very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that the class was taught entirely in Spanish, so we were forced to use it at all times. However, I think some some English could have been used to explain some of the more challenging grammar concepts. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very good for learning grammar tenses and vocabulary words, but it does move quickly as there are a lot of concepts that need to be covered. The downside of this course is that a lot of the learning happens at home during homework- the grammar concepts aren't really taught in class. Class time is treated more like a review and a time to check homework answers. The class does emphasize speaking, which helps students become more confident in their speaking abilities. ",
            "\u00a0I wish the course was more practical and less academic. I just want to know how to speak Spanish, not how to conjugate the future subjunctive. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Absolutely. If you're just taking it to get your language credit out of the way, you probably won't like it, because it meets every day and there's a decent amount of busy work (which is just sort of necessary for practice when learning a language) but if, like me, you actually want to learn Spanish, it's a lot of fun. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's a good kind-of intro course for Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend it if they are serious about Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to another student, but I would recommend that they take 110 first because this class goes very fast and assumes some prior knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this class because it teaches students not only how to speak in Spanish, but it also teaches them about different cultures of Spanish speaking countries. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to learn spanish, there are no other options other than to take this course, so yes? "
