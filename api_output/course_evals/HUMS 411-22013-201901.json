            "\u00a0I feel like this course is a good introductory survey to philosophical and religious traditions. ",
            "\u00a0Insight into the most important question: what makes life worth living? I feel like my vision for my future is clearer and I know myself better now. I learned more about how other people view life and the world which helped me know myself better as well. ",
            "\u00a0how to evaluate other traditions and apply them to my own life\r\nhow to become close with classmates in a way that facilitates discussion in ways i hadn't before experienced with other yale seminars ",
            "\u00a0A deep appreciation for the pursuit of important questions, and a new comfort in not being able to find answers. The class is a class, but its material is your own lifethat's priceless. ",
            "\u00a0Wonderful course in which we explore the life worth living through a rigorous framework and the lens of different traditions ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge of diverse and important religious and cultural traditions. Skills to understand others beliefs, be more compassionate, and interrogate my own beliefs critically. Insight into major religions, others thought processes, and my own notions. Time to reflect. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think critically about what I value in life and what I find meaningful. I was taught a framework for which I can evaluate a flourishing life. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: It is a very discussion-heavy course about personal ideology in a way that is engaging but structured enough to allow for real discussion about differing perspectives and experiences. Most of the speakers were really cool. The essays are not dependent on the things you learn in class (like the things you take notes on) but rather on the ideas and your perspective, which was a breath of fresh air. Also the retreat is super great. There should be an end of semester retreat too!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I was lucky enough to have a really great section and TF but I feel like if you didn't have a good TF, the class would really suck because it's so dependent on section engagement. Also some of the speakers and readings were a little inaccessible. Additionally, there is a large amount of readings assigned (though they are not 100% necessary to do in order to succeed in class). ",
            "\u00a0I think the biggest strength is the discussion; I learned so much from my peers. I think sometimes the discussion was overly structured, or dipped into more of a lecture which honestly felt like the less useful times in class. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: the retreat at the beginning of the year solidified seminar dynamics and classmates' trust with each other, which in turn made discussions lively and fun\r\n\r\nweaknesses: sometimes we got lost in the weeds of the tradition and lost sight of the bigger picture ",
            "\u00a0The readings felt like the least interesting part of the course. So much time was spent going over texts that the class clearly hadn't engaged deeply with.\r\n\r\nThe times when we used religious traditions as springboards for universal questionsand let our own personal reflections and convictions drive the conversationwere the most satisfying and illuminating.\r\n\r\nI really liked the seminar/lecture format as well. ",
            "\u00a0Some of my favorite lecturers were those who intimately connected their own lives to the traditions that they followed; I wish more of the lecturers did this. I really enjoyed the how adaptable the seminars were; the progression really followed the points that students made, and felt very organic and authentic. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: strong seminar participation, great weekly lectures, excellent teaching, retreats. No notable weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0A strength is that you learn a lot not only from the guidance of the instructor, but from your peers as well. In this class, you learn to grapple with hard questions and are given the space to debate philosophies of life. A way it could be improved is to have the lectures and discussions connect in a more coherent way, maybe in the form of allotted time for post-lecture discussion. "

            "\u00a0Yes. It's not for everyone, but definitely shop it and see if it's right for you because if it is, it will challenge and inspire you in ways no other class at this University will. ",
            "\u00a0100%! I learned so much about the big questions, other traditions, and truly bonded with my peers. I feel heading forward I have a better structure and vocabulary to ask the big questions. ",
            "\u00a0absolutely! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would strongly recommend this course. It's a great opportunity to learn about different traditions and a space for self reflection. It's also very unique because you get to learn about how your peers think and evaluate life. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, although the enthusiasm with which I'd recommend it would depend on who you are. I took the class as a second semester senior expecting it to be a loosely structured, let-the-students'-interests-guide-us type of class. Life Worth Living is a class, with readings that can sometimes feel frustrating if you don't want to be doing them. If you're excited about the syllabus, definitely take the class. If you just want to talk about the meaning of life, think twice.\r\n\r\nAll that being said, the assignments are a ton of fun, and tangibly help you grow both in the context of Yale and w/r/t the rest of your lifethat's invaluable in a class. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely yes! It's one of those courses that forces you to be be more intentional about your life and the daily actions that you prioritize and commit to. I also loved learning about the different traditions through the lens of the life worth living. ",
            "\u00a0100%!! It gave me essential perspective, made me a better thinker, and made me happier. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Rarely are students given the chance to hone their life philosophies and think critically about their views on a meaningful life, with the resources of instructors and fellow peers. This is a great chance to really take the time to think about the direction you want to be heading in life. "
