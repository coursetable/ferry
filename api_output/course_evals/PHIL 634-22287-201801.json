            "\u00a0I learned about how to think about how the evidence of disagreement should affect our confidence in our first-order beliefs. I also learned how to revise an argument to deal with objections. ",
            "\u00a0The nature of disagreement, the philosophical debate over the disagreement help me to think philosophy as a content more carefully ",
            "\u00a0This course did a great job of introducing students to the disagreement literature. It allowed me to think about which position I more closely align with and also other areas of epistemology. "

            "\u00a0I'm not sure what to change about this course. The content was not thrilling, but did seem worthwhile. Maybe starting on religious disagreement before the last week would have been nice. ",
            "\u00a0Fascinating course material...very boring professor ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Many of the articles were great reads and the class discussion was also helpful and engaging. All of this, along with Dr. Pittard's clear explanations and direction, made the conversations in class enjoyable and challenging. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I felt that some students tended to dominate the conversation with tangential issues and this not only took up class time but made it more difficult to get involved and talk about more substantial matters. I wish that some of this could have continued outside of class. "

            "\u00a0If you care about debates in contemporary analytic epistemology, this gets into one of those that is interesting, and that connects to some other areas of philosophy. So yes if that. ",
