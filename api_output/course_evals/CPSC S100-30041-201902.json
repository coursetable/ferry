            "\u00a0Pretty much all basic coding skills ",
            "\u00a0Programming. ",
            "\u00a0I went into the course with no prior knowledge of computer science, but came out of it with the ability to code in multiple different languages to solve a variety of problems and challenges. ",
            "\u00a0I learned some about what computers are, gained a better understanding of programming, how the internet works, and how webpages are made. ",
            "\u00a0-The understanding of memory and how computers handle instructions.\r\n-How to perform algorithms in C language.\r\n-Basic file reading and writing\r\n-Making and accessing databases. ",
            "\u00a0With CS50, I learnt computer science more in depth with the introduction of C, Python, Javascript, HTML and web programming. I am more interested in computer science after I took this class. I acquired the fundamentals of computer science, like the realization of how the websites work and how the screen displays work with the knowledge of this course. Every time I see an programming error, I know the right way to approach it and solve it. This course has also taught me how to connect the dots together, for example, when I learn python, I can also do the same thing in C, and essentially to get the same result on the output. ",
            "\u00a0The online videos by Dr. Malan are amazing. However, the professor wasn't as helpful. "

            "\u00a0I wish during the class time we physically coded more. I also wish we did some more examples in class that were not done in the lecture videos. ",
            "\u00a0This course could be discussed with more examples. ",
            "\u00a0The first few weeks of the course, when C is being taught, is exceptionally planned and taught. The introduction to thinking like a programmer through learning how to code in C was a very effective introduction into the subject. However, when the transition happened to other languages, the time constraint made those other sections seem rushed and brushed over. The python sections was manageable because of its similarity to C, but the web development sections was a nightmare. If the timeline were to remain the same, I do not think the web development pset that is assigned should be the finance pset. The transition to that pset was abrupt and everyone in the class was struggling to work on the pset, as we were not at all familiar enough with flask, html, and javascript. ",
            "\u00a0It moves very fast. There's a quick turnaround for problem sets. It's tough to get everything done. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is that we can learn a lot about computer science since this course is supposed to be the main introductory class to computer science (CS50), and we get to learn and experience a variety of different programming languages. I like the variety of different languages that we get to learn. The weakness is that the course load is too much since CS50 is a semester course and is crammed into one summer session, we would need to do a quiz every Monday for the entire class time and numerous Pset that is also very lengthy. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Goes over material from videos in class. Thus, we get to revise and practice in class\r\nWeakness: The Class pace was very slow. The prof did not go in depth at all "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this if you have a lot of time to designate to this class. It is very useful and you learn a lot, but it is a lot of work and a big time commitment. ",
            "\u00a0Yes because this is cs50. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because the intensity of the course means that so much is learned through the process of this course. However, I would recommend that they take this course over the regular school year instead of over the summer, because the summer course is often rushed and thus unnecessarily difficult. ",
            "\u00a0I do not think that I could. It simply moves too fast and becomes too stressful. However the student wants to learn a lot in a short time period I think it could be good. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend, since this class is the introduction to a greater world, the world of computer science, and it is also very practical. Because we are in the digital age, computer softwares are almost everywhere. Even if people don't want to pursue a computer science career, it is still crucial to have the fundamental knowledge for computer science. Although the Psets are hard and challenging, but it feels good when you finish them and the program works perfectly. All in all, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think it provides you a good basis in computer programming, teaching you basic structure, some languages, some web development and most importantly the ability to pick up new languages and skills more easily for what you need to accomplish in the future, while being taught in a way that ramps up rapidly but starts from the bottom, allowing beginners to become proficient.
