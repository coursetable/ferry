            "\u00a0This was a really enjoyable course. The material was challenging but Professor Pettigrew explained it well. Studying for this course was never a chore because the content is so interesting.  I wish that the midterm exam would have been posted so I could check my answers against what was asked. ",
            "\u00a0Great course. Maybe make the slides more comprehensible; it's hard to know what she's talking about when reading back through them after class. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this class. The content I found super interesting and enlightening-and it definitely made me think about diseases in a more public health mind-frame as opposed to the biological-only mind-frame I have always been used to. That being said, I think there could be more organization of the class as in-a book. A lot of the material covered in class is biological mechanisms, and but the literature assigned does not usually explain it well and we discuss it for a bit, and the move on. And classes aren't recorded so we can't go back and review it that way either. I think there is a lot of important content. But I think we move through it too quickly for a good understanding. This easily could be an every day course for multiple semesters to really get a good understanding. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a great introduction to infectious diseases. I am not in EMD and have very little biology background, which made learning the concepts slightly more challenging. However, the combination of the biological, epidemiological, and social factors of infectious disease made the course interesting and useful. ",
            "\u00a0Great course. TFs and instructor are great and there seems to be a system to this course that has worked historically so no suggestions from me. ",
            "\u00a0The class was well taught. The powerpoints were a little disorganized. I do wish she'd post the entire powerpoints (without blanks) up after the classes ",
            "\u00a0the weaknesses are that at times the slides were vague and I missed the more biological side of infectious diseases. The homework took a long time to complete and the questions on the exams were very open ended at times. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this course. Incredibly interesting every day and I loved the blend of bio, epi, and social justice. This material is exactly what i wanted out of this program. I would appreciate a bit more direction in the homeworks so I know what kind of answers I should be providing. I felt sometimes I was writing short essays but still missing the point because I wasn't sure what the TFs and instructor were looking for. I would also encourage Dr. Pettigrew to consider recording lectures. They are fast and dense so I think having recordings would really help when it comes to doing the homework and studying for exams. ",
            "\u00a0Favorite class. Loved the material and the way class was run. Small size made it easy to participate and ask questions. Liked the homework and exams being more big picture than focusing on minute details like other bio courses Ive taken. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The material presented was, I thought, really interesting; Prof. Pettigrew is funny and engaging\r\n\r\nWeakness: There weren't a lot of opportunities for feedback (both qualitative and in terms of grades) or engagement with other students ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this course, particularly its strong biological components. ",
            "\u00a0One of the best courses of my life. Even though I have little science/bio background, it was structured in a way where I could still participate in discussion. I wish it wasn't during the slot right after lunch time... ",
            "\u00a0Great class, I really enjoyed learning about new pathogens every week. The smaller sized class was conducive to learning. Exams essays are return without questions making it difficult to know what exactly was answered incorrectly or correctly on the exam. In class breakout activities were very enjoyable trying to work in groups to solve the given problem. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the course! ",
            "\u00a0It was well organized. I loved the opportunities to think critically about the info we just learned. It really helped solidify my learning or even made me learn something new. The foodborne illness activity at the end of the semester should be kept and was both a nice way to have fun and a way to put all the things we learned over the semester to action. ",
            "\u00a0Extremely interesting class! Really enjoyed the diseases that were covered. My only suggestion would be adding more in class projects such as the one done on the last day of class to locate the source of the outbreak. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, this was a great class to take.  It was more biologically focused than had originally thought, but Melinda does a great job at making it accessible to everyone.  The homework assignments were very doable and helped a lot with diving deeper into the material.  Fantastic course! ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me to look at the infectious diseases in a broader aspect. I learned the dynamics of outbreaks, how movements and culture change the pattern of a disease and the importance of prevention. It was good to learn in an interactive environment, but sometimes it was hard to hear when a student spoke at another corner of the class (it was a big classroom, Winslow auditorium, which was really cold often). Also, sometimes everyone were listing one point and Dr. Pettigrew was commenting but at the end of the class I was feeling that I couldn't understand the main point. Especially with the empty slides, it was not easy to remember all the things that we have talked when you are not sure which one was correct. And I had really hard times with Dr. Childs' lectures. ",
            "\u00a0Great class! Necessary for all EMD, so probably can't get out of it. Don't recommend it if you don't have a science background as this course relies heavily on having previous biology knowledge. Melinda is a great professor. ",
            "\u00a0Good course ",
            "\u00a0STRENGTHS:\r\nExcellent overview of infectious diseases, touching on very relevant ID principles from a public health perspective. Very \"balanced\" approach.\r\nLoved the engagement with current literature regarding ID topics, facilitated by an excellent instructor.\r\nGiven my science background, I appreciated the biological/mechanistic details offered throughout the course.\r\n\r\nThe first HW was graded somewhat harshly, but overall very fair and useful assessments. Fair exams testing general concepts.\r\nEnjoyed the in-class discussions, but during the first few months, I felt like \"balance\" was lost in that too much time was spent discussing individual students' opinions, resulting in alot of \"rushing through\" the last few slides of each lecture. By the end of the semester, this balance was restored.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES:\r\nDuring the first 1.5 months, a couple comments seemed to denigrate physician involvement in infectious diseases; while I realize the important contribution the medical community has had towards antimicrobial resistance and other public health issues,  given the generally existing anti-physician sentiment among the YSPH student population, I felt like a more balanced discussion could have been facilitated. This, however, seemed restored by the end of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0STRENGTHS\r\n-- I appreciated the opportunities to work in small groups, especially given the size of the class. The more of that, the better. I also appreciated the professors emphasis on asking and answering questions of students, again very gracefully done given the size of the class. These were important moments for us to engage with the material and retrieve information from our memories to strengthen our understanding.\r\n-- I loved that the homework assignments gave us the chance to think through problems, work with classmates, and prepare for the exams. The study guides for exams were also very helpful  if you studied based off the study guide, you both understood the material better and could pass the test. I had a class on a related topic the same semester, and the only questions I could answer on the exams for that class were the ones I had had homework assignments on in Principles of Infectious Diseases, because the homework assignments stuck the material into my brain.\r\n-- Giving students open-ended questions to grapple with is a great idea, as long as theyre vetted by TAs first of course. This course did a great job of connecting biological processes to larger epidemiological questions. \r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES\r\n-- The most helpful way to organize course readings on Canvas is in a File, which can be downloaded in its entirety, and then easily accessed when offline or facing slow internet access. Modules and links to external websites are a challenge to navigate, and can require signing in with Yales Virtual Private Network when off-campus to gain access to some articles, which can in turn require Multifactor Authentication. It is easier to download all the files for each class in one go, and that is best done when they are all included in a folder in Files. \r\n-- The professor noted that the scores on the first exam were separated into two tiers. If I had to take a guess, I would guess that the upper tier is people who had a background in biology and whose first language was English, and vice versa for the lower tier. More definitions of terms during lectures would help those who dont already have that body of knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0strong in ID. ",
            "\u00a0Awesome and unique course!  Learned so much relevant material in a short period of time.  Readings were interesting, but a textbook would've been helpful.  Had a lot of biology - should recommend biology as a prerequisite. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very interesting! I enjoyed it very much. My only suggestion would be to provide answer keys for the exams and/or the exam study guides so that students can get a good idea of how to structure the answers and what should be included versus left out of an ideal response. ",
            "\u00a0The class was very detailed class about infectious and I learned a lot of material. Sometimes I thought the class was too technical almost feeling like a med school class as we needed to learn mechanisms for certain diseases even though this should be more if epidemiology of infectious disease class. But overall was a good class. ",
            "\u00a0This was my favorite course. I thought is was thorough and thoughtfully taught and I looked forward to it every week. It would have been helpful to have recorded the lessons for review however because not all detailed information was listed clearly on her slides in a way that could be reviewed later. "

            "\u00a0Dr. Pettigrew was particularly good at making us think critically about the social and political issues surrounding infectious disease, while teaching us the biological mechanisms at the same time. Though she sometimes spoke quickly, her lecture slides and illustrations were informative. \r\nI do think recording the lectures would have been helpful for reviewing concepts. I would sometimes misunderstand a concept in lecture, so having a recording would help with fully understanding the processes. ",

            "\u00a0Good instructor who selected very relevant, public health topics throughout the course for individuals with and without science backgrounds.\r\n- a few of the mechanistic details seemed overbearing towards SBS individuals towards the beginning of the course, but this was rectified by the end. ",
            "\u00a0STRENGTHS\r\n-- The professor was very organized and gave interesting lectures, with well-structured PowerPoints.\r\n-- The professor had a friendly and relaxed way of speaking to students that put us at ease and helped us to learn. She was responsive to student emails.\r\n-- The professor structured the class in such a way that those of us who attended lectures learned more than those who did not  which is how learning should be. Were not here to get what we could get just from reading a textbook, we like to hear what she has to say.\r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES\r\n-- The professor sometimes would speak quickly during important points, or use terminology that students were not familiar with and then lose half the audience. Assume that every word needs to be defined the first two times its used in a lecture, for example slowly say episome, a genetic element inside some bacterial cells rather than just episome. ",

            "\u00a0Very good lecturer! ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Pettigrew was a great lecturer teaching us very interesting material. My one point would be sometimes I felt the lectures were too long or rushed and we couldnt cover some material in detail. Sometimes it was also hard to take notes completely as the slides would go by real quickly. ",
            "\u00a0She is a brilliant instructor and I feel lucky to learn from her. The only comment I would leave is to ask her to be mindful of those with less medical literacy. The first few weeks of class I was googling words as she said them because, not coming straight from undergrad or a microbio background, even words like serotype needed a brush up for me. Therefore I got behind a lot because I did not have the background knowledge that she assumed we all had when learned biological mechanisms and I felt it harmed me in note taking. Because she does write what she says on the slides, if you are not comprehending as you are writing your notes are almost worthless and I felt it would be more helpful for students like me to start slower and spell things out more clearly. However, she was very good about checking in with us to make sure we understood. "

Could be challenging for individuals without an intro course in immunology or microbiology, but as someone with a pre-med/med background, these scientific concepts were easily understandable, offering opportunities for greater absorption of public-health-related concepts.\r\n\r\nProfessor engaged students in lively discussion.\r\n\r\nWould recommend to individuals seeking a general understanding of principles of infectious diseases.

Look over the syllabus, if you are an EMD student familiar with a large number of the topics covered, perhaps it would be worth your time to look into placing out of the class. Professor Pettigrew is great, she makes the material more engaging with small group activities and case studies (rather than just lecturing for 1+ hour). ",
