            "\u00a0I learned various techniques applicable to cell biology research, and I learned a lot of key facts behind these techniques. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about cell biology and about my future in medicine. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to critically think about scientific problems and problem solve tough issues. I learned many research techniques that will be very important in medical school and beyond. I learned to present scientific data in front of an audience. ",
            "\u00a0Tons of basic science techniques: PCR, BCA, Agarose/SDS gels, protein prep, column prep. This class will teach you everything you need to know to conduct basic biochemistry research. ",
            "\u00a0This course gives you experience in the most relevant techniques in biological research today. It is unmatched in the amount of resources provided in a teaching lab setting, and in the quality of instructors. Your presentation skills will be improved, and your general knowledge relating to biological research will be dramatically elevated. ",
            "\u00a0In this course, I learned various cell biology experimental techniques and how to think scientifically and critically about biological concepts in the context of research design and data significance. We also practiced presentation and communication skills through chalk talks and job talks. Guest speakers provided us insight and knowledge on career paths and life lessons. "

            "\u00a0Strengths\r\n1. A nurturing environment in which to learn cell lab techniques; you won't be afraid to ask questions or mess up, since you know (and Dr. Wolenski insists) that it's all part of the learning process\r\n2. Meets twice a week. It might seem like a long time to spend in lab, but having a set rhythm in this lab allowed me to get to know Dr. Wolenski, my TAs, and my classmates better, truly making the class seem like a family\r\n3. There is a great emphasis on being able to present scientific ideas to your classmates, through a \"chalk talk\" and a \"job talk.\" The chalk talk is a 5 minute presentation on the white board during which you explain a cell bio lab technique; the job talk is a 15 min powerpoint presentation on a paper that you pretend you've written yourself. Being forced to understand such concepts and present them as if you were an expert is an invaluable lesson in the sciences, and I'm so so glad I had the opportunity to do so in this class\r\n4. Dr. Wolenski himself is a phenomenal professor, and I hope Yale recognizes this and hires more professors like him. He genuinely cares about our learning and about our growth as students and people. He encourages our professional aspirations (knowing that so many of us were pre-med, for example, he brought in various Yale-New Haven physicians and researchers)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n1. Sometimes lab ran longer than it needed to, particularly in the last few weeks of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly don't change a thing. I really loved the community and mentorship that I found through the course, as well as the knowledge and laboratory skills I acquired. ",
            "\u00a0A perfect class. ",
            "\u00a0Best class I have taken at Yale! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Fantastic class- you'll learn a lot and Wolenski will teach you everything he has to know. Also just a great guy.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Twice a week for ~5 hours each. Adds up to a lot of time, but it's worth it. ",
            "\u00a0Don and Dr. Wolenski complemented each other perfectly! The guest speakers were such an invaluable experience. ",
            "\u00a0sometimes classes dragged on a bit ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very engaging, wonderful professor and TA's, chalk talks and job talks helped improve presentation skills, labs were interesting, got to know classmates well, guest speakers were amazing\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes all the time set aside for talks and guest speakers detracted a bit from the labs themselves. The labs seemed rushed and a bit disorganized at times. "

            "\u00a0As you've already seen from past evaluations, the question is not so much whether you WANT to take this course, but whether you can get into it in the first place. It's got an 18-month wait list for a reason. There's not much I can add that hasn't already been said.\r\n\r\nTake this course not only if you want to dabble in learning cell lab techniques, but also if you want to do so in an encouraging learning environment, with one of the best professors Yale has to offer, with some of the most caring TAs you'll meet in your life. ",
            "\u00a0YES YES YES A MILLION TIMES OVER. If you are not on the waitlist, email Dr. Wolenski and get your name on the waitlist RIGHT NOW. This was by far the best class I've taken at Yale. Not only did I gain a LOT of knowledge that will help me with my future research career, but I also gained a lot of friends and mentors through this class. Dr. Wolenski puts so much of his personal time and resources into this class, and the end result is incredible. Please, please, whether you're an MCDB major, a pre-med, or just curious about biology, take this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would highly recommend this class. It takes up a lot of time but it is so worth it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student applying to medical school or looking to do research after Yale. The skills I learned here are invaluable to future biomedical success ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this class to another student (if you can get in). Make sure to sign up during your first year so that you can take it your junior year. Wolenski is a gem of a teacher, and you'll learn so much about science. There is always food, your classmates will incredibly smart, and you will love the ten hours you spend in lab per week. ",
            "\u00a0This is without a doubt the best course I have taken at Yale. It is truly unmatched in the amount of experience that you gain, and in the amount of fun that you have. All around, this is a great environment. ",
            "\u00a0I'd 100% recommend this class to anyone interested in the content. Dr. Wolenski is so passionate about teaching and is one of the few professors I've had who genuinely cared our learning. Not much work outside of class, classes sometimes run long but still worth it! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take it if you can get in. Dr. Wolenski is an amazing person and teacher. The course is unlike any other you'll take in MCDB or at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely if you can get into the class! There is quite a high demand and long waitlist for this class, but definitely worth it! Professor Wolenski is such an engaging instructor and the TA's are very dedicated as well. The labs are very interesting, you will practice presentation skills with chalk talks and job talks, he invites guest speakers, and you'll get to know your classmates very well. A very fun lab! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely take the course! It may seem like a large time commitment, but the main commitment is the time actually spent in lab, which means that you don't go home with lots of assignments. Depending on the experiment we do on a particular day, it's also entirely possible to be out of lab well before the listed end time. Dr. Wolenski is fantastic, and the TA's (Don and Koen) were amazing at keeping all the experiments on track. You learn a lot of basic cell biology lab techniques, and if you've done research in a bio lab setting before, it won't be anything you haven't seen, done, or heard of before, but this class will really drill into you the fundamentalswhy we use this particular chemical or buffer at this particular point in an experiment, how a light microscope is built and why it works, etc., and it ends up being so useful because you actually will go home understanding so much about basic lab techniques.
