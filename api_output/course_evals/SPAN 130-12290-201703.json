            "\u00a0I think my Spanish skills (especially speaking) improved a lot. ",
            "\u00a0While taking this course, I strengthened my knowledge in Spanish from that of which I had learned in high school. I feel more confident when switching back and forth between preterite and imperfect and using for vs para amongst other things. I believe that I became a better listener after taking this course and I got more practice with speaking the language. ",
            "\u00a0This class taught me how to speak Spanish much better at the intermediate level. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the Spanish language. Specifically, grammar, vocabulary, and the general flows and nuances of the language (more so than in L1 and L2). ",
            "\u00a0I believe that  learned a lot throughout this class. I believe that I am both a better speaker and writer than when I entered, however in my class specifically, it was unfairly graded and criticized making me feel as if any development I had made was nonexistent or marginal at best. ",
            "\u00a0This class primarily developed my grammar and vocabulary in Spanish, and also helped to improve my speaking, writing and understanding. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I feel that this course is quite well structured to reinforce grammar structures that are essential in communication. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of Spanish grammar in this course, as well as a lot of new vocab. ",
            "\u00a0I learned Spanish to a much better degree than I have in previous courses. Prof. Barroso spoke exclusively Spanish and it really helped us learn. ",
            "\u00a0I have developed strong vocal skills taking this course as I have not in any other Spanish courses. ",
            "\u00a0ability to speak more fluently and not second-guess verb conjugations in conversations. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my Spanish language skills and learned a bit about Spanish ciliture "

            "\u00a0The strength was the instructor: Lorena. The weakness was the textbook: it's not used very much, and definitely isn't worth >$200. It's basically just a way to monitor our homework online. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are that it is able to cover plenty of material that helps us to speak the language regarding all the primary tenses ad what not. I think that doing online activities was very helpful as we learned grammar. I also enjoyed being in a class of peers similar to my level of Spanish. The weaknesses of this course are that individual students don't receive the attention that they need I class. So if you need additional help, you may need to seek outside assistance. ",
            "\u00a0While this course focuses very intensely on learning Spanish, the syllabus has numerous errors, leading students to incorrectly prepare for exams and projects.  The tests frequently use future knowledge before it is taught and are graded arbitrarily.  Never did I feel like my knowledge built on itself to better me in any way. ",
            "\u00a0One big weakness was the level of difficulty of the tests. Sometimes I felt it was just testing our reading comprehension and ability to memorize facts rather than our knowledge of the Spanish language. I spent at least 5 hours studying for every in-class assignment, yet my grade never improved. \r\n\r\nI do feel my comprehension of the language improved. By the end of the course, Spanish felt much more natural than at the beginning. However, my grade did not reflect that, and that's what bothered me. I certainly put in the time and effort, but results didn't show, for whatever reason. ",
            "\u00a0I believe that the expectations of this class both in what it demands from you and how it treats your best efforts is completely unfair. The work required day in and day out is exhausting, and on test and exams expectations are so unfairly high that at many times in the class it felt as if there was no hope of success for me. ",
            "\u00a0One strength of the class is in how much it focuses on grammar and vocabulary as I feel that I had improved in both of these by the end of the semester. However, I felt that we never received much feedback in how to improve our writing and I don't feel that this class helped me improve that at all. ",
            "\u00a0I feel that if we had more oral presentations in the class, it would be helpful. For most people in this class, spanish will be used almost entirely orally in their life, so it makes more sense to train that skill more. ",
            "\u00a0This course does cover a lot of material in one semester, which is a strength. However, I think the assessments are truly beyond the level of what is taught in class, and the grading system of this course makes it incredibly difficult to actually do well. ",
            "\u00a0Meeting every day is a huge strength. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are in the student to student interaction, but the weaknesses are in the constant flow of homework that seems to have no end at times. ",
            "\u00a0The daily homework became overwhelming and tedious at times which took away from the learning. "

            "\u00a0Spanish is pretty cool. ",
            "\u00a0I think that this class presented me with an excellent opportunity to continue learning Spanish. I don't think that it was too advanced at all. You go over most of the topics since early on in Spanish which was a good refresher for the semester. At some points, I felt challenged but that only meant that I needed to study more. The class normally flew by each day, and it has been my favorite class at Yale so far. ",
            "\u00a0If you have taken Spanish L1 and L2, then I guess you are in too deep to turn back now (my sympathies).  Otherwise, do not take this course for any reason.  The course is poorly structured, requires future knowledge on tests, and is a brutal grind of meaningless assignments with no feedback.  Unless the teacher likes you, this will feel like a daily punishment for not knowing Spanish well.  Your GPA and sanity will suffer under the slog of weekly evaluations just important enough to tank your grade if you ever slip up.  Seriously, this is the worst course decision I have made in my time at Yale, and pulled my GPA down while distracting me from the classes that mattered. ",
            "\u00a0Do not take this class if you don't HAVE to. Granted, it depends a LOT on the teacher you get, but don't risk getting one that may cause you to receive a grade that significantly drops your GPA. I started off slow in this class, but I was okay with it because I thought it would get better, but it never did. Maybe marginally, but not noticeably. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this class to anyone! The amount of work and time it requires of you is ridiculous and it often feels like you are putting in a lot of work for very little reward. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class if a student really wants to improve their ability to speak Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0This class does really help with grammar, so I'd recommend it for that reason. ",
            "\u00a0I don't think many people will take this unless they have to. If you don't have to take this for your language requirement, this class is not worth taking. It's hard, a lot of work, and is very harshly graded. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, its a great course if you want to improve your Spanish language skills quickly "
