            "\u00a0This course taught me more specifics on the inner workings of the brain and how learning and memory were embedded in psychological practices. I was able to engage in the course well through the lectures, homework assignments and the information learned through a couple of labs completed. I think the course has a lot of great information that I took away. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the biological and psychological bases of learning and memory, as well as the extension of this into computer science and AI / DL ",
            "\u00a0This was the first upper-level neuro class I've taken at Yale. I enjoyed applying my knowledge of the brain to a more specific topic learning and memory. ",

            "\u00a0I learned how to think critically and I am grateful this class led me to learn more about myself and how the brain works. ",
            "\u00a0The title of this course really says it all. We dived into learning and memory, with some discussion on other general psychology and neuroscience topics you might find in other psych classes (like free will, emotions, etc). If you remembered anything from The Human Brain, you probably did well in this class. ",
            "\u00a0The two main focuses we had were:\r\n1) psychological theories to explain phenomena of learning and memory\r\n2) neuroscience/ physical substrates that underly the phenomena\r\n- Through this we learned a good deal about psych experiments and brain anatomy\r\n- The course seemed a little more relevant to people interested in psych research, or people interested in more intersectional psych/neuroscience related careers (ie. designing AI, creating new education techniques, possibly marketing) ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the functional organization and anatomy of the brain, with a specific focus on the system responsible for memory and learning. Other topics include the physiology of neurotransmitter-based signaling, clinical disorders of the brain, and the history of psychology related to learning and memory. ",

            "\u00a0strengths is the professor and the really interesting material taught in class\r\nweakness is that the class moves very quickly and there is little instruction with assignments, hard to tell how you are doing ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course were the labs we did in class sometimes- they were really fun! The weaknesses are the course's focus on rote memorization. Having to memorize the names of scientists and books and different parts of the brain without any real understanding of how they all fit together was frustrating at times. I felt that the tests were not to see how much you learned or understood, but to see how good you were at memorizing factoids that you could have googled. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: fantastic neuroscience course that also provides contextual, psychological background; great, coherent professor; not too demanding of a courseload while still being challenging\r\nWeaknesses: weighting distribution of grades not released, oftentimes assignments were a little unclear on their instructions ",
            "\u00a0I think the lecturing could sometimes be difficult to follow because there was so much information and the professor sometimes spoke in a monotone voice. Perhaps having him walk around and interact with the class a bit more rather than just reading off of the slides. I would have felt like I NEEDED to attend class rather than seeing it as a waste of time. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - great content and organization of material, interactive labs and activities\r\nWeakness - classroom structure makes it difficult to stay engaged/ interact with Professor Brown unless you sit in the front ",
            "\u00a0This course has nicely distributed assignments three midterms and several projects for people who prefer non-exam-based assignments. It caters to all learning styles. Lectures are generally interesting and connect the material to contemporary studies and provide real-world applications. ",
            "\u00a0I did not enjoy the fact that this course basically rehashed everything from a psych intro course, but when we got more in detail on learning and memory details it became more interesting. ",
            "\u00a0The assignments didn't really feel like they reinforced the content of the course and seemed like a lot of work. ",
            "\u00a0The material is all interesting and cohesive, but it would be better if the lectures were not often summaries of the textbook. ",
            "\u00a0I felt like it was a lot of information to take in at once; however, the professor is very accommodating and cares a lot about each student's individual progress. ",
            "\u00a0Strength - If you study lectures and the textbook, you can be pretty sure you'll do well in this class. Weakness - Sometimes the tests asked for what I thought was sort of obscure details like the very specific area where something occurs that we might have talked about once briefly. I would prefer that its more concept understanding based, which it did have some of, but not enough. ",
            "\u00a0Very organized! I appreciate how the professor aligned the lectures with the readings and that there weren't really any unnecessary assignments. The tests were pretty fair and the activities/assignments were interesting.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness for me was that we covered many things in a quick, one-off kind of way. I rather have focused on less material and in greater depth. For example most of the lectures had 60+ slide presentations and we really only focused on a few topics in depth. ",
            "\u00a0The course content is enriching and interesting, particularly for someone with a prior interest with the human brain. It moves at a slightly fast pace, but it does not require a strong neuroscience background to appreciate the content. The computer labs were especially interesting and engaging. For weaknesses, I did find the lectures dry, largely because the professor would use all 75 minutes to go through an equal number of slides. On most days, the professor runs through the day's lecture and then we depart--I wish there was a mix of lectures and interactive components, such as group activities or online labs, rather than separating the class in lecture days and lab days. ",
            "\u00a0Please make the exams less based on tiny details! (Aka, I didn't feel that asking whose book spent X weeks on the NYT best sellers list was a fair test of my knowledge). Please give guidelines on the lab reports for things you want to see before they're due (like marking off points for not having enough detail in the introduction - some of us have not written psych lab reports before and didn't realize we needed to just regurgitate what we had in class) "

            "\u00a0Not really, unless you have a neuroscience background and want to memorize facts ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it to someone that has experience in neuroscience because there was a lot of information that I learned previously which made the material easier to understand. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Definitely take this course if you have an interest in neuroscience. Learning and memory is a central aspect of what makes us human and Prof Brown does a great job of covering all aspects of this amazing feature of human cognition. The connections to the real world through labs and the AI presentations / student talks made it even more worthwhile, to see the connections between biological sciences and tech. The tests are fair, although they ask for a lot of minutia like names of nobel laureates in the field, but Prof Brown makes it very clear what you should study before an exam. There are no surprises. But, Prof. Brown brings in delicious baked goods from time to time! :) ",
            "\u00a0Yes - if you are already interested in the brain! ",

            "\u00a0I enjoyed the class a lot, and it was a great introduction to the human brain and the applications of learning more about the mind. ",
            "\u00a0If you want a pretty straightforward, learn whats in lecture and in the textbook kind of class, then this class isn't too bad. That being said, its not the most life changing class. If you're really interested in learning and memory go for it, but if not, you probably won't enjoy this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It was interesting and I think Professor Brown is a great presenter and very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I would cautiously recommend this course to an other student. Having an interest in, or strong appreciation of, all things brain will make this course more enjoyable. The course content can be very interesting, but it's up to you to bring your own excitement. The lectures will otherwise feel disengaging and pedantic, because you'll run through several hundred powerpoint slides between midterms. For an interested student, a ton of new content may provide for an enjoyable experience. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: information is interesting, Prof Brown seems to really care about his students\r\nWeaknesses: homework assignments make very little sense, tests are TERRIBLE. I read in the reviews that they were straight rote memorization, but didn't understand the degree to which it is. There's no hierarchy of information in this course, every little detail can be tested in T/F manner. These tests felt more obnoxious than SAT trick questions. For the final exam, he said he would hold a review session, and then one day after class randomly said it would be then, and gave us over half the questions. But he hadn't warned us about the day, and some people had class after and couldn't make it, so felt massively unfair. ",
