I found it especially useful in conjunction with my soil science and plant ecophysiology class. Much of the information was new to me, but about half the material was important review in climate, weather, water, and energy topics. I felt it was a good reminder of the sorts of things that we can calculate and quantify, the sorts of things that are difficult to quantify/calculate, and that I can find the formulas to do these calculations without much difficulty. \r\n\r\nFinally, it was also a good illustration of how data is not always as specific, exact, or accurate as a layman might think. For example, though I felt at the beginning of the course that a review on significant figures and numbers was too basic, I found it really useful when we later looked at IPCC figures and graphs for carbon and energy balances.

I wish I had been in a classroom. I think the instructor and the TAs did the best they could to offer support within this structure by providing a lot of office hours. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated the Shimi made the course online so that people could access it whenever, however they needed to. It definitely added flexibility and allowed me to take the courses that I needed to. The material was very interesting, and I think it's important to know as an environmental manager.\r\n\r\nI did have frustrations with the overall execution of the course, though. In particular, the only source of knowledge was a video and office hours. That made the students highly dependent on the instructors, which I think was unfair and pedagogically unsound, especially for a diverse set of learners. I do not learn by being talked at, and for concepts that are so new and unfamiliar, it would have been nice to have a text to reference. As I did for the ecology class, I would have read the text in advance of watching the lecture to orient my brain around what I was about to learn. I also could have had something to refer to while doing the assignments -- something more substantial than my notes and more easily findable than trying to rewatch the lecture and remember which minute Shimi covered a specific topic, or do some random google search that would send me down various rabbit holes. It made problem sets unnecessarily harrowing. Not everyone learns by reading and then hearing and then doing, but for those of us who do, it would have been nice to have the option of following along with a specific text. Related to that, I thought that the quizzes were sometimes unreasonable with how specific some of the questions were. ",

            "\u00a0Physical Sciences should serve as an example of how a basic knowledge course can be implemented effectively. Professor Anisfeld is a great communicator of information: clear, concise, compelling. It was particularly nice to have a basic knowledge course structured this way, in which those with some background could move more quickly than others. Many of the other required classes suffered from moving at the lowest common denominator. It was fun to do this solo and really engage with the material at a speed appropriate to the individual. \r\n\r\nI wouldn't change anything! ",
            "\u00a0Since I'm not here to study the physical sciences, I was very happy to be required to take a class in the subject. It seemed like an opportunity to investigate a topic ancillary to my own studies, learning from a respected member of the field. I loved the material in this class and reveled in Prof. Anisfeld's lectures. My appreciation for the class was frustrated by the flipped format; I would have enjoyed sitting a  lecture to get face-time with Prof. Anisfeld. The structure of the course made it easy to get through the material effectively but not to learn it deeply. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: Shimi is a really good teacher!\r\n\r\nweaknesses: I think too much information/too much detail was presented for a half semester course. Some TF's admitted that Shimi tried to fit in as much as possible into a shorter period of time, and that isn't really the point of a half semester course. If some of the detail had been cut out, I would have absorbed the other material much better. Notably, some of the deep dives into chemistry could be cut out, and some units could be shortened (atmosphere, soils, precipitation) - those units that went well beyond a foundations level.\r\n\r\nFinally, I would have enjoyed an in-person class more than the online lectures. While Shimi recorded was still an effective teacher, I would have appreciated the opportunity to engage more in a traditional class setting. ",
            "\u00a0Shimi is a great lecturer, and he really engages during class/office hours. I honestly can't think of any improvements. This isn't my favorite class I took this semester, but it was a really valuable experience and the course as it stands seems like the optimal version of itself. ",
            "\u00a0The format of this course is extremely effective. The professor was very responsive. The material covered provided a useful foundation for F&ES courses. The course could be better as a full semester course. At times, it felt like we had to rush through the material. I would have been able to digest things more at a slower pace. We also could have gone a little deeper in some areas, had the course been longer. The course would also have been more effective in the first half of the semester. Many of my classes this semester required me to understand physical sciences from the very beginning. At times, I felt like I was learning things too late. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course tried to fit too much information into too short of a time period. It would have felt less like a tidal wave of information if there had been fewer modules with more time to understand and practice each one. ",
            "\u00a0I really appreciated the flipped classroom approach where lectures and assignments could all be done outside of formal class time, and class time was dedicated to asking questions and getting help on assignments. ",
            "\u00a0I did not like the format. Personally, I learn more in a regular class format. I also think that not having a book or text that explained the concepts made the course even harder.  If the class had a text a book, and if the curriculum was limited to more basic concepts, the class would have been more appropriate and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very effective in that it covered a wide variety of valuable information and skills that will be critical for my success at F&ES and in my future career. However, because the range of topics included was so broad, it made it difficult to fully comprehend each lecture before moving on the next one. I feel that the course could be even more effective if it covered fewer subject areas or if it was expanded to a full-semester course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\nReally important material. I have confidence speaking to the science climate change and the environment. Shimmi is a really class professor and cares a-lot. The hands on nature of the course was great and i enjoyed working through the science of it rather than just lecturers. This is the better way to do things with science so good job on that. I wish we had some more interaction time properly with shimi thought because he does explain things well in an interactive setting (i.e. the review sessions).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nWAY TO MUCH MATERIAL FOR AN 8 WEEK 1.5 CREDIT COURSE. It bothers me when professors do this. They are told they need to cut down material to make a shorter course and what do they do? They literally keep the same amount of material and just condense the timeline. Its really frustrating. Even though I really thought the material was all valuable, it felt like a huge challenge. \r\n\r\nImprovement:\r\nIf keeping it the same structure, maybe cut out all the stuff about soils, and doing crazy excel work for measuring charge differences for ions. These presentations were super dense. I really think it can be simplified. Alternatively keep the same credit hours but spread it out over the semester or something. ",
            "\u00a0I don't think the \"flipped\" element of the course served this class well--it would have been much more engaging to watch Shimi lecture in person (though I know he covered a huge scope of knowledge). I'd suggest paring down the course to fit the half-semester time length and focus on key ideas you don't want students to ever forget, and drill them in. I.e. mechanisms of climate change, global energy budget, geology, or whatever feels most relevant. However, if I were continuing on to do more Earth Science, I would be grateful for the introductory breadth I received from this class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nThe flipped classroom format worked VERY well for this class; The professor is very good at explaining concepts; homeworks/quizzes did not take a lot of time but were helpful in solidifying learning.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\nI wish it had been longer! This felt like the most important and certainly best taught \"required course.\" ",
            "\u00a0I am not a fan of the flipped classroom, and would have preferred in-class lectures, especially since Shimi is such a great teacher. I also think that this would be better as a full-semester course. There's too much content to pack into half a semester. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes it wasnt entirely clear based on the lecture/images what were the important things to remember - there were moments that sounded like offhand comments in the lecture and werent in the images but showed up in the quizzes. ",
            "\u00a0That the course was offered online was a blessing and a curse. As it's level of complications and workload was incredibly demanding, although it was a wonderful benefit to be able to study the material at the pace that one wishes. Unfortunately this semester was not structured well and as such the prereqs were the courses that suffered. In the future if possible providing incoming students with the means to take the course over the summer or in a time-frame that does not conflict with other intended courses would be advisable. ",
            "\u00a0seems better suited to a full semester ",
            "\u00a0Shimi is an excellent lecturer and a wealth of knowledge. I think the biggest weakness was the structure of the class. I didn't like having online lectures because it puts the organizing strain on us. In addition, it means that we don't benefit from hearing other students' questions. Great info in the class though! ",
            "\u00a0I liked the flipped schedule of the course, it made it much more easy to complete and was helpful to have office hours so often, as well as online problem sets and quizzes. I do think there was a bit too much material in the course to fully learn everything. It could be improved by being a full semester-long course or having slightly less material covered in the 6 weeks. ",
            "\u00a0The course was mostly covered over the internet through videos. This was very helpful in assisting individuals to study at their desired pace. Office hours were very helpful for completing problem sets. The content was very well organized. \r\n\r\nI, however, believe weekly modules were often very bulky and considerations should be made to reduce the load in subsequent semesters ",
            "\u00a0Personally, I very much appreciated the flipped format of the class, as it catered to my learning style and allowed me to maximize my time management efficiency. However, I know that other students found it difficult to absorb such a wealth of new concepts in half a semester's time. I'd recommend providing students the option of taking a similar, full-semester course (perhaps offered in the spring) that explores these concepts at a bit of a slower pace and in greater depth, so that students feel that they are fully absorbing everything that they want to learn. ",
            "\u00a0The brevity of the course made it somewhat challenging to really grasp the concepts. In terms of the Foundations courses, I would have preferred being given the choice of taking a full semester long course in lieu of this half-semester requirement. I definitely would have taken that option for this class, and might be taking the Physical Science of Climate Change next semester which seems to me like it would make an appropriate substitute for this class, if we wanted to fill that time with a different course.

            "\u00a0The online lectures were surprisingly clear and engaging. Office hours were fun. Canvas quizzes are a bit cumbersome in that you have to constantly re-enter your answers as you take the quiz. There is also no option for partial credit if your work process was correct but made a calculation error :( ",
            "\u00a0As a foundation course for the MEM degree I wish that this course had been waived for me. This is less of a critique of this 1/2 semester course and more a slight bitterness at the waste of a credit that I didn't need. My background was in oceanography and fisheries science and I was required to take several chemistry, geology and oceanography classes, all of which covered much of this curriculum. Without studying, and with little outside assistance I am not proud to say, but I did the bare minimum and passed this class. \r\n\r\nI would have found the materials far more interesting if there were more connectivity of ideas within 'hard science'- especially water science, and what is available at Yale, who is doing what that is making headlines, and how this might be applicable to the variety of specializations that we are all pursuing. I'm sorry that this felt like an unhelpful use and expensive use of time. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked that the lectures were available early, so I could work ahead if needed. I also found the multiple office hour sessions useful and enabled me to keep my schedule flexible--and I loved that Shimi was at most of the review sessions so I could talk to him and get to know him. In general, I thought this class was really well adapted to the flipped classroom format. ",

The reverse classroom worked really well and in fact this should just be a summer course. \r\n\r\nI wish it could be more case based and I would recommend attaching a piece of news or something 'applied', real-world to each topic we learn about, so we immediately see and get joy from feeling like we are better at understanding environmental issues from a physical perspective.

I really appreciated the flexibility of taking the lectures and doing the assignments whenever I wanted to, and having the ability to do the homework multiple times helped me to understand what I was doing wrong. The TAs were super-helpful, and it was great that they had office hours so many times each week. I do wish that this class was a full semester, because I would like to learn more about the topics we covered and not feel quite so rushed. My one complaint about this class was that I found the 2 part, 4.5 hour final to be a bit excessive for a 1.5 credit course. ",

            "\u00a0Even if you think you have basic knowledge of many physical science topics, the course could still be a good refresher without demanding much work. I thought it was! I'm glad I took it! ",
            "\u00a0Don't fall behind and go to office hours! ",
            "\u00a0Do it, especially if you have only taken one or two physical sciences courses - this covers a wide range and its a great overview. ",
            "\u00a0Take notes as you watch the videos on the computer so you can search for terms later during the homework and quizzes. I don't advise skipping the lectures and attempting to solve the quizzes without your notes. ",
            "\u00a0Although the course is offered online the assignments are difficult enough to demand attending the in-office hours, which is unfortunate. ",
            "\u00a0take notes even during video lectures ",
            "\u00a0Shimi is a real wealth of knowledge. Try to set a time when you watch each lecture, if it stays online. Also, don't take your notes by hand because you may want to have a digital copy. ",
            "\u00a0Make sure not to get behind on watching the lectures. In fact, I recommend to watch the new lectures as soon as they are open and to take the quiz directly afterwards, saving the problem set for office hours the following week. There is a lot of material but it is very possible to absorb most of it if you are proactive and work ahead. Also, I recommend taking digital notes that you can reference and return throughout the class, as well as in your future studies on related topics. ",
            "\u00a0The course moves quickly and does build on itself to a degree. Do all the quizzes and really learn the concepts with the problem sets. The grading is really fair and you can walk a way with a solid understanding of physical sciences concepts. ",
            "\u00a0Take notes during the videos so you don't have to re-watch them. ",
            "\u00a0Take good notes...there is a lot of info covered quickly. ",
            "\u00a0Office hours for this class are not to provide extra help for students--they're more like necessary check-in sessions, and you should go early in the week if you felt confused or overwhelmed by anything in the lecture. ",
            "\u00a0no choice? ",
            "\u00a0Ask for the class to be in person ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this class! But watching the recorded video lectures may be more time-consuming than you think. "
