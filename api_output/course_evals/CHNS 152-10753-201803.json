            "\u00a0I learned a lot of new characters, cheng yu, sentence structures, and interesting things about Chinese culture. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my speaking and written Chinese skills. Furthermore, I learned a bit about the culture and history of China. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a very intensive list of new vocabulary that can be used in regular conversations between classmates and other speakers. By taking this class I was able to develop my speaking, which needed help mainly grammar section. I was able to learn many other facts outside the written curriculum. For example I was able to learn older chinese references and the sayings itself. By being able to learn more than the written cirriculum my insight for chinese deepened allowing me to apply these knowledges to when I articulate those words and forming them. ",
            "\u00a0Not only was this course helpful by easing our way into the intensive study of Chinese, it also exposed us to a lot about Chinese culture and tradition. I am now able to pick up Chinese vocabulary much more quickly and am more appreciative of the language, ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of new vocabulary and sentence structures, improving my writing abilities. I gained a little more insight into Chinese culture, although most of the learning came from vocabulary and sentence structures. ",
            "\u00a0Becoming more adept at reading, writing and speaking in Mandarin. ",
            "\u00a0I was able to hone my oral, writing, and reading skills in Mandarin with the help of Wang lao shi. I learned a lot of new vocabulary and definitely found ways to utilize new sentence structures in and out of class (Chinese lunch table!) "

            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this class. The small class size and the class format of part lecture, part discussion were very engaging, interesting, and at many times, fun. Prof. Wang was very helpful and kind. No weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: My Chinese massively improved from day 1. Looking back to lesson texts and the beginning of the semester, they seem ridiculously easy, and as of now, I am more than capable of reading Chinese passages (although I'm not at the level of being able to easily understand the news or read newspapers/books. The instructor, Wang Laoshi, is very enthusiastic and good at getting her students engaged. The lesson text is written Wang Laoshi herself and is very useful for improving Chinese. The course focuses especially on using standard language (better vocabulary) and better sentence structures and patterns. There were many other aspects of the course which improved learning, e.g. daily dictation quizzes, presentations, group projects, debates, etc. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course did a great job of improving my Chinese, but I also feel like I needed more practice speaking. Wang Laoshi does encourage us to participate during lesson lectures, but I felt my speaking improve the most during activities like debates. I would recommend replacing maybe one out of every four or five lectures with some sort of class-speaking activity. I would also liked to have gotten a better understanding of the students--at the end of the semester I barely knew most of my classmates. I would suggest a speaking or recording activity done between members of the class on a biweekly basis, in order to foster camaraderie in the class. ",
            "\u00a0I think my strength was being able to grasp the new terms and apply them well. My weakness is that I had trouble being able to apply all of the grammar structures, because a few of them can be used for many different scenarios, so I tend to use less of the others. ",
            "\u00a0Wang Laoshi is definitely one of the greatest parts of taking CHNS 152. She is brilliant and passionate and knows the material very well. However, I wish there could be more speaking practice. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of this course include teacher engagement and amount of vocabulary that could be learned. Weaknesses of the class include unknown expectations, emphasis on vocabulary over content, and amount of information that had to be crammed. This could be improved by making expectations clearer, like posting assignment grades on canvas, ensuring that vocabulary is used to strengthen writing rather than be a means to an end, and giving more review assignments as practice. ",
            "\u00a0There was a lot of emphasis on grammar and writing, which was really helpful. The projects were also incredibly fun and I was able to utilize my new knowledge in a unique way. However, I do wish the students were able to speak more, so maybe more presentations could be helpful in the future. It also felt that we were learning everything at a very fast pace sometimes, so it was a little difficult to absorb it all. If we could meet more than 3x in a week, I think it would be really helpful. "

            "\u00a0Yes! This class is great and so is Prof. Wang! ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend taking this course with Wang Laoshi! She is a very good teacher and cares greatly about her students. You'll find the class to be fun and rewarding, while simultaneously being challenging enough for you to improve your Chinese. My family and other relatives complimented me for my improvement in my speaking, and after you take this course, I'm sure yours will for you too! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I would recommend this class to other students because I felt like this class was a good intro class into Chinese coming from AP Chinese. How the course was taught was well planned. The book we used slowly implement longer and longer passages and at the end it was a very long reading, but since its split into chunks, instead of the whole reading every night it was manageable. ",
            "\u00a0YES! Absolutely. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this class to other students because it was a strictly memorization-based class that lacked any creativity. In situations where creativity could have existed, creativity was replaced with mundane memorization of vocabulary and sentence structures, and it was very hard to find motivation to study. This is because it is easy to forget what was crammed rather than absorbed, and it's not a good feeling when you go on and do other things, knowing that you will eventually forget most of what you crammed in a semester. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you want to become a stronger writer and speaker in Mandarin, this is the class for you! All of the lessons were well-organized and engaging. "
