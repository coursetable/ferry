            "\u00a0I grew more confident in analyzing Middle English works, and I gained a deep appreciation for the poems that we read and the imagination that went into them. "

        [
            "\u00a0I think that we spent enough time on each poem, and I liked that we were able to write protocols and reflect on what we read. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided the opportunity to read and engage with a poet that undergraduates otherwise wouldn't encounter. Graduate students did typically take the lead in discussion, but Professor Brantley did a nice job bringing the undergrads into the conversation as well, and hearing the grads' thoughts was very helpful as I formed my own ideas about the poems. The prospectuses were also a really nice way to dive into the poems: much more in-depth than a reading response, but not as formal as a lengthy paper. ",
            "\u00a0This course is excellent. The breadth of assignments, from protocols/reading responses to a bibliography project to a final research paper, enables students to practice all the skills crucial for literary scholarship -- research, close reading analysis, writing both for presentation and for the page. The syllabus is also phenomenal. I thought the reading each week was manageable -- but still challenging -- and I very much appreciated reading criticism each week along with our primary text. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It gave me the opportunity to read poems that I may never had read. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to a student interested in medieval literature. The language is somewhat more challenging than Chaucer, but the course is well-paced, so it shouldn't be too much trouble. I really enjoyed reading all the works of the Gawain poet, and I'm very glad to have had the chance to think and write about them. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely. This course is a fantastic study of an incredible Middle English manuscript, which has inspired decades of scholarship but still holds a rich reservoir of potential analysis. This course empowers students to improve their English skills in several crucial ways. You will come away from the course a much better reader, writer, thinker -- and likely with a newfound appreciation for Middle English literature. "
