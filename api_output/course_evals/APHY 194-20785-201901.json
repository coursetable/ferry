I really enjoyed the structure of this course. Any weaknesses would have to be professor specific -- Professor Cao frequently got confused in class or had to go back on her previous examples to fix things, which was a little confusing. If she could be more focused on her examples and teaching, that would alleviate a lot of student confusion. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Tests were fair and the TA's were very helpful\r\nWeaknesses: class was not helpful and the final was too difficult for there to not be a curve, especially since it's worth 40% of the overall grade. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very poorly taught. Professor Cao is definitely the courses major weakness. Her lectures were hard to follow, generated several confused questions in class, and in trying to answer those questions she often prompted even more. Often she would run late and only just introduce topics covered on that week's pset. I had to do most of my learning by just reading the text book, and she did a horrible job preparing the class for the partial differential equations on the final. ",
            "\u00a0The only positive thing I have to say for this course was that the material was fairly interesting and I liked how it built up over the course of the semester.  As for the class, lecture was not helpful, and I often found myself confused with the material.  A more engaging and clear lecture would benefit students taking this course. ",

",

            "\u00a0The first two midterms were pretty representative of the homework and what was taught in the class. Final was very difficult for most people in the class and was representative of 40% of the semester grade. Two questions on the final (hardest ones) were worth 50% of its points.  Should change the point distribution of the final to be more representative of the class. Especially since it's not typically curved. ",

            "\u00a0The lectures themselves were almost exactly the same as the textbook, which is why much of the class stopped coming to lecture. The further problem remained in the fact that the textbook was poorly organized to facilitate learning. There was very little explanation of why we were using any given method or what the goal of each lecture was. In many cases, we simply jumped into an example problem without knowing what we were trying to do. While Professor Cao did a very very good job of responding to questions, she was simply unaware of students as she ran through the example problems which was not useful in engaging students. ",
            "\u00a0There are no strengths to this course, except maybe the optional TA office hours offered on Tuesday and Wednesdays from 7-9pm where we could work on our Psets and receive guidance from the TAs. Other than that, this course only had weaknesses. The information was taught extremely fast in the most complicated manner. I would have to self teach myself everything and found youtube to be a MUCH better explainer than Hui ever was. Her accent also makes it difficult to understand, in additon to her hand writing. I often found myself in class completely lost, having NO idea what was going on... literally no idea. The information is conveyed so poorly- this class was awful. ",
            "\u00a0There were no strengths of this course, aside from the fact that you do end up teaching yourself the material, and it satisfies a major requirement.\r\n\r\nIt had many, many weaknesses. Above all, it was taught even more poorly than I even thought was possible. The lectures were disorganized and error-laden, the class notes were messy and undecipherable, and the content was not properly relayed from the textbook. This was easily evident in that, in a class of around 80 people, fewer than 20 would show up to each lecture because even purely reading the textbook was more effective than going to class.\r\n\r\nThe most important weakness was in how poorly the class was set up for grading. Before the final exam, there was essentially no grade distribution. The mean on every problem set was above a 95 and the mean on both midterm exams was around 90% (with the mode on each exam being at or near 100%). Objectively, the midterms and problem sets' grading was far too easy. Then, the final exam was in an entirely different ballpark with difficulty. The exam was longer and more difficult, with an average in the mid-60%s. This exam was an odd wakeup call, shoved unceremoniously at students at the start of finals period with no prior warning (not to mention, zero practice questions or practice exam posted anywhere). So, essentially the entire distribution was based on this final exam, worth 40% of the overall grade. Honestly, it is hard to imagine a worse class at Yale or anywhere else. I am disappointed that such a class would be \"taught\" at an institution that supposedly prides itself on world-class and unparalleled teaching and learning. ",
            "\u00a0This class is basically like a high school class in that you don't have to listen in class, the homework is basic, and the tests are easy. The TAs and teacher are not good at teaching, but definitely are trying. The final is impossibly hard and does not reflect any other material in the class. ",
            "\u00a0This is mostly a very good course, with fair midterms and psets. However, the final was beyond a fair difficulty level (the average was 65) and the professor's lectures were not very clear. ",
            "\u00a0The professor was a bit unclear with her teaching, but the problem sets were very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0This course was poorly taught and overall was a very weak course. The lectures were hectic, too fast to follow, and dulled us all out of our minds. The beauty of differential equations was completely lost under a jumble of notation and mathematical tricks leaving us lacking in conceptual understanding but knowing how to manipulate symbols. The course was extremely easy to do well in up until the final. So many people had 100s at that point or close to. Then the final came out of no where and was incredibly hard compared to the rest of the course which was very unfair as many of us thought we were prepared. And then there was no opportunity to learn from our mistakes because the course had ended. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were often hard to followTA lectures during review sessions and working on psets was how I actually learned the material. The final being worth 40% with no curve but ten times more difficulty than the two midterms made 0 sense. ",
            "\u00a0The problems we were given strongly facilitated learning of the topics. The problems on the final were far harder than homework problems however. Weaknesses were the teaching - I learned nothing from the style of teaching. We needed to do more problems as a class, and more difficult ones. ",
            "\u00a0I thought it was not taught very clearly in lecture and that the lecture notes were difficult to follow. The TAs of the course were excellent. ",
            "\u00a0The major weakness of this course was the disparity between the difficulty of the midterms and final exam. The averages on the midterms were in the mid 90s, but the average on the final was a 64%. And nothing was curved accordingly. This seems kind of ridiculous that the tests were so vastly different in difficulty. There should be more clarity as to what is expected on the exams, especially the final. \r\n\r\nThe psets in this class were fine and good practice of the material. The office hours with the TAs were the true gems and helped many students succeed. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are the Teaching Fellows and their review sessions. The weaknesses are the lack of engagement and at times confusing teaching style. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Hui Cao could have done a much better job in engaging her students and explaining the material. The course would have been very engaging if the differential equations were explained in context in terms of applying them in real-life situations, but all Professor Cao did was copy her handwritten notes on a tablet that projected to the screen, while explaining each line. It would have been much more helpful if she explained better or explained some physics/engineering concepts in context (after all, it is ENAS). It may be partly due to her accent/language barrier as well. "

            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to another student. It teaches you the basics of things but I mostly learned on my own or through TAs. Most people don't show up to lecture because they realized it didn't help, but I went and was always confused. The workload is okay but I recommend a course that is more rewarding academically and better taught. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. It gave me a foundation in differential equations that I feel fairly confident in, and that I have already started applying to some of my other classes, such as upper level physics. Additionally, the class really isn't too difficult -- the mode on both of our midterms was 100%, and the medians were in the 90s for both as well. You get to drop your three lowest problem set grades, which is really generous. Because of this, the class isn't curved, but it works out because of how easy exams are/generous the problem set grading is. You have a problem set every week, which covers exactly what you're going over in class, and there are two 2-hour study halls offered every week where the TAs will help you work through literally every homework problem. The material also isn't that difficult, and if you are an astrophysics or physics major looking for a class in differential equations, this is much better than Physics 301 from what I've heard. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course. It was very boring and not lessons in class made no sense. We were told up front that we would not learn why equations work because there wasn't enough time for that so instead, we were just told equations and had to memorize them without understanding why they work. I pretty much taught myself everything with the textbook because classes weren't very insightful. ",

As long as you have the steps clearly explained to you, its only a matter of implementing them into the more complex problems. But without that concrete understanding, you can get stuck very quickly. I would recommend this class to any student but not with professor Cao. Cao did not provide that aforementioned clarity thats SO imperative to understanding diff \r\neqs well. If you have the option to take it a different semester, do so. But if not, make sure you seek out the resources needed to understand the methodology of Laplace theorem, separation of variables, etc. Nick Bender was a phenomenal TF and a great example of how an instructor can really change the way you understand things. But outside of him, I had to rely heavily on outside online resources because prof Caos lectures were just not clear enough.

The ENAS math courses are supposed to be better than the regular MATH courses because they're more applied and therefore more interesting to engineering majors generally, but this course was just one of the worst I've taken at Yale.
