Lectures are a nice supplement and the personal anecdotes help contextualize the law into practical applications.\r\n\r\nWould appreciate more mini assignments throughout the semester instead of one final that comprises the majority of the grade for the class.

The reading was a big strength, but obviously the lectures were more important. Prof. Elliott was would point us to the most relevant sections of the readings and expound on the topics that are most current/matter most. Stories about his personal experiences were especially insightful. If I had to pick a weakness I would say there could be more chances for participation, but at the same time the professor would keep things on topic whereas students like to steer things towards their particular interests that have less relevance for the rest of the class. ",

This made our course discussions somewhat boring; the same few students continued to have 75% of the questions and comments, because everyone else either had no idea what was going on, or no desire to chime in. ",

Lecture powerpoints could be used to underline key concepts that may be missed in class because the course proceeds at a very fast pace. ",

It would be good to get some hypothetical cases or something of the like and think through how cases actually play out in a way that we might experience in our career. The course should focus more on 2018 and a little less on 1990. ",
            "\u00a0The course was almost a review of the history of environmental law, rather than a look forward. It was useful to learn how laws were developed and amended in the past. I think it would've been more useful to include a look forward by including more information about current legislation, proposed legislation, and climate change considerations. The course was a three-hour lecture for one day a week with no assignments, which might not be the best approach to learning for some students. "

            "\u00a0I would say that if you are determined to get a lot out of the class that you should make an effort to do all of the readings that were assigned. Professor Elliott will go over material covered in the reading assignments- if I didn't read, I think I would've been a little lost during his lectures. His lectures are somewhat unstructured and a little bit rambling (especially because there was only one lecture for three hours on Monday morning), so make an effort to pay attention for the lecture, take notes, and review the notes you take after class for the material to really sink in.
