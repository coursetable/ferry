            "\u00a0The course completely redefined how I think about history. It made me think about history through the viewpoints of the people living in it. ",
            "\u00a0we learned how to analyze artwork, and how art yields commentary on social and political history. ",
            "\u00a0I honed my writing skills a great deal. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt so much about early modern England!! It was really interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Very specific factual knowledge of early modern England as well as the theoretical frame with which to consider how the concepts of both time and place impact the way that history was formed and how it is studied. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Strengths-Great integration of visual pieces and a wide array of evidence materials. Really is engaging through different media uses. ",
            "\u00a0This course is an incredible opportunity to use the resources at the YCBA and be taught by one Yale's most eminent and renowned social historians. If you are interested in art or England take it! ",
            "\u00a0I thought this class was very strong in that it provided students with new learning opportunities through physical art. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: great teacher, super interesting material, not too much work, you can really make the course your own and write about anything you want from a day at home in early modern England to naval ships or landscaped gardens\r\nWeaknesses: the readings are tedious, but no one does them anyway ",
            "\u00a0Interesting readings and a well-led seminar. The course is solid all the way around, and I dont know how it would be improved. "

        [
            "\u00a0Yes! Take it! even if you have no background in English history, it is a great course and expands how you think about history and your own day to day life. ",
            "\u00a0This course is an incredible opportunity to use the resources at the YCBA and be taught by one Yale's most eminent and renowned social historians. If you are interested in art or England take it! It's also very accessible to students with no art background, but you may get more out of it if you have some familiarity with English history. Our class met almost always at the YCBA, and we had the chance to look at paintings and visual imagery at the end. Highly recommend! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely - new and fresh approach to learning. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this course!!!!!!!!! The teacher is fantastic, and the topics you look at are really, really interesting. ",
            "\u00a0yes, lots of creative power for assignments which was nice for a change ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The course is incredibly interesting and truly a fun one. ",
            "\u00a0This course would best suit somebody that is actually interested in the subject, time period, English history overall, or an interest in how art can be interpreted. If you find yourself taking the class without one of those reasons, then the seminar can become tedious. "
