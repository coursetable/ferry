            "\u00a0I now know a ton of really complicated Spanish grammar that I will never use again. But to be a little nicer, I would say I'm better at speaking in Spanish and comprehending it. ",
            "\u00a0Developed my ability to speak and comprehend the spanish language. ",
            "\u00a0Speaking, writing and reading Spanish! ",
            "\u00a0Great comprehensive outline of the language. Emphasis on mechanics and grammar. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to be more fluent in Spanish and a lot of grammar. ",
            "\u00a0Improved Spanish writing, reading, and speaking skills. Learned about some aspects of Latin American culture and how to analyze Spanish literature. ",
            "\u00a0Proficiency in speaking, reading, listening, and writing in spanish. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my Spanish speaking and writing ability to the point where I can basically translate anything I want to say into Spanish (unless i just don't know some specific vocabulary). ",
            "\u00a0Completely broadened my spanish vocab, grammar, and general ability to be able to speak the language. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a better understanding of spanish as it is spoken rather than written or academically studied. I also just had a good time in this course because it focused less on constantly studying vocab and grammar and more and performing skits and talking to each other. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a much greater proficiency in speaking and writing in Spanish - so much so, that I am studying abroad to earn my L5 credit this summer! I also gained a greater appreciation of Hispanic culture and music. ",
            "\u00a0Through this course we successfully developed skills in oral and written Spanish communication, fluency, and literacy. This course encouraged us to develop our facility with the Spanish language in conjunction with our critical thinking skills through analysis of Spanish and Latin American essays, poetry, movies, songs, and art. Thought this process we hence also gained a broader introduction to Spanish and Latin American culture and history. "

            "\u00a0I've talked to native Spanish speakers and they say that they never use this advanced of grammar. I much rather would have had a class where I could improve my conversational Spanish. However there were some fun oral activities. ",
            "\u00a0It is very easy to get overwhelmed by the work load if you ignore it but You learn a lot ",
            "\u00a0It is a LOT of work all the time. Homework should be reduced to every other day. ",
            "\u00a0The class meets everyday so that one is constantly using and engaging their Spanish knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0I think the strengths are the structure of the course allows to learn Spanish very well. The weakness is that it is way too intensive. ",
            "\u00a0I think this class is a good way to improve spanish skills but more activities such as the gallery or other activities outside the classroom would be beneficial. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very well structured in a reasonable timeline and easy to follow, but I feel like the vocabulary I learned was not as useful as it could have been since it's mostly just straight from the textbook. ",
            "\u00a0Well organised, every lesson was well timed, much more lively and engaging than L3 ",
            "\u00a0Lots of busywork and weird activities in class, readings were also pretty strange. Class was very speaking heavy, which definitely improved my speaking ability but might have also been at the expense of my writing. ",
            "\u00a0I felt that the readings were strong, but that towards the end of the year the shear number of assignments made it impossible to actually study or enjoy the material. I would like to see this course made more literature and reading heavy and have the grammar incorporated through a study of Spanish history or literature. ",
            "\u00a0One major strength is that the course addresses the Spanish languages from all angles - reading, writing, speaking, and culture - in a way that's not incredibly monotonous or boring. I cannot think of any weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0There were many more strengths to this course than there were weaknesses. I believe we already submitted feedback in hard-copy form, but overall I had a very positive learning experience with how the course was structured. I very much appreciated the even distribution of different types of learning opportunities, including the required readings, the grammar-related homework, the vocabulary, the compositions, the oral presentations, and of course the quizzes and exams. Personally, I felt like having many different types of assignments made me feel less pressured about each individual one and more focused on learning in general. Having class every day of the week was also helpful because I know that consistent, focused, and high-volume immersion is critical to truly learning a new language. "

            "\u00a0If you like Spanish you will probably like this. If you have to take it you kind of don't have a choice so just make sure you get a good proffessor. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was fun and kept me engaged. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it to finish a language requirement. ",

            "\u00a0only if you need it ",

            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to any student looking to further improve in the Spanish language. I think it's a critical course i gaining proficiency, since the course requires so much oral communication. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I highly recommend this course, especially if you are interested in actually learning and improving your fluency with Spanish. If you are not interested in the learning and mostly just need to get a requirement out of the way it might be a little less fun, but if you come in with the right attitude and you aren't afraid to make mistakes then you'll have a great experience.
