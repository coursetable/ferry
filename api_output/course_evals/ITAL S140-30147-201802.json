            "\u00a0This course bettered my skills in the Italian language and was a continuation of my academic progress throughout this year (and summer). We studied grammar, vocabulary, and some culture. This course solidified my understanding of basic grammatical structures in the language and allowed me to reach a comfortable level for communicating with others in Italian. This course explored more challenging concepts and structures, but also reviewed ideas we learned through L1 and L2, and helped to advance my skills. ",
            "\u00a0My Italian was greatly improved in this course with Simona and Giovanni. It was mostly review of what we learned in L1/2. ",
            "\u00a0I completely developed my proficiency in the Italian language and became more confident in my writing and speaking. ",
            "\u00a0I was able to improve my Italian dramatically. Not only did I learn the grammatical side of the language, I also managed to improve my conversational Italian. ",
            "\u00a0As with the L3 course, I learned how to speak Italian without having to translate everything in my head first. ",
            "\u00a0Learned Italian and the culture in Italy. ",
            "\u00a0I became much more proficient in Italian and grew to love the language. I was able to practice in daily life what I learned in the class and became sort of a real Italian, living with a host family and such. ",
            "\u00a0Full fluency in Italian ",
            "\u00a0By taking this course, I further developed communication skills and improved my grammar in the Italian language. In this course also strengthened my written Italian and comprehension. This process was aided by the intensive, immersive aspect of the course as well. ",
            "\u00a0i got a lot better at italian "

            "\u00a0The structure of the course strongly facilitated learning and was very organized. Lessons we long and on the daily, but the demand to speak for a least a few hours a day helped to advance my skills in the best manner possible. The amount of homework was overwhelming for a summer abroad and a lighter-load would have allowed for a more enjoyable international experience, however I belief the homework was helpful for our studies. The course was designed to be taught by two professors and I really appreciated the class time being split between them. This switch created a different feel in the classroom and was helpful for maintaining focus for such a longtime. ",
            "\u00a0This class was very well organized and taught. I would only change one thing and that would be to reduce the amount of online workbook assignments before tests and instead add more review sheets for us to do by hand similar to those in class since they are more clear and similar to the test format. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the structure of having two instructors, as it broke up the 3 hours of class time, but I wish it could have been more of a seminar-style. ",
            "\u00a0It was very engaging all throughout the term. Not only did the professors help with the material, but they were able to answer questions that may not have been included in the textbook but still pertained to the class. ",
            "\u00a0Like the L3 course, the only weakness I could think of was the online workbook and one or two mistakes in the textbook. ",
            "\u00a0I really loved almost everything about the course. The exercises were helpful, the teaching was great, and I feel like I really cemented in my mind what I had learned during the past year in Italian L1 and L2. I also really enjoyed the essays and \"zibaldoni\", which helped me remember my time in Italy even as I grew more familiar with vocabulary and how things are said in Italian (idioms, uses of words, etc.). The detailed corrections were incredibly helpful. We also, even though this was not the culture class, were immersed in the culture to an extent through Italian music, the reading of Bocaccio, etc. I did dislike the online workbook: not only is it extremely expensive, but it is not nearly as helpful as the pen-and-paper exercises we do, which we check in class. With these latter we have the chance to ask questions about what we don't understand, while with the online workbook you are left in the lurch. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: met every day, good environment ",
            "\u00a0The course was well-organized and structured so the class was very informative and interactive. Although class was lengthy, the structure kept me engaged. As it progressed, so did the ease in speaking and writing the language, but there was always more to learn. ",
            "\u00a0Fast learning but fortunately not a lot of homework because class time was long "

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! The course is not easy, but the work put in is worth it! I feel proud with my skills in Italian and am so impressed by how effectively and quickly I have learned the language! The Italian program at Yale is incredible and all the professors are amazing - especially Simona and Giovanni - and you cannot go wrong with studying the beautiful language! This course in particular allowed me to travel abroad for the first time and opened the gates to new relationships and experiences! ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely! Doing this course in the summer is a fantastic way to get credits for language requirements while also exploring a new place. It forces you to talk in Italian which only benefits your learning. Simona and Giovanni are excellent professors and are very helpful if there is any confusion. ",
            "\u00a0This class was so helpful in improving my language skills and the instructors were kind and understanding throughout the process. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was a great class taught by great professors. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course was absolutely incredible for my Italian language development and gave me the confidence to speak in restaurants or strangers when necessary without fearing not being able to communicate. ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely! Life changing! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. It is a great way to learn Italian while having an unforgettable experience in Italy. You are surrounded by beauty in the language and the scenery and you become a part of that world. I also think that the L3/L4 course in Siena that I took was better than what I have heard about the L1/L2 course. We learned everything at a very manageable pace and had a chance to cement everything with practice and exercises, whereas the other program seemed rushed and less well-arranged. Also, when we arrived in Italy we were able to communicate with our host family and other Italians in a way the L1/L2 students could not. Anyway, I would like to stress how much of an incredible experience it is to be able immediately to use in daily life what you learn in the classroom, and I highly recommend the L3/4 Summer Session in Siena. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I completed this class and left with full fluency in Italian, which I was able to test in conversation with Italians ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It was very good and I learned a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course if you are planning on taking the intensive L3-L4 as the program in Siena was enjoyable. Moreover, this course begins to focus on other aspects, like culture and literature, which are aided by grammar comprehension. "
