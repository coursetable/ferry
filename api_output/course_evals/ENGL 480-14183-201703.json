            "\u00a0I learned SO MUCH in this course. I learned how to write better, how to interview better, how to think about topics and pitching stories, how to take creative risks--the list goes on. It pushed me to think about \"journalism\" differently, and why it matters, and how to do it well. ",
            "\u00a0The skills taught in this course are exactly as the course title suggests. You truly learn how to report and craft a longform narrative, from the very early stages of reporting (sending emails to sources, interview skills, finding the right people to guide you to your story) to the final stages of crafting (conceptualizing structure, \"greening\" the article so that it's concise while still stylistic.) This course teaches an appreciation for the medium of longform through the incredible readings assigned and the rich stories that students bring to the table with their own projects. You also learn editing skills that help you with your own writing in the workshops, which require students to give detailed feedback to each other on drafts of articles. As a result, everyone has an investment in each others' stories and wants to see the articles turn into their best versions. ",
            "\u00a0As was promised by the course title, I came away from the course with a much, much better understanding of how to come up with, report, structure, write, and pitch a piece of long-form narrative journalism. ",
            "\u00a0This class was such a gift. I learned so much about one of the most confusing, elusive parts of journalism: the seam between good reporting and good writing. That area is rarely taught, and this course filled that crucial hole at Yale. I improved in my reporting instincts by understanding more deeply what kind of reporting is necessary to good writinginfinite details, open reporting that can bring your subjects somewhat into the writing process, artifacts, enough information to make judgements about opposing viewpoints. I also learned how to *green* and reduce the size of my pieces, which is never not worth it. ",
            "\u00a0I've developed a much more sophisticated sense of structure and style. I have tools to source a wide variety of articles in creative ways, and I have become a much better interviewer -- more comfortable, better at asking questions, more spontaneous. By responding to my peers' workshop drafts, I became a more attentive reader -- better at diagnosing problems and suggesting creative solutions. It sounds cheesy, but I'm braver, now, and more confident in my own abilities. Perhaps more important than the skills I learned, from ideation to revision, is the lesson that nothing, really, is beyond my reach as a journalist. Some things are, like access to super-famous people, but you don't need that to write a great article. Sourcing takes ingenuity and determination, not necessarily connections or experience, which I learned from listening to Prof. Stillman talk about her own experience, and from reading the products of my peers' incredible investigations. This class opened up a world of possibilities for me! ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to craft compelling long pieces of reportage. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much by reading great long-form work, by professionals and classmates, about how an outstanding piece is structured. ",
            "\u00a0I always looked forward to reading in-depth long-form pieces for class because they were like treasure troves of knowledge and beautiful things. I learned about harnessing pronouns (they/you/I/we) and verb tense (past/present/future) through discussion of The Really Big One by Kathryn Schulz. I learned about online forums parallel to the Talmud and how themes can be used as underlying narrative structure when we talked about The Darker Side of Aaron Swartz by Larissa MacFarquhar. While reading Underworld, I was in awe of how Jeanne Marie-Laskas brought the world of coal miners to life--her usage of her voice and the placement of the heart of her piece helped push me towards a more specific direction for my own writing assignment. Almost immediately after I received tips about interviewing, I was able to apply those best practices in my interviews for my piece. Through weekly responses to my classmates writing, I learned what was important structurally and narratively for a polished, engaging, and moving piece of nonfiction writing. Through a class trip to the New Yorker, I learned from Jia Tolentino to be sensitive to readers who may not be on my side (politically, opinion-wise, argumentatively) and to include counterarguments and different facets of the topic I am covering.

            "\u00a0This was an incredible course, and I learned so much, both from the professor and from other students (since we work-shopped the drafts of our essays). I think viewing the other students as people to learn from made the class more intimate and suited to a really unique learning experience. I don't think it needs to be improved--it was great. ",
            "\u00a0I loved everything about this course. The one thing I would advise students who are interested in taking it is that they should be ready to dive into independent reporting projects and have to hold themselves accountable to their own unofficial deadlines in order to meet the final deadlines. The seminar itself is so much fun and extremely enlightening, but it does only meet once a week, and the reporting assignments require nearly daily work for months. That should not deter anyone though; Professor Stillman makes herself available to answer questions via phone and in-person meetings outside of class should you seek them. She is extremely dedicated to her students' personal and journalistic development through the course, and you couldn't ask for more from a professor. ",
            "\u00a0One possible improvement for the course (though I'm not at all sure about this) would be to change the structure so that students write one narrative piece  preceded by a few shorter writing and reporting exercises  rather than two 4,000-word pieces. I certainly felt I didn't have quite enough time to produce a second piece in which I could take as much pride as I did in my first one, and I spoke with a couple classmates who felt the same. That said, I thought some of the final drafts of the second pieces were fantastic  even better than the final drafts of the same students' reconstructions. So I'm not sure I recommend changing the course assignments. Just something to consider. ",
            "\u00a0Like other intense Yale writing classes, this one is strong because of its format. It forces students to put time and work into reported pieces that then can be edited and workshopped by peers. What more can you ask for!! Sarah Stillman, though, is one of a kind: She brings an unfathomable amount of knowledge, instinct, and warmth to the classroom that results in an environment people want to put time into. The comments she gave us on our piecesfour big rounds of comments in total, plus in-person meetingsconsistently blew my mind in their depth. All of this makes the work done in 480 feel like much more than homework. While writing my pieces and preparing my comments for others, I felt like I was doing work that will contribute, even in small ways, to the rest of my life (but maybe that has to do w/ the fact that I want to be a journalist...). \r\n\r\nThe only weaknesses are that this format is also an insane amount of work. I'm not sure how to solve this problem, other than to recommend the *possibility* of only having students write one piece. If not that, I wish there were an easier way for students in journalism classes to get funding / reimbursements from Yale or YJI for reporting expenses, since delivering top-notch work can also sometimes mean spending money on transportation or putting a lot of extra time into making friends with someone who has a car. ",
            "\u00a0For the first time in a workshop, I felt the time we spent critiquing professional works was extremely useful, efficient, and constructive. Analyzing the structure of published works helped tremendously in teaching me how to think about constructing a long-form article. I will continue to return to the works we read as I take on new writing projects. \r\n\r\nI think it would be possible to get off to a quicker start at the beginning of the term without significantly cutting down on time spent critiquing published works. I think the first class should be spent on the syllabus, introductions, and favorite lede + article (because it's an application-only class, it would be possible to send out that assignment beforehand. Waitlisted students could get a pass, or do it regardless of the final decision). That way, the second class could be devoted to ideation. I would have been fine with a heavier reading load at the beginning, before we started sourcing our own pieces. Readings could be added to give us a better sense of what sorts of articles we could write. Then the proposal could be due a bit earlier -- potentially enabling everything to get pushed forward a week, and allowing for more time in the second round of workshops, which felt much more crunched than the first. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Stillman is incredible. ",
            "\u00a0The course is fantastic: the workload is just right, the feedback is incredibly helpful. Each reading was excellent and every class was a joy. \r\n\r\nThe two 4,000-word pieces are fun to write but a lot for one semester so combining the assignments or creating one longer one could work next year. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Stillmans Long-Form Narrative class propelled me to pursue what am I curious about and care about. This course is extremely well thought out and executed to facilitate collaborative learning. We read from a really wide range of long form pieces and always came up with our own lists and diagrams to understand and concretely improve the process of reporting, interviewing, and writing. Before student pieces were being workshopped, we discussed a general approach for workshop and those ground rules helped facilitate really helpful and insightful comments that dealt with broad themes and minutiae and everything that had to do with the piece. I was struck by her in-class exercise to trim words from a speech from over a century ago. I was awed by my classmates solutions, and I became more aware of the importance of every word in a narrative, but also the ways in which trimming can improve a piece of writing. \r\n\r\n\r\nI really loved the writing in-class exercises and tips about craft, and Id love to see more of them! Professor Stillman supplemented our course reader with handouts from Telling True Stories, a book she introduced on the first day of class and excerpted for us throughout the semester. Especially when I was stuck for ideas, as I often was, I would flip through Telling True Stories and mull over all the advice from Nora Ephron or Tom Wolfe about how to tell a story as if youre writing for the screen or if youre a documentary filmmaker. I really appreciated being able to refer to these theories on nonfiction. In the future, perhaps each week there could be included in the reading an essay or two about craft. Telling True Stories is a fount of wonderful advice and thoughts, and John McPhees Draft #4 On the Writing Process also has been helpful! "

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone. It isn't easy--there's a lot of (very interesting) reading, and the assignments are two major, in-depth reported essays. But Prof. Stillman is one of the best professors I've had at Yale, and I really felt lucky to learn from her, because she was so committed to work with us to improve our writing and reporting. I think it's rare at Yale to have a professor who's so deeply invested in students' work, but it makes a huge difference. As a result, I learned a lot and feel I my writing improved a great deal, and I'm much more confident in my writing. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take it. For anyone really interested in improving their storytelling, journalistic and creative writing abilities, this is the best class for you. ",
            "\u00a0This was, without a doubt, the best course I've taken at Yale. It's the only class I've taken that I can say was legitimately inspiring. If you can, take it. Professor Stillman has so, so much to teach about both writing and reporting. She cultivates a classroom environment that is at once comfortable and challenging, inviting and rigorous. Despite being in New Haven only once a week, she (somehow) managed to devote more time and care to her students than any other professor I've had. Whether you consider yourself a journalist, a fiction writer, a poet, a playwright, a writer of all genres, or a writer of no genres, I cannot recommend this course highly enough. ",
            "\u00a0100%, no questions. This is the more holistic, comprehensive journalism course at Yale, and the chance to work with Sarah Stillman is wild. Be ready to work very hard in your reporting, your writing, and your comments for your classmates, since that makes the class community feel much stronger. And be sure to think of ideas that are accomplishablesomewhat local, specific stories are both doable and more successful in the time frame of this class (and, I'd argue, in many other journalistic time frames). ",
            "\u00a0A million times yes! This course -- through the feedback of the best professor I've had and the best group of peers I've encountered together in a classroom -- has transformed my writing and thinking. I didn't expect my class in long-form, literary journalism to hone my logic skills more effectively than the logic class I took at the same time -- but it did! The atmosphere was always positive and incredibly constructive. I looked forward to class the moment I left it each week. You will grow so much as a writer, reader, thinker, speaker, and listener in this class! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. If youre serious about journalism, this is a must-take. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. ",
            "\u00a0If youve ever had a question about the world around you and want to explore it further, or you think you might, take Long Form Narrative with Professor Stillman!! This class deals with issues are relevant now and have been important to humanity over the ages, and Professor Stillman provides encouragement, guidance, and seemingly endless support throughout the whole reporting and writing process. She and the class are there with you when you are coming up with an idea, discussing best practices for interviewing, figuring out what is at the heart of your piece, and editing sentences and phrases. Professor Stillman cares so much about her students, and you can tell from the energy she devotes to preparing for each class and mediating the class discussion so it flows seamlessly. And the way she follows up on students writing with in-depth emails as well as line notes. This was my favorite class so far at Yale! "
