            "\u00a0I learned more about Russian literary and art culture and how it was influenced by history. The background reading in history was great for understanding the context for the primary sources and the readings were usually interesting. I learned how to discuss literature and tie it in to the culture we were learning about and experiencing. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a broad overview of Russian Culture and Literature. Exploring authors like Tolstoi to Gogol and Pushkin to Blok it was extremely rewarding as well as reading the texts in Russian as well. ",
            "\u00a0Learned more about russian language and culture ",
            "\u00a0there are many aspects of russian culture, being able to see things from a russian point of view ",
            "\u00a0I gained a little knowledge about Russian art history and St. Petersburg history ",
            "\u00a0A more complete understanding of Russian history and literature. "

            "\u00a0The course was amazing and interesting. There were few dull moments. It could be improved by spending less time on certain topics so we could cover it all. It also would have been great to discuss more of the historical context in class. ",
            "\u00a0The weakness is the discussion sections kind of being dry but the material was fascinating. ",
            "\u00a0lots of cool insights, but the discussions were long ",
            "\u00a0I think the discussions could be guided more effectively. The reading amounts could also be lowered. You can stay on top of them in New Haven but once you get to Russia its almost impossible to keep up and do well in your language class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The professor is kind and charismatic and understanding, and there is a lot of room to read everything and do everything and learn a TON if it really interests you\r\nWeaknesses: The class is completely nonstructured and the discussion is superficial. The readings are just too much! So not only does nobody do them, but the discussions on them end up being frustratingly superficial, and a lot of the bigger texts don't even get a mention in class. The readings should be diminished, the curriculum more structured, and students given a bigger incentive to do everythingas it is, a few dedicated students do too much and carry the discussions, while mostly everybody does very very little.

            "\u00a0Yes, this course is amazing and Professor Firtich is an incredible facilitator for discussions and extremely brilliant when it comes to this literature and art. These works are so important and I was lucky to has Professor Firtich to speak with about them. ",
            "\u00a0Yes especially if you want to take further courses in Russian culture, history, or literature. ",
            "\u00a0its required for the abroad program, so yes ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend the experience in Russia. And maybe if you really love Russian literature, I'd recommend taking this class as well and working as hard as possible to read all the texts and do everythingyou'll come out with an extremely rich knowledge of the subject and learn a ton. However, as a standalone course, no, I would not recommend this class. Not unless it's severely restructured and the readings lessened, with more assignments given throughout the summer to incentivize doing all the reading. "
