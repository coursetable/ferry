            "\u00a0I gained a great degree of familiarity with Euripides \"Orestes,\" as well as a basic sense of the forms of Greek Tragedy and poetic influence in Greek drama more generally. I also learned more about the nuances of Greek grammar, and about the uses of particles in Ancient Greek. ",
            "\u00a0Intensive review of greek grammar, syntax, and morphology by reading one of Euripides' plays in its entirety. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This is a great course. It is wonderful to focus so extensively on one play, to really get to know this particular, fascinating, complicated work. I would only wish that we could discuss the themes and motifs of the play more in seminar itself (though that may be hard to balance with translation of the actual Greek). ",
            "\u00a0I learned details about Greek grammar that I had not been exposed to in previous courses: the difference between the present and aorist imperative, for instance, or the historical development of the cryptosigmatic aorist. It was helpful to translate the whole passage in class, as it allowed me to see mistakes in my own translation that I would not have noticed otherwise; I wish, though, that we could have spent more time discussing the text. "

            "\u00a0I absolutely would recommend this course. This is a wonderful course for anyone who cares about literature or classics. Reading Euripides in Greek is an exhilarating experience, and the play itself is fascinating and compelling. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Interesting and Professor Bakker is very knowledgeable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes: this was a helpful refresher of Attic Greek grammar and syntax, which I desperately needed after a semester of reading Homer. My Greek certainly improved over the course of the semester. "
