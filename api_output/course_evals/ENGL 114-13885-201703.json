            "\u00a0This course was good practice for essay and research paper writing.  The readings made me think deeply about a lot of different topics and helped me process events in my own life. ",
            "\u00a0I can say with great certainty that this class both greatly improved my writing skills and helped me be able to read and discuss dense and challenging texts. ",
            "\u00a0I know this is a pretty long-winded course evaluation, and I also know that some of you are simply trying to see if a class is worth taking. So, if you don't want to read my ramblings let the takeaway of this be simply to TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU CAN BECAUSE IT WAS FANTASTIC.\r\n\r\nAllow me to preface this by saying I have never considered English nor writing one of my strong suits. I come from an extremely STEM focused household, so math classes have always been my preference.\r\n\r\nWhile this may be true, it has been in primarily English classes where I have had the most intellectually stimulating and enjoyable times learning, and this has been true for both high school and now in college because of this course. \r\n\r\nI like to believe that in high school, one of my favorite teachers essentially introduced me to the world of quality writing; I write now to tell you that Mr. Raccuglia is who I have to thank for *making* me a better writer.\r\n\r\nEnglish 114 with Mr. Raccuglia was my favorite course this semester. I went into the course thinking that it would simply be a course I was taking to fulfill distributional requirements, but what I left with is a profound new perspective on our subject (love) and immeasurable improvements to my writing quality.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge I gained by taking this course is difficult to describe, for it ranges from stylistic choices (like how many semicolons I use and why I should perhaps use a bit less) to ideas on the field of love (thanks to a wide selection of high quality sources Mr. Raccuglia had us read) to simply the knowledge of what college writing is like and how surprisingly fun writing can be.\r\n\r\nIn a similar vein, the skills I have developed by taking this course are equally invaluable and countless. I will highlight what I believe is the most important: the ability to evolve from high school level writing to college level writing. I can't thank Mr. Raccuglia enough for this skill, for it will be because of skills I developed in this class that I will be able to write persuasive grant proposals, fellowship applications, and research papers; what I have gained from this class is a springboard, a jumpstart, a clear advantage over students without my newfound skills.\r\n\r\nFinally, insights I have gained in English with Mr. Raccuglia are a bit easier to describe. There are two: the first, relevant to the course topic, is that love is a lie, there is no hope, and that really, one doesn't *find* love out in the world, one must *build* it. The second is that English isn't so frightening, as long as you have a quality teacher like Mr. Raccuglia and a willingness to listen to criticisms that can fuel critical revisions. In fact, and I can't believe it myself, this course has even given me doubts about STEM and tempts me to double major (or have as a singular major) in English.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I wish Mr. Raccuglia (and it has felt so absolutely strange to type Mr. Raccuglia as we normally just call him Peter) could continue to teach all the English courses I take at Yale, for he is an exemplary mentor, writing coach, and friend. \r\n\r\nNote: I have managed to only use two(!) semicolons in this entire writing; not bad -- wait... ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to structure a compelling paper in such a way as to draw in the reader. I also developed a lot of useful insight to the topic of love. I understand now that communication is a big part of the development of love, as well as the portrayal of love. Yet, I also realized that love is not meant to be defined; in fact, love thrives when it is unknown. ",
            "\u00a0I really learned how to write better papers and got to look at love in a number of ways. ",
            "\u00a0I think my writing improved throughout this course. \r\nI learned how to tackle denser and more challenging texts and how to construct an argument based off of a scholarly paper. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about developing coherent arguments, analyzing texts thoroughly, and connecting ideas from various authors. ",
            "\u00a0I became a much better writer in this class. I also developed skills that have helped me read thoughtfully and sift through readings to find the most relevant information for my paper. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to successfully think and write material. This class made me realize a whole different aspect to writing that i never knew before. ",
            "\u00a0I'm certain my writing abilities have improved over this course as a result of the mandatory one-on-one meetings with Peter after the submission of each paper and also through the class structure which included time for peer reviews. I also firmly believe that I'm walking away from this class with an improved ability to approach topics in cross-disciplinary ways. Finally, this class challenged me as no other has to think about and understand a source, not as something definitive that I must accept as complete and correct but, as something meant to facilitate the development of my own ideological understanding. ",
            "\u00a0I developed how to get more focused on a specific claim in a paper and not make my central idea too broad. "

            "\u00a0The course readings were good selections - challenging at times but manageable.  The class discussions at the beginning of the term were really engaging, but they got slightly less so towards the end of the semester.\r\nThe one-on-one conferences were helpful and the feedback was clear, but the actual grading of the papers took a long time (it would have been helpful to have some of the earlier papers back when writing the next paper so I could know if I was on the right track). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - Structure of the class is great and definitely facilitates discussion, which is what I enjoyed the most. I loved the texts that Peter selected, and he definitely gave us great feedback on our work which was nice.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Too much readings. Honestly, they were impossible to keep up with, and I know that most of the class did not complete at least part of the readings regularly. Also, he took over 2 months (until after we turned in our last paper) to return one of our papers, which really was not to our benefit since we could have used the feedback to improve our future works. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are well selected writings on the subject of love. In particular, I will always vividly remember one writing by Firestone that kept me nodding in agreement as I read along and saw many patterns I follow in my own love life! It really was incredible to read most of the essays, books, and writings Mr. Raccuglia provided, so I definitely have to say this was perhaps the strongest strength of this class.\r\n\r\nAnother great aspect of this class was the familiarity that Mr. Raccuglia, who I will now refer to as Peter because it is just getting way too weird typing Mr. Raccuglia, established immediately with the class. On the first day, he had us just call him Peter and we just talked about some things vaguely related to love to test the waters of how comfortable we were talking about such a sensitive subject -- although it was a little worrying when he writes down literally (and I am definitely using the word \"literally\" correctly here) everything you say. After that first day, Peter actively tried to engage every student and had all our names down by the second day, all the while encouraging us to do the same for each other. In addition to this, Peter had us write our own guidelines for how we felt an individual should be respected when they were presenting their idea or discussing a reading. All of this helped to foster a safe and reassuring learning environment that I can without a doubt say helped the class stay engaged and enjoy speaking.\r\n\r\nNow, in terms of essay revision and how the class made me a better writer, I'd say this strength came from Peter being a brilliant guy himself. The way he could pick apart the weaknesses of your essays so easily was scary. In fact, in the first few revisions I think Peter was a little scared to attack our essays in the hopes of preserving our feelings; we let him know quickly that we just wanted all of the terrible aspects of our writing, and boy did he let us know after that. The comments he makes are just invaluable, and when I make revisions based on them, I can see my paper getting better. It's that simple and straightforward.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, another strength of the class was the peer revisions sessions. We would take a day after a big submission to revise three to four of our classmates' papers and openly discuss them in class. Doing this helped because when you pick apart a classmate's paper, you can see the flaws in your own paper as well. For instance, if you see an argument you don't feel is substantiated enough, you might recall that you also made some pretty egregious claims, and will therefore go back to change it.\r\n\r\nFinally, the only weakness I can really think of for this class would be a stricter enforcement of class etiquette with computers. While there was a rule placed about three-fourths of the course in about no computers, they still appeared at times and you can tell when random YouTube videos play accidentally on speakers that some people aren't paying attention. This isn't really Peter's fault and I'm sure that whatever he (or for that matter, any teacher) does place down as a rule, we will find someway to get distracted anyway; however, it still would have probably been a little beneficial to the level of engagement by students to have some guidelines established about the use of computers/phones (also, I was guilty a few times too, so there aren't any innocents!). ",
            "\u00a0Nothing really wrong with it, but couldve used more time spent on peer review. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that the texts in this course were super interesting to read and our class discussions were thoughtful and engaging.  \r\nSometimes the texts were very challenging and I would have benefitted from a little more structure or background when reading them. \r\n\r\nPeter gave us so much in-depth feedback on all of our rough drafts and had one on one meetings with us for each one. \r\nAfter our discussions I felt very prepared to write a paper on the texts despite their level of intensity. \r\nI especially liked how much variety there was in our readings/discussions. We were all over the place in terms of fields, decades, and styles (even a field trip to the art gallery), so each class was different and new. ",
            "\u00a0The course was always interesting and the reading were equally enthralling. I enjoyed our first and last assignments. The second and third assignments were difficult in my opinion because they were too broad. Overall I think I learned a lot from this course an I also enjoyed it very much. ",
            "\u00a0Almost everything about the class I would consider to be a strength. Most of the readings that were assigned were very interesting and enjoyable. Peter also always gave very helpful feedback on papers and always seemed so engaged and excited about the material he was teaching. It was a really great course overall and I can't think of anything I didn't like about it. ",
            "\u00a0I feel as if this course was strong in the teaching and engagement, yet was weak in reading length and chose of reading. ",
            "\u00a0This class was practically perfect. The biggest complaint I have is that the discussion model felt slightly monotonous some days, but that was really only on days when class participation was abnormally low. Genuinely, I would not change much about this class. It was the best class I took this semester! ",
            "\u00a0I loved the discussions we had, but I feel that the papers could focus on even more of the readings. "

        [
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you want to work on your writing. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. The subject of the course is fascinating and very thought-provoking. I really enjoyed the class, and it was definitely my favorite this semester. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This course helped me not only made me a much better writer, but also helped me reconcile my own perspectives about love. I haven't talked much in this evaluation about the actual subject of this course, but I truly did learn a lot about love.\r\n\r\nWhile \"learning about love\" might not seem like something practical, there is so much that I can't describe without the context of the readings we used. For instance, the dichotomy of love is now something I'm cognizant of, thanks to one of the last readings we did which attributed meaning to every word associated with love, such as magic, heart, and embarrassment (A Lover's Discourse).\r\n\r\nYou WILL enjoy this class, the subject matter, and the readings no matter who you are. There will always be something in this class that you can latch onto and strongly identify with, whether it is online dating or the pursuit of a soulmate. TAKE THIS CLASS! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to another student because it was an excellent course that not only aided in the improvement of writing skills, but also was very interesting. The topic of love is something that everyone can relate to and it was great to look at readings and have your thoughts be presented to you by someone else in such eloquent ways. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. The texts we read were super interesting and varied. As a writing course, there was tons of feedback on our essays and Peter was really helpful throughout the whole process. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course as a writing class. I believe it was very enlightening. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was my favorite class I have taken so far. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because if one wants to write college level material, they must learn from individuals like Peter. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I'm stumbling to find the words necessary to portray how much I would recommend this class. I've improved as a student of Yale and a more generalized intellectual in ways that I feel incapable of articulating. It's a great class and, along with other things, it will accomplish its goal of making you a better writer. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is very interesting and engaging. "
