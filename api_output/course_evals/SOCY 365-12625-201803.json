            "\u00a0None. The value of this course lies on the readings and preparation for class, but not through the discussion. The professor is not engaging nor interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how the relationship between journalism and politics works and the sociological theory behind (mis)understanding. ",
            "\u00a0Really learned so much about how political news is made- from the historical context that have laid the foundation for the journalism we see today. Also learned about the sociological processes that govern interactions in public life and how this inherently leads to challenges in public communication. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to think about American politics through a lens of sociological concepts, which was new for me. I was not as confident as I would have liked to be in applying those concepts, however. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the techniques used by journalists to write stories, and the relationship between the media, the public, and political officials. ",
            "\u00a0A good combination of political science analysis and sociological analysis. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: i think we read some really interesting books (News At Work, Sociology of News) and I actually really liked the theory part of the course (though didn't enjoy it as much while I was reading it. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: wasn't necessary to watch that whole movie in class (could've been assigned as homework or optional movie screening), felt like the midterm prompt was hard to make an argument about. Wish it has focused more on how the relationship between politicians and journalists varied due to racial or gender bias. Found it strange that this topic didn't come up at all. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the readings, but I think it would have been better if the latter part of the course was taught in the beginning! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: INCREDIBLE PROF.- Mahler is such an engaging professor and I always looked forward to ending my week with his seminar. The assignments were relatively helpful and well connected to the things we discussed in class, and Mahler was always available for meetings. \r\n\r\nWeakness: none, best PLSC class I've taken. Prof. Mahler deserves a Teaching Prize! ",
            "\u00a0We were constantly behind, and I think a bit of the reading on journalism was either too basic or too repetitive. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the class was definitely the beginning of the course and the readings. They were super interesting. ",
            "\u00a0The topics were very interesting and most of the readings were very engaging. While I understand why Prof. Mahler couldn't address every political news drama over the course, it would have been nice to incorporate a bit more contemporary issues. Also, the seminar style class could have been used better to give more room for student input than guessing the \"right\" answer. "

        [
            "\u00a0I'd recommend this course if you are interested in news/politics. It was enjoyable but not my favorite class in the world. ",
            "\u00a0I would. You get some insight into the development of modern journalism and then, underpinning that, some sociological exploration into communication in general, in order to examine how we as people are able to share a world in common. This latter part is not advertised, so it can come across a jarring shift to some. Here, however, you do enter very interesting theoretical ground, with appeal beyond just Political Science. ",
            "\u00a0YES- no other class at Yale is more relevant to everyday life, especially in the increasingly politicized world we live in today. Students learn not only how to understand actors in the political and journalistic spheres but also how to unpack their own biases and engage more meaningfully with the world they live in. Literally the best class at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Mahler is great. "
