            "\u00a0This course is a robust training in contemporary theoretical issues in sociolinguistics. Professor Errington does not take fluff in his seminar, so you are really forced to critically engage with each and every author on the syllabus. As a foreign language student, this was a great supplement to my usual language study, and a useful lens to bring to my social studies major. "

            "\u00a0I would have appreciated more built-in steps for feedback on my research project, given that it and the vague \"seminar participation\" score constitute the entirety of one's grade. I frankly think that it is fair for undergraduates to expect some quantitative feedback at some point in the semester, given that many of us are, on some level, concerned with how our grades will look for graduate school. I truly have no idea what grade to expect when they come out, and that seems a little off. "

            "\u00a0Take this class if you are super passionate about a research topic that you come up with in the first two weeks of class. Definitely feel out the first couple weeks, though, to see if they match your expectations. I chose a research topic that was ultimately rather different from the content of the course, and Professor Errington demands a strong connection to the material, which is dense, philosophical, and theoretical.
