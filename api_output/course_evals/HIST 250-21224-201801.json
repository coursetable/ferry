            "\u00a0I gained insights of evaluating history through the lens of gender and sexuality, which is helps me to treat the subject more critically ",
            "\u00a0how to write better and put sources in conversation ",
            "\u00a0An overview of how the concept of gender has evolved at large in European society, as well as what women were up to in the past 250 years. ",
            "\u00a0This course was well-organized and insightful. Unlike learning about events in history from the usual perspective that largely focuses on male participants, we were able to grasp a greater understanding of historical contexts through a gender perspective. This perspective was often focused on how gender dynamics both developed and shifted social norms through different periods in time. That perspective then helped me to not only visualize how these dynamics continue to manifest and create gender inequalities, but also how important it is to look at history from multiple perspectives. The writing credit is also a helpful bonus. ",
            "\u00a0During this semester I learned:\r\n-how to improve my writing\r\n-why women position are positioned the way they are in history by evaluating the social construction of gender and sexuality\r\n-the different frameworks women have used to argue for the expansion of rights and liberties\r\n-and more importantly, the ramifications these arguments had on today's society and view of history ",
            "\u00a0I learned about how gender shaped historical themes and events as well as the historical ties between gender and race and gender and perceived social stability. Furthermore, I now have a better understanding of how gender dynamics in present society work/are limited by their origins. "

            "\u00a0The materials are all very interesting, but the lectures could be more organized. It would be helpful if the instructor could provide more structured slides as guidance and post them on canvas after each session. ",
            "\u00a0good ",
            "\u00a0The lectures and readings are both strong, and I very much appreciate that the readings were posted online. The only improvement I could think of is if the course was structured as two 50 minute lectures and a section, it would be better, rather than one long lecture and one short one. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that the material was the main strength of the course, and the professor was very invested in the course and engaging with students as well. I would have liked it if the lectures were more engaging (this might be mainly a student and not a professor issue), and for the visual aids to be more organized (like the PowerPoint presentations), especially for people who are not familiar with these often-complex contexts in history. ",
            "\u00a0The course material is very interesting, yet the lectures are very scattered. I would recommend taking notes without following the powerpoints as they do not follow the lecture. ",
            "\u00a0The material in this class was incredibly interesting. There is only one way that this class could be improved. It would have been nice to have the lecture slides posted more regularly throughout class. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this class because it provides a good introduction to gender studies and the syllabus is well-organized. ",
            "\u00a0yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this was a really fantastic course, and I learned a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. You get a decent overview of gender history in Europe, and the writing component of the class is fairly easy with only two 5 page papers and one final 7-10 page paper. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student who is willing to engage with and be open-minded about the material. This course can also be confusing if you do not like history or aren't very familiar with historical events, so if you are willing to escape that comfort level then, by all means, go for it! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to other students despite the fact that it was frustrating how scattered lectures were. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to another student! It is a great introductory history class and I learned so much about how gender dynamics of today have been shaped by the past. "
