            "\u00a0I learned about Feynman diagrams, fundamental particles, conservation properties, nuclear structure, and a bunch of other stuff! ",
            "\u00a0Learned basic particle physics. Mostly learned how much there is that we don't know. Good intro to the field ",
            "\u00a0This course is mostly a survey course of particle and nuclear physics. We studied Rutherford scattering, nuclear models, the weak and strong interactions, conservation laws, the Standard Model, the Higgs mechanism, and physics beyond the Standard Model like dark matter and dark energy. ",
            "\u00a0A very qualitative understanding of particle physics. We learned basically the Wikipedia entry for \"particle physics.\" A very rough overview of the standard model, neutrino oscillations, a week of cosmology (astroparticle physics), and a strange few weeks of nuclear theory. ",
            "\u00a0A broad overview of various topics in nuclear and particle physics "

            "\u00a0Strengths: This class covered a lot. Though a lot of material was covered cursorily, I gained the vocabulary to talk to scientists and mentors about particle physics, at the very least, on a superficial level. That was pretty nice. We got to cover cool things like Feynman diagrams, and at the end of the course, we talked about beyond the Standard Model physics, which was very cool. In this class, you get a small taste of the large fields of particle physics and nuclear physics.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I felt like this class was misadvertised. It's labeled as 442, so it seems a very natural continuation of 440 and 441. Particle physics was last taught maybe 4-5 years ago on the undergraduate level, and the last time it was taught, it was by Prof. Goldberger, who is a star in his field. Back then, the class had a reputation for being difficult but very rewarding. Going into this class, I expected we would learn some really intro quantum field theory and quantum chromodynamics (the theory behind strong interactions), but the class was very, very qualitative. I liked that we covered a lot, but depth was sacrificed for breadth of material. Furthermore, the material was supplemented by a book by Das Ashok and Ferbel. This textbook is not good. It's in CGS, unclear at times, and its organization of topics was confusing. I wish the class had used Griffiths' fantastic book on particle physics, since it covers a lot more and is aimed right at the junior/senior level. I guess what I'm getting at is that this class felt too qualitative and experimental for my tastes. I wish we had covered the math behind what we studied, since I think to me and my peers, that was the far more interesting bit. I looked forward to taking this class last summer, so the disappointment of taking it left me with a bit of a sour taste in my mouth for future classes. Nothing against Baltay, he's a clear lecturer, but I wonder why he didn't use Griffiths and cover fewer topics in more depth. I think all of us would have preferred a careful study of select topics rather than a large overview of disparate topics. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: couldn't be rigorous because of lack of background, meant some gaps in learning. Towards the end this got very extreme and was hard to follow a lot of the material.\r\n\r\nStrengths: Very cool material, good and interesting lectures. Prof. Baltay is very experienced and has cool anecdotes. ",
            "\u00a0I think that this course is a strong introduction to the field of particle physics for people who don't know QFT or graduate-level quantum mechanics. It falls short in dealing with the ugly math that comes up in particle physics, and for many topics we only got a qualitative description that sometimes left us disoriented and confused. Also, the textbook was not good, I don't know why we didn't just use Griffiths. ",
            "\u00a0This course needs a better textbook. As an undergraduate, it's very difficult to take particle physics because you're in a weird position: you know some quantum, but no QFT or Dirac. If the professor set aside 3 or so weeks to give a rough introduction to Dirac theory the material would be accessible. Griffith's \"Elementary Particle Physics\" coupled with Lancaster's \"QFT for the Gifted Amateur\" would be a good pairing at the correct level. Cutting nuclear physics from the course would cause the course to flow better and would allow more time to be devoted to the necessary prerequisite knowledge. Spending more time on symmetry and conservation laws, with a brief look into Lie algebra/group theory would also be a nice touch.  \r\n\r\nThe strength of the course is its very existence. Very few undergrads have the opportunity to take a dedicated particle physics course designed just for them. As for material covered, the accelerator and detector design sections were pretty cool. They were invaluable for anyone who would want to be an experimental particle physicist. ",
            "\u00a0This course is taught at a reasonable skill level and the workload is very reasonable. \r\n\r\nHowever, my greatest issue with the course is that sometimes it feels like there is a disconnect between the material on the psets and the rest of the course. On both the final and the midterm there were problems over topics that had not been covered at all on the psets. I think that if the instructor (Baltay) wrote more of the problem sets himself or looked over the questions he's assigning more closely, then maybe they would better prepare us for the exam questions which he writes. Sometimes the psets were tedious and unhelpful. Also, some of the problems in the textbook (Introduction to Nuclear and Particle Physics by Das and Ferbel) assumed formulas that weren't even covered in the textbook. Overall the problems could have been a lot better.\r\n\r\nI also think that at times some topics were rushed while they shouldn't have been. In half a lecture we basically brushed over some key points of Dirac theory, when I personally would have rather taken some time to look at it more closely in order to understand better what came next. In general the course could use a little more depth and a little less breadth. "

            "\u00a0Depends who's teaching and what textbook. Baltay is great, but the weakness was his reliance on Das Ashok's textbook. If it's being taught out of that, don't take it. ",
            "\u00a0If you think you might be interested in pursuing particle physics for real, this is a fine intro that you can take before grad school and QFT. Also has a not so high workload it's fine. ",
            "\u00a0If you want a taste (and only a taste) of nuclear and particle physics, I would take this course. However, if you want to really learn dive deep into these fields, take a graduate-level class and actually learn some useful math. ",
            "\u00a0If your schedule, physics, and math background allow it, I would recommend at least shopping the graduate level particle physics course alongside this one. This class looks great on a resume and is very fun (albeit not super rewarding). If you use Das and Ferbel's \"Introduction to Particle Physics\" I would recommend picking up a copy of Griffith's \"Elementary Particle Physics\" to supplement the course. The psets are not difficult. The exams are fair and basically mimic the psets. The curve in the class is very generous, so it's a fun class. Professor Baltay is a great lecturer and it's always fun listening to his outlook and opinions on physics ",
            "\u00a0Take this class if you're interested in the subject matter and are willing to to research in your free time to decipher some of the pset problems. Look at the textbook (Introduction to Nuclear and Particle Physics by Das and Ferbel) online to see if you like it. The class will deviate from the textbook. Don't take this class if you're someone that needs to understand what's going on every step of the way, because there will be plenty of things you'll just have to take for granted. Also don't take this class if you need something super well organized, because at times you'll wonder when something that shows up on a pset was even covered. "
