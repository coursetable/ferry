            "\u00a0Much better at speaking Spanish, better understanding of various complex Spanish grammar tenses ",
            "\u00a0Vastly improved listening, speaking, and writing skills. Solidified all verb tenses, exposure to Spanish and Latin American literature and films. Learned how to develop deep analysis in Spanish, rather than just description. ",
            "\u00a0My Spanish did improve, and we worked on more complex grammatical structures than I was used to. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me improve my Spanish skills overall, especially with sharpening up grammar. L4 is great for fixing any grammatical errors that a Spanish student finds himself or herself making on a consistent basis. ",
            "\u00a0Improved reading, writing, listening, and speaking in Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0My conversational Spanish skills were really improved throughout this course and grammar concepts were really cemented. ",
            "\u00a0This class did a great job of improving my overall fluency in Spanish, especially when it comes to oral communication and reading comprehension. It is structured significantly differently than L3 and I feel in a better way because it emphasizes communication skills over grammar in the classroom and forces you to learn the grammar on your own. This is a well-structured class and wish the other levels of Spanish were comparable. ",
            "\u00a0I learned spanish. ",
            "\u00a0Great improvement in spanish ",
            "\u00a0My Spanish grammar and vocabulary improved significantly throughout this course. Rather than focus on the very general grammatical topics like in the previous levels, in L4 we start to look at the finer details and we begin to refine our understanding of the Spanish language. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: professor Cividanes is amazing and keeps students engaged during class, course material is very organized\r\nWeakness: there is homework every day ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: strong professor (Cividanes)\r\nAssignments and test given fair weight\r\nNot only reliant on textbook, uses outside sources like novel, films\r\nAmple opportunities for speaking and writing practice\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nsharp divide between first half which was very textbook and vocabulary focused and second half which was comprised primarily of novel and presentations. Based on this, could be a bit more points of connection between the two parts, but the second half allowed me to use and implement skills learned in first half. ",
            "\u00a0Prof Cividanes was a definite strength, as was the organization of the course. It could be improved by being less repetitive and reliant on textbook exercises / responding to questions in the same format every day. Also, students should be allowed to print their own course packets rather than having to spend $30 at tyco. ",
            "\u00a0A strength is the opportunity for in class discussion and the open dialogue of the class, which encourages students to step out of their comfort zone and begin to speak freely in Spanish. Another advantage is how the graded material is severely broken up so not one assignment is more than 15%. This gives you opportunities to improve your grade on a weekly basis. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Covers a lot over the semester, without moving too quickly. The course really forces you to notice your own weaknesses with the language and correct them. I found the short stories and poems that we read very enjoyable, if challenging at times. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The online homework is sometimes inscrutable and not particularly good at enforcing what we do in class. Also, since the class is very speaking-heavy, students who have studied abroad or have more immersive Spanish backgrounds can sometimes dominate. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that it really improves your speaking abilities. At times it seemed like some of the in-class activities like the debate or movies were forced, and it could be improved by having more time to talk about contemporary, controversial topics as opposed to old short stories or movies.\r\n\r\nYou definitely have to be prepared to teach yourself the grammar on your own because in-class lessons were rare. ",
            "\u00a0It meets every day, which is important to language learning. ",
            "\u00a0Great teacher ",
            "\u00a0One of the greatest strengths of this course was the interesting and engaging discussion that dominated the class time. We spent almost the entire class speaking to each other or listening to our classmates and it played a major part in improving my oral and aural comprehension. I also think that reading a short novel at the end of the semester and spending time dissecting it and really going deep into the language and historical context was a great way to bring all of what we learned over the course of the semester into one final project. "

            "\u00a0Yes, especially if you get Professor Cividanes. You learn a lot, especially speaking, without having to put in an excessive amount of work. Grading is fair and encourages learning. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The course is well-structured with a strong emphasis on speaking and writing. Definitely felt like I learned a lot and solidified all my skills from L3. ",
            "\u00a0This course is mandatory, but not bad. A lot of work at times, but with a strong professor it is doable. ",
            "\u00a0You're likely taking this class to fulfill a language requirement, but if you are simply doing it because you want to continue developing, I would completely recommend it. The Spanish department is wonderful and most of the professors genuinely want you to improve and are wiling to help you do so. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, whether you just want to satisfy the language requirement or learn to speak Spanish, this is a comprehensive and challenging course that will improve your speaking, reading, and writing without an excessive amount of work. You probably won't be fluent in Spanish by the end, but you'll learn a lot. ",
            "\u00a0I had a great experience in L4 Spanish! Take this course if you want to improve your speaking and grammar skills and get much more comfortable with the Spanish language. ",
            "\u00a0If you're taking the course its probably required. The class is much better than L3 in the respect that it focuses on improving your oral communication skills significantly. It is more work than L3 and be prepared to teach yourself the necessary grammar outside the classroom because in-class conversations are centered around reading comprehension from the many short stories and books that you read. ",
            "\u00a0Yes yes yes ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course. It will challenge you, especially if it is your first Spanish class at Yale, and as it meets everyday you will have to stay on top of all of the work. However, it is truly rewarding to see how much your understanding of Spanish improves. Try to take it with Ame Cividanes if possible. "
