            "\u00a0I learned about the history of whiteness in America. I feel like I knew a lot of the material already, as it is somewhat already known that whiteness is a ubiquitous characteristic of our society. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed taking this course and learning from the experiences of my peers to learn about whiteness in America. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to articulate how whiteness has shaped different aspects of life: activism, real estate, pop culture, diversity initiatives, institutions, etc. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about myself and my day-to-day experience in relation to whiteness and privilege. Further, I learned how to critically understand my actions and beliefs and the ways in which they reflect and reproduce larger patterns of inequity. I learned how historical moments and choices have led to the current situation of whiteness and race. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to think and talk about race, and the ways it informs power in American politics and culture, more frankly and critically. I gained new vocabularies for thinking about whiteness (solidarity, fragility, colorblindness, racism v. prejudice) and expanded my understanding of topics like cultural appropriation and diversity discourse. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the intricacies of whiteness and its pervasiveness in our society. I also learned how much I truly do not know about White America and how much there is still to learn. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: we were able to talk about race very openly in class. Also, our personal feelings and opinions were encouraged, as opposed to theoretical readings and responses to them specifically.\r\nWeaknesses: way too broad of a topic. White America is huge. Whiteness is a huge topic to tackle in one semester, once a week. Also, I think it could be useful to get really emotionally invested in the material, which would involve more holistic approaches to the material. I think the students should be able to get to know each other first, and then start to discuss this upsetting material. I think also narrowing the course would be beneficial. Perhaps \"white supremacy in America\" or something like that. ",
            "\u00a0The readings were hard to understand at times. I loved the student led classes because it was great to work with a group and lead the discussion. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: the fact that it is a seminar and everyone can speak their minds. Professor Carico carries discussion very well. The symposiums were a great idea as I learned so much about my topic through teaching myself and planning the two hours we were allotted. I wish we had done them earlier in the semester so I could get to know my classmates sooner. I also wish we had more group activities just so the ice would break a little faster. \r\nWeaknesses: towards the beginning, the amount of reading combined with the density of the reading was a bit high. Sometimes concepts flew over our heads and that was why section fell flat. After Professor Carico changed the readings, our class became more alive. ",
            "\u00a0The time for personal reflection and discussion on situations close to home (e.g. how whiteness plays out at Yale) made this class extremely meaningful. The symposiums were a great way to learn from my classmates and to think about how to effectively present discussions on whiteness to a large group. Almost all the readings were both illuminating and accessible. I would have liked more variety during class time instead of primarily big group discussions. For example, I enjoyed when we watched videos in class and then connected them to readings, or when we had time for smaller group discussions. ",
            "\u00a0The course travels fluidly between venerable thinkers like Baldwin and Du Bois and discussions of contemporary culture and challenges students to be introspective. It interrogates white supremacy from a number of angles (literary, sociological, historical, political) and in a number of contexts (social justice movements, popular culture, liberalism, the foundation of American politics and society). Professor Carico is an honest and refreshingly unsparing thinker. The class discussions sometimes grew static and while our conversations about race were more honest and frank than I've seen in pretty much any other course, I still think we could have gone farther as a group to talk about the role whiteness played in our own class and connect those dynamics to the readings. ",
            "\u00a0I wish this class had followed a more logical structure and covered more contemporary topics. I really enjoyed Professor Carico's style -- he was funny and engaging. I also enjoyed the structure of the class -- the symposiums led by students were interesting and added to the class. ",
            "\u00a0This course was fantastic. We had great conversations about a variety of topics that involved whiteness, white people, racism, poverty, and activism. I was engaged in every class meeting and looked forward to every discussion. My only advice for improvement would be an adjustment of some of the readings in order to engage everyone more completely during discussions. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I would recommend it if it has been amended. In its current form it was too broad, the discussion questions did not push us to consider new things, and it just kind of fell flat. But if we got deeper into the racism within the class even, it would be a more challenging discussion. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It is important that Yale students engage in difficult conversations. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This class gave me the vocabulary I need to articulate my experiences as a person of color. It gave me the tools I need to break down white fragility. It gave me the understanding of how America has come to be. This is a must-take. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Everyone needs to take this course. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a refreshingly candid look at race in America. White supremacy, in all its ugliness, is on full display. The readings are varied and interesting, and Professor Carico is approachable and adaptable. I would definitely recommend the class; I learned to think more critically about my own place in history and the ways white supremacy reinvents itself across eras, cultures, and contexts, and all that has never been more relevant. ",
            "\u00a0Yes -- I walked away from this class feeling like I had learned a lot and Professor Carico is also great. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student. Regardless of race, every student--particularly at Yale--should be aware of how the structure of whiteness exists in our society. This class is not just a lecturing about liberal ideas; it discusses the facts about how American society was founded by white people for white people and how those ideas still exist today. Everyone should try to take this course to understand more about the real America. ",
            "\u00a0No. Readings are vague, relatively uninteresting, and do not invite opinion. "
