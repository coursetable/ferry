            "\u00a0I learned a lot about various vertebrate innovations and how they developed phylogenetically and ontogenetically. Also, because there was so much material from such a broad area, I learned how to capture big ideas across many different species. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to be a more critical thinker. ",
            "\u00a0An understanding of basic anatomy from both an evolutionary and developmental perspective.  This course will give you the basic tools to analyze anatomical patterns in both timelines of a vertebrate (individual, thus developmental, and overarching, thus evolutionary). ",

            "\u00a0Lecture organization not always very clear. Overall well taught. Would be nice to have assigned textbook reading. ",
            "\u00a0The weakness of this course is the structure of the lectures. It is not always clear what certain topics have to do with the greater subject we are taking about and the powerpoint slides lack clear, concise information that is relevant to what we actually need to know for the course. Adding psets to this course could additionally facilitate better learning and understanding about how best to answer questions for the midterms and final. ",
            "\u00a0The course and the lectures are very well organized. However, I think it would benefit from some assignments besides the two midterms and final exam. This gives only a few opportunities for students to perform well. ",
            "\u00a0improvements: have exams well in advance of drop deadlines/reading period (super stressful), have sections, have review sections that are better ",
            "\u00a0It was a very good course. ",
            "\u00a0This course truly gives you the essential knowledge of developmental comparative anatomy. However, it would probably have been better to have a more rigid structure of the material; the syllabus really changed in the course of the semester because of delays or changes in what the material was taught. ",
            "\u00a0I wish this class covered fewer topics but in greater detail, or at least done a better job at highlighting what the most important points are. I found that lectures covered a far too high breadth for me to keep up with week-by-week and often did not go into enough detail for me to understand the evolutionary events and their consequences to be able to comfortably answer exam questions. ",
            "\u00a0Having 75% of your grade determined in the last 10 days of class (one midterm and final) is incredibly stressful. I wish it was broken up into a greater number of midterms. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include easy to follow slides. Areas of improvements include more enthusiasm during class and better delineations of what information is relevant to exams -- information overload. ",
            "\u00a0I think this class was not very supportive for student learning. A ton of information was given to us, and there was no formal support for us to learn the material. The book that was recommended for the course was far more detailed than the lecture slides. It was hard to discern what was big picture information or information that would be tested on. The lectures were well organized in terms of the powerpoint slides; however, the lectures were not very engaging. ",
            "\u00a0This course is poorly organized and there is basically no student support.  If we need help, the most we get is a half-formed email answer that does not improve our deeper understanding of the subject.  With the amount and detail of content that we cover, the course really needs more opportunities for engagement, like sections, quizzes, worksheets, and more practice questions before the tests. "

            "\u00a0Comparative anatomy is a challenging course that I had to take to fill my major requirements. I would recommend a student take this class if they have a major passion for the subject outside of it being a requirement. It is difficult and requires a lot of attention and detail in order to do well. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It's not easy, but it is super interesting and rewarding. The amount of studying I had to do, and the amount I learned from it, was pretty incredible. ",
            "\u00a0no, i would not reccomend. the exams are very stressful because the results of the exams come out after the drop dates for classes, the TAs do not seem to know the material because they are not good at explaining things during exam reviews. Prof is good though. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I really enjoyed the course. ",
            "\u00a0Do not take this course if you think it will be a vanilla anatomy course; it is not. However, it is a very fun course in that you really manage to understand evolutionary and developmental reasons for the basic setup of the body of vertebrates. You will also come to understand the important evolutionary innovations that have made the evolution of eutherian mammals and reptiles possible. If you are good at learning large amounts of textual material, then this class might not even be that hard. Go to lecture! ",
            "\u00a0I personally wouldn't take this course unless required by the major-- I know of several people who dropped the course after the first midterm (which was after the first drop deadline and resulted in Ws). The content is fascinating and Prof. Wagner really knows what he's talking about, but having only 2 midterms and a final dictate your entire grade is very nerve-wracking. The way the tests were scheduled this year, you had no grades for the course before the middle of the term. I wish this class were tested more frequently (maybe 3 midterms as he has had it in previous years?) or with greater breadth to match the content. ",
            "\u00a0I hope the material will be organized more clearly, instead of 1500 slides of pictures. ",
            "\u00a0If you have to. A lot of work but very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0No. The course is not very supportive for student learning. The amount of material that was given to us was very overwhelming. I felt like I was often just cramming information before the two midterms and the final and never really learning. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a huge stress.  It was so difficult to stay engaged in class and absorb everything that the professor was throwing at us.  There is so much information and way too much detail to learn fast enough and well enough to answer the questions on the exams.  Don't take this class unless you need to.  It is interesting information when you apply it to medical issues, but that is a pretty small part of the content. "
