How to give a public talk?  4. How to give a professional conference talk?  5. How to give a job talk?  6. How to present your work in a professional poster?  6. Tips and ideas about how to write a paper. 7. How to do outreach? ... etc.  These topics are really useful for graduate students and I hope they can be incorporated into the course. "
