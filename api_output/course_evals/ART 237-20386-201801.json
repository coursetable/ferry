Using medium format is not much like 35mm - you need to really think about what you're doing. This changes the whole photographic process, and I found myself making very different (and exciting) work that I couldn't have done had I just stuck with an SLR. "

            "\u00a0The course is certainly very hands off - and I liked that. I was able to just go off and do my own thing while using all of yale's facilities. But perhaps it would have been nicer to have more seminars like the one about writing for art. Getting people really engaged during those classroom sessions is very rewarding. "
