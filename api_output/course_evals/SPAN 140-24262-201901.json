            "\u00a0Speaking skills vastly improved ",
            "\u00a0I learned advanced Spanish grammar and cultural knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0A greater understanding of Spanish grammar and skills. ",
            "\u00a0This course really helped improve and finalize my comprehension of the Spanish language. Was super informative and you learn A LOT, but it is all very practical and helps a lot. We moved at a good pace, and there was a nice balance of practice writing, speaking, and listening. ",
            "\u00a0Learned spanish grammar and also gained experience speaking and listening to spanish. Lots of reading comprehension and videos to ensure that true mastery of the language was the goal. ",
            "\u00a0- Stronger speaking, listening, and collaborative skills \r\n- Applying my spanish to real world problems, discussing politics and global tensions/social issues ",
            "\u00a0Decent advanced Spanish grammar and cultural development ",
            "\u00a0I feel much more able to converse and write in Spanish after this course. When paired with L3, Spanish L4 introduces many useful tenses and phrases to students and leaves them prepared for fluency if they choose to improve their skills individually. ",
            "\u00a0Spanish language, grammar, and Spanish-speaking countries' cultures ",
            "\u00a0I learned so many new grammar conjugations and even more about South American culture. This was a fantastic course. ",
            "\u00a0Cemented my knowledge of Spanish and made me speak a lot. "

            "\u00a0The course is very professor-specific.  Your experience could be good or bad depending on who you get, and the organization overall is at times frustrating. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: small class size, intimate, good connection with teacher, constant Spanish practice \r\nWeaknesses: repetitive, a bit too much busy work ",
            "\u00a0I think the course was pretty good, the stories and assignments were engaging, interesting and well organized. ",
            "\u00a0This was a great course! It could maybe be a little more spaced out in terms of the larger assignments-- after spring break, there was either an exam, quiz, or presentation every week, which was very different from the first half of the class. ",
            "\u00a0Loved having course material that was not just text (the film \"No,\" short videos, audio, podcasts, etc.) It allowed for a wider range of learning. The art gallery trips were fun. \r\nSometimes, the daily assignments (like supersite) were a bit hard to learn from. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very activity oriented, engaging teaching, content (books/movies) are very applicable and engaging\r\nWeaknesses: workload is fairly unbalanced on a day to day basis ",
            "\u00a0Pretty good overall ",
            "\u00a0This course could be improved with more grammatical work in class. Many of my struggles came from misinpreterpretations of lessons which I had to self learn outside of class. Additionally, the semester should really begin with a review of necessary verbs because many of the verbs on tests were assumed as prior knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nThe professor's commitment to her students' education\r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nThe textbook ",
            "\u00a0It is so organized. The everyday class and work is great and you reap the benefits over time. That being said, the homework is so uneven. There would be 3 hours some days and barely 10 minutes worth other days. This could become hard during some weeks that I was very busy. If it was more regular, it might make it easier for students to keep up. But the best part was Profesora Tordin. A big improvement would be adopting her version of the course. Not only is she amazing, but she made us activities to do every day that went way more in-depth than the actual syllabus. It says just to review the homework in class, but by skipping this and still choosing to do the homework, I learned way more than I was actually supposed to. "

            "\u00a0Yes, this class has improved my Spanish tremendously in a lowstakes and friendly environment. ",
            "\u00a0I would if they were interested in learning Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! This course will really help you become more fluent, as it covers a lot of important tenses and aspects of grammar. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if they want to learn Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the activities and content included are incredible. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah, get a good teacher and its pretty easy ",
            "\u00a0This class is a lot of work and not necessary for many students. Because of that, I would recommend it only to students planning to become fluent in Spanish later in life and who would like to perfect the grammatical nuances. ",
            "\u00a0I would, but I would only recommend they take Professor Tordin's section and only if they were planning on doing L5 or study abroad. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, and especially with Giseli Tordin. She's new so she had no reviews before us, but we got so lucky! She's truly a gem. The course is rich and the materials they have you study are wonderful. The movie 'No' is my favorite! ",
            "\u00a0I recommend it to anyone who needs to fill the language requirement or wants to brush up on their Spanish. It is better than L3 so if you are wondering about taking it even though you don't have to it is worth shopping with a good professor. "
