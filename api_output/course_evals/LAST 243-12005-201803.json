            "\u00a0I got so much more comfortable with the intricacies of Spanish grammar. I feel so much more comfortable with speaking and writing in Spanish now that I've taken this class. ",
            "\u00a0I further developed my Spanish reading, writing, and speaking skills. ",
            "\u00a0LOTS of great grammar skills! ",
            "\u00a0This class delivers exactly what it promises - a deeper understanding of Spanish grammar. Its very hard, but you WILL see remarkable progress in a semester. ",
            "\u00a0Who knew Spanish grammar could get so advanced? This class is really fun if you like grammar, because you can really get into the nitty-gritty of certain rules and the exceptions to those rules. You also get to read some great short stories and watch films. "

            "\u00a0SO much homeworkalmost to the point of absurdity. ",
            "\u00a0This course has a high workload but one that is well-dispersed throughout the semester. It's a consistent amount of work, so there's never a huge uptick in workload around midterms or finals period (as is the case for most other classes). Another strength is Professor Seymour, who is incredibly patient and engaged in her classes. She is a wonderful instructor and always has time for her students. ",
            "\u00a0One strength is Professor Seymours great energy and enthusiasm for the material. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses-- want more review, slower pacing\r\nGreat-- the actual knowlege learned! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - it does exactly what youd think it does - youll learn a whole lot of grammar. \r\nWeaknesses - not as much opportunity to speak and practice speaking, though theres LOTS of written practice and detailed feedback on your writing. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are that the material is interesting and you learn a lot, especially because it's a smaller seminar. Weaknesses are pretty specific: \r\n1) It's too much homework. Eventually you get used to it, but sometimes you are asked to do an online homework, write a paragraph, and do readings all due on one day. \r\n2) The textbook does not have a table of contents. If there's any way to update the textbook, that would be great.\r\n2) One of the films, Secreto de sus Ojos, is really graphic and terrible about rape and murder. As someone who can occasionally get \"triggered\" by this kind of thing, it was really hard to watch and digest. Didn't seem necessary in a grammar class. I hope they take it off the syllabus. "

            "\u00a0Probably the best part of this class is the teacher, Terry. She is an absolute delight. As for the class itself, it really improves your writing and you can tell. Focuses on a lot of the pesky mistakes that non-native speakers make all the time. It feels a lot like in L1 and L2 you learn the basics. In L3 and L4 you go over those with more detail and then in SPAN 243, you go over those with a fine toothed comb, looking for places where people always make mistakes (subjective, por/para, prepositions, etc). It really really helps your writing. Not so much for speaking but there are other classes for that. It was only enjoyable because Terry is so upbeat and so engaged in class. She only calls on people by cold-calling, which after you get used to, sort of takes all the pressure off getting the answer wrong. Definitely helped my Spanish improve. But soooo much homework. That is the one annoying part of the class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend Advanced Spanish Grammar with Professor Seymour to any student who wants to really improve their language skills under a kind, patient, and highly engaged instructor. It won't always be your most \"fun\" class (it's grammar and sometimes that's frustrating and detail-oriented!), but if you keep up it will be so rewarding to see your progress over the course of the semester. Plus, with the frequent graded assignments, you'll always know where you stand in the course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I now feel very comfortable and prepared for future courses in Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Prof. Seymour's so great, and I learned a ton. BUT it *is* a lot of work-- just a warning. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but know what youre getting yourself into. Dont take this class to get a requirement out of the way - take it out of genuine interest in the content. Its a really, really hard class with a high workload, and the grading is tough. Ive taken a lot of language credits at Yale and have never taken more difficult language tests than those in SPAN 243. That all being said, I learned so much in this class and am very, VERY impressed by Professor Seymour. Take it with her or dont take it at all, in my opinion. Shes the course director and really knows what shes doing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Great L5 class and a lot of fun. "
