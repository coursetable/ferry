            "\u00a0This course had a strong focus on a particular problem and treating it as a project to be addressed. It would benefit from more structure and feedback as the project progressed, as well as clearer expectations on what the project and focus of the course were. ",
            "\u00a0The class wasn't very organized, but it was brand new and the model we were basing our entire project off of was developing throughout the semester, so it was a learning process for all of us. The way we were to be graded throughout the semester was rather unclear. ",
            "\u00a0Small class allowed for easy interactions between students and instructors, very much a collective learning and sharing experience. \r\nSome elements of the project were trial-and-error, but they provided valuable lessons in my mind, and any other project (in or out of the school setting) would encounter trial-and-error elements. I appreciated this. ",
            "\u00a0I wish the course were a bit better organized and that it was made clearer what was expected of students and when. I felt like time was often wasted trying to figure out what we were going to do in class and that could have been avoided if the professor had laid out a plan ahead of time. I also think it should have been more clear that the majority of the work would be in GIS, especially since both professor and TA did not have GIS skills. Lastly, I think more attention could be paid to solutions other than walls, because in reality walls will not be practical everywhere and will often have environmental \"costs\" that can't be given an economic cost.
