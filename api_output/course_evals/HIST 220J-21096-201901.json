            "\u00a0I learned about the Second World War, and also got a chance to write a long research paper, which was actually really fun. We also did lots of student presentations, so I would say I improved at that skill. ",
            "\u00a0Understanding of global lead-up to World War II; primary source research in archives; general life lessons from Prof. Kennedy ",
            "\u00a0This course provides an insightful, engaging look at the lead up the the Second World War. It is informative and fascinating. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a lot of insight on the origins of World War II which is very important. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a good lesson in how to take advantage of the Yale college seminar format. It encouraged students to read the background material widely and to pay particularly attention to how themes emerged over the course. The term paper component also encouraged students to really prepare for writing a senior thesis through conducting their own archival research. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a ton about lead up to WWII and historical research and writing process. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about the origins of the Second World War in Europe, and a lot about the historiography of the war. Its also nice to just hear Professor Kennedy talk about history, just experience teaching it and everything. "

            "\u00a0Very much a leminar, which isn't my thing. Prof Kennedy is brilliant, but our classes could have used more structure and we never really talked about the readings. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked Paul Kennedy's class and I learned a lot of information that helps us understand World War II a little better. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength of this course is being able to learn from Professor Kennedy, who not only has a vast amount of knowledge in the subject but also cares for his students and takes time to get to know them and push them academically outside of the classroom. This course also definitely challenged the students through the term paper and introduced primary document research through the Munich Documents component.\r\nThis course could be improved through a bit more organisation and guidance. There was not a lot of discussion amongst students in the classroom and the presentation format meant that it was possible to become somewhat disengaged at times. There was also very little structure for the term paper, which made it challenging. Although Professor Kennedy made himself very available for advising over email and in office hours, the almost complete lack of structure or deadlines for the paper made it quite a daunting task and required a lot of self-organisation on the part of the student. ",
            "\u00a0The course relies too much on student presentations and not enough on Professor Kennedy's instructions. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Kennedy is amazing, interesting material\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: more in-class discussion (tho listening to Prof Kennedy is always a treat) ",
            "\u00a0The final essay assignment could be broken up into more sections, and there could be some advising on the draft for example. Otherwise it was good at having students present on readings, and the sources presentations were particularly enlightening. "

            "\u00a0I would only really recommend this course for the chance to write a research paper on the origins of WWII. Classes were fine, just not terribly engaging. I think I expected something more. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Professor Kennedy is a treasure ",
            "\u00a0Yes, Professor Kennedy is a great source of knowledge, and an even better person. I thoroughly enjoyed taking this class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course because many times students learn about World War II but do not know or understand the causes/origins and this class helps students gain a better understanding of the origins. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to challenge yourself to a new kind of learning, which involves a lot of personal motivation and initiative to reach out to Professor Kennedy and the resources at Yale, then this is a great course to take. The material is very interesting and at the end of it you will have a paper you can be proud of that will help in preparation for the senior essay. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if only to get to know Professor Kennedy better. He is a wonderful person who cares a lot about undergraduates. However, the course relies too much on student presentations. I often wished that Professor Kennedy came in with lesson for the day rather than just listening to students give a presentation. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - tho I still have not received a single grade, so I have no clue where I stand. But take this course for Prof Kennedy - hes legendary. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Its worth it just to sit and hear professor Kennedy talk about everything. The sources presentations also give you great background for the kind of stuff thats out there in the primary sources for the origins of the Second World War and how to read them. Those were super fun. One thing to note is that advising on the final essay which (I think) is the entire grade is a bit dodgy. Professor Kennedy is helpful but doesnt really do much advising aside from recommending secondary literature. "
