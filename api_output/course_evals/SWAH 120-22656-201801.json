            "\u00a0I improved my grammatical constructions, expanded my vocabulary, gained confidence in complex sentences and reading the language. ",
            "\u00a0- I can speak swahili for more than 15 minutes. \r\n\r\nSwahili is probably one of the most beautiful languages one can learn at Yale. From the class, I got the introductory vocabulary, and a mastery of foundational grammar rules. "

And a greater variety of techniques in learning grammar / vocabulary might have helped. Sometimes it was difficult to know what vocabulary was worth knowing for tests and what was just being told to us for slower integration. ",

            "\u00a0Swahili courses are my favorite courses I've taken at Yale. I really enjoy learning the language. Mwalimu Kiarie and Mwalimu Gertruda are amazing, and they make learning the language easy. They also make sure you have everything you need to excel in the course. ",
