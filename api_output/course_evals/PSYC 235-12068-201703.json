            "\u00a0Projects shouldn't be given to us according to the TF or professor's interests but instead class interests should be kept in mind. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very engaging professors and TFs. Interesting material and clear lectures. Weaknesses: few opportunities to receive feedback for writing ability before evaluations. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor is approachable and engaging in lectures\r\nWeaknesses: We did not really do much through the semester. My writing did not really improve, because we did so little of it. Most of the writing came at the final paper. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the discussion/seminar style of the classes and how we always started with a discussion of events and \"Today's Media Claim\". ",
            "\u00a0Professor Richeson, Natalie, and Julian were all fantastic in class, and very approachable. At times, the class seemed to stay on one subject for quite awhile, but it seemed to be necessary for getting a good foundation for the topic. Rather than solely being group work, I think it would have helped my learning to be able to work independently on the projects. ",
            "\u00a0The professor and teaching fellows put a ton of work into the course, and it shows. Everything is planned to a T. You definitely learn a lot if you pay attention and actually do the work. In the future, I'd like to see a change made to the topics of the papers we write. In PSYC 200, the prerequisite for this course, we got to pick our own topics to conduct our research on and develop our own surveys for participants to fill out. In this class, the whole class had to write their papers on the same topics that the professor and teaching fellows chose. I still learned a lot from that, so I would recommend keeping it for one of the papers (probably survey), but for the experimental paper, it would be fun and a challenge for everyone to design their own study. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths was the focus on getting actual experience with doing studies and writing up results. A weakness might be the slower pace of the course in learning about actual research methods. It also would be helpful to have one-on-one help with writing our actual paper systematically to really learn how to write it - feedback was good and going to office hours was helpful but really being able to learn how to write a scientific paper and have someone oversee that process would have been more helpful. This especially would have been helpful for the first paper, so we could learn from the start how specifically to write a research paper. I also sometimes felt as though the questions asked of the students in class had obvious correct answers that weren't very mentally stimulating and made class drag on because we weren't able to go deeper and discuss. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: manageable and pleasant experience learning!\r\nWeakness: the class was a little too large to make the creative structure work. Coming up with our own research questions was great, but the process was very repetitive and frustrating because it's so hard to get a large group of people on the same page of anything ",
            "\u00a0I liked that the professor and TAs were so involved in the course, which allowed for a smooth transition into conducting research. However, some lecture days were dry and felt slightly repetitive. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Richeson was the biggest strength of this course along with the TFs. They were the most helpful and useful assets to doing well in this course. ",
            "\u00a0It was very well organized and not stressful at all. I appreciated the fact that we went gradually through the material and were able to apply what we learned and class and develop skills necessary to conducting research. It was helpful to go through the actual process of designing a survey and experiment with the TAs (who were incredibly knowledgeable) and developing those skills. I also think it was smart to do the survey project as an entire class and then split into smaller groups for the experimental project; it was even more useful to have a TA help us every step of the way rather than throwing us out to conduct our own projects.

            "\u00a0take it. very easy WR credit. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Prof. Richeson is a very kind and engaging professor. She gives everyone ample opportunities to ask for and receive help on understanding topics and projects. The class itself covered everything we were meant to learn in a straightforward and painless way. Would recommend to any student seeking requirements for PSYC/S&DS/WR/SO. ",
            "\u00a0Not really. The things you learn (process of conducting research) can be picked up in another research methods course where you learn this class's material as a peripheral to a main topic. I would recommend this class if it was geared more towards writing scientific papers, since there aren't many classes like that. \r\n\r\nThere wasn't much work in the class, which is kind of a disappointment if you were looking to get something out of this class. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a great addition to a semester where all of my other classes were fairly heavy. Class is usually pretty engaging and Professor Richeson clearly cares a lot about her students. There were two papers (~15 pages each) and a midterm. Overall a pretty good deal for a writing credit. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course based on the semester (Fall 2017) I took it. I'm sure the previous semesters were better, and I expected much more. I got absolutely nothing out of it. It seemed like many of the students didn't even have a basic grounding in psychology or statistics, which I thought was a prerequisite. It feels like I wasted a course credit on a semester of sitting through really basic concepts. ",
            "\u00a0If you're a psych major, you probably have to take this class, so whatever I say here won't really have a significant effect on you. I would even recommend this class for non-psych majors. It's a writing credit without the pretentiousness of a humanities class. You actually write about real-world issues, and even if you're not a psych major, if you plan to go into any field of academia, it's helpful to know how to write a publishable research paper, which is what this class teaches you. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if they want to learn about research methods and writing research papers; if they just want to learn about psychology this may not be the most interesting place to go. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the teaching staff made it a phenomenal experience ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to another student who needs to take a research methods class, by I would not recommend it as an elective. ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend this course, but I think a lot of what I enjoyed about the class was Professor Richeson's doing. We spent the first half of the semester in lectures with Professor Richeson, who always used examples to explain concepts and truly cared to make sure that we understood what she was saying. The second half of the semester was spent doing two projects, but one was as a whole class and in the other project we just split the class in two so it wasn't personally burdensome. We were also guided every step of the way by our TAs instead of being thrown by the wayside to do our own projects. I expected this class to be stressful based on past reviews, which is why I believe that I enjoyed the class because Professor Richeson was so adamant about it being more chill than in the past. "
