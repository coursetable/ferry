",

I spent only 2-3 hours on the first 3 psets because they're so trivial (like implementing a bfs, calculate distance, etc), I was not learning  much for first half of the semester, but the second half covers really OOP stuff like multiple inheritance and many design patterns. The pset about designing a game to expect unknown future change to the rule encapsulate the essence of OOP a lot, so I hope the second half of the class could be augmented to about 2/3 and give more psets like the Yahtzee game.

I think if any CS class were to implement a nice 3-4 week group project to help hammer in the course's concepts than it would be OOP, a programming concept whose application is best suited for dynamic and interesting projects. Instead of having a final that tests cursory knowledge of C++ and Go, why not let us  show what we know with a cool project? I think our Yahtzee assignment tried to bridge that gap, but having an even bigger assignment would be much more fun. ",

Usually programming assignments are kind of a free for all at Yale where if it passes public test cases, then that is all that matters, but for this class our code was analyzed for its style.\r\n\r\nFor some reason it was really hard to follow Professor Glenn in lecture though. I wish he had well-written notes like other CS classes at Yale provides ",

The problem sets are really interesting and definitely more manageable than 323 or even 223. ",

Beyond that though, this class helped me understand how and why certain patterns exist in OOP. The intros to Go, Java & Objective C at the end of the semester were a wonderful way to make further OOP learning more accessible. Psets were always fun, too. ",

Less time could have been spent on aspects of programming language syntax in class, and more on the OO concepts themselves. ",

It's good that I took this course because I learned OOP from it, but I felt like I was always behind the majority of the other students who already knew Java or another OOP language. This class was at one point a CS gut but not this semester. Our exams were quite challenging and some of the psets were relatively time-consuming as well (although we usually had 2 weeks to do them so it wasn't that bad). This course is not easy if you don't already know OOP. In fact, I found it much more conceptually challenging than 223, even if the workload was less. Only take this course if you have room for a fairly serious CS class in your schedule. ",
