For example, for autoimmune disease setting, we learned how to specifically tune down corresponding such as effector T cells. In order to learn these skills, first, we learn the foundation of immunology. Then we applied to these foundations into an engineering discipline. Overall, in this course, I was able to learn a huge deal of information in immunology and engineering. "

And learning the pathological pathways in this class was very helpful. The professor is also dedicated to teaching current research topics which makes very helpful for us to understand what is going on currently in the area.\r\n\r\nWeakness\r\n-Have the class well-defined curriculum and make the readings assignments and class discussions in line with the HW and the exams so that students could actively engage with the class.
