Working with members of the Jorgensen lab, I got to learn a lot about force fields, MD simulations, and biomolecular simulation in general. \r\n\r\nThe lectures by Dr. Parr are also quite good at alerting you to many of the problems encountered when performing research in the scientific community.

            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were:\r\nshowing students examples of ethical dilemmas in chemistry\r\ninspiring them to create an environment where these problems are less common.\r\n\r\nThe course could be improved by Professor Parr letting us out of class on time instead of 10-15 minutes late every time, making me late for subsequent courses. Also, it would be more interesting if the focus was more on others' research, like the last few classes. ",
            "\u00a0There could be more communication between research advisors and the teaching staff, it felt very disconnected and sometime's it's unclear what the expectations are since there's no oversight.  It's still a great way to get involved in research though. ",

Individual case studies force us to think about those that do unethical things not as \"bad\" people but rather as human beings that made poor choices. ",

All of the lab members are generally very helpful and are willing to have you help out with their interesting projects.\r\n\r\nAlso, Parr's lectures on ethics are pretty good, with lots of interesting factoids. You learn a lot about research, but also the names of New Haven streets and their connection to British history. "
