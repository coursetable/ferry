He wants us to learn and truly take something away from the class. Overall, this capstone was much better than some of the others I heard about. We had a clear deliverable, it was an interesting project, we had a reasonable client (the IFC), and our professor was great. ",

            "\u00a0I have heard horror stories of capstone projects, this was not one such capstone. It was a joy to work with the IFC and with Professor Hopkins. "
