            "\u00a0I developed a knowledge of Civil war history, Abraham Lincoln's statecraft, and rhetoric. ",
            "\u00a0A better understanding not only of the period leading up to / during the civil war, but also a better understanding of Lincoln's historical legacy. This course allowed me to think critically about what an American statesman is and should be. ",
            "\u00a0I gained new familiarity with a wide range of Lincoln's writings as the basis for his political thought. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the theoretical tools to evaluate Lincoln's political philosophy and political leadership; in particular, this class explored the connection between ideas and political development. ",
            "\u00a0The class provided a good understanding of Lincoln's style of statecraft and political thought.  We also learned about the American political and intellectual theories of the time and their relations to Lincoln. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about Lincoln, as one might expect. But I also learned so much about American history. This is both a history and a polisci course in many ways, and I really appreciated both aspects. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a deep knowledge of the Lincoln corpus, and an understanding of the broader context in which Lincoln lived and thought. I learned to treat politics as a domain of ideas, and not just power  that words and rhetoric matter, and that Lincoln was a great leader not just for his accomplishments (his deeds), but also for how he used words to shape the public mind. I developed my ability to read speeches critically and to chart the evolution of a thinker's thoughts across time. ",
            "\u00a0This class is amazing for anyone who wants to better their knowledge of American history, but most importantly if you are genuinely interested in learning a variety of perspective on Lincoln. You learn a great deal of political thought from Lincoln and other thinkers, while also improving in deep analysis of texts. I believe my writing also improved greatly as I picked up a lot of Lincoln's rhetoric. ",
            "\u00a0I developed more precise analytical skills with which to read and understand speeches and texts, and the insights Professor Smith imparted through Lincoln's words were influential on my own political ideology. "

            "\u00a0One of my favorite courses I've ever taken at Yale. couldn't be better. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of this course include Professor Smith's lecture style, the provision of a section, and general depth in the course material.\r\n\r\nI think that the weaknesses of the course include lack of transparent communication about syllabus reading expectations. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are very interesting with unique arguments that engage with the texts in complex ways. The reading is not overwhelming. The relatively few opportunities for evaluation and uncertainty about paper expectations make the course more challenging. ",
            "\u00a0I'm not sure that the course could be improved. The themes of the week were supported by a host of primary sources, and Professor Smith's lectures always added something to the readings. John's sections, although sparsely attended, were informative and helpful in studying for the exams. The papers helped me to learn more about specific aspects of Lincoln's thought and politics, although it seems as though a better system would have been two papers (rather than three) plus a final exam. ",
            "\u00a0The class is approachable and the material is interesting.  There does not seem to be any assumptions of prior political knowledge.  Occasionally, the lectures were somewhat biased, but that did not take away from my experience in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: really great deep dive into Lincoln's speeches and writings. I left the course with profound admiration for him.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: would have been improved if it were more of a seminar-type course with more discussion, especially because it was a small enough class to allow for such a format; also don't think there should be a final- a final presentation on one of lincoln's speeches could be more informative/useful ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of this course is the material. Professor Smith on the first day of class said that the Collected Works of Lincoln would be the single most important book we read at Yale. Maybe this is hyperbole, but Lincoln was a master writer, and his legacy is as important today as ever. It is a pleasure to hear Smith lecture on Lincoln. While the three short papers can at times be frustrating, they effectively make students take up a broad range of Lincoln's writings from different angles. \r\nThe way to improve this course would be to make it a seminar. It certainly works well as a lecture, but with material as rich as Lincoln, a lecture falls short in allowing students to delve into the material and converse about it. There is more than enough depth and nuance in the readings to merit longer class discussions and a longer research paper as opposed to lectures and short papers. I think this structure would enhance learning. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course, that could only be improved by increased administration (maybe through a TA?), as there was little online communication and it was often find to hard the updated readings. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely would recommend this course. The complaint I have about many courses is that you walk away with extraordinarily vague top-level understandings of a few issues. In Professor Smith's course, you will have a concrete understanding of Lincoln and his impact on the nation moving into contemporary times. This is an important class to take if you are interested in Lincoln as a politician, rhetorician, or commander! ",
            "\u00a0Those interested in Lincoln at all would enjoy this class immensely. If not, one should know it is intensely focused on his life and philosophy; it is not a history course. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Lincoln is a universally-cited, poorly-understood political figure, and this course will help you explore his thought in depth and to evaluate his standing within the prevailing intellectual tradition. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the class, and I expect that anyone who has any interest in American politics or Lincoln's life would as well. ",
            "\u00a0This course will make you a better thinker, leader, and person. It is an absolute must-take for any student interested in statesmanship, rhetoric, moral dilemmas in politics, American history, or political theory. Professor Smith is one of the foremost experts on Abraham Lincoln in the United States, having published countless essays and edited books on Lincoln over his distinguished career as a political theorist. It is precisely Smith's background as a political theorist that makes the class so unique and engaging -- the course not only offers the opportunity to study Lincoln & the Civil War as you would in a history course, but it also allows you to engage with Lincoln as a philosopher, a statesman, and a human. Smith's lectures examine Lincoln's intellectual influences and seamlessly incorporate the works of Bancroft, Frederick Douglass, Karl Marx, J.S. Mill, and other political thinkers of the 19th century. On top of all that, Smith is also a really fun, kind, relaxed professor who loves engaging with students and watching films in the course. The leminar format is perfect for approaching Lincoln, as Lincoln's writings do not lend themselves well to the seminar-format (in my view). All in all, I urge any student of politics to take this -- you will not regret it. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! but student must be interested in American history-- specifically the Civil War. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend Lincoln, Statecraft, and Rhetoric: it is a pleasure to read Abraham Lincoln all semester. This class teaches you about rhetoric, political debate, and leadership. I think understanding Lincoln is imperative to understanding all of American history and politics. Professor Smith will not be the most energetic professor you've ever had, but he has a subtle sense of humor and a great grasp of political thought. Don't confuse this for a history class - it's listed in political theory for a reason. Sometimes the history/context was a little lacking, but that doesn't take away from the overall strengths of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course if you're interested in Lincoln, political philosophy or even just 20th century American history. Smith's lectures were usually quite interesting and you'll leave the class an expert on one of America's greatest leaders. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Professor Smith is amazing and actually cares a lot about your experience with the course. The texts are incredibly intriguing and background is almost always provided to certain text if you are unfamiliar with the time period. The essay prompts are intellectually challenging, but in a very feasible way. They challenge you to really formulate a unique stance and support it with the texts, which requires time and thought.  This course is only offered at certain times, so if you have the chance, you should absolutely take this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is a fascinating, in-depth look at one of the greatest leaders in the history of the world, whose politics are desperately needed today. "
