            "\u00a0Tons! really great practical skills about doing data analysis. yale needs more PRACTICAL classes like this! ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me the knowledge behind research design and the production and development of experiments. Specifically, this course uses Stata intensively to work with data sets and learn how to use the program's functions to achieve your research goals. This course has made the consumption of research papers much easier, as I now understand the \"Research Design\" section of each one. Beyond Stata, Professor Thomas also challenges his students to interrogate presumptions that researchers often make when answering experimental questions. For example, he always asks us what the potential confounding variables can be in a regression. This gives you the opportunity to be creative. Finally, you get the chance to conduct your own research project with a set of data. I generated my first hierarchical regression table in this course, which used six different models! ",
            "\u00a0I developed an in-depth understanding of Stata. Prior to this course, I had no real idea about the capabilities of the program, and Prof. Thomas did a great job of showing the class just what Stata is capable of doing. It gave me a better understanding of the ways in which Stata can be utilized by researchers to analyze data sets. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to use STATA. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a ton about the ins and outs of Stata, research design, and research implementation. ",
            "\u00a0JT's vision for this class is as a practical introduction to all of the intricacies of data management and analysis, and it definitely delivered as much as possible given the fact that we are limited to one semester of work for what truly takes years to master. I'm walking away with a /much/ deeper working knowledge of Stata and of just how much work goes into managing and analyzing data. ",
            "\u00a0I leqrned advanced quant analysis on Stata. JT was incredibly helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about data management and the basic principles of quantitative research. Professor Thomas does a fantastic job of demonstrating how research works in the real world. Walking away from this course, I was confident in my abilities to do research in a professional setting. ",

            "\u00a0JT took on too many students this year, and I would recommend keeping the class sizes small. Other than that it's a super well structured class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: you learn a ton! really practical skills that will help you SO much in the real world. the ability to use your own dataset is awesome too, so you can really tailor the class to your interests.\r\n\r\nweaknesses: JT definitely took on a lot. and it was so wonderful of him to not say no to any students or cap the class, but it also led to delays in grading and difficulty in discussing projects as fully as we'd like. JT is by far the best teacher in the Jackson Institute and absolutely irreplaceable, but also he has so many demands on his time jackson should really look into getting another expert in data analysis to join. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Engaging, useful, rewarding, must-take for those who want to do social science research.\r\nWeaknesses: N/A ",
            "\u00a0For the most part the course was very good. The only problem was that assignments were not returned in time to be useful. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: JT explains things in a clear manner, he uses a lot of meaningful examples that help us understand the applicability of the work, and I felt I learned a lot about actually using stata. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It seems like we sort of ran out of time in the end and the regression part was a little rushed, which made the final project a little more difficult. \r\n\r\nImprovement: 1) It would be nice if some office hours were offered on Monday or Tuesday given that the psets were due on Wednesday and most students don't start them before the weekend. 2) Because class periods were long and in the evening, it was sometimes harder to stay focused on the materials (especially when it was dark out) -- it might be nicer to split it up into two 1hr15min sessions per week instead of one 2 hour block. 3) I liked the idea of implementing a \"study hall\" type period where students could work on the psets or final projects during a certain period and a TF or JT could be there in case we had questions. ",
            "\u00a0Smaller class size would have allowed for more timely feedback and more engaging sessions. ",
            "\u00a0I think that this course is what you make of it, and most of the concerns that I heard from my classmates were rooted much less in the quality of the instruction (you will not find anyone who does not think JT is a wonderful professor) or the material and more in conflicting visions of what the class should be about. If you don't want to learn Stata, do not take this class, which is essentially a Stata class with the opportunity to apply your skills to a topic entirely of your choosing. ",
            "\u00a0The course is simply amazing for people who want to improve their quant skills on Stata . JT is one of the beat profs I hav ever had at Yale, he has taught us so much. One thing to improve would be if we could start our projects sooner. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Thomas is awesome. It's nearly impossible to make 2 hours of Stata interesting and even entertaining, but he did. The lectures were really well organized, and the problem sets were carefully written. The only major weakness was slow grading on the problem sets (which made it hard to catch your mistakes from week to week). That being said, the course was much larger than normal, so I really appreciated Professor Thomas being willing to let everyone in. ",
            "\u00a0JT is so amazing and such a kind teacher, but please JT don't take more students than you need to. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course is so unique in that we actually gained a legitimate hard skill upon completion! I thought the lectures were structured well, and of course JT is such a great, engaging professor that even though we went through a ton of content, the course still seemed very manageable. I think the only tough part was that the course had substantially more students this year, and sometimes I felt like it was difficult to get a response from JT or I would be worried about overloading him since so many students sought help from him all at once. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I learned so much in such a short period of time, and I feel that I gained real, useful knowledge and skills from this course. JT is always available to help and provides many resources for additional help.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the problem sets were extremely difficult, especially for people who had never done coding before. One thing that would be helpful would be open office hours structured like a group work session rather than individual appointments because I would often get stuck at multiple points in the problem sets. Also, a little more review of actual statistical methods, such as different types of regressions and interpretations, would be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Great class the strength is Professor Thomas and his teaching. He is a great professor, masterfully explains complicated concepts and keeps statistics and data science interesting (which can be a very hard task). He makes himself very accessible to his students and pushes them to expand their knowledge and understanding of stats. "

            "\u00a0Yes. Fun if you're invested in your research project. Would recommend doing this in conjunction with a capstone or a research project on the side. ",
            "\u00a0Great class! a must take if you are interested in quantitative social science research. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this if you are a Global Affairs major or have any interest in conducting a quantitative research project. The class will give you the tools necessary to develop a research question, collect the data, and run Stata commands to test a hypothesis. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students because I think Prof. Thomas cares a lot about the course material and his students, which makes for a positive and effective learning environment. This class gives Global Affairs majors the chance to design their own research paper and explore a topic of interest to them. It's a great option for the research design credit necessary in the major, and it will give you newfound skills in Stata that may prove incredibly useful if you go into a research/policy position post-graduation. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class if you are really interested in research or learning more about stata. Fair warning, it was actually quite a bit harder than I expected. But JT is super understanding and a wonderful, warm professor -- he does his best to make learning stata fun and enjoyable. And stata is actually pretty cool once you get it down! (Also good prep for approaches to development.) You get to do your own research project, which is a cool opportunity to pursue your own interests. ",
            "\u00a0I think this is a great class for Global majors (indeed, the vast majority of my class was comprised of them), especially those who want to walk away with a pretty deep understanding of Stata and all of its power. It fulfills the research requirement, allows you to delve deeply into a topic of your interest, and is an excuse to spend another semester with JT after AQA. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This class basically teaches you how to use STATA which is a marketable skill. Also, you take this class for Justin Thomas. As said year after year, he is great, personable, and quite willing to help. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely recommend this class to anyone who is interested in serious research, especially involving data analysis. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course if you are interested in doing quantitative research in a professional setting. The workload is very manageable, and the final project is enjoyable. Professor Thomas gives an incredible amount of individual time and attention during the final project portion of the class. Overall, this was a very valuable course with a great professor. ",
            "\u00a0TAKE IT STATA IS A MARKETABLE SKILL ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this class! Work in study groups for problem sets. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student! I learned so much, and all of the information was so useful and applicable. I now know how to use Stata to analyze a dataset. If I am reading a paper and have a doubt about something the scholars say about their data, I now know how to download their replication dataset and check it out for myself, which is really cool. If you are willing to put in the time, the final research project is really interesting and rewarding as well. ",
            "\u00a0Data is incredibly important to the modern world, and I doubt that there are many other classes at Yale that teach you so practically how to work with data and how to use it in research. I would recommend this to any student, global or not. "
