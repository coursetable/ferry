            "\u00a0I learned so much from this course about educational philosophy, the role of arts in both education and society, and the possibilities for non-profit arts organizations.  I also learned to critically examine the current state of education and society as a whole. ",
            "\u00a0This course redefined a lot of my assumptions about education, community service, and the role of arts in society. Since music is such an educative field, its really helpful to learn how theories of society and education can factor into what we want to accomplish as artists. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the theories and writings of great educational philosophers and artists, and got a chance to critically think through their arguments and thoughts, as well as shape and refine my own. "

            "\u00a0The Sunday noon weekly discussion response submission requirement was a little intrusive, especially given how busy Saturdays nights and Sundays tended to be this semester. I would recommend pushing the time later into the day (preferably the evening). ",
            "\u00a0This course is a brilliant opportunity to discuss educational philosophy, the role of arts in both education and society, the possibilities for non-profit arts organizations, and anything else that could be relevant.  The only weakness I can think of is that the discussions (at least for my class) tend to lean a bit too much towards theory as opposed to practice.  We did not discuss very much what we could actually do about all of the problems we examined. ",
            "\u00a0The material is certainly interesting, but also extremely varied. So there are topics you will find meaning in, but probably also ones that you will have trouble engaging with. A greater cohesion or reasoning behind the lesson plan could improve the course. The course is well-designed in that it is never prescriptive but lets us come to our own conclusions/opinions about the material. ",
            "\u00a0This was a great course. The environment allowed for critical thinking and open discussion of concepts. The one thing I found sometimes did not work so well is that the class structure, which had two students present on the readings and facilitate the discussion each week, sometimes made it harder for us to get a fuller understanding of the reading as one student might give a presentation with a warped or incomplete understanding of things, or might have a hard time facilitating the discussion. "

            "\u00a0This is a wonderful course with really interesting course readings, though I recognize it may not be for everyone. The first class during reading week is fairly representative of what discussion might look like, minus the student-led presentations, so if you aren't a fan initially, I doubt much else will change your mind. ",
            "\u00a0I would strongly recommend this course to any students interested in the intersection between music, service, and society, especially those who are skeptical about the role of music in modern society.  Entering this class, I was doubtful that music was at all useful, but I have discovered ways that music can contribute to social good. ",
            "\u00a0Only if you need it as a major requirement or are especially interested in the intersection of arts and community engagement. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This class is absolutely wonderful if you are interested in using any form of arts (not just music) in service to society. "
