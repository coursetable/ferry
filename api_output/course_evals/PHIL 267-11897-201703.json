Over the semester, I developed familiarity with using sentential and first-order languages while also examining how each system functions at the metalogical level. I also gained experience writing proofs, especially proofs by induction and by contradiction. "

            "\u00a0The course is very structured, in a helpful way. The material is covered with ruthless efficiency, while office hours are helpful in filling in any gaps left by the pace of instruction. ",
            "\u00a0The particular strength of this course is its structure: the semester has a clear focus toward the proof of the completeness of first-order logic. Individual pieces may feel disparate as they fall into place, but Professor Shin emphasizes how each element becomes important to the final proof in the last few weeks. Professor Shin's teaching was a highlight as well. I was glad to have a small lecture, with Professor Shin running the sections and grading the problem sets. She is an excellent teacher. "
