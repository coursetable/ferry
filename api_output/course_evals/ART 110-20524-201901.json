Also, there is a hierarchy between who can afford to buy certain materials as opposed to those who must find and re-use scraps. ",
            "\u00a0Not really many weaknesses other than a general lack of materials, but this is not that important in an art class which is more about the theory of sculpting. Strengths are the open-ended structure and great support from teachers. ",
            "\u00a0The projects are very open ended, which was very intimidating for me at first. However, over the course I really learned to take advantage of the amount of agency we get and go with it. It would have been a little more helpful to get a little more guidance towards the beginning of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Erika was really nice and I felt like she gave us a lot of freedom to create the art we wanted to create. However, as an intro course, I wish there would have been a little more structure.  The professor was willing to show us how to use tools and materials, but sometimes I didn't know what to ask about because I don't have a ton of experience with sculpture materials. Also our $150 mandatory materials fee was spent on a lot of materials that the class didn't end up using. The materials bought were bought without student input, which meant that if we wanted to use anything else for our project we had to buy that on top of the fee we'd already paid. This was really frustrating as someone who doesn't have excess money to spend on art supplies. I'd prefer to have bought supplies individually without paying the fee or have input as to how the class money was spent. "
