            "\u00a0Dr. Elder was engaging and genuinely cared about the material. However, the readings were often extremely dry, and the class quickly became disengaged during discussion, especially as the semester progressed. The final project was also somewhat strangely formatted with lots of repetitive information, and the museum exhibit format seemed unnecessarily complex and tedious. The way the material was approached in this course was very theoretical which should be better reflected in the course listing. ",
            "\u00a0The readings were very boring, the class was organized by technology, not by theory which is how it should have been organized. The class discussions were only based on readings and often became repetitive. ",
            "\u00a0It could involve more actual technology and medicine and not just theory ",
            "\u00a0There were always great conversations in class, and the readings were always interesting. The grades and papers are structured well, and the workload was always the perfect amount. No weaknesses! ",
            "\u00a0I think having a greater understanding of the final project when we chose our artefacts would have been really beneficial. Some artefacts seemed to fit the topics better and made for better exhibits. ",

            "\u00a0If you're looking to take a class about the historical development of medical technologies, probably not. Dr. Elder is interesting and really cares about the class, but the class was far more theoretical than I had expected. The workload is very reasonable and the course probably won't be a point of stress, but if you don't know what you're getting yourself into you may end up bored. ",
            "\u00a0No. Unless the student really wants to learn about sociology, I would not recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0Depending. It got boring at the end ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Very interesting and a pleasure to take. "
