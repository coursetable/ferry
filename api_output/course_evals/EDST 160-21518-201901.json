As a psych major, I found a lot of this class intuitive, but still enjoyed the course. It's a great way to fulfill the PSYC 140/150/160 requirement.

            "\u00a0Many skills discussed in this course weren't actually developed by the course for the first time--in other words, the course relied heavily on material that was a review of topics taught by AP Psych/PSYC 110. This meant that the course felt more like a review course than anything else, which is confusing considering the instructor recommends taking PSYC 110 before beginning the course. Some new studies were talked about that developed more niche knowledge of social psychology, but overall, for a student who has a very basic background in psychology, there were few new topics broached.

            "\u00a0Strengths: optionally interactive lecture, the \"key\" method of marking important terms, easy to understand test structure and how to study, only a few assignments but thorough\r\nWeaknesses: location (Davies is dark and depressing), time (during 3/4 of lunch), lack of recordings but high volume of information, slides sometimes useless in reviewing (too little text), random selection of terms to actually know from the textbook\r\nImprovements: introduce recordings ",
            "\u00a0This course's major strength is the content: it's so interesting.  It's also structured well: three short papers, one 3-page response, and two midterms -- I think this provides a fair grading distribution in case you do poorly on one thing.  This was Professor Gendron's first time teaching the course, so I'm sure it'll get better in the future -- she's an incredibly smart lady, and it was noticeable in lecture! ",
            "\u00a03 papers were hard to write and come up with ideas for ",
            "\u00a0The course had interesting material but I felt there was too much question and response with the class rather than lecturing and people would not respond and I would have trouble not zoning out. Also, I think way too little time was spent on some important concepts but then too much time on other concepts. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Super interesting material that was often presented clearly. Workload was manageable and I felt well prepared for the exams.\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the assignments like the reading responses were graded quite harshly in my opinion. Some lectures were not very engaging, and most of the class did not seem interested in the lecture ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: lecture flow very clear; very manageable content; integration of current, relevant research with all topics\r\nWeaknesses: Honestly none, but in terms of assignment weight it just seemed imbalanced for the 3-page paper to be worth just as much as the midterm and final, since the paper is only on one topic while the tests cover a whole half of the course content. ",
            "\u00a0If it's possible to move the course out of Davies, that would be ideal. It was very easy to zone out in Davies.\r\nStrengths: accessible material, doable assignments, nice slides (which improved over the course of the semester), good review, great exam reviews in the lecture before each exam\r\nWeaknesses: dry at times, repetition, a lot of summarizing of studies, awkward when professor would ask lecture questions and wait until someone answered ",
            "\u00a0strengths: the lectures are quite solid and the pace of the class is generous; it is fast-paced but not to the point where you lack sufficient time to truly process and understand the information thrown at you\r\n\r\nweaknesses: more information on the slides + clearer explanations of studies; example response papers for reference ",
            "\u00a0Brilliant material and real world application examples. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Instructor is nice, flexible. The papers and assignments are spread out reasonably. \r\nWeaknesses: The PowerPoint slides, while visually appealing, contain little to no information (more of which would be helpful even for someone that attends every lecture). I found that the professor would spend significant amounts of time asking vague, low-ball questions to the class (which would be met with silence more often than not) instead of actually explaining complicated studies in depth. Essentially, we would spend over half of class period \"discussing\" very intuitive, low-level psych concepts and then fly through the conclusions of a complicated study in roughly one minute. Attending lectures often did not feel productive or like a good use of time. The professor was not always very articulate in expressing certain concepts (sometimes very slow in developing an idea, lots of \"ums\").\r\nLikewise, the papers, while straightforward in theory, were accompanied by extremely vague rubrics and harsh grading by the TAs. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: how much the professor cares about her students\r\nWeakness: the class content. I don't think I learned much actually going to the class than to study on my own. I hope that it could be a little fast paced and with ACTUAL dense content. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Gendron was always engaging and easy to speak to. And her lectures were very well organized to facilitate learning. The assignments were all very manageable and well spread out, so not too much stress. I think review sessions before exams should be made longer. ",
            "\u00a0The material is very interesting and fun to learn about! It is important and engaging!\r\n\r\nProf. Gendron did a good job of keeping us engaged, and for this reason, I think that the course would work better as a small lecture, in a smaller lecture hall. Davies Auditorium in the mid-afternoon just feels bleak; we also didn't fill all the seats, so we were spread out and could easily become less engaged. For a class that is about social interactions and person-to-person interactions, I think this class should be even more interactive in its form; a smaller lecture size in small lecture hall would be so beneficial. Similarly, I think that the use of laptops for note-taking in this course should not be allowed. Again, since this class is about social influence, having others on laptops can be a distraction! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Maria Gendron, interesting material ",
            "\u00a0The course had some really interesting material. I wish wed been able to relate concepts wed covered to more salient events around us though as opposed to just using studies to illustrate them ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were that it was a nice lecture that helped me learn a lot of information. The professor and TAs seem nice and approachable. A big strength was that the instructor responds really well to feedback, and it was clear to see when the class would change a little based on the class's responses. Sometimes it was confusing, but it isn't really a weakness anymore because it there was effort made to clear up any confusions. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the curriculum of the course was very appropriate. The material did not get repetitive or boring. ",
            "\u00a0It can get soooo boring even if youre interested in psychology. They need to find a way to make it more engaging ",
            "\u00a0I liked lecture a lot and was always engaged with the material. The writing responses to psychological studies were also fun, giving me a chance to relate the course material to topics that interested me. The final writing assignment seemed too heavily graded for how straightforward it was. ",
            "\u00a0Lecture itself was a bit disengaging and slow. Professor Gendron often asked for commentary from the class in a way that was unproductive and time-consuming. The content itself is quite interesting, but lecture could be improved if delivered in a more lively and engaging manner. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: the professors enthusiasm about the subject\r\nWeaknesses: the degree of overlap between intro psych and social psych. It would have been nice if the focus was mainly on those studies and concepts not covered in intro psych or other psych classes.the feedback on the reading responses was relatively sparse. ",
            "\u00a0The subject matter is a big strength. I think social psychology is super interesting and applicable. The lectures lacked energy and clarity and made the class unenjoyable and tough to follow. ",
            "\u00a0Teacher could be a better lecturer, more enthusiastic and engaging and lively. Class was very easy to be bored with, and too much of the information seemed liked conjecture and lacked evidence to back up hypotheticals. Class could be faster paced with clearer objectives, and much more engaging. ",
            "\u00a0The assignments and assessments were very fair. Sometimes, I found the lecture style not the most engaging. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course is definitely the material, as we cover a lot of the popular research and nearly all of it is relevant to everyday life. The workload is also pretty light, and Professor Gendron and the TAs were all very approachable and willing to help. I think a weakness of this course, which is true for a lot of intro-level classes, is that we weren't able to go very in-depth with anything before we had to move on, so it often felt very surface level. ",
            "\u00a0It would be great if we were assigned to a specific TA, so that we know whom we could reach out to when we have questions.\r\nIt would be best if emails were replied.\r\nDifferent cultural perspectives were incorporated into the course, which is really great. However, the course is still heavily based on the American cultural context, which may make international students a little hard to follow in some studies.\r\nStudy guides were great and clear. The lecture contents were well-organised.\r\nMore reminders (verbal, written and CANVAS announcement) should be given when there is a deadline/exam data change. It was quite confusing to see the exam date on the syllabus changed but there were no accompanying announcement elsewhere. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the lecture setting and course structure\r\nMajor weakness was somewhat arbitrary grading of papers ",
            "\u00a0Course felt monotonous. Dr. Gendron spent too much time in class asking questions to the group. This may have been engaging for the few that would answer, but it felt like a waste of time. Also, for whatever reason the course was not taught in an exciting way. Maybe because Dr. Gendron would simply present concepts at the surface level and not go in depth? Lectures felt slow and got to be quite boring at the end of the semester. When Dr. Hirsch came for a guest lecture, she moved at a much more engaging pace. It helps to feel like you need to pay close attention to keep up. This I think keeps the lecture exciting. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very well organized flow of lectures, good lecturer, interesting subject material\r\nWeaknesses: none really, in my opinion. Solid class. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: grading system, breadth of material, easy to follow structure\r\nweaknesses: lectures can be more engaging, material to review for tests can be clearer ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the content and found it to be captivating. I thought the presentation of the material was a little bit repetitive and think it would have been more captivating if Professor Gendron had mixed up some different ways of lecturing. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the professor!!!! She responds extremely well to feedback and her style of lecturing works extremely well for the content. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The professor's slides were clear and easy to study. The course progression made sense and told a coherent narrative. The exams were fair in what they asked. \r\nWeaknesses: We didn't have much guidance on the response papers, and the TA's varied greatly in how they graded our papers. I didn't like how we had to buy a $100+ textbook that we barely used. Many of the studies we learned about seemed simplistic or pseudoscientific, especially the studies about the effects of culture on a person's behavior or outlook (There's no such thing as a generic \"East Asian\" cultural context). ",
            "\u00a0The writing assignments were frankly, stupid. Its really hard to summarize an article, give your thoughts and observations, and supply a new insight all in one page. Likewise, the grading rubric was insanely vague, which liberated the TF's to be harsh with grading. Gendron is an incredible lecturer, but her tests and assignments were convoluted and frustrating. The TF's did not give any proper advice as to how to make the next writing assignment better, yet they expected some incomprehensible standard. My TF was impossible to meet with and stopped responding to my emails. The course information was great, but the support for students was lacking. ",
            "\u00a0could focus a bit more heavily on the aspects of human thoughts/behavior that social psychology studies and experiments have elucidated; could spend less time discussing the aspects of human nature that can be learned from folk knowledge and daily observations ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are that it goes beyond what you learn about social psychology in introductory psych classes and that it makes an effort to get you to apply what you've learned to real life. However, I felt at times that the instructor spent a lot of time on the philosophy of social psychological research (as opposed to philosophy of research in general, which is of course very important to study). I'm sure that this is useful to people who will actually study psychology for a living, but for people like me who merely want to use it in their careers (in my case, medicine), the way that the textbook focused heavily on application of concepts was far more useful. On that note, the textbook for the course was fabulous and I strongly encourage its continued use. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Great survey for those of varying levels of psychology experience. A lovely critical approach to some of the biases/trends in psychology (e.g. WEIRD psych). \r\nWeaknesses: I wish it were more rigorous. \r\nMixed bag: The interactiveness of lecture is a great idea, but I think it led Prof. Gendron to some more stagnant places (in terms of patience). I believe there is a way to make it work, though! ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were pretty dry, but the material was easy. I also wish we couldve gotten the assignments back faster and feedback on what we did wrong on them ",
            "\u00a0I loved the professor. She is passionate about what she teaches and you cant help but also get excited about the material. ",
            "\u00a0The course covered a wide breadth of information and Dr. Gendron was very clear about what we were expected to know for the final.\r\n\r\nThe lectures themselves were not very engaging. Mostly she would read the slides and textbook definitions, or ask open-ended or leading questions to the lecture hall and wait for an answer, which didn't seem like it would be helpful for our learning even if people were willing to answer. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Dr. Gendron is a fantastic professor! Her slides are clear, but in lecture, she breaks them down further so learning is facilitated.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This class certainly needs to have a discussion section, so that we get to talk to TFs and fellow students in a structured setting. There was practically no way to know why my grades broke down the way they did, aside from office hours, which can interfere with my schedule. ",
            "\u00a0This course was pretty poorly taught. The slides were hard to read, the lectures weren't well organized and it made it hard to learn anything new. ",
            "\u00a0This course covers a lot of interesting material while raising important questions about some of the problems that we see in society (e.g., prejudice, aggression). It could, however, be improved by having a more organized structure. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very detailed information, good powerpoints\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish more was emphasized on the results and significance of experiments, sometimes it got confusing. ",

            "\u00a0No, because the lectures were slow ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. It was very engaging and provided thoughtful answers to otherwise unintuitive social psych phenomena. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great intro to psych for anyone interested, a great review for psych students, and a great break for non-psych students. It is very accessible. ",
            "\u00a0YES! take it with Professor Gendron! ",
            "\u00a0If you are a psych major and are looking for an interesting course to take for a social science credit/core, take this class! it is quite intriguing to learn why people act the way they do when they are in social situations versus when they are alone. The course gives you a lot of insight into those around you and yourself. You can't help but apply all the information you've learned from the class to every social situation you are in, as the connections are everywhere. ",
            "\u00a0No, I would not recommend this course to another student. Though the professor is friendly, there are so many wonderful psychology courses at Yale (including other intro level courses) that would be much more fulfilling. Especially if a student has already taken AP Psych in high school or PSYC 110, this course will often feel like review and therefore a waste of time. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly, no. I love the professor. She's one of the kindest people I've met. But, if you were to ask me was it worth your time and tuition, I'd recommend you a different course ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely. You'll get draw into the material quickly. It's also very manageable work wise. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Great for a psych or cog sci major ",
            "\u00a0YES! Awesome class!! ",
            "\u00a0Easy class, interesting topic ",
            "\u00a0Sure ",
            "\u00a0Yes Professor is great and content is interesting ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend taking this course. For someone who has not taken a psychology class before, this course is a great way to be introduced to the subject. I had a lot of friends who took Introduction to Psychology (PSYC 110) and I think the material in this class is more specific and more interesting for about the same workload. I also think that compared to PSYC 110, it is a lot easier to access the TAs and the professor, which was very useful for me because it was my first time taking such a course. ",
            "\u00a0No, it was really boring and I didnt like how the professor lectured. Take abnormal psychology instead. Also, 1 page response papers are really difficult to write because theres simply not enough room to hit all the points on the rubric and then they grade you hard and its pointless. ",
            "\u00a0If you like psychology, this is a great course to relate it to many everyday problems. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I enjoyed the class. ",
            "\u00a0The course is relatively interesting and workload incredibly light, so I would recommend this as a fifth class to another student. However, as a whole, it was not a particularly engaging or fulfilling course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0It's a good, slightly easier alternative to Introduction to Psychology, if you're not interested in the major. Covers the basic topics and their application to social interactions. ",
            "\u00a0Potentially. If the student has never taken psych, this is a great class to take. I found that the section on stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination was the most fascinating and society relevant in todays age. However, if the person has already taken intro psych, much of this is a review. Also this class is pretty low work so that should be taken into consideration. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend! ",
            "\u00a0It's hard to say. The material is interesting, but Dr. Gendron's lectures were so dry that I stopped going to class because it was too hard to pay attention or gain anything useful. More could be learned by reviewing the textbook on your own time, which is a real shame because the material had so much potential. ",
            "\u00a0No. It was the worst class Ive ever taken at Yale. The lecture was horrendously organized and shared - very little could be gleaned from the lecture slides. The lectures were extremely dry. ",
            "\u00a0Not really unless you want a decently easy grade. The teacher is really helpful when you ask for help but the material and the way the material is presented itself is quite boring. ",
            "\u00a0If someone is looking for an easy course, this would be the one to take. However, effort does have to be put into the assignments in order to come out with a good grade. I ended up realizing that I am not very interested in psychology, but this might be a good course for someone who is curious about this topic. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. The concepts covered are really interesting and are easy to see playing out in your everyday life, and we got to touch on a lot of phenomena surrounding group dynamics that are relevant to our current political climate. The workload is low, with just three reading responses, two non-cumulative exams, and one short paper. Some of it can be redundant if you have taken intro psych, but if you enjoyed the social portion of that class, then this will be a good, somewhat more in-depth treatment of that material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!!!! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this makes a great fifth class and has a super minimal workload.  The one hold up is that the grades you get on the papers can seem kind of random based on which TF grades them, so whether you get an A/A-/B+ can be pretty unpredictable regardless of how much effort you put in ",
            "\u00a0No, I think one could learn the concepts taught in the course by simply reading the textbook and not going to lectures. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah! Interesting subject material and lecturer on top of being a well-run class. Go for it. ",
            "\u00a0I think the class provides a good overview of what social psychology entails. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend, especially with this professor. I looked forward to the class every day. ",
            "\u00a0It's an interesting class, but a lot of the studies overlap with studies from Intro Psychology, Intro Cog Sci, Psych and the Good Life, and Game Theory. It's just that the studies are presented in slightly different ways. The class isn't too hard. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, Gendron is a great instructor, and the course material is very relevant to daily life. ",
            "\u00a0I would because it helps clarify how qualities of human nature (qualities that many people may not be aware of) underlie some of the issues we see in the world. I am interested in nutrition and food systems, and various aspects of this class helped me better understand issues in these fields. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to better understand the social world, then yes, absolutely! I took it because I'm pre-med and needed a psychology class but didn't want to do intro psych since I had already done AP Psych in high school. I chose this class in particular because I wanted to make sure that I better understood (1) how to interact with patients and (2) how broader social structures can influence their health. I think this class helped me accomplish both of these goals to a reasonable degree. ",
            "\u00a0I would, if they have not taken many psych classes before. ",
            "\u00a0Sure ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This was my favorite class this semester. ",
            "\u00a0Nope. It wasn't very interesting and though it was easy it was hard to enjoy because of the lecture structure ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course because it gives an opportunity to students to think about many social issues that can be traced to psychological phenomena. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0No I would not. The grading seemed very unorganized and not uniform throughout my assignments. Was not very easy to engage in this class. ",
            "\u00a0I think I would recommend the course to people who had no experience with Psychology, and those who wanted an easy course. I wouldn't recommend it to people who really care about the field of psychology, or those who want to learn a lot. "
