            "\u00a0What it means to be a global firm;the challenges faced by multinational corporations and national governments; insight as to how foreign capital affects local citizens ",
            "\u00a0I learned what I expected to learn and more.  We first learned frameworks and theories that were useful in understanding the interactions between global firms and national governments, and then got to apply them by learning about cases.  The case presentations and discussions were the best part of the class. ",
            "\u00a0Discussion skills, argumentation and writing. I leanred a lot about real life cases related to multinationals and governments. ",
            "\u00a0Far and away my favorite course this semester. I learned so much about what host countries need to do to ensure that foreign direct investment benefits them. What is more, for someone that someday hopes to start my own MNC and work in developing countries, this information was particularly relevant and helpful. ",
            "\u00a0This course gives you a very good understanding of how politics and FDI are intertwined ",
            "\u00a0I primarily learned about general principles that apply to multinational corporations and host countries in general. ",
            "\u00a0The class is an excellent overview of the implications of foreign direct investment and its consequences on its recipients. The class examines the relationship between multinational corporations and governments of both developed and developing countries. In this class I learned how to look at globalization and FDI for multiple perspective which gave me a holistic approach to this phenomena. "

            "\u00a0The experience of the teacher can be seen in everyhing that is selected and discussed. Topics are awesome. The onky weakness that i can tell is that the Professor is sometimes hard to understand and his grading can be a little harsh. ",
            "\u00a0S:\r\n\r\n-Professor LaPalombara is a savant at this stuff\r\n-I like the lecture style format of the first half of the semester\r\n-The readings and cases are fascinating and salient\r\n\r\nW:\r\n\r\n-The discussion format of the second half of the semester sometimes felt forced and like it lacked guidance ",
            "\u00a0The class teaches about the costs and benefits of foreign direct investment and multinational trade. The strongest aspects of the class are the student presentations followed by discussion of the presentations and assigned readings. A potential area for improvement is a discussion that requires all the students to participate equally. "

            "\u00a0This is great course to learn more about how multinational corporations function and the daily challenges of multinational managers face in the decision making process. The combination of lecture style learning and applying lessons to case-based practicums allowed me to internalize the course material and apply it. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this class if you have an interest in international business or global development. The work is challenging but very rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, Professor LaP is so full of experience and insightfelt truly fortunate to take a class with this living legend. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course, what is taught is a must know!! ",
            "\u00a0A really fascinating course that looks at foreign direct investment, and how host countries and multinational corporations can both do a better job of handling it. Professor LaPalombara has consulted for host countries and multinational corporations alike across the globe and sometimes incorporates his experiences into the course. He is very sharp and has been teaching the course for 40+ years. I highly recommend taking it. \r\n\r\nThe readings are hefty but worth going through them. And, if you don't, it's not the end of the world because he rarely calls on people during seminar. 3 shorts papers and a straightforward final exam otherwise. ",
            "\u00a0Professor LaPalombara is a must ",
            "\u00a0A few weeks in I considered dropping the class  many students in the seminar chose to drop  but I was ultimately very glad I stayed. I learned more in this seminar than in any other. The material was very interesting to me, and Prof LaP has seen and learned so much that his insights are especially valuable. ",
            "\u00a0YES! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to everyone who is curious to understand how politics and economics of the globalized world work. "
