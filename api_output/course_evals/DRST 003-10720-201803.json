            "\u00a0Prior to coming to Yale, I'd never really encountered philosophy, so this course was a good introduction to reading, analyzing, and writing about philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0How to contribute to philosophical discussion, how to write a philosophy paper, argument mapping. Helped me realize I really love philosophy ",
            "\u00a0I learned logic and a way to organize my thoughts in a clear, succinct manner. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think about and write about philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0Formulating a strong philosophical argument; basics of writing a philosophy paper; introduction to most foundations of early philosophical thought from ancient Greek to Abrahamic; openly participating in class; bringing my own perspectives to challenge philosophical ideas ",
            "\u00a0I developed a solid grasp of the fathers of philosophy, Plato and Aristotle, as well as other pioneers of the ancient philosophical world, from Epicurus to Sextus Empiricus. We also looked at Maimonides and Aquinas in the Middle Ages. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to create argument maps, develop linear, supported arguments, and close read a text. I learned how to attack individual points in an argument map to undermine the conclusion, how to think about both sides of an argument by objecting and writing a response to my own objection, and ways to consider whether an argument is logically valid or not. I also learned to look for nuance in arguments (I hadn't considered that the Theory of Recollection is different in the Meno than in the Phaedo until Prof. Dembroff pointed it out. They always did a great job pointing out the small details of arguments that we may not have noticed.) ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about how to think about and write for philosophy (I had never taken a philosophy class before), as well as learning about centuries of influential Western philosophical thought. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to summarize and evaluate philosophical works and how to discuss them with peers. ",
            "\u00a0Philosophical thinking, argumentation, writing clear and concise philosophical papers, argument mapping, synthesis of complex philosophical texts ",
            "\u00a0DS Philosophy gives an amazing background for any kind of future philosophy classes. I had absolutely no philosophy background before taking this course, but now, it's turned into one of my favorite subjects. You learn how to make argument maps for a specific claim, figure out why a specific claim depends on a specific premise, and delve into big philosophical questions. Does God exist? Can it even be proven? What's the nature of time? Of our soul? Of the good? One thing that was emphasized is that these questions weren't just for Aristotle or Socrates or Aquinas. They're still relevant to our life today, and they'll never stop affecting us. ",
            "\u00a0Classical philosophy, argument summarizing, extracting the premises of an argument ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about the defining philosophical ideas that define the Western tradition from Plato to Aquinas. ",
            "\u00a0The main skills I learned were learning to break down an argument and to not take claims for granted. Philosophy really made me question everything and understand the fundamentals of a good argument. Things we take for granted, like the existence of things, was questioned in this course and it really taught me to approach academic discussion with the mindset that I am here to learn from others. "

            "\u00a0Reading level is very reasonable. Could be benefited (like all DS courses) by more comparison across texts ",
            "\u00a0Honestly, I really enjoyed this class. I think it could've been very confusing if I had a different professor, but Dembroff was amazing. ",
            "\u00a0The course was good. I think its largely dependent on your professor and your classmates. The content is generally interesting, although sometimes the syllabus lingers for a little longer than it seems like it needs to in particular thinkers. ",
            "\u00a0I found this course to be very engaging. I think it could be improved by adjusting the pacing of the readings; for example, I found the fact that we read three completely separate texts for a single class to be quite off. I would have preferred to cut back on some of the more extended discussions on single readings, i.e. some of the Aristotle readings on Categories and Physics, in lieu of taking more time with some others. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - The readings were manageable and fruitful. ",
            "\u00a0The chronological progression of the course enhanced my understanding of each philosopher and the predecessors on which he built. The seminar structure was particularly conducive to learning about different philosophers, and the course generally felt less rushed than my other Directed Studies classes, which I appreciated. Also, Prof. Dembroff ran the course in such a way that we progressed from discussing arguments as an entire class (at the beginning of the term) to dividing into smaller clusters to discuss and then share with the group; as a result, we gradually gained greater independence and better understanding of philosophers' arguments as well as the ideas themselves. ",
            "\u00a0I felt that this course, and Prof. Dembroff especially, really taught me how to be a better thinker and philosopher.  Prof. Dembroff's course seems to me to be unparalleled in their focus on teaching how to think, not what to think.  The only weakness I can say is that sometimes we got stuck on small or unimportant questions that hindered us in covering a lot of material--but I felt that I came out of this semester with a very solid understanding of all the thinkers we studied.  Couldn't think of a better way to be introduced to serious philosophy than Prof. Dembroff's course. ",
            "\u00a0This course felt like an actual seminar. Professor Dembroff was especially inclusive; they were an amazing first philosophy instructor. I felt that everyone had a voice in the discussions. We talked to each other about our ideas and the authors, not just to the professor. Professor Dembroff was very clear about their standards for the course the start. We received handouts on how to participate in and lead philosophical discussions, as well as how to write our first papers. \r\n\r\nMy biggest issue with the course is that we didn't have a formal argument mapping and logic lesson until about a month in. In the meantime, we still used philosophy terminology without knowing exactly what it meant. It would've been helpful to have that skill from the beginning. ",
            "\u00a0The wide variety of philosophical texts on the syllabus kept the course engaging. On the other hand, the lack of secondary resources made it difficult at times to delve deeper into specific philosophical arguments. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Dembroff was by far this course's greatest strength: they set high standards for myself and my peers, which constantly pushed us to not only make contributions, but meaningful contributions, during class. I would say that the class' greatest weakness is the unavoidable D.S. problem of not being able to spend enough time on certain texts. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course is that we broke down arguments on the board and made a point of taking notes on nearly every text we read. This really helped my understanding of the texts. This course also taught me the difference between a valid argument and a true argument. A strength of this course is that it exposed me to a new form of writing. I had never before written a philosophy paper, and the straightforward approach actually helped me be more clear and concise in other DS writing assignments. I think a main weakness of this course is that we go through material too quickly and we do not get to discuss everything we read. The philosophy reading was particularly dense, so the speed at which we read the material actually slowed my learning. "

            "\u00a0Yes- the reading list is comprehensive and interesting ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I had a lot of fun with this class and it's really good if you like philosophy, questioning life, and/or being able to think clearly. ",

            "\u00a0Yes! This was my favorite class I took this year. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. I found this course to be a very enjoyable and informative introduction to philosophy as an academic subject, particularly with Prof. Dembroff's teaching. ",
            "\u00a0Yes; Professor Dembroff is an amazing professor who gives clear feedback and teaches us helpful concepts about philosophy. This was my first philosophy class and I really enjoyed it. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely.  Prof. Dembroff is a gem at Yale, and their teaching, even of subjects that are difficult or even annoying (read: Sextus), is fantastic. ",
            "\u00a0This course provides such an important background for anyone interested in philosophy. You learn how the same patterns of thoughts and theories have progressed since the very first philosophers, the likes of Socrates and Plato, to religious thinkers like Maimonides and Aquinas. There's a very clear progression in complexity and thought; you can see how each philosopher builds on their predecessors to form a distinct school of thought.\r\n\r\nThat being said, it IS a lot of work. Be prepared for some very big readings, both in thought density and number of pages. Aristotle especially is hard to get through, but everything afterwards is amazing and fun to discuss. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, purely for Professor Dembroffs teaching. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student who wants a survey of the major philosophical ideas that make up the early part of the Western tradition. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I think everyone should take a philosophy class because it really does improve argumentative skills. This is less about the class and more about my class in particular, but Professor Dembroff was an awesome teacher and my class dynamic was always entertaining while productive. "
