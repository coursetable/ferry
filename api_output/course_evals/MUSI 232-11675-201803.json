            "\u00a0I learned to play various instruments of the Javanese Gamelan, and I learned the broad cultural context of which it is a part -- religious, colonial, global, local, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Learned how to play gamelan and learned the roots of Javanese culture. Very insightful readings and journals. ",
            "\u00a0We learned how to play traditional Javanese Gamelan instruments, mostly xylophones and gongs. We also learned about the important role of the performing arts in Java and greater Indonesia, as the music traditionally accompanies a play or a dance. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about Indonesian history and culture as well as how to play different instruments in the gamelan ensemble. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about Indonesian culture and music. ",
            "\u00a0Of course, how to play a few instruments in the gamelan and insights into both the history and modern understandings of the ensemble as well as its context in Indonesia. Learned how to blend into an ensemble, listen, and feel like a part of a larger gamelan-playing community. ",
            "\u00a0Learned how to play Gamelan instruments and learned a TON about Indonesia. Perfect course, in my opinion. Most applicable knowledge, interestingly enough, and really opens your mind. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much both culturally and musically. It was a great experience and a tremendous semester all around. I learned how to play a complex array of instruments and learned what it takes to make an ensemble. "

            "\u00a0The work load is very chill and the readings are interesting. As someone with a limited music background, it was so much fun learning an instrument and not just studying from texts! ",
            "\u00a0There are many strengths to this course: it was such a breath of fresh air! I had a really wonderful time playing the different instruments and getting to know everybody in the class.  Also, the cultural aspect was really nice as I learned so many things about Indonesia. The main thing for improvement is that sometimes Maho could explain things about how to play the instruments and songs more clearly when we learn a new song and it would greatly improve our ability to play correctly. ",
            "\u00a0This was by far the best class I have taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Perfect course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- So fun, such a perfect musical break in an overwhelming schedule. Readings were very thorough and taught a lot. Maho is perfect and so good at teaching you from scratch while reminding you constantly of the cultural aspects of playing Gamelan. People in the class were fun too. Maybe more class bonding could work? ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - very organized, great teacher, great class culturally - learn a lot about the history of Indonesia and music. "

            "\u00a0Absoutely take this class. The way it's set up, you spend about 15-20 minutes discussing readings o Tuesday, and the rest of the day and all day Thursday you learn repertoire. There are weekly reading responses (very short -- I always found myself writing more than required because it was all so interesting). \r\nthis class brought calm to my schedule and I can't recommend it enough! Make sure you come to the first class as there is a short application due to its popularity. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Take this class. You will learn a lot about gamelan and Javanese culture. Maho is an amazing and caring professor and the workload is very manageable. ",
            "\u00a0This class is amazing and I left every session feeling better than when I walked in. Maho is so kind, the classroom environment is very positive, and there is no way to quantify how fun it is to play these instruments for a few hours a week. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class! It is a joyful and enriching experience. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. There is nothing to lose and everything to gain. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Who wouldn't want to take a course in which you play in an ensemble requiring no background musical skill, learn from Maho and Masdar (an honor!), and come away with deeper understanding of the gamelan in Java and Indonesia? ",
            "\u00a0YES! You will love it and learn a ton. We also met the SULTAN of Yoygakarta and princesses! You get so much exposure to a culture that is amazing and fulfilling to learn about. You learn a lot-- seriously. This is not just a gut. You get so much out of it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, It is a very interesting class that is also a lot of fun. You meet some awesome people that have similar interests and want to learn about Javanese music. ",
