            "\u00a0I learned many thins that are covered in Math 112 ad Math 115. ",

            "\u00a0I learned how to think more creatively and learned a lot about mathematical models. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of new and intriguing ways to apply math to questions in the natural sciences, including an extensive grasp on using differential equations to model the properties of various earth and life systems. I also gained a fundamental knowledge of calculus techniques in integration, as well as solving and visualizing differential systems. ",

            "\u00a0The course was well organized and the teacher did a good job teaching. The problemsets were challenging, but there was only one due a week. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are the way that this was taught. The only weakness with the course was the timing as I feel like it would be better suited as a Mon, Wed, Fri class. It always felt like it had been years between Thursday and Tuesday. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include the relevance of the content we learned. However, papers we read often included extra information that was confusing and not too relevant to what we were learning. ",
            "\u00a0Good class, highlight for me were the readings, which really applied concepts we were learning to actual biological phenomena. The first psets were a little tedious but they got better as the course progressed. ",
            "\u00a0I didn't like the readings, however I think that John was an amazing teacher. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course does a good job marrying somewhat abstract math concepts with real-world applications in physiology, chemistry, agriculture, and so much more. I also think the course moves a pace that does not overwhelm you, but brisk enough that you would be surprised how much material gets covered in a semester. The support network is also pretty extensive. In terms of improvements, the course PSets were often challenging but did not necessarily reinforce what was taught in class, and I would have appreciated PSet questions on the readings to help reinforce the main takeaways from each article. ",
            "\u00a0The pace of this course was too fast. There was a brand new lesson every single day with little to no time to review past concepts. Much of the concepts were too abstract to understand within a 75 minute time span. The course required a basic calculus 1 background but it became clear that the only students who grasped the material and were able to succeed in the course had a lot of experience in physics and chemistry as well. The range of subject experience in the course was too high for a class with only about 10 people. For instance, on the midterm one student received a near perfect score, meanwhile another received a failing score. With much of the class receiving lower end scores. It felt that the course required students to be at a higher standard than what was said on the syllabus. If the only way to succeed in the class was to have had more experience, I would've never took the course, I expected to succeed with only a basic calculus background, as stated on the course requirements, but clearly was not during the course. Additionally, considering the small class size, you would expect that the students would be much more engaged and have a better understanding but that was clearly not the case. Many times I would find myself looking around the class to see if others were just as lost as I was, and it did give me some comfort that I was not the only one, however, I wish the course wasn't like that. Additionally, in-class examples were simplistic meanwhile problem set assignments were much much harder than what was taught in class.  The material taught in this course was way ahead of what my peers were learning in their math classes. Altogether, I felt out of place in this course with little hope to succeed. ",
            "\u00a0The class was difficult and demanded lots of review out of class but was by far more interesting and had a better support network than math 115. "

            "\u00a0This course is great for students who prefer infrequent testing and homework that is challenging but not time consuming if you understand it. However, given that there are only two tests including the final and one quiz, it isn't great for students who prefer to have more breathing room for the occasional bad test grade. ",
            "\u00a0Good course for students looking to pursue biological sciences, as mathematical modeling can be applied to a large variety of topics, as seen during the course. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class instead of 115! Heck, take this instead of 120 if your major will allow it. Smaller class size, easier curve, concepts were taught well. Make sure to make a group for psets to check over or else you'll lose points for dumb mistakes. ",
            "\u00a0It's interesting, but hard and fast paced. Ofen I felt left behind and too afraid to ask questions. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. While the course does have a life science spin to it, it covers the basic inventory of calculus tools you would need in later calculus classes. The reading assignments are interesting and are a unique twist to a math course, and I think that they improvement the enjoyment of this course. ",
            "\u00a0No, I would never recommend this course to anyone. The amount of stress and anxiety this course gave me was too much. I expected to be challenged, since I know most STEM courses at Yale are already difficult to take on, but this was overwhelmingly difficult. I would not recommend this class to other first years like me. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend math 116 over math 115. "
