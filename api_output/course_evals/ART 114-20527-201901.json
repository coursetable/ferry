I am especially self-conscious of my drawings (as I know they are not particularly good) but taking this course was a really good way for me to start to get over that. ",

            "\u00a0I absolutely recommend this course  as a non-visual artist, there was a lot for me to learn about drawing, and Rob made it enjoyable and comfortable. You'll learn concrete skills that'll make you a much better drawer, and you'll also gain a lot of confidence. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you are interested in learning to draw and learning about art from a very knowledgeable professor. If you are taking this class hoping to learn drawing in a traditional way, this might not be the right class for you. We did not get any formal instruction in how to draw depth or proportions, for example, and I would have appreciated a little guidance in that. However, Professor Storr made a compelling case for why that's not the best way to learn how to draw. The class is pretty laid-back and not a lot of work, just make sure to keep up with your daily sketchbook. ",

            "\u00a0Definitely- great for learning about myself, setting aside time to draw, and learning a new skill! ",
