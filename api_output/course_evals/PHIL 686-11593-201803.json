            "\u00a0An understanding of Kant's third critique, and also - I hope - some sensitivity in reading Kant. ",

            "\u00a0This class has read Kant's third critique very closely. I have learned a great deal about Kant's doctrine and German Idealism. I can also start reading other philosophical works from Kant more independently. "

        [
            "\u00a0It was great. Good, interesting and inspiring explanations about the text, interesting questions for discussion, kind and encouraging responses to students. Good balance of explanations of the text to enable and open a discussion, student's presentations and open discussion. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated most the slow readings of the third critique. The end of the course was a bit fast, and I think much of it went past me. I would've preferred to have focused more deeply on a single thread of response. ",
            "\u00a0This course has a clear structure and offers a great interpretation of Kant's third critique. As a student from architecture, it certainly provides a fascinating entrance to the philosophical discourse. In the last section of the course, we discuss why and how Kant's third critique matters for the contemporary discourse. I wish discussions like this could come up more often in the previous sections. "

            "\u00a0Yes, from the reasons mentioned above. It was a wonderful course, both on the level of learning to understand the fascinating text - one of the greatest to be found in the tradition of human culture - and of encouraging thinking. The professor was very knowledgeable, clearly was very interested in the text and invested in making it understandable and interesting for the students, and also encouraging and kind. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I would recommend this course to another student. However, without previous knowledge of Kant's critical philosophy, it can be very hard, to begin with. "
