            "\u00a0I learned about different theories and approaches to international relations. It helped me to analyze IR issues in a structured way, applying the knowledge I received in the course. I learned about the benefits, as well as the limitations of these approaches, and how they complement and contest each other. In the second part of the semester, I applied this knowledge to the analysis of specific IR problems. ",
            "\u00a0I developed my skills relevant to learning international security (or somewhat broadly IR) theories and how they can be adopted to view certain international political events or phenomena. Also, I became a bit more familiar with how historians seek to explain particular international political contexts or specific war types. On the first half of the course, we learned about IR theories and how they can provide various angles to IR research. On the second half, we addressed specific international security topics in light of those IR theories, and how we can analyze given subjects with theories, formal frameworks, as well as historical and diplomatic cases. These were all relevant to my academic development as a student whose primary interest is international security. ",
            "\u00a0I got a thorough overview of the IR landscape, with special attention to security studies, and developed familiarity with both the content and context of IR research. ",
            "\u00a0A better understanding of foundational texts in IR and practical applications of theory to relevant topics ",
            "\u00a0- Intl Security theories - realism, liberalism, constructivism, etc. \r\n-Definitions of power, institutions, beliefs, norms, etc.\r\n-Learned to understand theories through empirical studies and also case studies\r\n-Learned to look at current events and international security through a more structured and theoretical lens ",
            "\u00a0Grade knowledge of the theory and topics in the field of international security. ",
            "\u00a0We surveyed the breadth of international relations theory and the international security issues related to interstate conflict. "

            "\u00a0There are no weaknesses in this course, in my opinion. It is very well-structured. The assignments help reinforce the knowledge I received from readings and class discussions. All of the readings are paramount for understanding of the issues discussed in the course. ",
            "\u00a0Reading group was particularly helpful whenever IR concepts we dealt with that week in the class are percolated into the reading(s) for the reading group. And the course is pretty well-organized in terms of topics. Another helpful aspect for me was that the course syllabus, coupled with the IR field exam reading list, contains a very neat list of what IR students need to read, and I would say that is a very helpful guideline for me particularly.\r\n\r\nOne potential addition to the course would be related to empirical studies. Since we learned about theoretical and historical IR studies and their advantages and potential disadvantages (when approached mistakenly), it would be good to see how current empirical IR research can contribute to the literature or can produce misleading perspectives\r\n\r\nFor example, the debate about the decline of war can be naively approached with empirical records. Without considering the development of war technologies, threshold for defining wars in available datasets, nuclear revolution, and many other aspects, such approach might generate some counterintuitive interpretations when compared to interpretations stemming from historical trajectories. ",
            "\u00a0Other students could have been encouraged to talk more, and more female authors could have been included.\r\n\r\nThe course material was engaging, the pedagogical style productive (for me, personally), and the coursework manageable and mostly useful.\r\n\r\nThe reading group was a nice supplement; not too much additional reading and good to engage with recent scholarship. ",
            "\u00a0The reading load was a bit onerous--I would have preferred to read more in-depth, instead of skimming, but the volume of reading required skimming. Also, the closed book nature of the final exam was not helpful--unlike a comp exam, we did not have enough time to compile our study materials and memorize everything. Instead we had to do slapdash cramming of the material at the end of the semester and then hope that we retained enough to do ok on the exam. I think that it would have been much better to have an open book exam so that we could write more comprehensive answers to the exam questions. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: excellent syllabus, excellent instructor\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the reading was a little overwhelming.  I think I started off in the hole because I didn't know what I was getting myself into in terms of reading and understanding theory, and I really struggled to pick it back up from there.  I would recommend at least one class in the beginning going over what makes a good theory or things to look for in all the academic readings - essentially how to go about reading all the reading we did (this might not apply to the poli sci PhD students, they didn't seem to have any trouble).  \r\nAdditionally, the class was structured to go over theories first and then topics in international security. Sometimes at the beginning I don't think we had decided on if we were going to try to understand the theory, or immediately compare it with other theories.  I think I got something out of every class, but because they were all always structured a little differently I sometimes had issues understanding the actual content of the readings because analyzing and comparing it.\r\nFinally, there were some students in the class who overpowered everyone else.  I think that the varying levels of knowledge that individuals had made it difficult for everyone to participate in the class. Some individuals made frequent comments on everything but the readings, only comparing it to their outside work which wasn't helpful.  Sometimes the class operated on too high a level for everyone to understand and I think that's why participation was a bit low at times. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the seminar + reading group format of reading the 'classics' in class and then discussing a more recent piece on the same topic during the reading group. ",
            "\u00a0I truly enjoyed the discussion format of the course. I must confess that I hesitated to contribute due at least partly to the display of academic bona fides by the second year PhD students. Often these students invoked readings and issues that we did not cover in class and that I was not familiar with. From time to time it felt like these students took the conversation completely off track, making it difficult for other students to contribute. Professor Monteiro attempted to correct this dynamic but I think the class struggled to get out of the rut that we fell into in the beginning of the year. "

            "\u00a0Yes! This course really helped me to systematize my thinking on international realations. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Even if for those non-IR students, this class would still help in light of logical development of your ideas. One aspect of this course is that Professor Monteiro is very keen to help students think logically with available information and write coherently. It is good to have this kind of training, although the learning process can be intellectually painful. ",
            "\u00a0For anyone interested in IR, this class is necessary. ",
            "\u00a0Everyone has a theory of international relations. Not everyone can articulate their theory, and most people's theories suffer from serious inconsistencies, but everyone nonetheless has intuitions and beliefs about the way states interact. This course offers students a way to systematically analyze the main theories of IR, enabling students to develop their own understanding of foreign affairs and to better critique foreign policy strategies around the world. The reading is extensive and rigorous, but Professor Monteiro serves as an incredible guide through the IR canon. Monteiro is an extremely powerful thinker and scholar who is deeply dedicated to his students and this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Nuno is a great instructor and the material is engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - this class was the most challenging class I've taken at Yale but I learned the most from it and my way of thinking has developed incredibly. I also liked the reading groups - I think they were better than class sometimes but maybe because there was only one reading for each class. ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in international relations. There is a substantial reading load per week, but this gives students a solid survey of major debates in international security. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone involved in the fields of security or foreign policy. We all evaluate security issues from our limited perspective. This course was excellent at providing a variety of frameworks to examine these issues in a more systematic way. "
