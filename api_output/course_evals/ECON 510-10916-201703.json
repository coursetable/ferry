Problem sets were pretty out of the blue--lecture did not prepare students well to do the problem sets, but exam was fair.\r\n\r\nSecond half lecture great, engaging, relevant policy applications, and problem sets also challenging yet fair and manageable.  Maybe a bit more \"big picture\" info on why each model is important would be nice. "
