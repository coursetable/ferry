            "\u00a0Complex analysis is a very broad field of study and in this class we touched on the bases of the field. We looked at holomorphic functions and their super nice properties and also learned how to integrate more (woo...). Beyond that we touched on the Riemann mapping theorem and talked about the applications of Complex analysis. To me the applications made the class more intuitive as there was a more clear motivation for the theorems we proved as well as having a real counterpart. In general, because Complex analysis has such nice properties, the class was more or less learning about tricks in manipulating functions and thinking about curves and the basic definitions so that further study is possible. ",
            "\u00a0Learned some of the fundamental topics in complex analysis, such as Cauchy's theorem, Fourier series, residues, and conformal mappings. Covers all the important stuff. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about complex differentiation and integration. Also, applications to Fourier analysis. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about complex analysis. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the basics of complex analysis ",
            "\u00a0Contour integrals; residues; holomorphic/meromorphic functions; conformal maps. ",

        [
            "\u00a0The subject itself is a great strength as many problems are quite elegant. However one of the weakness was that it wasn't made super evident that we could assume nice properties, many times they were brushed under the rug as being apart of the properties we assumed. Professor Coifman is also a huge figure in complex analysis as well as Fourier analyses and can very easily provide concrete examples to visualize what we were doing. The book is also very good as well as online reference material that Prof. Coifman sends out. Complex analysis is pretty well known so there are many resources out there to get started and to improve with. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this class and the way it was structured. Prof. Coifman does an exploration of a topic in class, and the assigned pset questions involve proving the theorem with more rigor, or other problems similar to what we discussed. So this made the workload manageable while also ensuring we understood in depth the key topics that were discussed. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were pretty good in this class! I also found the problem sets to assess our mastery of the material well, as they tested us on proofs and concepts from class and the textbook. The class could have been a little better organized, and I would have liked to have received more feedback on my performance. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciate that Coifman tried to teach us intuition over the nitpicky details of a proof. However, it was frustrating that during lectures he often wouldn't define variables, i.e. he'd write \"consider f\"...is f holomorphic? Harmonic? Bounded? A general function? ",
            "\u00a0Professor Coifman was a good teacherhe provided helpful intuition for results, and made it clear that we would learn more about the details of the proofs by just reading the textbook than by him repeating what is in the textbook in class. Problem sets were NOT returned in a timely manner, so it was hard to know how I was doing in the class or how well I was learning the material. ",
            "\u00a0If Coifman is going to teach undergraduates, there needs to be some mechanism by which the department can enforce that there be some actual grading structure that the students know about ",
            "\u00a0This class was a mess. Lectures were disorganized and motivation for the proofs covered was lacking. The textbook is okay -- although it's a collection of lecture notes, and not the most organized either. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very not organized. There was no syllabus or teaching plans so we didn't know what to expect before each lecture. Seems like the lecturer just decided what he wants to teach one day before class. The lecture was hard to follow because only formulas and calculations are written down. Definitions and theorems are not written in complete sentences, and the assumptions are either not written or unintelligible on the board, so a lot of times when we are taking notes and wasn't listening to the verbally stated definitions or theorems we lost track of what Professor Coifman was doing. Sometimes no clear reference was made between the content of the lecture and the textbook, and sometimes Professor Coifman just decided to talk about sth that was not on the textbook, and no reference was provided and it was usually hard to find through a google search. Homework was easy because most are just lecture materials, but this left me wondering whether I was solving problems or simply transcribing the lecture in a clear manner. I had to spend a lot of time studying for this course but a lot of time was wasted on organizing the notes I scrambled down during the lectures or transcribing from the pictures taken in class instead of solidifying the knowledge. Also, sometimes he uses the same symbol for two different functions that are presented in the same statement, and his actions are almost unpredictable. He would erase the important stuff that he just wrote down 30 seconds ago to write down some new stuff, instead of writing it on a new piece of board or erasing the stuff that he wrote much earlier.

            "\u00a0Yes! Analysis is fairly fundamental to many fields of study and to work with such elegant proofs is quite rare. The course definitely has aspects that make it tough, like busy work integrating, but the class is quite different from many of the other math classes at Yale, making it an excellent addition to any student's courseload. You learn about complex integration and differentiation and how it's pretty different as well as learning about interesting tricks that can be applied elsewhere. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! As a math major, compelx analysis is in my opinion an essential class to take in college. I really enjoyed this class, compared to abstract algebra even. The number of theorems and definitions are smaller, and once things start to kinda click you find you can do really cool things with applications in physics, fluid mechanics, etc.. I'm also a person who likes visualizing math and complex analysis requires a lot of that. ",
            "\u00a0If you are a math major, the content of this class is really necessary. It's cool stuff! ",
            "\u00a0I think complex analysis is really cool, but I would recommend you take it with a different instructor.  Coifman is brilliant, but his style of lecturing is not super suitable for undergrads who have never learned complex before. You will likely have to put in a lot of effort trying to teach yourself different topics, because I usually only understood 5% of his lecture while it was happening. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, take it, but pay attention to who's teaching it. ",
            "\u00a0Complex analysis is pretty beautiful, and if you're a math major you should definitely take it. Coifman's a mess - no one had any idea what grade they were getting throughout the whole semester because we never got psets back and he outright said he wasn't giving us grades based on them anyway - and his lectures are disorganized and vastly unengaging. ",
            "\u00a0Perhaps this class would be better with a different professor. Complex analysis is a beautiful subject and this class did not do it justice. ",
            "\u00a0NO. Unless you need this course to graduate, don't ever take it because it is a waste of time and you don't learn much. "
