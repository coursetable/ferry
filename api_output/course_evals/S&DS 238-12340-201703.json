            "\u00a0S&DS 238 wasn't a terrible course, but I think there are a lot of ways it could be improved to make it a much more satisfying experience for everyone involved. For starters, it was almost impossible to bring myself to pay attention in lecture -- the lectures would jump from slides to solving problems to code, often without notice -- and it was never made clear what was going on. I rarely absorbed anything through this learning method; I always had to re-teach myself the material after lecture. Professor Chang did not come off as the most organized and often lacked clarity; he also did not do a very good job of answering questions, often either repeating what he'd already said or not really answering the question at all. The psets were more challenging than I was used to but not that unreasonable; however, I wish the course was not so backloaded, and that there were more smaller assignments or exams to keep up with the material as we went along. I also did not think the design of psets such that they were difficult enough to force people to office hours was very productive; it would have made more sense to actually go over those concepts in the classroom setting. All of this added up to an overall effect of perpetual confusion. I realize this all sounds harsh, but S&DS 238 seems like a course with a lot of potential that is not currently being realized. Tidying up the lectures and refining the schedule could go a long way. ",
            "\u00a0Problem sets were quite hard, and required help from TAs/ULAs. ",
            "\u00a0This course was virtually perfect. It's clear that Prof. Chang has put an enormous amount of time and thought into its design.\r\n\r\nThe one thing I might suggest is to make the exams less like the practice exams. It seemed like we were tested on a fraction of the material we actually covered. It was also possible to study the practice exams and do well while understanding little other material we covered. Exam questions that are more like our problem set questions would be better. It would also produce a wider distribution of exam grades, which is preferable; the variance of the midterm grades was very small, which means that careless mistakes could make the difference between letter grades. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Joe Chang has great lecture notes that you can read over before class to get a better understanding or after if there was something you missed\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I found lecture very boring and hard to follow, especially when we would run functions in R in class. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Chang is not the best lecturer. I was constantly confused even though I attended lecture. ",
            "\u00a0All around a great course. The lectures were engaging, the course reading was in-depth but at the same time easy enough to read and understand (AND corresponded to what was actually taught! Unlike many other classes...), the psets were challenging but a fair length (i.e. clearly designed to reinforce concepts!), and we covered a good amount of material without being spread too thinly. Did I mention I REALLY liked the psets? ",
            "\u00a0I thought this course was really good overall. I appreciate how many office hours were offered throughout the week which made it a lot easier to do the psets. The main notes for the course were great and covered pretty much everything talked about in lecture. I thought the problem sets were sometimes unreasonably hard, they took a very long time to complete, which was not reflected in the grading, as they made up a very small part. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Teaches you a lot about statistics and probability and data analysis with R. The Psets help you learn the material, 1 midterm and final which are not too, too bad... And the textbook that he writes helps you really understand the material if you are confused by the lectures (also TA sessions are so helpful!!)\r\nWeaknesses: The lectures are hard to follow (especially when he teaches in R) and the psets are very hard and pretty different to what he teaches in lecture. ",
            "\u00a0S&DS 238 was a wonderful course, and I have trouble thinking of any weaknesses. Professor Chang was charming, patient, and very good at teaching, and I thought his design of the course - the way that it built on what we already learned and managed to impart an enormous amount of knowledge on us without ever becoming overwhelming - was incredibly impressive, and this class should serve as a model to others. The only thing that could maybe be improved was that the midterm and final were relatively easy, and the curve was therefore very harsh, and small mistakes were sharply penalized. But overall it was great. ",
            "\u00a0This course i poorly taught. It is meant to be an intro course about probability and statistics with zero prior coding knowledge. However, the teaching style assumes a huge amount of prior knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0The course was taught very well! I felt that the homework complemented the course very well! ",
            "\u00a0The problem sets were good practice and challenging. They required extension of the concepts learned in class so the office hours available were helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strength of S&DS 238 is the curriculum. Prof. Chang has selected a really interesting and useful set of material, and his notes for the course are absolutely superb. I have never taken another course with a better set of notes than this one. I enjoyed the combination of mathematical theory with applications in R, and I think there was a good balance between theory and application. Curriculum-wise, the only change I can suggest is that it would be nice to spend a tiny bit more time on frequentist statistics, so we could really understand what it is and how it is different from Bayesian statistics. Perhaps it would be nice, on the last homework, to try solving the same problem with Bayesian and frequentist methods, and compare the results. The other suggestion I would make is to publish the R code in advance of the class, alongside the preliminary slides  it would make it a lot easier to follow along. ",
            "\u00a0Bayesian statistical inference is (as the syllabus claims) much more intuitive than the standard frequentist approach, and the course covered it well; it also provided a useful counterpoint to the more conventional stats classes I've taken at Yale. Simulation with R was fun however we could have spent more time on data manipulation and working with data in R. Also (as with any class with them) the ULAs are kinda useless but I think you know that already. Joe is pretty responsive and helpful on Piazza so that kinda makes up for it. ",
            "\u00a0Problem sets are tough at times but fair and very informative. Practice exams are very fair and exams closely resemble them. Powerpoints are helpful as documentation of the covered material. The only weakness are the uploaded R files from class - if you missed class or zoned out in lecture, they are hard to decode at time ",
            "\u00a0This is a great class and Professor Chang is really nice. Sometimes lectures can be dry but that happens in all math classesin general this was more exciting than most other classes ",
            "\u00a0The course notes were really detailed, and follow the lectures, which made it easy to refer to and consult with. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting material, learned a lot on my own and from doing the psets, worst lecture I have had at Yale. Absolutely no one was engaged, I'm not sure why we all showed up. From the back of the class you could watch everyone doing homework for other classes, online shopping, or scrolling through facebook. This wasn't because we are lazy students, nor was it because Professor Chang wasn't trying to be funny, just the structure made it absolutely impossible to absorbe information. PowerPoint suck. PowerPoints about math suck more. I know that because a lot of this class was about code and you have to project, that its so tempting to project everything, but its just bad pedagogy. \r\nWhat I would recommend, from the perspective of someone who really wanted to learn this material and who has taken many a class with hard math, is, please, do the math on the blackboard. Don't just click past the proofs and the calculus on slides. Come in with your notes, do the math out by hand while explaining it, box the important things. Then pull up code showing how different parameters effect the shape/behavior. THEN walk the class through how to use it in R. ",
            "\u00a0I really think that one of the strengths was the clarity with which Professor Change delivered the material and the resources he made available to use.  On the other hand, a weakness has definitely be the speed of grading and feedback. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- very well taught,extensive online notes, well paced and structured, awesome professor. Even though the material is sometimes complex, its obvious that professor Chang has thought long and hard about how best to teach it and thus the class doesn't feel overwhelming. \r\n\r\nweaknesses- I sometimes found it hard to follow along with the coding in class, especially when professor Chang would edit already written out code- it would have been helpful if he could upload the code before class along with the powerpoint slides so we could more easily  follow along. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\nGreat professor (who is passionate about the subject and helpful) and helpful TF's/ULA's and office hours 5 days a week\r\n\r\nProfessor Chang designed this course, and as a result, he was invested in teaching the material properly. He wrote a main set of course notes for the class (the textbooks), which contains intuitive explanations and example problems. He uses interesting/memorable examples to explain concepts, which is especially helpful for those who do not have a prior background in probability/statistics.\r\n\r\nThis course uses Piazza, which is a question and answer site. You can easily ask questions on the course materials/problem sets (which is nice if office hours don't fit your schedule). Students can also answer questions on Piazza. This aspect improved my learning because I was able to improve my own understanding by \"teaching\" the material to someone else.\r\n\r\nFair exams (much easier than psets and practice tests were an accurate indicator of the actual exam)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nThe course is quite difficult (but manageable) if you do not have a background in probability/statistics/computing. The problem sets are quite difficult to complete on your own and a lot of us were at office hours every day (on the flip side, there were many students who were never at office hours).\r\n\r\nThe computing aspect of the course is not really introduced well. The first few problem sets were pretty difficult computationally if you had no background and are not used to facing errors/being patient. However, this does get better throughout the course, and the problem sets get easier. "

I suspect anyone who's reading this has to take this course for their major, but for anyone who doesn't, shop the course and get a sense of whether the curriculum will benefit you, because it's not an enjoyable enough course to take for the material alone. I don't generally believe in approaching Yale courses based on how useful they'll be, but this is an exception that proves that rule. ",

S&DS 238 ended up being my favorite course of the semester. Prof. Chang is either the nicest professor I've ever had, or the nicest person I've ever met, period. The class is extremely well organized and well executed. More importantly, it really delivers on its promise to use Bayesian statistics and MCMC to make any statistical problem tractable. By the end of it, you're doing hierarchical models and hidden Markov models  topics that would normally never be covered in an intro stats class. If you have any interest in stats at all beyond the bare requirements of your major, do yourself a favor and take this class. ",

Try looking at a different stats class or maybe a math class, or maybe even a good Yale course on ornithology or something. This is Bayesian statistics which is not easily applied to physics (at least and the undergraduate level). You can also forget that this class is supposed to teach probability theory. It covers a little combinatorics at the beginning but that is about it. It also covers markov chain monte carlo which sounds cool (and is) but don't take the whole course just to get to that. ",

            "\u00a0S&DS 238 (previously Stat 238) is a great choice for any science student, especially a biologist. Its not easy, but its also not super hard - If you have enough math background (technically you need multivariable calc, but really BC calc is enough for 95% of the class) youll be fine. I am seriously concerned that many biologists dont know enough statistics, and before taking this class, I definitely fell into that category. To be honest I still need to learn more stats, but this class was an excellent start. After taking this course, I have a good understanding of some of the mathematical theory behind probability. I know the basics of how Bayesian statistics works (and this is used all the time in biology). Finally, I learned how to program in R and use it for statistical simulations. Prof. Chang is a decent lecturer, if not the most excitingand dont judge him on the first lecture, my year he got substantially better on the second or third class. Also, hes a great guy and his class notes are absolutely phenomenal. He could make them into a textbook if he wanted. Also, I strongly recommend going to his office hours, hes really helpful and fantastic at explaining concepts one-on-one. In any case, if youre considering taking an intro stats class, although I havent taken them all I would strongly recommend this one (unless youre a math major and need 241 to count for your major). Its not going to kill you and you will learn a lot more than you would in the 100 series/psych stats. Its also more focused on probability and statistics (rather than data analysis) when compared with 230. ",
            "\u00a0Good introduction to Bayesian statistics but be warned that this course barely covers \"standard\" frequentist statistics (i.e. things like hypothesis testing, p-values, confidence intervals and whatnot) so if you want to learn about those look somewhere else. Workload is very manageable - problem sets take less than 5 hours a week (mainly trying to figure out R), exams were fair and not hard. Joe is pretty amusing in lecture but can be somewhat disorganized; however everything you need is in his lecture notes (which are fun to read). ",

            "\u00a0I very strongly recommend this material. Bayesian Statistics and specifically Markov Chain Monte Carlo is very very useful in all fields of science and if you havent used it yet you will. On the other hand the class, as it is currently structured is a total waste of time. Lecture is watching professor Chang quickly clicking through proofs, stumbling through explanations of prewritten code before just running it and telling you you can figure out how it works on your own, and him never being prepared to answer any questions. Trust me, you don't have to go to lecture. Just buy a textbook on Bayesian methods and work through it on your own. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to other students who are interested in statistics and data science.  It seems like a good class, even if you have already taken 241 & 242 or plan to take that sequence. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! if you're looking for a class that will force you to learn to code while teaching you some useful statistics, this is a great, well taught choice. Its also great for understanding why what you're doing in statistic works. Just be aware that the psets take 4-8 hours/week and the exams aren't trivial, so be prepared to put in some work to do well. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course. It may be a lot of work, but it is rewarding. I entered the class with a general fear of probability/statistics and programming and left with an understanding of some probability and statistical theory. some computing skills, and a \"problem-solving\" mindset. Additionally, statistics is important for most majors (and for being an informed citizen in general). If you can handle the material (or if you are willing to put in the time), then I would recommend you take this course, especially if you are thinking of majoring in statistics). ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Great intro to statistics course. Prof Chang explained the material well and his notes are incredibly detailed and intuitive - I reallt felt like I cam out of the class having a solid foundation in statistics. Plus, 238 is one semester shorter, better taught, and incorporates more useful computational/programming material than the intro statistics alternative of taking 241/242. "
