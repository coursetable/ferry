            "\u00a0I learned a lot from the Chinese section about classical Chinese and the richness that lies in the structure of the texts. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this class - all of the literary material was very interesting, and was explained in a way that connected it to the progression of Chinese history. The Chinese material was a little challenging as it was my first time reading classical Chinese, but was made manageable. ",
            "\u00a0This survey course taught me general context for the history of the intellectual tradition of China, as well as its place in world history. ",
            "\u00a0-extensive knowledge about the history of Chinese civilization, especially to the end that the \"civilization\" is homogeneous nor is there just one coherent narrative\r\n-important pieces of Chinese culture (arts, literature, philosophy; the introduction of Buddhism and the Western world and their impacts on China)\r\n-improved my Chinese reading and writing skills\r\n-It was a great way to learn about my heritage ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me a deeper insight into the Chinese literary canon, far beyond what I had even known to exist. Some of the works we read were truly among some of the finest pieces of literature I've ever read. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me to understand a (very long) continuum of Chinese philosophical and literary thought, though maybe not at the deep level that I'd like to understand it (but that can't really be helped since it's a survey course). It can be taken for an Hu, WR, or L5 credit -- I took it WR, and very much enjoyed writing in the course, but I'm not sure that my writing improved all that much. It doesn't have the essay workshopping that you'd expect from a WR course -- section focuses on really understanding the material -- so you don't really get much critical engagement with how you're forming an argument unless you go looking for it (which I'm chronically bad at anyway, so other people may have had a different experience). Overall, though, very engaging material and sufficiently small class size. Had a lot of fun in EALL 200. ",
            "\u00a0I came away from the course with a broader understanding of key themes with which to approach Chinese history, philosophy and literature, and to situate myself and my upbringing within. While the course was fast-paced, Prof. Lu did an admirable job of steering us towards consistent themes and demonstrating how each period responded to their local concerns within a longer tradition. The course also helped me appreciate the diversity of questions and responses in China, and evaluate my present perspectives on issues such as race within a broader historical context. ",
            "\u00a0This was a sprawling survey of Chinese history and culture, from 2000 BCE to the start of World War I. We studied big events, people, concepts/themes, books and other works. I was in the Chinese section, so also learned some new vocab and also some Classical Chinese. Got great practice writing academic essays in Chinese. ",
            "\u00a0You learn a lot about the writers and philosophers in the canonized Chinese tradition of pre-modern China (including people like Confucius and Laozi). You also learn to do close readings of the texts and analyze the literary strategies used to convey the meaning through the three essay assignments, the topics were a bit confusing at times and required lots of thought and planning. You also gain general knowledge of the development of China throughout history as you travel through the different dynasties and historical events by reading these renown works. ",

            "\u00a0This course could be improved by separating the Chinese section from the English lecture. By virtue of classical Chinese being so interesting and rich, we spent much longer talking about one analect than we could have in English, which made it hard for us to cover as much ground as the English section. I wish we had had more Chinese sections, and more time to actually go deeper into the original text. \r\n\r\nTina's lectures were good, and she made great observations. She is funny and current. Rather historical, however, if you are looking for a true literature class.\r\n\r\nI struggled with taking this class in two languages. For instance, Tina's lectures often blew my mind over even small observations (the chinese word for culture literally means \"literization\"? what?), but I didn't have the tools at my disposal to think about those ideas in Chinese. We wrote the same prompts as the English section, so I was trying to write papers on literary criticisms in Chinese and baidu translating every other word. At least I now know how to say some really obscure literary and philosophical terms in Chinese? I went into this class knowing it was going to be experimental, however, and I still enjoyed writing those papers.\r\n\r\nI think it might be worth not having the English lectures to make time for more Chinese sections. Not necessarily a hot take-- they do work well together-- but just purely in the interest of time. ",
            "\u00a0This was one of the most interesting classes I have taken at Yale. The balance between English-language lectures and Chinese-language section discussions was perfect. One remark may be that the material for the final was much more extensive and difficult than for the midterm. ",
            "\u00a0The course's three distinct tracks are a unique asset, and it really benefitted from intermixing the students. However, I do believe the requirements for Humanities students could use some tweaking. 3-4 pages never felt anywhere near enough for the writing assignments, and it limited my depth of engagement with the texts. I'm not totally sold on the merits of my proposal, but perhaps assigning Humanities students 2 of the 3 Writing assignments (6-8 pages) would work better (that is, allowing them to drop one). Additionally, doing this would allow you to intermix the Humanities and Writing sections, which I believe would benefit the class as a whole and allow a more even distribution of students. Especially if the number of Humanities students remains small, I think this might allow the class to run slightly more smoothly. \r\n\r\nIn general, I have a slight philosophical disagreement with making the Humanities requirements a strict subset of the Writing requirements (though I recognize many YC courses do this). A Humanities class should not be an easier version of a Writing class. I really like the idea of the Wikipedia assignments -- perhaps a Wikipedia article or a historical expository piece could replace the third writing assignment for Humanities students. I really enjoyed the historical aspect of the course, and would have enjoyed the opportunity to read more deeply on some historical topic, and this would move the focus for humanities students slightly towards a general cultural learning.\r\n\r\nThese are minor suggestions. The course is incredible, and has been one of my favorite experiences at Yale, despite being far from my major. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated the option for the Chinese discussion section; I think it greatly enriched my experience as a native Chinese speaker looking to take this class for personal understanding. I don't know if I would have taken the class otherwise, because the lectures by themselves definitely weren't as meaningful (i.e. learning textbook knowledge that might be interesting and all, but nothing like the more hands-on application and interactive discussion open to freer question-asking we had in discussion)\r\n\r\nWhat could be improved is the agreement between professors on what is being taught in lecture versus in section. Not that they have to be identical, as per my comments above I think it makes sense for the content to be slightly different and really appreciated the instructors' openness to feedback about our topics of interest, but more cohesion would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nAlso, the lectures came off as very grounded in theory, (as opposed to straight common sense), and I would have appreciated an explicit initial discussion of why we should look at things the way we did (e.g. when we analyzed a primary source, a question often raised by Professor Lu was \"who wrote this? (one person or does it sound like a historical, cultural compilation?), or a more detailed explanation of the way the professor was thinking (because there clearly seemed to be a line of thinking she was fishing for from her responses)\r\n\r\nI guess in general this course tries to take on a lot, and a more coherent flow (maybe by 'simplifying the narrative'/making more clear what's important and what's just interesting historical facts. Yeah, condensing/highlighting more the history) would help (i.e. we talked about the shi theme, but in studying I found it helpful to also try to trace the intellectual history, cultural history, and dynastic/state history as separate threads) ",
            "\u00a0Taking it for a WR is not going to get you the skills you'd expect, but I'd say that's the only real flaw. Tina Lu is great at presenting material in a funny and engaging way, and you'll learn a lot if you participate in class and keep up with the readings (sometimes heavy, sometimes light, just depends on the day). It's pretty remarkable that you get from 800 (ish) BCE to 1919 in a single course while still maintaining a decent focus. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in China abstractly -- it really helps you build an understanding of eastern thought. ",
            "\u00a0Specifically for the Chinese section, I feel like students were not supported to succeed. I really enjoyed the lectures, section and the written assignments, but as most material was delivered in English, expecting students to translate this work into Chinese for midterm and final exams seemed too much. Regular vocabulary lists in Chinese corroborating English terms, and graded quizzes or tingxie as a replacement for midterms/finals may be a fairer way of assessing how much students learnt. ",
            "\u00a0The professors and content are fantastic. Prof. Lu's lectures are extremely engaging. Really loved them.\r\n\r\nOne weakness was the workload and scope of the Chinese track. Going in, I assumed (and, like, read on the syllabus) that the amount of reading would be the same. But it seemed like Zhang Laoshi would've liked to teach his own full course; we had a lot of extra readings (which were mostly sent the night before section; they weren't that long, but they were in Classical Chinese, which takes a lot longer to parse through if you want to understand it), and section was really lecture half the time.\r\n\r\nI think this is the first year they're offering a Chinese track, so I know these are just kinks that will need to be worked out. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course was that it covered a lot of historical material and analysis of the texts, and students became more involved through the essay writing component (in both English and Chinese, depending on which section you choose). There were also guest lecturers who presented.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of this course was that it moved rather quickly and due to time constrains, could not delve deeper into discussions of each texts in class. Students were not given access to powerpoint slides from class, which made it harder to study the material covered completely (especially the close readings of quotes from various texts, which might be included in the midterm and final for the text ID portion). ",
            "\u00a0The course is taught with a significant amount of self-directed learning. Readings should ideally be done before the lecture on the context of the text, though this is sometimes less useful without having learned the relevance. This might be changed by giving lectures prior to reading, if possible. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes; this class is a great survey course of Chinese literature, philosophy, and history. It is a great way to get introduced into Chinese tradition and understand the basis for Chinese society. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, regardless of your Chinese level, it will be fine and instructional. However, I will say that there were parts of the exams that I couldn't read, because we learned about many of the texts in English. Just study them in Chinese and it will help. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. The workload is manageable, readings are relevant and chosen well, help is always available and both sections and lectures were done with enthusiasm. ",
            "\u00a0Tina Lu is a fantastic professor and this should be a required class. Whether this is anywhere near your course of study or not, you will benefit substantially from taking this course. This is a course whose general knowledge will flavor my understanding of world history. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it, because it's a great chance to learn about Chinese tradition and culture, which I believe does come from a radically different starting point than, say, Western cultures that we have more classes on. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to other students. It's not inordinately difficult and it touches upon a length of time such that any student will find something to pique their interests. ",
            "\u00a0Totally would recommend -- Tina Lu is really the best. If you're abstractly interested in China, this is a great launching pad for further understanding, since you get the basis of intellectual thought throughout the tradition. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the class gives an interesting perspective on Chinese history, and 's section is very fun and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course. But not as a fifth class -- and by that I don't mean don't take it if you already have four on your schedule; I mean you should drop one of the other classes you want to take and take this one instead.\r\n\r\nThere's a decent amount of reading; it's not unreasonable, but it's chunky (and it's all primary sources, which means it's often harder to discern what you should be paying attention to). For the Chinese track, there are three 1000-character essays; but the expectations are a lot lower, I think, than if you wrote them in English. There's also a midterm and a final (which are also in Chinese). The midterm was hard because we only had 50 minutes, but they just went easy on the grading, so it turned out fine; the final, on the other hand, I found very difficult. (For example, on both tests we had to list some provided people/events in chronological order. On the midterm was something like \"Xi Jinping, Confucius, the First Qin Emperor,\" which you'd probably know after spending 10 minutes perusing the Wikipedia page for China; on the final were five different texts, only four of which we read (and only parts), only two or three of which we actually discussed in section, so I had a lot of trouble ordering them right.) ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students interested in learning about and doing close reading analyses of the Chinese literary canon, which includes philosophy, poetry, plays, and stories. ",
            "\u00a0The Chinese Tradition was an excellent introductory course to the Chinese canon that provides a cursory overview of the most important contributions over a 5000+ year period. This was a great course to take having had little to no prior understanding of the richness of the Chinese literature. Take the course with the intention of keeping up with the readings, or you may find it difficult to contextualize. A lot of insight and reflection is required to truly get the most out of the content, but it is a very rewarding process that will allow you to see just how the traditional Chinese cultural values have changed over time. There are three tracks within the course (writing, non-writing, Chinese) that may influence your perception; the writing and non-writing sections have English discussions and assignments. "
