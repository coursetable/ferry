I asked the course instructor if statistics and calculus experience from 5+ years ago and no computing experience would be enough for me to make it through the class (emphasising I barely remembered anything). It is not, I later discussed with the course TF and realized I was way over my head. I think this course is very beneficial and a great resource.
