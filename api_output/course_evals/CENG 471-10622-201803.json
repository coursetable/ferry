            "\u00a0What you learn is dependent on which lab you are in, how approachable/helpful your mentor is, and how much effort you put into your research project. ",
            "\u00a0I got training in how to work in a lab, how to write research papers, analyze data, and it was a great introduction into the laboratory environment. It all depends on which lab you join though. ",
            "\u00a0Great, great experience. The graduate students in Professor Pfefferle's lab are wonderful people from whom I learned a lot. I saw firsthand what getting a PhD in chemical engineering is like and did real-life research in which usable results were actually found.\r\n\r\nI learned what academic research is actually like. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: Very open ended on what you do depending on what labs have spots open\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Very hard to shop labs, I would suggest getting into a lab and getting familiar with it before doing research for credit ",

            "\u00a0If you are considering either a career in academia or in an R and D lab, I do recommend you do research.  There is no harm in doing it for credit during the semester if you were already going to do it anyway.  The only real requirement is to write a research summary at the end of the semester for your PI who gives you a P/F grade. ",
            "\u00a0Yes if they want a good way to get into a lab without sacrificing their free time. It's a great way to justify working in a lab over the course of the semester. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, this is an excellent way to gain experience in a lab/outside of the classroom! "
