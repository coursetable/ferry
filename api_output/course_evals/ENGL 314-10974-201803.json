            "\u00a0I learned a lot about Ireland's history and the way the literary revival reflected national tension.  In-depth discussion of Joyce, Yeats, Wilde, and others in the context of their time. ",
            "\u00a0Detailed close-text analysis. Developing and writing paper topics. A better appreciation for different literary mediums (poetry, drama, prose). ",
            "\u00a0Better writing and reading. ",
            "\u00a0My writing and critical reading skills improved tremendously, as did my knowledge and appreciation of Irish Literature. This was the course I have learned the most in at Yale. I particularly appreciated the way that historical context was woven into the course, without dominating. ",
            "\u00a0This course introduced me to the Irish literary tradition of the late 19th and early 20th century. I gained a solid understanding both of the general literary, cultural, and social conditions of the time and of specific writers such as Yeats, Joyce, and Beckett. The course also pushed me to integrate literary and social analysis as well as to compare works of different genres. ",
            "\u00a0Survey of Irish cultural history and political climate of the 20th-century. Fairly comprehensive overview of Joyce and Yeats, with interesting parallels drawn from these two giants to other authors. Understanding of how Irish literary style and form grew out of English tradition and domestic turmoil. ",
            "\u00a0This class taught me to trust my instincts as a thinker and reader innately. I feel that in other courses, some professors want you to approach the coursework in a very specific way, but this class strengthened my ability to think more as an individual. ",
            "\u00a0This course offered an overview of Irish literature of the early 20th century, with particular attention to Modernism and the contours of Irish history in the same period. Beyond its content, I appreciated the inclusion of a wide selection of genres: the course featured novels, short stories, drama, poetry, and criticism, all ranging from traditional to experimental. The design of the course and Professor Cleary's excellent teaching made me a better reader, as well as one more knowledgeable about Irish literature. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: Awesome discussion, great readings, interesting assignments\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Because there is so much to cover, the course doesn't go much into depth on any of the classic Irish authors.  We returned to Yeats a few times, but never got to fully analyze his style/form.  We also didn't get to read all of Ulysses (which could be a positive, depending on how you look at it).  Not sure that this should/could be improved, as the breadth of material was important to get true insight into the revival. ",
            "\u00a0A phenomenal course  take it because of the outstanding subject material and the outstanding Prof. Cleary. Dont be dazed by the intense historical criticism right at the beginning, and every week I found the readings and seminars to be engaging. \r\n\r\nDecent reading load but nothing too crazy. \r\nTwo papers (7-10pg, 10-15pg), which is relatively normal.\r\n\r\nImprovements:\r\nI would appreciate poetry by at least one more person on the syllabus, to offer a formal counterexample to the large amount of Yeats we read. \r\nAlso, establish from the beginning that there will he reading responses, since they started about 5 weeks into the course with no warning. ",
            "\u00a0One less book perhaps could be good. Theres a lot to get through during the semester and it felt slightly overwhelming. That being said, I think its very hard to improve the class as a whole. The engagement of the class as a whole was excellent. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely a fun and engaging seminar. Its main fault, and I'm not sure who is to blame for this exactly (perhaps the students) was the sense of formality that permeated most of our discussions. Because of this, much of the dialogue had to be facilitated through the instructor, and there was less conversation with the students bouncing ideas and thoughts off of each other. The rare occasions that this did happen made for really fascinating discussion, and I only wish there could have been more of it. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strength is that Professor Cleary is an incredible teacher, and very good at encouraging students and nudging them towards insightful discussion. I see no real weaknesses of the course; I loved the syllabus and the pace, discussions were great, and I believe all of that is due to Clearys style of leading class. ",
            "\u00a0This course was by far the best run course that I have taken at Yale. The syllabus was comprehensive - covering both a wide breadth of authors while also allowing for extended encounters with major figures like Joyce and Yeats - and Professor Cleary was adept at framing each week's reading in the larger social context. The questions that he sent out before most every class did a tremendous job of focusing our thinking and ensuring that our class discussions were on point. \r\n\r\nI can't think of any major weaknesses to this class. While I would have liked to spend more time on several of the authors that we read, this desire is not really feasible to carry out, given that it would require dropping another author from the syllabus. The Irish Literary Revival was all around a fantastic class. ",
            "\u00a0It might have been helpful to have more advanced notice on some of the reading responses, but I think they were helpful in engaging with the readings. I really appreciated the lectures at the beginning of each seminar since they provided much-needed context and set the tone for the ensuing discussion. Professor Cleary moderated these discussions tactfully and efficiently. I also appreciated having so many compelling essay topics to choose from for each paper. ",
            "\u00a0There are many strengths and no weaknesses that come to mind. The class was often dynamic, fun to engage with, and controlled well by Professor Cleary. There were a few discussions in which discussions were weaker than normal but I think that because classes were usually so strong, everybody including Professor Cleary was aware of it. ",
            "\u00a0I was very impressed with the course overall. The strong reading list offers many different approaches to the complex relationship between Irish literature and the country's political history. In some cases -- Ulysses in particular -- I would have been glad to discuss more criticism by both contemporary writers and more recent scholars to put our political readings of the works into a broader context. But the course is already full of excellent material, and there may not be room on the syllabus for it -- and Professor Cleary never failed to contextualize the works in discussion. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class.  The material is awesome, and Professor Cleary facilitates great discussion.  There is a lot of reading, but it's all very enjoyable and definitely worth it. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely recommend  Prof. Cleary is a treasure. His warm demeanor and thoughtful engagement with the class made every seminar a delight. The writers we read are fantastic, even as sometimes the writing is quite difficult. The seminar discussion was excellent  hopefully future iterations of this class could be as small as ours was at 11, because it made discussion electric. ",
            "\u00a0If youre willing to put in the time and effort, then youll get loads out of it. Professor Cleary is also a brilliant manager of the topics at hand as well as the class. ",
            "\u00a0I found the discussion was always pretty interesting! There were writing assignments due before most classes--depending on who you are, you might not like things being due mid-week, though I'm sure it helped in understanding. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The syllabus is outstanding, and Professor Cleary is the greatest Professor ever. He gives extensive and helpful comments on papers, which is wonderful and really helped my writing and thinking. Take this class! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Anyone with an interest in Irish culture, literature in general, or a desire to take courses with amazing professors should take this class. The reading for every week contained some new aspect of the Irish Revival, and Professor Cleary's pre-class questions and short writing assignments helped to illuminated these aspects. \r\n\r\nAnother reason to take this course is that it allows you to understand literary modernism through the window of a particular social context. From decadence to social realism to experimentalism, the syllabus contained all facets of modernism. My understanding of modernism has changed as a result insofar as I had hitherto seen it as an exclusively internationalist movement and now understand in more nuanced terms. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Irish literature may not be your cup of tea but Professor Cleary is unparalleled. ",
            "\u00a0Yes certainly. I do not think that many people realize how fantastic and influential Irish literature is. The class is also great in that, even if students have a lot of background or very little background, the class will offer something  something to them. ",
            "\u00a0This is an excellent course. While the topic is in some sense rather narrow -- the Irish Literary Revival had its own time, place, and context -- the syllabus reveals a wide variety of contemporary responses to this pivotal moment in Irish political history. Professor Cleary is an admirable teacher, and his course design and discussion leading allowed me to sharpen my reading skills across many different genres. Whether or not you have a prior interest in Irish literature, I think you will find this an enjoyable and interesting course. "
