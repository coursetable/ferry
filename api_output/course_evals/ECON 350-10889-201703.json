It takes work to understand the intuition behind the concepts taught in the course, but it was satisfying to get them eventually. ",

            "\u00a0Professor Bewley whispers into the board and you cannot hear anything during lecture.  It makes lectures a waste of time unless you are completely zoned in and manage to grab a seat in the front row. ",
            "\u00a0the textbook is very very well written (thanks truman!) and the material/theory is very important. however, it is dense and lectures were not always the most related to problem sets. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures and problem sets were quite different. I wish lectures covered more problem-solving. ",
            "\u00a0Weakness: Lecture, it's very difficult to learn anything because the professor speaks waaay too quietly. Strengths: the textbook and general course material is linear and well-organised so you won't be confused about what you have to learn; the professor is a really nice guy and will take the time to explain things to you in detail if you approach him; there are loads of practice midterms and finals that help you get accustomed to the style of examination so you'll rarely be surprised. Though, make sure you get your hands on a solutions manual, it's key to learning the class material and understanding the homework ",
            "\u00a0Truman is a very helpful and the problem sets were helpful, but I wish lecture could have included less proofs and more examples. ",
            "\u00a0The course is really good at making you learn more economics and economic models. The professor understands the material better than anyone, but its sometimes hard to understand what hes saying in class. He speaks at a soft tone and doesnt stop very often for questions. When you read the book, you get a lot more out of the class than when you dont. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were pretty ineffective. Most of the time we just sat in class copying what Bewley wrote on the board, which was pretty much the exact same as his textbook. Lectures hard to follow. Definitely had to read the book on your own and do problems to understand. ",
            "\u00a0Very cut and dry course, with the material centered around the content in Professor Bewley's textbook. Lectures were very theoretical/proof-based and contained few examples. Were not reflective of the material on homework and midterms. ",
            "\u00a0More examples---either in class or in section---would be helpful, e.g. when toward the end of the course Prof. Bewley began providing step-by-step roadmaps/guidelines/algorithms for solving the various models. They were particularly useful when the exposition made clear what each step had to do with the models. Sections were not helpful; since solutions were posted, summaries of this week's lessons (e.g. as above) geared toward the current psets would be far more helpful than going over last week's. ",
            "\u00a0The subject and theory are very interesting, but I felt like there was a huge gap in learning how to apply the theory we learned to solving the problem sets. "

It is a great introduction to advanced material taught by a Professor that defined and refined the field, and who really cares about his students (even tries to learn everyone's name, and mostly succeeds by the end of the course).
