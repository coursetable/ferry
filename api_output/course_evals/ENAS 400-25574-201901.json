            "\u00a0You learn so much in this class: How to use most of the tools in the CEID (if you don't already know how), how to think critically through an ideation process, how to work in groups to bring a product prototype to life,  how to approach entrepreneurship and so much more. this is a class that gives you tangible skills and useful knowledge about how to approach developing your own ideas into something real. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of new hands-on skills and was exposed to areas I previously hadn't worked with: Solidworks, working in the shop with milling wood and laser cutting, and so many other things. The guest speakers also provided so much good insight into their respective fields and were effective guides to the course objectives. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot in this class. I learned how to takes things from ideation to reality. I learned how to use new machinery in the CEID. I learned how to think critically about how things are made. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the product design process. ",
            "\u00a0You will learn so much that is extremely applicable to the professional world. You learn how to work on a team, work around bumps in a project, meet with potential partners, and so much more. This class (and any of Joe's classes) will prepare you for working after graduation so much more than any other class at Yale, so definitely apply for any of his classes. ",
            "\u00a0Throughout this course, I learned the mechanical processes of making a product, basic aspects of the product design process, and learned more about how individuals and teams build products and businesses out of ideas. We learned about product development processes through use of the CEID machine shop and other physical fabrication tools. We had lectures and exercises to help us understand the design process, from abstraction to completion. Finally, we had guest speakers come to class that could demonstrate how they were able to go through the design and business process to achieve success. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about the design process (mechanical and electrical stuff) as well as how businesses worked. Lots of cool guest lectures. ",
            "\u00a0Making it took us through the process of developing a product idea and bringing it to life. We were introduced to all major fabrication equipment, design thinking strategies, and several excellent guest speakers from different parts of the business and design world. ",
            "\u00a0Relatively in-depth teaching of various fabrication and electronics. Additional guest speakers on the details of the design process, as well as introductions to launching and maintaining startups. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a LOT in this course! I not only learned and/or brushed up on some hard skills like woodworking, soldering, and general craftmanship, but also gained valuable insights into ideating and problem solving as in a team setting. ",
            "\u00a0So many tangible skills - solid works, 3D printing, wood shop, metal shop, general design sense ",
            "\u00a0This course on the fundamentals of design and entrepreneurship provides a background in the respective fields. Through guest speakers, the students are exposed to different areas of businesses and perspectives on growing them, with their backgrounds ranging from small startups to industry leaders. You also gain a tremendous amount of technical skills through the speaker project and the group project, with strong support from the teaching staff. ",
            "\u00a0Making It is one of the most important courses a student at Yale can take if they are interested in technology or product creation. Prototype/product development can only be taught through practice - Making It accomplishes just this. The course instills in you the courage and self-confidence (but also self-awareness) to take an idea to prototype in the class and know how to take it to product-level after the course. Outside of just the product development part of the class, the class teaches you how to work successfully with a team and hear from experts in various fields. ",
            "\u00a0We heard about entrepreneurship and product design from various speakers and lecturers ",
            "\u00a0Team work, time management, conflict resolution, abstract problem solving, design skills, and a surprising amount of geometry and trigonometry. Also a host of technical manufacturing skills. ",
            "\u00a0An appreciation for how objects and concepts around me are created, improved, and brought to market; skills and empowerment to make such things myself; insight into the process of selecting a good idea and prototyping and creating and presenting it. "

            "\u00a0Everything about the class was incredible! The only weakness is that you don't really get grades back during the semester because of the framework of the course, so if you're someone who always wants to know where you are grade wise, you won't get that here. Nonetheless, if you do your work well and on time, you'll be fine. The workload piles up at the end of the semester when you're working on your final group project, but that is also very enjoyable and rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very good for those who are self-driven and want to accomplish things outside of their comfort zone because there is a lot of help and support. The weaknesses of the course were mainly due to scheduling issues of the guest speakers, but other than that I think the projects turned out the way they were supposed to. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- great curriculum, different style of learning, covers a lot, creative, fun\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- takes a LOT of time. I know several seniors in the class whose theses took a hit while we finished final projects. ",
            "\u00a0The final project was a really cool experience, and the teaching staff was so, so amazing. I wished we had spent less time on the speaker and more time on the final project. ",
            "\u00a0There are really no bad things to say about the class, but if I had to choose something I would maybe say front-loading guest speakers could have been beneficial in terms of having time to work on projects. ",
            "\u00a0This course does an excellent job at ensuring that the students are able to apply the practical knowledge of the course. From building a speaker from scratch, to creating a pitch idea, and building a final prototype, this course really allows for students to apply what they have learned. I think this course could improve by allowing a longer timeline for the final project, as it would have been nice to have more time to think about what the final prototype might become. ",
            "\u00a0Super fun course, but could've been organized a little better. I felt that there was a large stretch in the middle where we hadn't started out final projects yet and we weren't really doing anything of importance. Homework was sporadic and we received basically no feedback the entire semester. That said, the course was always really fun and it was awesome working on projects that I was actually interested in. ",
            "\u00a0Overall this was a very engaging course. The speaker project was fun and taught me a lot of fabrication techniques I had not considered before. The class project portion was less well organized, and felt rushed, but was a good learning opportunity in terms of team dynamics and speedily creating polished work. This class is worth taking for the visiting lecturers alone. Hearing from so many incredible designers and business people and getting to interact with them was inspiring and changed how I thought about a lot of things. ",
            "\u00a0Teaching staff and professor were all very highly engaged, and willing to help out outside of office hours for help. The courseload is a bit uneven though, but that's to be expected of a project based course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Joe is the numero uno strength of this course. He is incredible. He expects the very highest of his students and though that is stressful, it produces results. He is very patient and VERY dedicated to his students and their projects. The rest of the teaching staff follows his lead in these regards. The final projects were very rewarding and awe-inspiring. Also you get a FREE, PERSONALIZED BLUETOOTH SPEAKER halfway through the course. Um, yes.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Joe laid out a really exciting semester, but some things didn't line up as planned (guest speakers cancelled, certain projects taking longer than planned, etc.). These were problems largely out of the teaching staff's hands, but it did take away from the course a bit. Also I wish we could've starting ideating on the final projects sooner just because they were so wide open and directionless (which I think was overall a good thing, but definitely it more difficult). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: highly engaged teaching staff, great-thoughtful organization, great clear feedback\r\nWeaknesses: with interdisciplinary teams and making sure every team has at least one engineer, I think a lot of time can be cut from the introduction to making things part of the class and shifted to the student project part of the class. ",
            "\u00a0The structure of the course is very self driven; depending on the type, you can get the most out of the challenges. ",
            "\u00a0I really loved the format of the course - with speaker design and assembly for the first two thirds of the course, and product design for the last bit. I do wish we had a little more time to work on our final projects and learn more about other groups though ",
            "\u00a0This course is excellent in its final moments when you are grinding on your project, trying to work things out with your team, and pushing for the finish line. It could heave benefitted from a bit more structure early on, but Joe is definitely well aware of that already and I expect it will improve a lot next year. "

            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0YES! There's a lot to take out of this class. You gain hands-on skills, you learn how to think critically about creation/design and more, you hear from inspiring speakers about their work/success in their fields, you get to build a project with a team from scratch and much more. ",
            "\u00a0I would totally recommend this course because it is unlike any other Yale course where your success is contingent on getting the right answers--instead, your success depends on how much time and effort you're willing to put into your projects and how much you're willing to contribute to your team. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, if you HAVE TIME. This course is amazing and like none other at Yale. I truly loved it. But it can be stressful because of the time commitment. ",
            "\u00a0This class was cool but so much work. Im really proud of the work I did, and the teaching staff went beyond above and beyond. Take it if you can get in, but youve been warned. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend taking any class you can with Joe. His classes simulate real life problems, so they offer so much more valuable experience than the regular lecture or seminar. JZ cares a lot about his students, and the lessons and skills he can offer you are highly rewarding. Making It, in particular, enables you to work on a project you are excited about and invested in, and I'm sure some of the final projects will continue to be refined and potentially even put on the market. If not Making It, just take a class with him. ",
            "\u00a0Classes like this onewhere you get to work on a cool project with a lot of design freedomare relatively rare. Take one if you have the opportunity to. I already had a good amount of technical knowledge before I took this class, but I was still able to find stuff that I could learn. Doing work for this class didn't really feel like work, because I wanted to do it and it was fun. Also, Joe is a super cool guy and really cares about students. He didn't spend all that much time with my project group (because we didn't need help), but I saw how involved he was in the other projects; there were several occasions when he stayed at the CEID until 1 AM helping the groups with a problem they were having. Also, the teaching staff were really nice and helpful. ",
            "\u00a0YES YES YES if you can get in then TAKE THIS COURSE. It's so fun! But of course DO BE WARNED that it is an all-consuming class at the end of the semester (last 3 weeks or so), not in a terrible way (it's super fun!) but in a stressful way if you don't plan well. I structured my semester around this course to make sure those last few weeks would be as low-stress as possible in my other classes so I could dedicate myself fully to Making It. ",
            "\u00a0Great class overall. Particularly great for people with no engineering or experience making things, but for people who have a lot of experience here already just make sure you can happily commit to spending time \"re-learning\" basic stuff.\r\nThe opportunity to work on an interdisciplinary student team to create a \"product\" is super unique and valuable so if that sounds like something that sets your heart on fire, then this is a great class for you! ",
            "\u00a0Yes - absolutely take this course if you can get in its the best class Ive taken here! Jo is amazing. You get out what you put in and if you put in you will learn so much and have an awesome experience. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course, if you get accepted into it. This is the only CEID class with projects deriving from student-generated ideas, and there is a certain sense of ownership that comes along. Also, the amount of exposure into the design industry is simply great, with amazing guest speakers coming in every week. The workload is ok (around 3) for the first third of the semester then ramps up to around 8 for the last third of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student regardless of their major. This class thrives on interdisciplinary collaboration and the skills learned apply to any field. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely if its offered again! Zinter and all the other staff members are incredibly caring. In the future, the kinks of the course will probably be ironed out as well ",
            "\u00a0This course was one of the best experiences I've had at Yaleand truly, I mean experiences, not just courses. It often felt almost extracurricular in how much it engaged me and went beyond the normal academic grind. If you like challenges, problems, and/or building things, this is a course for you. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to students of all walks of life - particularly those who are interested in, well, making things. The class enables such students to make things happen (I swear I'm not trying to say \"make it\" over and over again - but it really is a phrase that applies to the class). Zinter and CEID staff are dedicated to making sure students create a good product, take lessons from the class, and have a good time - speak with them constantly to maximize all of these. "
