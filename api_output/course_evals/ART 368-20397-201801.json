I wish in addition to critique, we could have had chats/lectures on best practices + foundations. Alternatively, hands on, in class assignments would also be really helpful. For instance, I found the bookbinding demo incredibly helpful, as well as the NY times assignment that we got to start in class. In addition to looking at a lot of books, could we go further into a piece of work and deconstruct it to really understand the choices being made and how they work to make a cohesive whole? "
