            "\u00a0You learn both specific knowledge and ways of thinking about the world. It helps you come up with a methodology for understanding political economy AND it makes arguments about actual policies. ",
            "\u00a0Great overview of basic political and economic theories/models. ",
            "\u00a0I read a lot of political theory throughout the course, which has provided a lot of helpful frameworks with which to view other polisci classes "

        [
            "\u00a0The only real weakness was that at the start it wasn't always clear what parts of the readings mattered, but Prof. Rosenbluth asked for our input midway through and started telling us what to look out for. Strengths are the professor; she's clear, enjoyable to listen to, and brings food. ",
            "\u00a0Really great overview of material. I feel like I learned a lot. The guided questions towards the second half of the course were especially helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course would work better if it drew more on the Varieties of Capitalism literature. Comparative PE would be more interesting if it compared political economic models across countries instead of focusing on specific policy topics. The survey was useful for establishing breadth but sometimes it felt that we didnt make any progress on topics. "

            "\u00a0Yeah for sure, decent fun and you learn a lot about political economy. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Rosenbluth presents the material in a really clear way and I always left with a much better understanding of the readings. There are indeed a lot of readings, which can be quite tough, but I do think it's worth it. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely recommend the class to any undergraduate who is interested in learning some of the classics of the political economy literature. The class is a lot of work during the semester (4-5 journal articles a week, plus a weekly reading response) but the final paper is pretty short. Rosenbluth is just phenomenal and you can't beat the opportunity to learn alongside the PhD students as well. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the class to students who want to get more high level exposure to topics in political economy and policy. ",
            "\u00a0The readings for this class were certainly challenging, but looking back, it was a really rewarding experience and I felt like I learned a tremendous amount about political theory by the end of the class.  Definitely recommend! "
