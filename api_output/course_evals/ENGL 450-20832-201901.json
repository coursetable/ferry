I learned how to avoid cliche, how to write effective characters, how to make dialogue convincing, where to find inspiration, and so, so much more. You learn how to revise and edit your writing and how to distill the main point of your themes into just a couple words. Getting to meet with your tutor is an amazing opportunity as well to figure out what you need to work on personally and what your strengths are. ",

Obviously I also learned about how to develop characters and write dialogue but most importantly I learned how to write anything, which actually was incredibly helpful when I had to write my senior neuroscience thesis, which was obviously very different type of writing. I think this class improved my writing more than any other class I've ever taken. ",

I learned how to be diligent in my writing, how to think of things differently, how to improve dialogue, write in a different time periods, think about punctuation, look to other writings for inspiration, and think outside of the box. I also got better just by nature of writing so much. It forced me to get outside of myself and not just write about my life or things easily accessible to a college student. I learned to write about evil and silly things and push my own limits. I loved this class as a creative exercise. ",

It is so much easier for me to sit down and start writing, as well as how to improve my own writing. It's easy to tell when your own writing isn't good, but it can be really challenging to make it better, and Daily Themes taught me to articulate what does and does not work within my writing. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about writing and the process of writing. I learned how to fail while writing and how to come back from it. I learned so many different kinds and ways of writing. ",

Working with my tutor, I've been able to develop my writer's voice and figure out which types of content best suit my writing style. I've also learned where my writing weaknesses are. I think my biggest takeaways from lecture are an increased love for literature and books and an increased awareness as a reader of the craft that goes into every book. When I read now, I find myself sometimes in awe of how expertly put together this or that sentence is. Your writing will definitely improve in this class, if only from sheer volume and practice; I find it hard to believe that anyone, after 13 weeks of almost daily writing, would fail to improve somehow. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about myself as a writer  how I work, what I'm interested in, what I struggle with, what techniques I like and don't  which was invaluable. From the lectures and tutor sessions, I learned a lot about characterization: how to dig out backgrounds for characters so they become real people. ",

            "\u00a0I learned all about my writing. It feels like the class ended too soon. I just wish I could take it every semester I'm at Yale! This class has been so good for my understanding of what it means to write for a reader. ",

            "\u00a0You will develop the discipline of a real writer. Writing everyday changes the way you think about the world; you will constantly start to see stories around you and develop a sense of your own style. This class has taught me why I love writing and what I love to write about, strengthening my understanding of fiction and nonfiction and teaching me when and why I prefer each medium. ",
            "\u00a0Daily Themes made me a more wholistic thinker about writing. As someone studying English and writing at Yale, I was nervous a lecture course like this might feel too general or elementary. That was not the case, as this course teaches writing in a way that is applicable to any level. With lectures spanning topics from dialogue to punctuation to character development to setting, this course proves to be a full and solid foundation for any level of creative writing. This class it worthwhile if it is your first and only writing class at Yale or your tenth.  I look at my writing more critically and more thoughtfully after this course, and I have a far greater sense of my writers voice and style. ",

            "\u00a0In Daily Themes, wrote fiction in a serious way for the first time, curbed my verbosity, and became a more confident writer and self-editor. I became newly energized about reading great literature. And I learned to express myself in wacky and weird ways I'd previously shied away from. ",
            "\u00a0Discipline! I learned the most important lesson any writer can learn: you must not wait for the muse to strike! I also learned how to be critical of my own work and how to take criticism from others. It's not easy to defend the choices in your writing and it's really not easy to be humble enough to admit you had not thought something through before. "

            "\u00a0The weekly lectures were great. The prompts were always fun too. ",
            "\u00a0The lecture was fun at the beginning but got a little old after a while. The best part of the class was working with my tutor (Shifra) and getting to write every day. ",
            "\u00a0This class is really centered around you as a writer. There is strength in the fact that you get to pick your involvement with each of the themes and you can really write whatever you want so long as it's everyday. A weakness is the policy for missing assignments. I think there should be a skip policy and a late policy because as it stands right now if you miss one too many assignments you get a third of a letter grade drop, even if you do the work and turn it in late. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: consistent feedback, engaging lectures, a reason to write every day\r\nWeaknesses: prompts themselves were sometimes limiting in their scope. While I enjoyed the idea of class happenings, I found that my writing on happening prompts was consistently lower quality than my other prompts. I think the class could be improved by offering happening prompts as an alternative to other prompts throughout the week, or having students write some of the prompts throughout the year. ",
            "\u00a0The course is just great. I mean, after about half the class you kind of start to hit a slump with the daily writing, but you make it out. ",
            "\u00a0This class depends a lot on your writing tutor. Mr. Oppenheimer was a very good lecturer. It's a lot of work and the 300 word format has it's own specific challenges, but I definitely got better at writing just from having to write so much. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures could have more continuity and be better focused on actually improving the writing. They were beautiful and fun, but I rarely got things from the lecture that I could apply to my writing. The tutoring is this course's strength. I would advise not switching student's tutors at all costs, since I think it took me a long time to feel comfortable after being reassigned since we didn't have time for an introductory meeting where we talked about goals and backgrounds. ",
            "\u00a0This class reminded me why I could not be an English major at Yale. The subject material was verrrry white, as were most of the tutors. I appreciated Mark's efforts to highlight other kinds of authors, but every X-theme he highlighted sounded like it was written by the same person. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the fact that we had to write every day; there were some prompts that I didnt really connect to so I would have liked to see more variability in prompts. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures started off very very strong, but I think they started to be less impactful as the semester moved along. I think I was just reaching a plateau in my understanding of the \"rules of good writing\", and now the only thing I can do to improve is write more and read more. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- bonds you build with the tutor, Mark as an engaging professor who got to know a lot of students one-on-one despite the course structure.\r\nWeaknesses- sometimes the prompts were bad. I liked the happenings, but maybe students in the future could suggest prompts (one prompt per week would be student-divined) and that student could be rewarded with skips. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Mark Oppenheimer was a great professor for this class, he speaks super fluently and passionately, so I am never bored when in class. However, at the same time, I wish Mark got to know students better and had more opportunities to meet with students. I had the luxury of talking with him to schedule my happening, but I wish I got to know him better. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Many things!! Mark Oppenheimer is a very charismatic, honest, funny, and energetic lecturer. Even though the lectures are 2 hours long, I (almost) never fall asleep--in fact, I'm usually wide awake, laughing and saying \"oh, that's so interesting!\" You also get assigned a writing tutor who is essentially a personal TA that you meet with once a week, and my writing tutor was absolutely amazing. Most of our sessions consisted of her psychoanalyzing my writing in ways that really changed how I viewed why and what I was writing. As a Cognitive Science major, I found the lens in which she approached creative writing--by breaking down the psyche first, and then the semantics of the pieces themselves--really cool and conducive to my learning. Writing every day, of course, is also just a fascinating experience in and of itself, one that I am really glad to have done, \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: On a couple occasions, I felt that Mark's lectures were not particularly useful or important, and I left feeling like I had not learned anything new on how to become a better writer through them. This included the punctuation lecture, for example, but most of the lectures were great. ",
            "\u00a0I couldn't ask for a better advisor. A more coordinated curriculum would drastically improve prompts and the class at large. ",
            "\u00a0I thought lecture was a little pointless. We got off on a lot of tangents about writing that never really gave me any information on how to write better. ",
            "\u00a0The class is what it is - you have to write everyday.  Not much to change about the structure, it is built to fit the point of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing, amazing course. Towards the end of the course, it felt like some of prompts were a bit random and difficult to work with. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Weekly tutorials were really helpful in that I had someone to keep me accountable and recognize patterns and points of improvement in my writing that a one-time reader may not have caught. Lectures were really fun, and Mark is hilarious. Weaknesses: I'm not sure I learned anything concrete from lecture - it's more the experience of writing daily that was beneficial for me. (I'm not entirely sure I would categorize this as a weakness.) ",
            "\u00a0This courses lectures were super engaging and often the highlight of my week. The assignments forced me to work hard and improve my writing and think about what Ive learned. My sessions with my TA were very focused and informative. ",
            "\u00a0I think the experience varies a lot depending on who your tutor is. My tutor was helpful, but I feel like I didn't receive as much feedback or learn as much about how to improve my writing as I wish I had. I wonder if there was a way to match students with tutors based on the kind of feedback they are looking for. ",
            "\u00a0It did exactly what was promised. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - the lectures were absolutely amazing, and always a highlight of my week. I wish I could have doscusssd more of my peers work. ",
            "\u00a0more feedback from tutors/ peers ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: once-a-week two-hour lecture format is wonderful. Multimedia lectures were engaging. Course packets were full of fantastic, helpful examples and resources. And, of course, the writing prompt every day format is an amazing way to strengthen your writing skills, and, more broadly, your creative thinking at large. The tutor meetings were also helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: engaging lectures, great tutors, interesting readings\r\nweaknesses: structure doesnt allow for revisiting writing ",
            "\u00a0It is strong in that the lectures by Professor Oppenheimer were insanely interesting, the tutors are awesome and care a lot, and the very nature of writing every day just makes you so much better if a writer. I cant think of any major cons of the class. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course was my tutor. I really appreciate how he tried to identify my emerging writing voice, then encouraged and cultivated it. Not all tutors are the same though, so be aware of this.\r\n\r\nA weakness of the course was the lectures. Very often, they had little to teach in terms of writing and focused more on the professors interests (or whims). Professor Oppenheimers biases were most frustrating. At one point, he suggested that genres like fantasy and sci-fi are for children. While his reasoning of stories in these genres often having under-developed characters is sometimes true, the fact that he NEVER elevated good examples of these genres in class was poor judgement, in my opinion. For example, each week, Oppenheimer would select themes from the students to print out for the whole class. Even after acknowledging that these themes were subject to his own perspective of what made good writing, he almost never picked themes outside of the realistic fiction or nonfiction realm. Overall, the course struck me as being rather close-minded in what it upheld and thereby defined as good literature. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: mark's lectures were always really interesting and his content was helpful throughout the process. the meetings with the tfs were wonderful and it was nice to send things in that someone close-read every week. this experience was cathartic for me because i feel like my entire semester is relayed in the themes from this class, fiction and non-.  \r\nweaknesses: i always tuned out while we read daily rituals. they were sometimes fun, but got boring and came off just as a way to make sure people come to class. ",
            "\u00a0The quality of teaching is highly dependent on your tutor. I think a smaller class would be useful. Additionally, a matching program for tutor and tutee would be useful. Especially for what kind of writing and style an tutee is interested in. The last few weeks of class was not as engaging. Tutors did not reinforce what was taught in class. ",
            "\u00a0Writing for a short period of time every day will make you a much, much, much better writer. I absolutely loved the routine of writing five small pieces each week and reviewing them with a tutor. Its highly enjoyable and you improve so quickly. The course leans heavily on interactions with your tutor; luckily, my tutor was fantastic, so I had an excellent time. Mark Oppenheimer's lectures were amusing, engaging, and insightful, although they fell off slightly at the end of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were definitely the format, with the balance of weekly lecture and a separate tutor meeting. The one-on-one tutor meeting was especially wonderful. Mark Oppenheimer's lectures were amazing and made me excited to write each week. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: It's set up in a way that could lead you to developing your voice as a reader (between writing every day and meeting with a tutor once a week). \r\nWeakness: It's also set up in a way that could actually keep you from developing your voice as a reader (between constricting prompts, and if you happen not to mesh with your tutor and don't benefit from the feedback as much as you wish you had). Additionally, lectures were often more about the philosophy and politics of language than the actual skill of writingwhich was interesting, but didn't directly help me improve my writing. ",
            "\u00a0Daily Themes lectures are next to worthless. The only way you can learn how to write is by writing and reviewing your writing critically. Musings on punctuation are unnecessary. The writing aspect of daily themes cannot be improved except by improving the theme prompts, which, admittedly, could use some work. Daily Themes' greatest strength is the rigorous structure it enforces in combination with the freedom it provides students in their approach to writing. That is, students must write every day of the week, but the way in which they approach the prompts is entirely up to them. ",
            "\u00a0I like the freedom you have in this course. The prompts serve only as loose guidelines, which gives you a lot of liberty to write whatever you want. The one-on-one tutor meetings are also a very helpful part of this course. ",
            "\u00a0This class is really two parts: lecture and writing. Apart from the daily prompts and any inspiration that comes from class, lecture is almost completely disconnected from the writing process because the professor is not your tutor. This can be a strength or weakness, depending on you! I think the lectures were very interesting, but I did appreciate that we typically ended class a half hour early. I think a two-hour lecture on just punctuation or just dialogue would have been too much, but Mark found a really great balance with his lectures. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is absolutely writing every day: it's a learning experience you just don't get by writing one story a semester. The lectures were entertaining and mostly helpful, especially when they provided good examples of techniques and writers worth emulating. On the whole, the structure of the class is great and shouldn't be changed. In terms of weaknesses, sometimes I thought the prompts were too hokey or specific to really bring out the best writing. For the most part, though, I enjoyed the creative prompts (and I've heard that they were much better this year than in the past). Also, the longer story option for the last two weeks was very rewarding and a great culmination to the class. ",
            "\u00a0The ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- great tutoring, engaging lectures, fun assignments. No significant weaknesses ",
            "\u00a0I think the strengths of this course are the entertaining lectures and the dedicated tutors. The tutors really make or break this course and i think I was very lucky to have such a nurturing one. ",
            "\u00a0My tutor was amazing. He really personalized the course for me with recommendations and direct feedback. Without a discussion of my work I don't think the themes would have felt worthwhile to me. I needed to know someone was reading them. \r\nThe lectures themselves were not always the most informative. They were interesting and entertaining, but I don't feel as though I learned that much from them. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course for me was my tutor, 100%. Mark is great, and a very good and charismatic lecturer, but I learned much more from my tutor. I love the overall premise of the course. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are awesome, the write-5-times-a-week is completely doable, the meetings are incredibly helpful -- also what better way to improve your writing than by writing?! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: For the most part, lecture was engaging and worth attending. My tutor was PHENOMENAL and I thought they should change nothing about that structure.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none that I can think of. Maybe not use so much printed paper materials in class. ",
            "\u00a0Everything was great, I wouldnt recommend changing the course next year. ",
            "\u00a0I loved having a writing tutor to meet with regularly and receive particular feedback. I wish the lectures had been a bit more focused and productive, as I only felt like I was learning sometimes, and a lot of it felt very general and abstract. Writing every day was a wonderful exercise, though, and I feel more creatively generative as a result. ",
            "\u00a0The one-on-one tutor sessions are amazing. Take them seriously and take the feedback seriously. Your tutor is an amazing person and resource. \r\nSometimes the prompts were repetitive and could have been mixed up. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength of the course, in my experience, was the tutors (that's what the TAs are called). You are assigned one at the beginning of the course, and you meet with them weekly for the entire semester. They read every single piece of writing you produce in this class, so they are able to give incredibly specific and helpful advice. My tutor is the reason I got so much better at writing. The lectures are sometimes helpful, sometimes very prescriptive, but always pretty fun and engaging. To that end, the weakness of the course was the structure of the once-a-week lecture. Each lecture has a topic, but because the class is big and the lecture is, well, a lecture, it can sometimes feel disconnected from each student's daily pursuit of writing. ",
            "\u00a0The concept of Daily Themes is greatwriting every day is a possibly unbeatable way to improve your skills. The lectures, while certainly entertaining, didn't always give me a lot to think about, but I think they're still an important part of the class as a community space. Getting one-on-one feedback from my tutor was incredibly valuable! ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are that it really teaches you discipline, and the lectures were also engaging. The main weakness of the course is that it is (unavoidably) limitedthere's only so much you can do in 300 words, so at times that was a little frustrating. But I think that the value of the course is in its formatwriting 300 words, five days a weekand learning what that feels like, what it's like to have a routine like that. I also would have loved more guest lectures from fiction writers, since Mark is more of a non-fiction writer. ",
            "\u00a0The structure of the course is fairly straight-forward. There is a lot to learn from having to write every day, and I personally had a great experience with my tutor. After a while though, the prompts got a little repetitive and uninspiring. I imagine it must be very difficult to come up with prompts for so many days, so it is understandable. The weekly happenings were a great idea to manage lecture attendance. ",
            "\u00a0Daily Themes made me a more precise writer and original thinker and it taught me, forcefully, that writing is a craft, not a talent. The lectures were energizing, fun, and provocative. In particular, I really enjoyed the lectures on clich, dialogue, and connotation. The classes on punctuation and ekphrasis didn't change how I thought about writing as much. I would have liked to have more broad prompts that provided opportunities to play with form or genre and fewer highly specific ones like we had the last week. The tutor sessions were immensely helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: so so many things. Oppenheimer was such a fun and lively lecture, I actually enjoyed going to class, and I have a lot of big takeaways about what it means to be a good writer (and a good person!). I truly found him inspiring. Without his weekly lectures and my tutor's weekly encouragement, this class would have been such a drag. He really infused a lot of joy into what could have been a lifeless corpse of a lecture. "

            "\u00a0Without a doubt, this is one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. I recommend this class without reservation. If you want to get into a better habit of writing, if you want an excuse to write every day, if you want to be more creative and have an outlet from general work monotony, this is the class for you. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you're willing to put in the effort to write every day, then this class will transform your writing and maybe even how you think about yourself/the world. ",
            "\u00a0absolutely! this class is fantastic for any type of writer who wants to break out of their comfort zone and take a fun but stimulating class. Mark is a great lecturer and I can say with full honestly that I left every lecture with a new drive to write and be a writer. ",
            "\u00a0This course is an introduction to the elitism that is no doubt present throughout the entire English department. The entire class seems out of touch with the realities of the world, and Mark left the impression that he had never met anyone who made minimum wage. If you, like Mark, have never had to wipe your own butt, then you will probably chuckle along with him and have a good time. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! I don't think I grew  as much in terms of my specific writing skillset in this course as I have in other writing classes, but in a personal sense this class serves the important function of freeing you as a writer to take risks and write outside of your comfort zone. The tutor relationship and the constant feedback throughout the year really made this class worthwhile. ",
            "\u00a0YES! It is definitely one of the best courses I've taken while at Yale and it's completely changed my perspective on writing. As a STEM major, I've always hated writing. I've never felt confident in my writing skills but now I can say that I feel well-equipped to express whatever thoughts I may have and actually find writing to be creatively fulfilling. It's also completely changed how I view fiction and how I engage with stories in general. The lectures were so, so fun and something I looked forward to every week and the weekly meetings with your tutor are so great because it's half an hour a week that's just focused on you and improving your writing. It's AWESOME! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, take it! Like all english classes, I'm guessing A's are p hard to come by, so maybe credit-D it. This class will greatly improve your writing and decrease your perfectionism with your writing. ",
            "\u00a0YES but only if you have the time to fully commit to this class. Every day, 5 days of the week, you have to write 300 words. The assignments have to be turned in the next day so you can't save them all for the end of the week. That being said, I learned so much and my writing improved dramatically. I'm a science major and my science writing even improved just by writing every single day. I became more comfortable writing anything, and that was actually so helpful when it can to writing my senior thesis. The class is also a Yale classic and for good reason too. TAKE IT! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It's a lot of work, 5 stories a week. But you get used to it and it was always fun for me. If you like writing already and if you want to push your creativity, it's a fun course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes if you have the time to take it seriously. I got a lot out of the course because I enjoyed writing my daily themes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Different but fun. ",

            "\u00a0This is my number one must take class at Yale. My writing went from pretty good to really good and more efficient and I felt the improvement. My tutor was phenomenal so I learned a lot about bettering my writing. ",
            "\u00a0yes! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would most definitely recommend this course. One of my favorite courses this year, and my writing has improved due to writing every day in Daily Themes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes to EVERYONE, unless you are the type of person who only cares about learning concrete facts and skills, and have no idea why anyone would take a class to grow the soul and expand the mind. In which case, I don't know why you're shopping writing classes in the first place. For me, this class provided me with relief from my quantitative world of being a Cognitive Science and Economics double major, giving me not just an outlet and a drive to write and create every day, but renewed belief that the world is much more than its numbers. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely would recommend! Workload is not nearly as bad as I thought it would be and I loved my tutor (though, of course, it's kind of luck of the draw). Oppenheimer was definitely a very engaging lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you want to make a habit of writing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely take it no matter what. It's incredible having to write every day. It makes you come to terms with any insecurities you have about your own writing. This has made me more confident in doing a writing assignment in any setting. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely if you are interested in improving your writing skills and challenging yourself. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It's a great course. The workload is heavy though, even though it's only 300 words a day it can get taxing. But if you want to write better, this is a good course to take. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I'm a Junior and this is my first English class I'd taken at Yale, so I was a bit nervous going in, but it has been incredibly rewarding. I got to explore all those random story ideas I've had bouncing around in my head! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Its fun if you like writing ",
            "\u00a0Yes, highly recommend! The lecturer is amazing, the course structure (writing 300 words a day, 5 days a week) makes the high workload not too overwhelming, and having a personal tutor is a really wonderful and enlightening experience. One of my favorite Yale courses ever. Join the cult of Mark Oppenheimer!! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you want to be inspired by fun and engaging and fascinating weekly lectures, think critically about your own writing, and stop fearing the blank page and develop a daily routine around writing and churn out a lot of material then this course is for you! ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely would recommend this class to any person thinking about becoming a writer or any sort of artist in generAl. Marks lectures are super engaging and entertaining. ",

            "\u00a0Absolutely! If you want to be a writer, Daily Themes is the perfect boot camp for you. Youll learn to write frequently and effectively, conquering writers block. Youll end the semester with dozens of pieces youre proud of. Youll develop a relationship with your assigned tutor, who will be able to offer you a wealth of specific, tailored feedback. And youll have a lot of fun exploring writing styles, genres, and topics you might not have considered before. ",
            "\u00a0Yes it is an opportunity to do something potentially life changing ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this student to anyone who wants to get better at writing. Its an insanely fun creative outlet and I looked forward Professor Oppenheimer lectures every week. ",
            "\u00a0Only if youre alright with pointless lectures. Tutors are a hit and miss from what Ive heard. ",
            "\u00a0take it before you graduate, but take it as a junior or senior.  i say that because i think the caliber of your content will be higher, the subjects you will write about will be vaster, your writing will be better. i don't think you should take this class unless you feel pretty comfortable with writing and want to hone your skills. there are intro classes that might suit you better if you aren't comfortable. know that the pieces are expected to take one hour each, mine took several just because i was so invested in the course. to each their own i guess. but you will get out of this course everything you put in, so your effort will pay off if you really want to improve as a writer. mark is a great lecturer, genuinely interesting and class always flew by. i wish the class were a bit smaller, but reading other ppl's work anonymously was still fun. ",
            "\u00a0No. There is simply insufficient time for tutor to give feedback on writing. What's the point of an individual tutor is the tutor isnt gonna read your reading? Every single tutor has way different styles - and I had a horrible relationship with my tutor and so not only was my confidence in my writing greatly harmed and my individual style of writing CONSTRAINED in a creative writing class I left feeling this was a significant waste of time ",
            "\u00a0I would wholeheartedly recommend this class to anyone who wants to improve their writing skills. Daily Themes encourages you to dig deep and reflect; it can make you both a better writer and a more thoughtful and observant person. I think almost everyone could gain something from this class. ",
            "\u00a0Daily Themes with Mark Oppenheimer was a transformative experience. It was amazing, enjoyable beyond what I thought possible. It made me believe I could be a writer and showed me how possible it was. I learned how to fail and get back up again every day, which is really hard as a writer. ",
            "\u00a0This class is hit or miss, and mostly balances on who you get as a tutor (which you have no control of). I also wouldn't take it unless you're interested in discussing the philosophy/politics of language. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are willing to commit to writing five days a week for the duration of the semester. A warning: if you have any idealistic dreams about the writing life, this class will dispel them. This will likely be helpful to anyone with the intention of pursuing writing seriously. In the way that traveling is said to make or break a relationship, this class may be a good litmus test for your relationship with writing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! If you are interested in creative writing. ",
            "\u00a0This course is amazing! Take it if you can, but, and here's the caveat: only if you can and are willing to invest the time into it. I wish I had more time this semester to really write great themes, and you'll only get the most out of the class if you're passionate and willing to put in the effort. This is not a casual 5th class. The workload is high but so is the reward! ",
            "\u00a0If you are willing to put in the work, you will not regret this class. I am not an \"English person\" per se (at least not a major), but I have always really liked to write, and this course gave me a lot of confidence in writing fiction as well as nonfiction. You get into a routine that just becomes part of your day, so the workload doesn't feel as bad as it sounds  unlike in a class where you have one intensive project at the end of the term. ",
            "\u00a0I would, for the opportunity to write creative pieces every day ",
            "\u00a0Definitely--very enjoyable and helpful. Must-take at Yale ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to any student who is even remotely interested in creative writing. I think it's definitely a challenge to keep writing every day, and more than once i have felt tired and unmotivated to complete and submit the day's theme. But if you want to be serious about writing, these are challenges you have to learn to overcome and daily themes provides a guided structure through the process. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I think this is a course everyone at Yale should take. It is extremely valuable to try and write every single day, and I think it would benefit everyone. ",
            "\u00a0YES! A thousand times yes! It involves some serious concentration if you want to get something out of it, so honestly don't do this class if you aren't ready to commit to the project of improving your writing. That is the point of the class, so I don't see why you'd take it unless you were on board! But you will learn more about yourself than you might think from looking at your writing and trying to see it for what it truly is, not just what you'd like it to be. Also, your style will improve dramatically! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I believe writing every day is a great way to improve one's ability to construct clean sentences, build character arcs, and explore their artistic strengths and weaknesses. A great way to push oneself. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class. Its a great lecture that teaches you not only about writing but about how people interact with each other. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but more for your own personal development as a writer than for what you're going to learn during lecture. Do it if you want to make sure you're writing and receiving feedback on a regular basis. ",
            "\u00a0Take Daily Themes even if you are terrified of writing everyday. This class gives you a real discipline and teaches you a lot about yourself through writing. It is intimate and at times lonesome but so so worth it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely. If you are serious about the commitment and improving your writing, TAKE THIS CLASS! If nothing else it is a chance to seriously practice and think about creative writing. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Daily Themes is a great way to improve your writing. It feels really good to fall into a routine of writing every day, and getting one-on-one feedback from a tutor is so helpful, and an opportunity that I haven't found anywhere else at Yale. Mark Oppenheimer is also a really fun, interesting professor. Take it!! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you want to spend a semester really committing to writing, and seeing what that feels like. I think it's a very valuable exercise, but unless you're really devoted to it, can easily become tedious/burdensome. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class when you feel ready. It definitely isn't a class you can just sign up for. Having the time and mental space to write when you have dedicated instruction like this is important! ",
            "\u00a0Daily Themes is the course to take if you want to become a more disciplined writer  yet, at the same time, it frees you up to write weirder, more original material. Whether you're interested in fiction or nonfiction writing this will sharpen your skills for sure. ",
            "\u00a0YES! If you want to be any type of creative--this is it. I learned discipline, how to defend my own work, and how to critise it. \r\n\r\nHowever, you also learn the most important lesson any writer can learn: writing something awful won't kill you. I learned that sometimes prioritizing perfection gets in the way of some really wonderful art. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Sometimes, you struggle to get your brain working to write 300 words, but when all gears are churning and you produce something that's actually not shitty, the class feels so worthwhile. If you are trying to build discipline in writing, then this is the perfect class for you. "
