            "\u00a0The course is very immersive and well-rounded in terms of aiding students in identifying where they could improve and where their work is good. However, student feedback could be more directed as often time, students don't really know what sort of feedback to give their peers. ",
            "\u00a0One of the strengths of this course is the open nature of the discussions over everyone's work. Everyone is encouraged to give their honest feedback which can lead to the best discussions and is very helpful as a writer. ",
            "\u00a0The small class size was one of the biggest strengths of the class because it allowed us to really engage in each others writing and tailor the speed of the class to our needs. I can't define any major weaknesses with this course. "

            "\u00a0If a student is interested in pursuing film, I would highly recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Lapadula is definitely more honest with students in his senior seminar. It can be frustrating but it's a great opportunity to get real feedback on your work if you're passionate about it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. Learning the way to write a screenplay is helpful for any career in the film industry. It exposes students to a different style of writing. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, I would recommend this course to a student who is serious about developing screenwriting skills. This class helps you think critically about storytelling through your own writing, and through the work of your peers. It's non competitive, but you still get the challenge of working with students who are equally invested in improving their writing skills "
