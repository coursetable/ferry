            "\u00a0I developed a knowledge of moral philosophy and the ability to better analyze and formulate complex philosophical arguments ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write a philosophy paper! This course is a great time to learn how to hash out a paper and defend a position. That is all that Shelly asks you to do in a paper: make a statement and defend it. I was amazed at how bad I could defend a thesis, and this course taught me how to get decent at it. \r\n\r\nThis course also provides good insights into Mill, Kant, Hume, and other thoughts like the trolley problem, the experience machine, and the tension between free will and determinism.\r\n\r\nProbably the most fun class I had. Shelly is the only lecturer that I can confidently say held my interest in any of my classes. ",
            "\u00a0Intro Ethics sincerely tries to build a framework for approaching various moral philosophies.  However, it also sincerely fails.  In lecture, Kagan (the talented speaker that he is) walks us through the philosophical analysis of several stalwart theories and then deposits his two cents about them.  Granted, he is one of the most preeminent moral philosophers in the world.  But then he asks you to take novel argumentative approaches in an essay and you're left floundering because, as it turns out, the one thing this course evaluates you on is the one thing you receive ABSOLUTELY NO INSTRUCTION about.\r\n\r\nProfessor Kagan includes a short pamphlet on \"How to Write a Philosophy Paper\" that ironically only asks for simple arguments and basic writing.  Try giving one of his own philosophical analyses a crack.  Notwithstanding this hypocrisy, essays are graded on the basis of cookie-cutter form, rather than the novelty of ideas or the flow of arguments.  End of the day, this course offers little more than a survey on moral philosophy with a completely disjoint evaluation system attached.  Take it CR/D to learn and don't deal with the bureaucracy. ",
            "\u00a0How to critically analyze an argument and how to clearly articulate a complex idea. ",
            "\u00a0Introduction to moral philosophy - several important ethical theories, focusing on Mill and Kant but touching on Hume, Hobbes and questions of free will (determinism and compatibilism) and rationality (esp. egoism). Introduction to the critical thought process and analytic philosophical mode of writing. ",
            "\u00a0What is there to say that hasn't already been said. Shelley is a fantastic lecturer. The papers force you to think hyperlogically and its a fun class. I learned how to better cover my bases when making an argument and write very clearly. Philosophy writing is a separate skill from other writing. ",
            "\u00a0This is definitely a 'learn how to think' class. I learned a lot about how to reason about very abstract things. Also learned a lot about myself in how my intuitions have lined up regarding ethics-related questions. ",
            "\u00a0The knowledge, skills, and insights I developed in the course are too many to count. Reading the texts, attending lecture, staying after lecture to continue talking with Prof. Kagan, attending my discussion section, and writing the essays all worked in concert to stimulate my intellectual growth. If I had to pick, the most important takeaway for me was probably an improved ability to structure a clear philosophical argument in my essays. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me a better opportunity to systematically think through competing philosophical theories on morality. ",
            "\u00a0In this course, I was able to improve my articulation of philosophical concepts, as well as develop my philosophical writings. This was the first course I've taken in philosophy and I thought it was a great introduction to philosophical thinking. ",
            "\u00a0Writing a philosophy paper is different than anything else that I have ever done. Writing a paper like this really makes you focus on clarity: making sure that you know what your arguments are, making sure your reader knows what your arguments are, and stylistic concision. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to write logically for philosophy papers. The almost mathematical format of writing was new to me. For example, although I was writing, it almost felt as if I were doing 1+1=2 each time I made an argument. ",
            "\u00a0I had very little background in philosophy, so this class was great in building that foundation. I felt like it was very in-depth, and attending every lecture was very important. It was not a class that you could just be physically present in - If you weren't mentally present as well, you might as well not show up. Fairly challenging over all. ",
            "\u00a0Shelly and Matt (my TF) both helped teach me how best to organize and present my thoughts, as well as how to challenge the ideas I had come up with. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very helpful in teaching me how to write for a philosophy course/discipline. I also learned how to think at abstract levels and explain my arguments in a more concise and pointed way. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about normative ethical theories and how to write for philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0I learned some basics about contractarianism, Utilitarianism, and Katian ethics. ",
            "\u00a0How to write a philosophical paper ",
            "\u00a0I received an introduction to philosophy, more specifically, the philosophy of ethics. I learned about John Mill's utlitarianism, which is a basic philosophy that posits that the right thing to do is to maximize everyone's benefit holding everyone's benefit equally. This is a system many of us implicitly live by, and it was good to have it explained and clarified. I learned of Immanuel Kant's deontology, which focuses on moral rules based in humanity's autonomy and rationality. This form of philosophy is a bit more complex, and people who live by it may hold different views from utilitarians. I also learned about free will and why we ought to be ethical. I received not only instruction in philosophy but more importantly instruction in being a good person. ",
            "\u00a0I went into this course with minimal knowledge of ethical philosophy. After discussing the rhetoric behind utilitarian, Kantian, and contractarian moral frameworks--both in lecture and in section--I feel that I have a nuanced understanding of those few theories. Naturally, there is more to be learned about philosophy, but this course was a good introduction to a few schools of ethical thought. ",
            "\u00a0Though it was very challenging, this course gave me great insight into the demands of undergraduate philosophy, especially with regard to writing. ",

        [
            "\u00a0I found the course material to be engaging and presented in a way that was easy to understand. In my opinion, there is little room for improvement. ",
            "\u00a0You learn about many great thinkers of the past few centuries, which is amazing.  You then learn that successful modern philosophy prizes formula over ingenuity, which is pretty lame and antithetical to the themes Prof. Kagan attempts to convey. ",
            "\u00a0No improvement necessary, excellent course. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were excellent and engaging; discussion sections started off terribly (as very few students understood anything) and improved as the semester went on. I don't necessarily think that there's a way to improve this other than directing the TFs to intervene more if the students veer toward unproductive or incorrect lines of thought, which again happened much more often towards the beginning of the semester.\r\n\r\nPaper grading for this class is terrible. Expectations were never clear and I only figured out near the end that the paper desired was essentially a glorified logic proof and not any kind of creative synthesis or application, as one would naturally assume. If you wish for us to write in this manner, which feels entirely more appropriate for high school, please specify further.\r\n\r\nTFs are given far too much power over grading. I did not find my TF to be capable in general, and would have appreciated more engagement from Prof. Kagan in that respect. ",
            "\u00a0I understand the tough grading for papers and, honestly, think it is quite fair. It is harsh, relative to other classes, which is unfortunate but just a feature of the course. The think that bothered me about grading was how hard it was to do well in participation. I prepared for every section and still did not get great scores for participation. I think that was unnecessarily harsh and just deters students from taking the class. Should be changed. I think that it also makes section feel more competitive than conversational. Students are trying to get their big point in rather than listening to each other because of the pressure and difficulty of getting a good participation grade. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Every aspect of this course--lecture, discussion section, readings, essays--was excellent. Weaknesses: There were no authors of color on the syllabus, and some of the language Prof. Kagan used around race in the lectures was problematic. If you have time, I would strongly recommend reading Kant's writings on race (not on the syllabus) alongside the assigned readings from the Groundwork. In particular, \"On the Different Races of Man\" and \"On National Characteristics\" should give you a much more critical view of Kant. ",
            "\u00a0The section discussions often do not come to any kind of conclusion. Lectures are fascinating and informative. ",
            "\u00a0You can sit back and relax in the lectures but that's both good and bad. It's an intro level course, after all; many lectures he spends way too much time on relatively simple points. But that means it's chill. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course is that when students actively engage with the class, they develop a certain taste for logical arguments and get to delve into a type of thinking that many have not experienced before. The weakness of the course is that its policy of grading the discussion section is very much cutthroat and creates a suffocating atmosphere. It could be improved by changing the method of grading discussion sections; instead of ticking a mark for frequency of participation and grading the quality of the contribution, it might work better to not grade on these aspects for each and every one of the discussion sections, but rather in chunks. Doing so will allow people to participate more freely and actually enjoy the discussion sections more. ",
            "\u00a0First and foremost, the method in which section participation is graded is ridiculous - Tallying every time a student speaks only promotes an awful, inappropriate social behavior where everyone is spewing whatever nonsense comes to their head. Section participation should not be so influential in a person's grade, and someone shouldn't have to unnaturally shove their way into conversation to prove that they know what is going on - Let the papers determine that.\r\nMaterial is very interesting and the professor was very engaging. Someone get him a chair to sit in - His cross-legged sitting on top of his desk is not healthy for his lumbar spine. Only looking out for the guy. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the course! ",
            "\u00a0The course is very intellectually stimulating and rewarding in this sense. The essays related to the lecture and listening to the lecture was both entertaining and informative.\r\n\r\nThe section discussions had no rubric to know what was expected of students in terms of what we should learn in that time ",
            "\u00a0The course was strong in most respects but it was a bit weak in that the lectures didn't always align with the readings. ",
            "\u00a0These essays are graded too harshly, its unclear what the TAs want, they only give you a good grade if they agree with what you wrote ",
            "\u00a0I would have really appreciated more structured guidelines/rubric for the papers.  It was too subjective and therefore difficult to adhere to the professor's expectations. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: wonderful lectures, great if difficult readings, simple assignment structure, small and comfortable sections\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sections force level of engagement some students may find uncomfortable or difficult ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were very helpful in understanding the course material. I found it much easier to digest the readings when Shelly dissected them and walked through the arguments step-by-step. ",
            "\u00a0The reading schedule is not too demanding, which is good for an intro course for both Philosophy and non-philosophy majors. No significant weaknesses ",
            "\u00a0Course was rigorous and had interesting lectures but little teaching of intro level skills ",
            "\u00a0The weaknesses of this course revolve around the essays. The course could use clearer, more standardized rubrics that provide clear guidelines and expectations of how essays would be evaluated. Also TF's provide limited advice on essays which is a huge problem for students who want to do well and learn. The lectures and discussion section are really engaging and informative, but the weaknesses in evaluative standards constitute a big weakness. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the lectures, they were very engaging and interesting and went way beyond the readings. However, one criticism I have is that  some of the essay prompts were connected to ethical theories that we had only talked about briefly/superficially in class and had no readings for, which made writing an in-depth essay on these theories more challenging due to a lack of resources. ",
            "\u00a0Professor is very engaging, but the coursework may not necessarily reflect the work done in readings ",
            "\u00a0The grading is made to seem unnecessarily scary: if you try hard, you will learn a lot and do fine. That said, philosophy does seem sort of arbitrary so you probably won't have the same control over your grade that you'd anticipate in another paper-based class. Professor Kagan is a legend and really great at explaining complicated concepts very simply. The workload is usually very very manageable except during paper time (prompts only come out two weeks before the due date) when, if you're not careful, you may find yourself spending all your time working on the paper. ",
            "\u00a0The grading and the discussion sessions are harsh. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course is well-run overall. Lectures were engaging and informative, and my sections were good for filling in the gaps and exploring ideas. My TA (Joanna Demaree-Cotton) was especially helpful, and I found discussions with her to be the most valuable part of the course. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength is that it serves very well as an introductory course. Having never taken a philosophy class before, I was worried that I would be missing a foundation, but no such base is required. Another strength is the mandatory nature of discussion section, which I found were key in understanding information from lecture. The weakness to this is that one gets 50 minutes to discuss 100 minutes worth of information, in addition to the reading. ",

            "\u00a0Not as hard as people make it out to be. I didn't take it credit/D and I was fine. Most people take it for credit and they are the people who get the C's, so just put some effort in and you won't get below a B ",
            "\u00a0Take this course CR/D for one of the following reasons:\r\n1) You want a sampling of several strong cases for moral philosophy\r\n2) You enjoy solid lectures with very little useful reading\r\n\r\nTake this course for a grade for one of the following reasons:\r\n1) You love writing dull, shell-like arguments to please your elders\r\n2) You have no interesting contributions to make and would rather restate a theory for a better essay grade\r\n3) You live for uselessly arguing the obvious shortcomings of deterministic theories of morality\r\n\r\nDon't take this course otherwise. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it forces the student to engage with difficult, but important, topics. ",
            "\u00a0Great class - don't be scared off by the reviews. Just start it CR/D and convert later if you want to be risk averse. Go to lecture - they're really interesting/engaging + very useful for section and for writing the papers. Obviously go to section. Doing the readings will get you more out of the course (a genuine understanding of the works) but is not necessary for - and I might even say irrelevant to - getting a good grade if that's what you're after. (Shelly shades this advice on the first day; obviously doing the readings will help you learn more, so you should do them if you care about that - which, yes, admittedly you should - and have any spare time.) Learned a ton and had a pretty good time doing it. One of my favorite classes that I've taken so far at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0If you must take this course, TAKE IT CREDIT/D. I cannot emphasize this enough.\r\n\r\nKagan belongs firmly to the analytic philosophy camp and grades that way, meaning that your papers are essentially expected to be glorified logic proofs and demand far less original thought or creative synthesis than dogmatic attention to detail, which I did not find useful whatsoever.\r\n\r\nDiscussion sections are iffy - my TF often sat passively and refused to intervene on unproductive lines of dialogue. Far too much freedom is given to those with strong personalities but very little to say.\r\n\r\nThat being said, Kagan is a great lecturer and I thoroughly enjoyed that part of the class. ",
            "\u00a0I recommend it! Put in the work, talk to your TA, talk to a philosophy tutor. This will make the paper-writing quite enjoyable. Lots of logical thinking and brain-teasers. Enjoy Shelley. He is a terrific lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0I felt very taken seriously as a student in this class. I recommend. Material is interesting, too. I am less sure about some things, and more sure about others, related to ethics after taking the course. But either way I can state my position on them clearly and (maybe) convincingly now, which is cool.\r\n\r\nThink about your paper in the shower. So many ideas come from taking a shower! Additional advice is to pay attention to how Shelly presents ideas in the course. He walks you along so that you can follow exactly what premises are necessary to argue something, what the major counterarguments are, etc. This is how you should be writing papers for the class, too. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, you just have to be willing to put in a lot of time and effort on the papers ",
            "\u00a0This class operates on a maxim that applies pretty much universally to life: you get out of it what you put into it. Furthermore, you have options at your disposal to fine tune your level of engagement if you're looking for a bit less or a bit more: you can take the class Credit/D (less), you can stay after class every day to talk with Prof. Kagan (more), and you can do the readings as interested to some extent. Personally, I took the class for a letter grade, frequently stayed after class to talk with Prof. Kagan, thoroughly read almost all the assigned reading, and went to TA office hours regularly, and it was a wonderful learning experience. That is just one approach, however, and the point is that there are many perfectly good ways to take and appreciate this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This course is wonderful; each lecture is an eloquent exploration of moral theory and general philosophy. Kagan is a fantastic professor, a great personality, and an impressive thinker. Of course, this class is challenging; it takes time and real, unhurried thought to engage with the issues taught. And even then, its likely that you will find your most well thought-out ideas challenged and defeated. But this course is a venue for true learning and real intellectual challenge. While I found myself often frustrated at the sheer difficulty of interacting moral philosophical concepts, the challenge was evidence of my learning, and the courses ability to foster it. \r\nGo for it! ",
            "\u00a0Yes a great survey of some competing theories and a great opportunity to develop your own moral viewpoints. ",
            "\u00a0Shelly is known for teaching his course in such a way that students either hate it or love it. Like he explains on the first day of class, there is no litmus test to figure out which student you are. I personally enjoyed it, but you'll have to figure it out for yourself. ",

I also highly encourage that students who do not have previous engagements with the type of philosophic thinking and writing required by the class take it as credit/D/fail class. Even though you might try your hardest, the timeframe of a semester might not be enough for you to develop adequately and you might end up with an undesirable grade. ",

            "\u00a0I'd definitely recommend this course to anyone with an interest in ethical philosophy. Though we were only exposed to a few schools of ethical thought, I felt that exposure was nuanced and thorough, leading to a  deep understanding of complex topics. The grading of essays was tough but completely fair, and with a little effort it was easy to demonstrate improvement over the course of the semester. Although readings could sometimes be dense, Shelly never failed to walk through them step-by-step in lecture, which really helped solidify the information. All in all, it was a well-rounded course that was as rewarding as it was challenging. ",

Shelly is an excellent lecturer, and the material is very interesting. If you take the class for a grade, be prepared to work hard, but the work is worth it. ",

Thinking about moral and ethical ideas and arguments, how they bear upon one's own life and how one should live their life in light of these ideas - this is a very valuable process. ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend this class to anyone interested in morality and philosophy. It was the most interesting class of my freshman semester, and it has encouraged me to take more philosophy classes. You learn how to argue effectively and how to write efficiently, although not all of the writing skills translate to traditional English courses because there are very specific skills that pertain to philosophy papers. ",
            "\u00a0Anyone with the opportunity should definitely take Intro Ethics. It's an amazing class which you will look forward to each week. You don't have to be a philosophy major to enjoy the course. "
