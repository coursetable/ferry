Hard to keep up with the implementation details and algorithmic design concepts as well. Specs for problem sets could be more detailed. Also grading was ambiguous and delayed. ",

It is a TON of work and a lot of difficult content, but there is so much fundamental CS knowledge that is covered in this course, it's a huge loss to graduate without learning all of this. Take the class with a squad so you can go through slides together and understand the psets. It's a lot of work, but you'll also learn a ton. ",
