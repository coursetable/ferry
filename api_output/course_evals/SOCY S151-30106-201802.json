            "\u00a0I obtained a relatively thorough understanding about the theories of modern society . I had the privilege of learning how the great minds analyzed the society that they lived in.  Without taking this class, I would not have realized that the social norms we have gotten used to affect the disadvantaged groups negatively in unbelievable ways. I am now aware of the need of change in our society thanks to this course. ",
            "\u00a01. The knowledge about classical  social theories and contemporary social problems such as racism, sexism and neocolonialism.\r\n2. The ability to analyze the cause and aim of actions and probably social events.\r\n3. The ability to critically examine different arguments and theories.\r\n4. The awareness to analyze historic events with historical contexts. ",
            "\u00a0We learnt and discussed theories of several famous sociologists and some issues like race, gender... ",
            "\u00a0Now I have a basic understanding of the framework of Marx and Weber... and hopefully Durkheim as well. ",
            "\u00a0the readings from the last two weeks pulled me to focus on the issues about race, gender, colony and imperialism.\r\ndeveloped a deeper understanding about Durkheim, Marx and Weber. ",
            "\u00a0Main sociology frameworks of Karl Marx, Max Weber and Durkheim.\r\nDifferent genres of theory of morality.\r\nBasic connections between class, gender and race.\r\nBasic knowledge and insight of Colonialism. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided me with a systematic and scientific understanding to support my inherent incline towards fighting against systems of oppression.\r\nI thoroughly learned the concepts of the sociological canon and, most important of all, more than what is seen to be important by western sociologists. I left Yale with an informed opinion, with a strong stance against voices opposing my ideals and with a deeply rooted passion to delve deeper into the workings of Marx and modern-day sociologists, who are pushing forward in questions of oppression and exploitation. ",
            "\u00a0I find the course broadening my mind, because of different points of view on society that I have read about. It was also interesting to hear about perception of the issues of people with different cultural background. Although I was a bit afraid about participating in discussions, the teacher and group was really friendly so I could try it sometimes.\r\nI think the course was challenging and developing also to my language skills, especially because of different language of texts from 18th-19th centuries and different issue of the readings than other English texts that I usually read. I think the amount of texts made me quicker English-texts-reader. ",
            "\u00a0I improved myself through Mr.Rasit's class in all three aspects mentioned above:\r\nknowledge, skill, and insights.\r\nFirst of all, I enhanced my understanding in certain social structure, and certain social phenomenon like the racial discrimination. I never thought about the authentic reason and explanation for some observations, only judging them as just or unjust in the past. Through this course, the theories developed by Marx, Weber, Durkheim, Du Bois, and other writers all broad my horizon in comprehending what is Sociology. \r\nSecondly, the skills I learnt on class cannot only be limited and narrowed down into essay writing skills, but also connecting history with modern social theories. Formal academic papers help me to improve my writing skills; class discussion assist me to improve my cognitive ability and critical thinking... All in all, it's a great course with a lot to learn from the knowledge per se, the instructor, and my classmates.\r\nFinally, insights. After learning the course at YSS with Mr.Rasit, it seems that this term \"Sociology\" it's no longer distant for me. Viewing the world around me and explaining them with my own perspective could be a challenging task, but referencing through the lens of other sociologists will make this task easier and provide me diversified ways to analyze the society around me. It still requires effort to see how to use these things I learnt on class to plentiful fields and apply them to everyday lives. "

            "\u00a0The course could be improved by including projects or discussions that are more engaging and more suitable for students that are still in high school. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n1. Excellent professor\r\n2. The number of students is not much, so that I could engage more in class\r\n3. Interesting texts and theories that are neither too easy nor too difficult to gain basic understanding\r\n4. The free environment in class allows for more discussions and comparisons of different sociologists\r\n5. etc.........\r\nWeakness:\r\nSometimes the reading material is too much for me to finish and I have to read the version of articles in my first language to improve speed, which might lead to lower accuracy of the text I read. ",
            "\u00a0The readings are really helpful.\r\nthe discussion in the class are very interesting and inspiring.\r\nStudents can raise questions very freely in class and issues we discussed in classes ae divergent.\r\n\r\nreally intensive and heavy reading(I can understand that is because the tight schedual of summer session) ",
            "\u00a0The professor is perfect! :P ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\nAbundant knowledge and very decent reading materials. \r\nClear ultimate goal of learning.\r\nProfessor has creative understandings in this field.\r\n\r\nNeed to be improved:\r\nForm of homework could call for more engagement and thinking. ",
            "\u00a0Being centered around a critique of western civilizations, which are assed by their colonial, imperial, and exploitative past, this course is of such\r\nhigh value, because not only does it introduce the basic, most important works of sociology and more, but it nurtures discussion and, most important of all, it raises an informed student able to voice his*her concerns about inner contradictions in our current paradigm.\r\n\r\nThe only problem I see with this course is the time-frame. It is mentally not possible to absorb and really understand such vast amounts of material in such a short amount of time. Our professor, however, did a really good job of getting us all back together at the beginning of each session by analyzing, together with the class, and summarizing each and every text thoroughly. ",
            "\u00a0Although I find the course really great and interesting, it was really hard to follow up with all readings for the next class in 2-4 days. I am not sure how you can improve that - maybe we should get advice to start reading it before the Summer Session started or the readings could be reduced a bit. And I think that it would be helpful to write especially mid-term assignment, if we have known the questions when reading the texts, because we could bold some parts of it which would be useful. I think also giving historical background by the teacher would be sometimes useful before reading the connected texts. I think the strongest part of the course is the teacher with his passion, great attitude, stubbornness in pursuit of true and not-only-American point of view. The teacher is really open. He broaden our knowledge, but also let us think by ourselves. I find great he form of seminar for the course. ",
            "\u00a0I will list them again in a very simple and concrete form.\r\nStrength: \r\nThe great teaching methods and prodigious knowledge base of the professor\r\nThe uniqueness of the class contents per se (no course like this in high school)\r\nThe depth and width of the knowledge delivered from our professor through the texts of different authors\r\nThe thorough understanding delivered between students\r\nThe cultural diversity of students\r\netc.\r\nWeakness:\r\nI didn't come up with one yet. If I've got a chance, I would like to experience this whole thing again :) "

            "\u00a0Yes, I would. The class and reading materials can help students (especially high school students) get an idea of what college student life is like.  In addition, students are able to gain abundant knowledge of sociology and relate the theories to the world we live in. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. \r\nAs I've mentioned in the answer to the 3rd question, the professor is excellent in summarizing, analyzing and extending the reading materials so that we could always understand the text while not being restricted in the text.\r\nThe reading load is heavy and the papers are not short, but my understanding of social theories is simply based on these and I learned a lot of useful knowledge and developed my thinking pattern with the engagement of the reading.\r\nThe class itself is really interesting with happy atmosphere, the professor and students are humorous and hardworking. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Abundant and broad knowlege, very enegaging and useful for further study.\r\nPeople can express their views freely in class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Students can learn opinions from different sociologists towards differents. It is really helpful to expand knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I become a Marxist after taking this course... I would definately recommend this course to others as a mean to spread the ideology of Marxism. ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely. I gained a lot in the reading, discussions and lectures. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it to students with sociology or philosophy backgrounds, considering the course requires basic research methods in sociology and understandings of important theories. Theyll gain fair insights that would help their future studies. ",
            "\u00a0This course broadened my horizon like few things have done so before. I would therefore recommend taking this course by Prof. Rasit to everyone with the privilege to study at Yale, because he not only provides a thorough analysis of more than the sociological canon, but he first and foremost challenges the student to rethink his*her ideals and internalized understanding of the world and its past in order to gain an informed opinion one can live by according to his*her ideals and moral conception. ",
            "\u00a0Of course! I really enjoyed the course. I see the society form different perspective and it was pleasure to take the class and the reasons are above. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely!!!\r\nSee the answer in question 1, the entire class content and atmosphere is my favorite.\r\nMoreover, it will be really helpful for standard testing because there's a great load of reading every class, but it's different from my conventional understanding in which its very useful and amusing as connecting to famous historical events. The compare and contrast prompted by the professor  also lead students to think creatively and critically, as providing a new perspective in studying modern social theories proposed by different sociologists with varied background.
