            "\u00a0I learned the basic steps of how to create a start-up. I also learned how to get to know my competition as a way to help me differentiate my company from what is already being done. I became more aware of what consumers are looking for as well. I also built important relationships with stores that could possibly take on my products. This class even taught me how to create a financial plan, which I was most overwhelmed by. ",
            "\u00a0I developed knowledge of standard venture capital approaches to entrepreneurship, including marketing, operations, business development, cash flow projections, management, and fundraising. These skills came through applied work in all areas, as well as the weekly lectures and class meetings. ",

            "\u00a0I learned so much about how I can launch a company and I realized that breaking everything into small milestones makes the endeavor some very possible. I didn't know where to start before this class. The assignments kept me on an organized deadline so that I could make quicker progress. I don't think I would have gotten as far as I have without this class. ",
            "\u00a0The knowledge, skills and insights aligned fairly well with my expectations, although I would have liked to have received more instruction about how to actually do what was being taught. There was a lot of material to cover, and most of it was just covered at a very high level, not in depth. ",
            "\u00a0We wrote a successful business plan that we will start soon ",
            "\u00a0Okay. The class used powerpoints from the 1990s that gave me epilepsy and nausea. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed working on a venture for the semester. Some of the course content was really helpful and practical. However, the lectures seemed to take a narrow and old-fashioned approach to starting companies. From what I've seen, the routes and pathways are much more dynamic and variable than how they were presented in the course. ",
            "\u00a0The skills gain surpassed my expectations. As a result of taking the class we were able to submit our business idea for the Sabin Venture prize award-though we were not successful we got good feedback from the judges. We also submitted our idea to the Connecticut Business Plan competition and we won two awards. "

            "\u00a0Strengths - Great feedback on business plan/executive summary. Makes you think critically about the gaps you are failing to address. Great way to manage a timeline for the initial growth of the company.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - advice on how to incorporate and acquire funding seems outdated and narrow after consulting with other people (lawyers, particularly). It's too \"one-size fits all.\" Everything is about venture capital and become a corporation that incorporates in Delaware. I'm afraid that Maureen's path has a higher risk of you being eventually removed from your company by investors. She insists this is the best way to do things and does not consider other options. Would like to see a class with more diverse pathways to incorporate and get money. ",
            "\u00a0The course would have benefited from more frequent lectures and meetings, as well as an updated set of slides from the professor. To some extent, the class was secondary to the business that we we're working to develop, and that was a positive strength of the class. A major weakness was the closed-minded approach to traditional venture capital approaches and a lack of willingness to entertain big ideas. ",
            "\u00a0It is a great opportunity to develop a business idea as it takes one through the whole process step by step. Having a financial background is an added advantage for better understanding ",

            "\u00a0If you are looking for a very traditional understanding of the venture world and entrepreneurship in general then this is a good course, but don't expect to get detailed training on any aspect of what it means to actually set up or launch a business, that comes from your own out of class efforts. While those efforts are allowed and encouraged by the class, if you're going to take the class you should be prepared to pursue those learnings on your own. ",
            "\u00a0The best course to develop business plans, helps you think about the whole process. ",
            "\u00a0The strongest element of the course was the opportunity to work on a start-up for the semester and receive course credit. There was some interesting and useful material in the lectures, but the course also seemed to oversimplify the process. Maureen's comments were insightful but sometimes needed to be taken with a grain of salt. ",
