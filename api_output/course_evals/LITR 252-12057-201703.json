            "\u00a0You cover the entirety of Machado de Assis's career and nothing else, if this doesn't appeal, don't take it. But if you're interested in South American literature at all it, it will be very helpful and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course for those who want to understand more about the genious Machado de Assis and immerse in his universe of sarcasm, irony and realism. Through the course the students are able to have new perspectives about Machado`s books and experience unexpected discoveries, what leads us to understandings we would have never considered before! "
