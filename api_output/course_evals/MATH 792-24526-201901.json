            "\u00a0This is a very interesting subject.  The presentation of material in the second half of the course was sometimes difficult to follow, though.  I think that even though this was a grad course, having a few sets of suggested exercises throughout the semester could have helped us consolidate our understanding of the material as we went. "

            "\u00a0This course covered interesting material.  I would recommend it if and only if (1) you have finished taking the core math sequence and have moved on to focusing on electives and (2) you are good at learning a bit independently and following up on confusing details from class even if nobody is forcing you to hand in psets.
