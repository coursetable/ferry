            "\u00a0Reasonable and proper. The pace a case per week is ideal. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the workload was consistently fair. I was never overwhelmed with the workload. I appreciated that large projects were assigned well in advance with the full assignment being given to us at the start of the term. I thought every reading was valuable, and thought that the write-ups were a useful tool to focusing my thoughts. ",
            "\u00a0Adequate and manageable for the course. ",
            "\u00a0Its every week assignment kept me on the toe. It was not too much of work, but required consistent effort on the course. Also, the nature of the assignment helped me get better prepared for the classes. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the amount of preparation required for each class was very reasonable and this course was rarely ever a source of angst.\r\n\r\nMy greatest consistent challenge in my course assignments was actually in paring down my long, impassioned responses to the case studies to  the manageable 200-300 words that was required. ",
            "\u00a0I believe I would have more trouble with this workload first year. Compared to my other courses this felt light, though that is most likely due to the fact that our third year courses are inherently more difficult and time intensive than the courses we take in our first year. "

            "\u00a0The course was very well organized. ",
            "\u00a0The cases were clearly analyzed during class time and the group discussion has been fun and fruitful. ",
            "\u00a0My one suggestion for improvement in this area is that sometimes changes to the materials would only be reflected on either the physical documents or the digital documents on canvas. I would appreciate if changes had been reflected on both materials.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, the course was laid out in a very logical way. Any major changes to the syllabus were communicated in advance. I never felt that there were unexpected surprises in the materials. ",
            "\u00a0Well-organized and made logical sense. ",
            "\u00a0It was very clearly stated since the beginning of the course with the given syllabus. It was helpful to have diverse topics throughout the semester that involves managing people. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the class was well-organized, built logically on each week's assignment/learning and featured a good balance of discussion and lecture.\r\n\r\nThere was some shuffling around of assignments that was a little bothersome - but that was beyond the professor's control. ",
            "\u00a0We didn't stray from the syllabus, which may be the first time that has happened in my time at YSD. That said, I was and remain unsure about the important throughline of the course. Each topic was covered well and the order in which they were hit was useful, however I'm not clear on what we were building towards. "

            "\u00a0Vicki covered a large range of topic in this course and invites people in the field into the classroom, which I found really interesting and helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The instructor clearly knew the material and was very well prepared for class. Besides commanding the material, she was able field questions that were outside the scope of the day's lesson. Her presentations were accessible and informative. ",

            "\u00a0She was very clear about the topic that we were covering each class. How the class was student-instructor interactive was amazing. I appreciated her help when I had questions or struggle in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Vicki taught with an engaging mixture of practical information and anecdote that brought the material nicely to life. She was very affirming/excited when the class got to the heart of an issue we were discussing  and was also happy to step in and provide alternative perspectives if she felt we were missing the mark. Her sense of humor and amiable nature made the class a pleasure. Because this class offered a broad survey of the concept of 'Managing People,' there were some topics that I wish we had been able to tackle with more depth, but I recognize that the inherent nature of the class prevented that. ",
            "\u00a0Better/quicker responses to emails would have been nice - especially at leas responding to acknowledge reciept of assignments.\r\n\r\nThe discussions were more helpful than the powerpoints, which sometimes felt like afterthoughts to the real meat of the class. "

            "\u00a0I loved getting to speak with Jeff via Skype - this was my favorite day in class. I found Emily's presentation less interesting and less useful. ",
            "\u00a0I very much enjoyed all of the course visitors, but especially our public speaking session with Emily Donahoe. ",
            "\u00a0Bringing new ideas and very collaborative. The tips on making public speech was a useful tool kit, and connecting with the protagonist of the case that we were working on helps connect whats on the paper with whats in the real life. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed all of the visitors who spoke in class. The two presentations that tied directly to our assignments (Hendel and Herrmann) were fascinating and I wish we had more time with them, or at least they had more time to share their thoughts outside the scope of our questions. ",
            "\u00a0Emily was my favorite visitor, and I'd love to have her visit YSD multiple times, even for workshops. ",
            "\u00a0The speaker who came to help us with the public speaking was great. It seemed a little out of place in the course structure compared how other topics are tightly tied together. The class itself however was enjoyable and helpful in general. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that the session with Emily Donahoe was very useful and engaging - but that we could have, in fact, used even more time with her to fully benefit from what she had to offer. Not sure how that could be accomplished. Maybe she is a full workshop and not a class visit.\r\n\r\nWhile I thought that the Seattle Rep case was fascinating and provocative, I thought that our session with Jeffrey was a little underwhelming. I don't know if the questions we developed weren't incisive or interesting enough or if he just only had so much he was willing to say -  but I had hoped that our conversation would be gutsier and more provocative. ",
            "\u00a0Emily Donahoe was helpful, but I wish we had spent at least some time during the previous class discussing what we could expect. This would have allowed me to prepare better questions for her. \r\n\r\nThe Seatle Rep day was interesting - though the tech could have been better handled. If we can't have him come out in person, scheduling that session to take place in a room better equipped for such a course would be helpful. Having a camera that can see the whole room and a microphone that can hear it at least. Like, say, the 3rd floor conference room? "

            "\u00a0I learned a lot, and I'm sure I will take this material with me into my career. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very helpful in allowing me to understand the managerial aspect of leadership, and I learned the most from Vicki's real-world experiences. ",
            "\u00a0The case study focused on practical situations that we might face in our real life. The course is truly helping us better prepared. Im not familiar with the HR and employment policies in the United States so the employment part of the courses seemed more challenging. Although I learned a lot but Im not sure if I can recall and use what is discussed during class if I should seek employment in this country. ",
            "\u00a0I really valued the things I learned in this class!!! It illuminated an aspect of management that I was unaware of. It certainly changed the way that I expect to look for a job in the future. There were a few lessons, such as the termination lesson, that I wish we had done a second day review or had a guide on a handout. There was a lot of useful information in that lesson, and I worry I did not retain the \"why\" of it all. ",
            "\u00a0I consistently found myself referring to material from this class in my work and in my personal life. I found the material relevant and useful, and hope to build on it in the future. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, it was interesting to see the theatre from a different perspective. I spent a lot of time working closely with designers and technicians. I was excited to learn how theatre is managed from the administrator/manager's perspective. Also, I loved the course didn't only focus on theater. It was an eye opening experience to read case studies about non-theater, but more businessy fields. ",
            "\u00a0I think this class presented a very nice introduction to 'Managing People' - and as someone who has really only managed interns before, I found it very instructive.  I frequently found myself applying ideas from the class in my PWA assignments and to case studies read for other courses - which is indicative of both the strength/efficacy of the material and the quality of the teaching. ",
            "\u00a0Again, I never really discovered the through-line of the course. The topics were interesting, but I'm not sure what the larger picture is. This was especially clear to me when I got to the final project - I struggled with what the assignment actually was. I believe I learned all the skills needed to accomplish it in this class, but I'm not entirely sure how to put them together. "

            "\u00a0I would have liked more opportunities for feedback on my application of the materials we learned in class. Receiving written feedback on work at the beginning of the semester was helpful in understanding my grasp of the materials, and I missed that later on in the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Well organized and clear! ",
            "\u00a0My suggestions for improvement are listed in above responses. ",
            "\u00a0I would have preferred to receive some kind of brief feedback on at least my first case study response - if not on every case study response.\r\n\r\nI recognize that these assignments were just brief responses sent via e-mail - but distilling the essence of a 20 page case into a 200 word response actually took a lot of care and craft (not to mention time) and I would have appreciated knowing if the quality of my response was hitting the mark. ",
            "\u00a0Is there a way to do \"cultural analysis\" in place of a case study or two? While I can analyze an organization much more clearly than I could before this course, I'm not clear on a specific set of steps to do this. Something similar to the Functions of Leadership organizational analysis paperwork would be helpful. "
