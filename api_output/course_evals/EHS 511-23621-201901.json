            "\u00a0Not as much work but clearly no structure in the course. Tests had unreasonable expectations given the lack of flow in the lectures. Also, a final paper, final presentation, and final test is too much. Professor should follow the pick 2 from 3 criteria for the final of these three. This would follow that the two final assignments would be of a higher quality as students would not spread themselves too thin. ",

            "\u00a0The lectures and readings were great, but I had a hard time engaging late in the week, and late in the day. ",
            "\u00a0The course is more oriented at practical risk-assessments rather than the theoretical framework, which could be either a strength or a weakness, depending on the student. For me it was a weakness.\r\n\r\nAnd perhaps because this course is a bit outside my field, I found it a bit of a challenge to determine the boundaries of each domain--but I think this may be due also to changes in the field and different agencies.\r\n\r\nAdditional resources that might be helpful:\r\nNRC (National Research Council). (2009). Science and decisions: advancing risk assessment. National Academies Press. https://doi.org/10.17226/12209.\r\nRisk assessments and management theory and sociology (Sunstein, Beck, Giddens, Hacking, etc.) ",
            "\u00a0Material had potential to be very interesting, but the lectures are so unstructured and the professor often goes on unnecessary tangents. Expectations for exams and group papers/presentations remained relatively unclear until the very last minute. Honestly not a great class for non-EHS students, as the professor seems to expect for you to have a basic foundation in areas like toxicology that would be pretty foreign for non-EHS students. ",

I believe he can follow them quite easily, but in preparing for exams, I found myself a bit confused on where I was in each step. ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Ginsberg is clearly an expert in this subject matter and field, but I did not get the sense that he cared much for the class. He was 15-20 minutes late to class almost every week. I understand that he's driving from NY, but being late was more normal than not, so if he cared about the course, I would have liked for him to prioritize finding a solution so that he can get to class on time (and then he would keep us late to make up for time lost - not ideal for 5pm on a Friday). He also should not come in to teach this course expecting all of his students to be well-versed in toxicology like he is. Rarely followed the syllabus. ",
