            "\u00a0Much new knowledge on pedagogical practices, developments in rhetoric, etc. ",
            "\u00a0In this course I learned about the discourses surrounding the rise of vernacular poetry in Early Modern England! I am not an early modernist so the scholarship and concerns in the formation of the Renaissance were entirely new to me. I learned a great deal about the question of rhyme and its vulgarity in the rise of English poetry. I also learned a little bit about the nature of classical scholarship in the Renaissance, as well as its connection to an increasingly alien- seeming history. The seemingly inextricable influence of the classical in the vulgar, and vice versa, taught me a little bit about the kind of choice-making renaissance authors felt was available to them . . . In short, I learned about how a culture makes claims on the past through poetics and thought a lot about what kinds of futures those claims imagined. \r\n\r\nI think I became familiar with early modern literary scholarship as well, especially the most historicist strains of that scholarship. De Grazia forever! ",
            "\u00a0I found this class to be a great introduction to the period that also encouraged high-level reflection about the nature of literary periodization itself. The knowledge and skills it imparted were therefore both specific to the writers on the syllabus -- and the instructor did a fantastic job enlivening and clarifying the more difficult of them, while showing us how to close read sometimes obviously brilliant, sometimes rather awkward poetic forms  --  and generally useful for literary scholarship in any period. I especially appreciated how the instructor used the material to help us think about the problem of literary value: who gets valued and why? how were authors priming their readers to receive them in a certain way? how and with what degree of success were unusual poetic forms vying against established ones in the period? and how does the reception history of Renaissance figures continue to shape the way we canonize them (or don't)? ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to better track the formation of literary practices within their national context. ",
            "\u00a0A good sense of how emerging poetic practices, national identity formation, and writers engagement with classical education intertwined in England in the Early Modern period. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a real appreciation for the breadth of English 16th century poetry, and I especially learned more about women poets of this period and how much they engaged with the broader conversation of what it means to write poetry in English "

            "\u00a0This is a great course with a diverse syllabus catering to both those interested in history and those interested in theory. Within each session we proceeded at a lively pace and engaged a number of important ideas, while never losing sight of the primary texts and the ways in which we can close-read them. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- great syllabus! Many writers I had never come across before, and appreciated coming into contact with.\r\nWeaknesses- would have appreciated a little more space for discussion- while lectures/comments were helpful, the conversation sometimes got swept away. Also, professor's attitude toward texts was often depreciating- would have appreciated a little more excitement about these writers and texts. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: A  truly eclectic and surprising reading list, a discerning eye for the most useful kinds of scholarship for making that eccentricity  legible without flattening it. I don't imagine any seminar can be exhaustive, but it feels like we covered a wide breadth of styles and questions in the period . Class discussions were always upbeat, and the continuity between Prof. Nicholson's contextualizing and student's responses always felt fruitful. \r\nThis class was also one of those warm introductions to the professional scholarly environment. The postures taken in the class toward scholarship and collaboration were professional, but it still held the feeling of a judgment-free community intact.\r\n\r\nMy only complaint may be that I wish there were more room for provocations?  And that may be a personal preference. ",
            "\u00a0In addition to the strengths mentioned above, I thought the course did a very good job engaging every student in the class, regardless of background. This was partly a result, I think, of a very well-designed syllabus that gave us all many possible points of entry. It was also a result of Professor Nicholson's excellent seminar leading -- she was very good at pulling comments together, helping students clarify ideas that were still inchoate, and responding with clear enthusiasm and passion to many different kinds of argument. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are really one strength and that's the professor, Cathy. She substantively broadened the relevance of early modern texts and did an incredible job of creating a classroom where students from various levels of expertise felt comfortable engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Nicholson is one of the best facilitators of dialogue in the department. She incorporated peoples insights into her own teaching and encouraged them to engage with each other: everyone in class feels they have something to offer when Professor Nicholson is facilitating, and she makes sure that people with more knowledge share it generously and with context.\r\n\r\nIn some sessions, theoretical discussions (all fascinating!) didnt allow us to engage with the poetry too closely. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course was strong in the depicting the breadth of poetry in this period. I think a weakness might be over-focus on secondary work and critical conversation, which I understand and appreciate for a grad seminar, but I think there was more to learn from and say about the poetic writing itself. "

            "\u00a0Yes. Early modern texts are so much fun! (Seriously!) ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but with caveats- the conversation was fairly fixed on several specific ideas- and I didn't feel a close engagement with the primary texts until the last couple of sessions. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to any student working in English poetics, even if their interest was not in the renaissance (it's a great distribution class). There seems to be a gnarled set of roots in the beginning of English literature and it s interesting to watch them unfurl into the present. \r\nAny scholar working in the renaissance would certainly benefit from this course. ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this class to anyone, regardless of whether they studied the Renaissance. The discussions were always illuminating, and they certainly left me with a lot to think about going forward. It also brought some under-read authors to light, while also accessing new dimensions of more familiar authors. The class also engaged intrinsically fascinating questions about method, literary history, formalism, and the imbrication of politics and style. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Cathy is a great instructor. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. A great introduction to a broad range of poetry from the Early Modern period through a sophisticated lens that incorporates Professor Nicholsons expertise.  Students working in all periods would benefit from taking this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Cathy is a fantastic instructor and this course is a great survey of sixteenth century poetry. "
