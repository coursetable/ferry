            "\u00a0The homeworks are reasonably challenging but definitely a strength for the class. The midterm was poorly executed and should have either been an unlimited-time take-home midterm or just done in-class. Meng is clearly still learning how to lecture, so I think that he could improve the class by focusing more on explaining the physical meanings of what we are doing more rather than simply grinding through the mathematics from Kardar. I think the main thing the class needs is additional physical explanations as we are going along. Often times I have found myself capable of doing the calculations but still lacking a strong grasp of the underlying physics. ",
            "\u00a0I cannot think of any strengths of this course. The textbook for this course is horrific, and does a terrible job explaining concepts and giving context to calculations. The lectures were difficult to follow, and also lacked any context or motivation. The midterm, which was a take-home exam, was also awful, in that it was not comparable to homework, it was far too long for the time, students didn't follow the constraints of the test, and the questions were very unclear and contained several mistakes. The final exam, which was in class, was also far too long and far above the material of the homework. The length and difficulty of weekly homework was fine. The class could be vastly improved with a better textbook, including more context for the material, and parallel construction of the homework and exams, which should reflect the teaching goals of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses:\r\n1. The take home midterm was a bit of a disaster. It was far too long, much more difficult than homeworks, had several mistakes, and many students didn't follow the constraints.\r\n2. Homeworks were not comprehensive. That is, we did not get problems about material on which we were tested. The assignment on probability was never particularly relevant to the rest of the course.\r\n3. Textbook was often not clear. It did not motivate methods or calculations and often skipped non-trivial steps.\r\n\r\nStrengths\r\n1. The section on quantum gases was decent. Professor Cheng's lecture notes were very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The course content itself was reasonable and well chosen. Many times steps in the derivation of expressions were skipped in order to save time, but felt important enough to be explained. ",
            "\u00a0Homework was easy compared to exams. Id flip it the other way around. Overall, very good though. ",
            "\u00a0The Kardar book isn't very enlightening.  There seems to be little motivation for the material much of the time.  I had to find other books to help explain things better. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is the material -- statistical physics is a great subject. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course is very organized and Prof Cheng is very clear about the concepts and derivations. ",

            "\u00a0If this course were not a required one, I would absolutely not recommend it. This course felt like more of a crash course in mathematical approximation than a statistical mechanics course, was not taught well, and lacked motivation. ",
            "\u00a0Probably not. It seemed to often lack motivation and context. It was also not very useful for those not interested in condensed matter theory. ",
