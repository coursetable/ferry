This was immensely helpful to me and solidified my understanding of more traditional statistical concepts in a very fun way. The next part of the course moves \"beyond linearity\" and covered many of the \"machine learning\" techniques that I had begun to encounter in the ecology literature. I gained a solid conceptual understanding of how these techniques work and how to execute them in R. ",

            "\u00a0The first two thirds of the course (supervised learning) were all about solving two problems: regression and classification on a dataset given training data, including choosing the best method to perform regression and classification. We did this with linear regression (this is not trivial AP Stat stuff), linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, logistic regression, gradient descent, bootstrapping, stepwise regression, the ridge and lasso, splines, kernels, local regression, GAMs, trees, bagging, random forests, boosting, and SVMs. In the last third of the course (unsupervised learning), we covered PCA, k-means and hierarchical clustering, topic modeling via Latent Dirichlet Allocation, and spent two weeks on neural networks. I know it sounds like a lot, but it is definitely manageable for sophomores/juniors whove taken/are concurrently taking S&DS 241 and 242. I personally found the material super interesting, and very relevant to work undertaken in industry (even though it is not always the most cutting-edge, industry is generally not using the most cutting-edge techniques yet either, and the material in this class is directly applicable to work being done in data science divisions in major tech companies).

            "\u00a0Overall, Susan did a great job of teaching us machine learning and how to apply it. Biggest weakness of the course, however, is the exams and how we're only provided one practice exam to prepare. For a class that's weighted so heavily on exams, I felt that the exams only tested some extremely specific aspects of what we learned overall in each half of the semester. I would liked more open ended, explanatory questions that tested whether we knew what the ML tool was over a random assortment of questions that tested minor applications of the tools. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures are very clear and informative. problem sets are relevant to what we learn in lectures. Having sections could be useful to help get the hang of R coding. ",
            "\u00a0We covered a huge amount of material and struggled through very challenging problem sets, but the homework did help reinforce what we learned in lecture. I wish we didn't cover neural nets to the extent we did. ",
            "\u00a0The psets are okay; I like ones that seemed applicable to the real world.\r\nThe lectures were in generally very weak - it seemed like both a waste of Susan's time and ours, to be honest (especially the conceptual parts - we didn't spend enough time to really understand, but too much time considering how unhelpful it was. The conceptual pset questions, on the other hand, were pretty enlightening to work through). This class might be better if it was formatted backwards (read material beforehand, do problems, and ask Susan questions in class). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Very comprehensive, lots in information delivered clearly. Piazza was a great resource\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- would appreciate more discussion of the application of the techniques\r\n- HW solution sets and actual comments on the HW code would be helpful\r\n- A possible (but more difficult improvement for a large class) would be to let student find their own dataset and apply the techniques to the dataset ",
            "\u00a0The balance of applied and theoretical was quite good, particularly in the homework assignments. It would've been nicer if some of the applied parts of the homework were a bit more theoretical - the two parts felt almost like distinct classes at certain points, which made the learning a little less motivated as a whole. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the lectures and the material were very strong. I think we could have had a bit more guidance on the problem sets which would have facilitated learning more, but I still thought the problem sets were well thought out. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent course! Maybe more R Guidance and psets that are not as monotonous ",
            "\u00a0I thought it was very well organized. ",
            "\u00a0This class was very well organized. Professor Wang was a fantastic lecturer. One challenge was that people in the class came from a range of backgrounds and were looking for different things out of it. I think it would be beneficial to have split it into two different classes - one more theory-based and one more application-based. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were pretty dry, but it's good that the slides were pretty clear over all. I also like that we work with real data sets in the problem sets.\r\n\r\nIt was annoying that the tests were mostly about the application of the techniques, so we didn't have to know a lot of the math behind the slides. ",
            "\u00a0I think the greatest strength of this course was the amount of material covered and the pace at which it was covered. The material was interesting and seemed useful, and the pace was fast enough without seeming unmanageable. However, I think the greatest weakness of the course was how a lot of the material is taught. As with other applied statistics classes I have taken at Yale, this class tried to strike a balance between presenting the math behind the methods we were using and actually deriving equations and proofs. In the end I felt like this made the class more confusing than less, because many equations would be presented in succession on the slideshow but would only sometimes be referred back to on psets or exams, and sometimes the equations weren't explicated fully either in lecture or in the textbook. I would have liked if more of the math was presented, maybe working through proofs by hand instead of displaying equations on the board. ",
            "\u00a0The course does a good job of covering a lot of material and providing real world examples to contextualixe the content. Sometimes, the theory behind the techniques was difficult to grasp and more time could have been dedicated to its explanation. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this course was well-structured. I appreciated the careful foundation in the basics followed by a more in depth look at machine learning techniques. I thought the homework assignments did a good job of focusing my learning to capture certain key concepts, and allowed for some \"discovery.\" Occasionally, I think that I didn't benefit as much as I could have from the \"discovery\" sections of the homework, mostly because I was a little shy on my pre-requisites. ",
            "\u00a0Very well organised & explained, many office hours and help available, homework sometimes needed clarification. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are definitwly the problem sets. If in class we could got hrough a few examples/applications rather than just theory that would help. ",
            "\u00a0Great problem sets, perhaps a gentler introduction to R since the initial problem sets were very time consuming for those new to R. Also a bit unclear at times how much math we are expected to know. ",
            "\u00a0I think I wouldve liked more mathematical derivations of things, to really understand how everything works ",
            "\u00a0I thought this course was nicely balanced. The psets were just enough of a stretch that they taught you something in and of themselves, but not so much that they took 20 hours a week. The lectures were just mathy enough that those of us with lin al / multi / stats theory got something out of it, but also included enough intuition / visuals for those of us with less math. It moved quickly so that we could get to neural nets at the end, and I appreciated that. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Wang is a fantastic teacher. I took S&DS 230 with her, and decided to take this course mainly to take another one of her classes. Shes extremely well-prepared for each class, and lecture is extremely organized. It almost sounds like she rehearsed each lecture before she gave it, but when students asked complicated questions she would always give detailed and clear answers that showed she was really an expert in the material. I learned an enormous amount in the class, and even though it was quite challenging for me, I am very happy I took it. I would suggest making S&DS 230 a prerequisite to this course, because I found my prior knowledge from that course to be essential, and would have had a hard time without it. The course didnt really spend any time teaching the fundamentals of R, so 230 could be added as a prerequisite without changing any aspects of 365. Two minor complaints: the problem sets that said things like make some plots to get some intuition about xxxxx were a little vague, and I wish we had more specificity on what exactly we were supposed to do. I also wish we didnt have a problem set due the morning after spring break, since we basically had to squeeze it into the time before break, unless we wanted to do the problem set on vacation and without office hours.

            "\u00a0If you like R and are prepared to spend a lot of time struggling through very challenging problem sets, you'll be fine in this class. The material is really difficult, but office hours and Piazza can help you get through it. I do feel that I learned a lot, but it was a stressful course. ",
            "\u00a0There could be a lot of improvements made, but it is one of the better STEM courses Yale has to offer. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - but I would highly recommend that they take the pre-requisites (which I did not) and be very comfortable in R or be willing to put in a lot of hours into problem sets. ",

            "\u00a0I took this course with no knowledge of R and only AP statistics, so the learning curve at the beginning was steep. However, this is the class that I have learned the most in this semester, and Susan does a wonderful job of presenting a digestible amount of information. Machine learning topics showed up in three of my other lectures is semester, and this course made me so much more sure of what I was doing in other contexts. That said, without the proper background, its easy to get lost in the proofs in class. However, with enough work, this class is doable without the stated prereqs. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Amazing professor, course taught clearly and thoughtfully. ",
            "\u00a0Yes if you are interested in machine learning. It goes through many algorithms so its a great way to get started in data science. ",
            "\u00a0This class was very well organized. Professor Wang was a fantastic lecturer and her slides are good enough to study from if you don't attend lecture. I thoroughly enjoyed doing all of the psets. As someone who is more interested in applications rather than theory, I really enjoyed this class; however, I know that some people were frustrated that it was not as mathematics/theory focused as when Professor Lafferty teaches it. ",
            "\u00a0I suppose I would recommend this course to another student, if they're genuinely interested in learning more about applied skills in data mining and machine learning. I personally found it dry most of the time and not really that relevant to my interests, but I did come away with a solid understanding of the techniques and considerations that are important to know when modeling data. ",
            "\u00a0Sorry to break it to you, but this course is not going to teach you a lot about neural networks, and you certainly will not be programming self-driving cars by the end. In fact, most of the material will probably be pretty old techniques that people have been using for quite a long time. But these techniques can still be useful. The lectures are probably going to be pretty dry, and some of the problem sets can be pretty annoying. Even though I only had S&DS 238 and whatever I could remember from linear algebra, I still got a bit out of it. If you want a deep mathematical understanding, you'll want to have a strong math background. Otherwise, you can get by. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to a student who is not as interested in math or who does not have a math background, and who just wants to get an overview of machine learning techniques. The course doesn't go super deep into any particular topic, nor does it do much to explain the math used, so if either of those things are of interest I would not recommend the course. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a good introduction to the field. I would recommend taking a few statistics courses beforehand, but I never took a statistics class in high school or at Yale and it was doable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Time invested in thoughtfully completing homework assignments pays off. The homework and code provided for in-class exercises are excellent guides to ferry you through this exciting subject. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely, I am a first-year so this was a little more challenging than I thought it would be, but the fast pace and homeworks paid off. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!!! If you like stats, computer science, math or all three definitely take this class! ",
            "\u00a0A great class if you are interested in ML. I learned a ton from this class and Susan is very thorough and effective at teaching the content. Getting used to R has a steep learning curve if you're not used to it, but the problem sets become very interesting and enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course if you're looking for an applied introduction to working with, and deriving meaning from, large data sets. I would strongly suggest reading the textbook and being active on Piazza. I had only had Stat 100 before this course, and I did fine; she does a refresher on linear regression in the first week of class, which serves as a foundation for most of the rest of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, just understand what you are getting into. It is much, much more statistical than S&DS 230, and the equations describing how the various machine learning methods work can go by really quickly and be a little overwhelming. There are no formal proofs. S&DS 242 is technically a prerequisite, but about 30% of our class was enrolled in S&DS 242 at the same time (and there were probably some people who hadnt taken it at all). Also, about 50% of the course is grad students. Dont let this deter you, though: you can take the course as an undergrad and do just fine (like, get an A) if youve got S&DS 241 under your belt and are comfortable working with matrices and vectors of variables. I took the course with only Math 120/222 and S&DS 241/242, and it was hard work but manageable, especially since expectations are always very clear. During the supervised learning portion of the course (the first two thirds of it), we use the Intro to Statistical Learning textbook, and Id highly recommend spending 5-10 minutes before each class skimming the relevant section. Even though Professor Wang is really good at explaining the concepts, youll get more out of lecture if you already have a high-level idea of whatever she is explaining that day. There were six problem sets during the semester, and they took me about 10-15 hours each, with writing things up and figuring out R syntax taking a while each time. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0I took this class credit/d/fail and thought the workload was still pretty large. If you haven't taken S&DS 242 and 230, this will be a very challenging course (I would describe this class as 242 and 230's demon baby). Nevertheless, I still learned a lot and the grading is relatively lenient. "
