You cover a very broad range of topics, ranging from encoding to machine learning, but never end up knowing anything deeply or well enough to confidently list that topic as something you know. Definitely learn a lot on how to write a lot of garbage on a topic you never fully understood and how to pretend you know something when you dont. In terms of actual practical knowledge, you wont get much of it in this course. ",

            "\u00a0I think this course is a difficult course because of the broad list of topics, which require a strong background to understand well.  Coming out of the course, I don't think that I could explain many of the topics, but to solve this, I think there should be more thought into depth vs. breadth.  For example, the few classes on machine learning and security (I know they were supposed to be an introduction to the topic),  were necessary and could have been used for reviewing the prior topics.  Most of the students did not feel confident in the prior topics, and allocating the aforementioned class time to concrete examples would have helped us understand the important topics (like Fourier, convolution, etc.). Nick's office hours definitely helped me get a strong grasp on what we did in class, but I think he should have held more.  Finally, as for the examples used in class, I think they started out too general (especially with the notation), and with the students' backgrounds are factored in, they were too abstract to apply.  More examples with basic wording and a step-by-step walkthrough would have helped tremendously with the psets. ",
            "\u00a0This class would be awesome if in class there were some example questions worked out. \r\nI found that the classes were incredibly abstract and the PSETs dealt with real-number examples, and it was quite difficult to translate from one to the other. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- I find it great that we review previous material at the beginning of every lecture\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- I wish the problem sets were not just based on completion. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are the material (and the matlab labs), it is very interesting and applicable to many different fields in EE. The weakness is probably the teaching, which made lectures very dry. ",
            "\u00a0The content of the class is very interesting the way it is presented to us not so much especially since we can't explore any of the concepts in depth due to a lack of mathematical knowledge such as stats and linear algebra ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: topics are cool, lecture notes are often very complete and the textbook is very engaging.\r\nWeaknesses: THE LECTURES. Wenjun is a nice person, but completely inadequate as a professor. This appear to be a general trend in the EE department - they hire amazing researchers, but horrible lecturers. Most people dont show up to class. Sitting through 75mins of lecture is absolutely excruciating. She is unable to explain things clearly and in an understandable way. Doesnt show enough clear examples that showcase what is expected from us. That becomes quite frustrating, because the topic we cover can get very complex so you can get deep into following a complicated method without realising that she expects us to use simple shortcuts. A very frustrating and annoying class as a whole that made me want to switch my major away from EE. ",
            "\u00a0This course should have coding prerequisites and does not. It expects that you will be able to complete coding-based lab assignments individually, even with no coding background. It should also have a linear algebra prerequisite. On the first day, we were told that this course would not be math intensive, but rather focus on grasping a conceptual understanding of the material. Although this statement generally holds true, students who have a linear algebra background are able to understand the concepts far more easily than those who have not taken a linear algebra class. By not having prerequisites for this course, it puts students at an immediate disadvantage, and this is not clear at the beginning of the course. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the lectures are also taught in a very disorganized fashion that makes it hard to follow and difficult to recognize the bigger picture for the concepts about which we learned. Expect that most of this material will be learned on your own using a textbook. The textbook however is very well written and does provide a good basic understanding of concepts. There are also detailed lecture notes and slides on canvas, but again, a linear algebra understanding is necessary for at least the lecture slides included in the second half of the course. ",
            "\u00a0The course taught high level concepts well but utterly failed to train students on working through problems and actually being able to use their high level knowledge. More time should be spent working through problems in class and psets should be more rigoursly graded to provide greater incentive to actually learn how to do the problems. ",
            "\u00a0The course seems a little too broad. The material itself was enjoyable, but difficult to learn. ",
            "\u00a0I think that we didnt do enough practice/ example problems in the course. It made it incredibly hard to get the bigger picture i.e. what we were actually learning and what it co update be applied to. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes Wenjun would get stuck trying to explain one topic for most of the lecture. ",
            "\u00a0This course, while its subject matter is intriguing, really doesnt feel like it has a unifying thread. I found it very difficult to appreciate the course material in any context larger than the problem set assigned that week. ",
            "\u00a0Even if she's not the best lecturer, Wenjun tries really hard to be engaging and approachable, which is much appreciated. The online lecture notes are also very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Fascinating material; Homework graded for effort; Not necessary to have taken linear algebra or probability & statistics; Recaps at the beginning of each lesson; Lecture notes posted online; Allowed to bring notes to exams; The Professor and TA explained concepts well; MATLAB assignments were practically fill-in-the-blank but still educational.\r\nWeaknesses: Not enough worked examples, so it was sometimes hard to apply the concepts to homework problems.

            "\u00a0Yes, because it contains important topics about Electrical Engineering without really knowing how electrical components work. I think it is a good overview course for students considering EE as a major. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to any other EE student, especially if you are early on in your EE/CS career. There are many interesting topics, and although you may need to learn many of the topics more in depth on your own, it will make learning all of these topics again later much easier. ",

She tries her best to make sure everyone is on the same page, so you can't really fault her. The material we covered, however, is very interesting - I learned much more about various facets of electrical engineering that I never even knew were considered part of the field. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students interested in learning information theory and the mathematics of electrical systems. "
