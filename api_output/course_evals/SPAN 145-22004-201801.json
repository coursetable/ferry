            "\u00a0Strengths: Very good for improving language ability, excellent professor, interesting variety of material (videos, movies, readings). Weaknesses: Some aspects of the course were not incredibly helpful - for example, the Supersite is very expensive for how much it costs. ",
            "\u00a0The VHL central homework could have been more consistent ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: probably just the textbook, the organization is pretty poor. Class is also very long but still beneficial. You will spend a LOT of your time in this class. Tests are a bit too long for the hour you get but still manageable. \r\nStrengths: Class is well taught, Sra. Valle's teaching is awesome. Never judgmental and very welcoming. In class video shorts and movies are always insightful and concern themselves with important themes, and the others are very clever and fun to watch. Overall a strong class. ",
            "\u00a0Prof Valle is great, the format of the class is really good, and it helped me feel more confident speaking. Weaknesses were the class textbook/the extremely expensive online workbook subscription. "

            "\u00a0Yes. I would recommend this course to a student interested in committing himself to improving his/her Spanish and wanting to satisfy two language requirements at once. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course if you want to improve your Spanish. It offers plenty of practice, Professor Valle is engaging and thoughtful, and especially considering it is 2 credits the course has a reasonable workload. I found it very manageable and often pretty enjoyable. Sometimes the 2 hours would feel very slow, but other times they flew by. The movies we watched and stories we read were also really good. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Valle is amazing, you will enjoy your class with her. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely would recommend this course, my Spanish improved so much. The balance between speaking/listening, reading/writing is really good, and I particularly feel more confident with speaking. Feedback is consistent and helpful, and you can always ask for more help if you need it. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! A lot of work but very fun and the time passes very quickly ",
            "\u00a0If you are serious about improving your Spanish, I would highly recommend it. Professor Valle is a wonderful instructor and makes the class engaging and fun. Meeting for two hours everyday, you really get to know the other people in your class and ours was a truly a community by the end of the term. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially to get the credit out of the way. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - take this class if you want to learn Spanish and really be immersed in the language every day. "
