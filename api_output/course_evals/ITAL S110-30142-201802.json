            "\u00a0I learned the fundamentals of Italian grammar and language, along with skills to speak and listen at a rather basic level. Most verb tenses used in the Italian language seemed to be covered (although a few remain for L3-L4), and a lot of fundamental vocabulary was memorized (although at times the choice of vocab felt arbitrary). Notably I dont think I gained too much skill in conversational Italian, perhaps because that takes longer to develop than literary Italian. ",

            "\u00a0The biggest strength of this program is the instructors. Anna and Luca both cared so much for us and truly showed us that they cared that we succeeded and got a lot out of the program. On top of that, the program does a good job infusing cultural visits and tours, so that participants perhaps gain a greater understanding of Italian culture and heritage, without overtly spending much classroom time on it. \r\n\r\nThat being said, the program has quite a few weaknesses. The first is the culture of work that Siena creates. Because the program is so intensive, necessarily  students spend a whole lot of time learning vocab and doing homework. However, the pressure put on the students to preform created this nasty anxiety in which everyone worked all afternoon and didnt really take advantage of being in Italy. Grades became a fixation instead of learning from the landscape. The second problem (which, at times, blended with the first) is the location. Siena is a great town for study in many ways: its safe, its quiet, etc. However, its so small and plain (at times) that there are few activities for the class to do together to bond. Its a super isolating town in which the never-ending brick buildings seem to resemble those of a prison more and more every day. The biggest problem, though, is the homestay situation. It never felt like home. I still dont think my homestay parents really care for me at all; they host students year around (and if I had to guess, they are simply looking to profit). This isnt atypical from what Ive heard. Most students felt force-fed at times and essentially no one felt at home. 8 weeks is too long never to feel at home. Perhaps the old 5 weeks in Italy system was better in this regard. But the problems with the home stay program dont stop there. They are incredibly isolating. For the students who lived 40 minutes away from the center of town, alone, it was nearly impossible to make friends or feel connected to the program (which, of course, is compounded by the lack of things to do in Siena). The homestay section of the program taught me little about Italian culture (my host parents seemed more keen on criticizing my eating habits than teaching me about Italy) while making me feel super isolated and alone. Perhaps this could be rectified by doing a dorm component at Yale or in Italy, or simply by adding more class trips and class meals to foster a sense of community and unity within the program, but whatever it is, something needs to change. ",
            "\u00a0It was easy to stay engaged with the course at all times. Being surrounded by the language, and with the huge amount of information we were responsible for, it was hardly a choice whether to be engaged or not. You kind of had to be. \r\n\r\nI thought that the pace of the course was at times hardly doable. At some points I wasn't able to get a thorough understanding of the material because we moved on so quickly. I understand this is a function of trying to squeeze 2 whole courses into a short period of time, and there isn't much that can be done to remedy it.  \r\n\r\nMy biggest complaint was with the host stay situation. I was the only student in my household, and I found it very hard to interact with my host family. If I were to do it again, I would definitely ask for a roommate, as I imagine having another person with you that is in the same language situation would greatly ease the difficulties of interacting with your host stay family. ",
            "\u00a0Anna was a great teacher- one of the best I've ever had in my entire life. Could have been improved by her teaching the whole course. ",
            "\u00a0The course goes a little too fast. It could be strengthened if there was time in between to review past material. The strengthens definitely were the professors! Great professors that support and are available to you make the learning process so much better. ",
            "\u00a0One of the weaknesses of this course was simply just the pace, however I think this was a strength in some ways as well. Having the language so condensed was certainly difficult and while we had class for 3 hours a day, 5 days a week, it also required 2-3 hours of self-studying on those days as well to keep up and do well with the language. I think that having the program entirely in Italy made a huge difference, especially living with a host family who spoke 0 English really forced us to learn quickly. Although this was challenging at the time, I do think that it really helped improve my ability to speak and learn the language.\r\n\r\nI think that there are many ways this course and program can be improved. I think that the syllabus really needs to be looked at critically. I believe that the professors and some students of the program need to look at the syllabus together, and work to find a way where units that were most challenging or weeks with the most going on (trips, etc.) are facilitated and structured so students have more time to focus on more challenging topics, such as the subjunctive which was virtually skipped over at the end.\r\n\r\nI also think that the timing of program trips needs to be looked at more critically, especially most of the Siena trips after class. The only three trips disclosed to students before the program and on the syllabus were: Rome, Florence, and the beach. I think that first, the beach trip should not have been referred to in the information session at Yale especially as the beach trip, as it involved a trip to the archeological site. I think many students, myself included, actually really enjoyed that visit (probably one of my favorites of the program), however many were frustrated beforehand because it felt sprung on them. It was also only 3 days of class that week because of the Palio, which I think made it really difficult to push through the final couple of weeks of the program, and this likely contributed to a lot of the exhaustion students were feeling. Additionally, there were many trips within Siena that came up even the day of, such as trips to Contrada Museums, the bank, etc. I think these need to be planned more in advance so that students are prepared to engage with them, and can especially plan their studying and travelling accordingly. ",
            "\u00a0The book for the course does a very good job of explaining grammar but does not place a lot of emphasis on vocabulary. ",
            "\u00a0I think the first few weeks should be spent at Yale because being in Italy for all eight weeks felt very long also we arrived without knowing any Italian so it was difficult to communicate for the first couple weeks ",
            "\u00a0I think having the program in Siena for eight weeks was one of the most important improvements done to the course. You are being exposed to the language and the culture from day one, and you get more enthusiastic to learn the language and to learn it as fast as possible to talk to the beautiful people of Siena than if you were stuck in New Haven for the first three weeks, where there are your friends from outside the program with whom you can hang out, a whole world that has nothing to do with neither the Italian culture nor the Italian language. ",
            "\u00a0There should be more of a direct way to converse within the school settings because expecting our hosts family to contribute is nice in thought but in actuality It is not always feasible. Some families just stick to English and some just won't talk to you much at all if they can help It. A student can only force someone to speak with them but so much. ",
            "\u00a0At times, especially with specific grammar rules, the professors and the textbook differed. This could get really confusing sometimes, so it'd be nice if either a different textbook could be chosen or more of an effort could be made to match the textbook. Since the program was so intense and accelerated, we relied heavily on the textbook outside of class. Otherwise though, this class did an incredible job of including a little bit of practice in every form, with weekly essays, daily grammar and vocab, speaking mostly Italian in class, and having the opportunity to practice conversations with native speakers around Siena. One more thing is that the program seemed a little long, especially in the last couple weeks. I understand 3 weeks in New Haven and 5 weeks in Siena seemed too short to previous students, but all 8 weeks seemed a bit exhausting. Perhaps 2 weeks in New Haven and 6 weeks in Siena would be ideal. ",
            "\u00a0I think a strength was a the pure amount of information that we were able to learn in only a short eight weeks; however, one thing that could be improved was the timeline of the course. It felt like there was constantly too much going on which was very stressful and took away from our ability to enjoy our time in Siena and fully immerse ourselves in the culture. ",
            "\u00a0The main dilemma of the program was its extremely fast pace, cramming a year's worth of material in barely eight weeks. We were forced to skip key concepts and rush over to the next part without giving time to fully comprehend and absorb what was taught. This issue was slightly remedied because we were in an environment that forced us to speak and listen to Italian all throughout the day. The textbook was no help, however, as it was poorly organized, unclearly worded, and often contradictory. To improve the course, the instructors need to find a textbook better suited for the needs of the program. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this class. The teachers made it very interactive and fun every day--we would do Kahoot competitions about once a week, and have other interesting games interspersed between lessons. The one thing I would say to improve about the class is that sometimes we'd get off-task and spend too long covering things that are interesting, like Italian stereotypes, but not necessarily helpful to our success as students. However, these moments were few and far between, and overall this was a great class. ",
            "\u00a0The book was a major weakness. The course was too focused on grammar and writing and not enough on spoken, which meant that students knew a lot of the grammar in theory but then when they tried to use it in practice they couldn't speak because they did not know any useful vocabulary. Especially given that this course took place in Italy, meaning that the ability to speak to people is quite essential, there should have been a much larger stress on vocabulary and the spoken aspect of the Italian language.

            "\u00a0Perhaps. It definitely depends on what the student is looking to get out of the program. If the student wants to get through L1-L2 and see something different, its probably a pretty good choice, but I would also warn them to temper their expectations about how fun the program will be. My working evaluation of the program (which is definitely changing and developing as distance from the program grows) is that Im glad I did it, but I wouldnt want to relive those 8 weeks. I feel really sad and isolated for most of them, and definitely was waiting for time to run its course. It is a program that taught me what I needed to know, however, and so I dont regret doing it. I just wish I would have come in with lower expectations \r\n\r\nIf a students did do this program, though, I would offer them this advice (and yes, all of these are implicit recommendations of how to change the program):\r\nFirst, be very specific with your dietary needs with your host family. They will probably ask you, Do you eat everything? Wanting to be a good student, you will say yes. But if the thought of pasta every day disturbs you, maybe dont be so accommodating. Likewise, grow thick skin. They will likely try to make you eat more than you want every. single. day. If you dont want that or want to remain health-conscious you will have to be pretty aggressive about pushing back. Its tough, but necessary (I do wish, however, that program coordinators were more helpful in laying down the law to host families that force feeding is not okay!).\r\nSecond, try to get involved early. Finding places to study in Siena is tough (read: nearly impossible), but I urge you to try to make friends early so that you can perhaps find that elusive slice of home in Siena that I never found At the same time though, be careful who you travel with. Traveling & sharing an airbnb with a relative stranger is a fast path to an explosive fight.\r\nThird, be kind to yourself. You will probably be homesick at times, and may not enjoy the program much at all. Thats okay/normal. It felt really reassuring for me when I realized that I wasnt the only one having issues with my host family or the program as a wholeessentially everyone was in the same place. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Although I didn't love it at times, it was definitely a valuable experience, and I think anyone who goes through it can get something meaningful out. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend to students who really want to challenge themselves over the summer. Definitely would not recommend to students burnt out from the spring semester. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student looking to learn Italian quickly and efficiently. I would not recommend this course to someone looking for a 'gut' language because it requires a lot of effort and accountability, however is definitely and absolutely worthwhile for anyone willing to put in the effort. The course is designed in a way that students can succeed, and the professors were great. Overall I would recommend this course to students, especially those looking for a great summer abroad experience and learning a new language. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It was far more fun to take a language abroad than on campus and the level of engagement was much higher because you literally had to speak the language ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would. The language is great, Italy is beautiful, instructors have your best interests at heart. Even though this was an intense program, the course was organized in a way that made it very easy to follow through and get help when needed. ",
            "\u00a0Yes; It is a wonderful experience and I  believe that all students should learn languages while simultaneously being immersed in the culture. It fosters more of a love for the language being learned, and it fosters more self-discovery as well. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. For all the small things that could be improved, this class was still a great introduction to the Italian language and a really interesting and engaging exploration of Italy in general. I'll look back on this summer for a while as one of great learning and experiences. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was a once in a lifetime way to learn a new language. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, despite the problems with the class, I had a great time in Italy, spending two months with fellow Yalies in a beautiful country. I also learned a lot about Italian language and culture outside of the classroom, too, so it was a fully immersive experience. ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely!! If you want to get some language credits over the summer, this is definitely the move. My professors were the best I've had at Yale so far, and you get to be in ITALY for EIGHT WEEKS! The workload is definitely manageable if not sometimes monotonous because you're only studying Italian, but I learned so much and had so much fun while doing it. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely not recommend the course itself. I speak 5 languages fluently and essentially spend all of my free time learning languages, so I have some experience with this and in my opinion this course has many quite obvious and significant issues. The positive was that we were in Siena and it is a gorgeous town to spend a summer; however, the course itself (which I assume is the same when conducted at Yale) is a quite poorly executed. The textbook is terrible. 4 pages out of 5 are skipped entirely during the course. It is a 300 page textbook with literally 26 useful pages (I counted). There are so many issues with the way that the Italian language is taught at Yale that I couldn't write them all in this course review even if I tried. Just to shed a small light on the problem I'll give a minor example: all the vocabulary lists are organized in the alphabetical order of the Italian words, with the corresponding English translation next to each italian word. This means that you cannot quiz yourself using the textbook because you automatically know what letter that the Italian definition will start with since you see that the word above it started with the letter 'C' and the one below also with the letter 'C'.\r\nIt is such a minor thing when considering the 300 pages of stupidity that is that textbook, but it is the small things that make the biggest differences when you are attempting to learn a foreign language.\r\nI want to be clear, I am not ranting to be mean. I am ranting because I am trying to help and I think the Italian department could greatly improve its efficiency if it fixed some of these problems.\r\nInstead of having a textbook that has all of the vocab, grammar, culture, and passages for reading. There should be different books for each of the 4.\r\nThere should be a vocab book, a separate grammar book, a different book for reading, and then culture should be taught by teachers through powerpoint presentations or articles.\r\nThis course was lazily organized and many students suffered because of it. I was lucky because I knew, through experience, how to teach myself Italian while I was in Siena, in spite of this course. But most other students did not, and spent a ridiculous amount of money and 2 months in Italy and came out of the course without the ability to speak the slightest amount of Italian. They also did not have enough vocabulary to be able to read or write coherent passages that did not sound like Google Translate. "
