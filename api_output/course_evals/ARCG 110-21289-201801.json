            "\u00a0A more profound appreciation for decorative arts (it really is everywhere) and how it applies to global arts ",
            "\u00a0There is an endless list of things I have learned from this class. It is so much more than a survey of the history of decorative arts - it was an incredible experience. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write short museum labels about objects with a ton of information. In section and lecture I learned how to evaluate objects and look at connections. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how various decorative arts are created and the history behind them. I can see many art pieces in an entirely new light. ",
            "\u00a0Decorative art and cultural traditions ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how to identify and appreciate different mediums of art, which was a very new concept to me as I am not an art history major. ",
            "\u00a0-- How to recognize materials, crafting techniques, and different aesthetic styles in decorative arts\r\n-- Honestly, very refreshing to go beyond the emphasis on interpretation you work with when writing about paintings, sculpture, etc. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to appreciate decorative arts when I see them at a museum or even in the world around me. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me how to look and think critically about art. ",
            "\u00a0I gained the ability to identify objects and walk into museums with a greater comprehensive knowledge of the materials and underlying social structures beneath the objects displayed. I also learned to write briefly and informatively, speaking to the importance of various objects. ",
            "\u00a0The course provided a fascinating opportunity to engage with objects in a hands-on setting. The assignments, modeled after museum labels and catalogues, exposed me to a writing style I hadn't yet experimented with in other art history courses. ",
            "\u00a0Methods about production of art ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write about an object using incredibly concise, yet descriptive, language. I learned about the flow of materials and ideas between East and West, giving me a whole new appreciation of the development of modern decorative arts. ",
            "\u00a0This class was amazing. I didn't know much about decorative arts before this class, but this course really showed me how fascinating this area is. ",
            "\u00a0this is actually a really interesting and wonderful course. Professor cooke is so knowledgable. one thing i had an issue with was memorizing terms for the final. I ",
            "\u00a0Good insight into the making and transfer of decorative arts ",
            "\u00a0This was the third art history course I have taken at Yale so far and unlike the other courses that analyse the importance and iconography of a piece of art, HSAR 110 encouraged me to understand HOW a piece was made, and how its construction contributed to its importance and significance. ",
            "\u00a0I developed skills in identifying objects' materials and processes of manufacture by examining them, and also the aspects of trade and society that affect the making of use of objects. I developed a greater appreciation for everyday objects. ",
            "\u00a0A greater appreciation for the decorative arts and the processes and materials involved in making decorative objects.\r\nEngagement with the haptic sense and learning through touch - it was phenomenal to be able to interact directly with these objects in the YUAG classrooms!\r\nA wider understanding of art across different cultures and social milieus. An understanding of an expanded definition of art. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: Sections! and written assignments were actually very fun to do. ",
            "\u00a0Section in the Objects Study Classroom was the best kind of section I have ever had. I couldn't believe the fact that I got to touch ancient Greek pottery with my bare hands - it makes for a priceless learning experience. ",
            "\u00a0I loved everything ",
            "\u00a0There are a lot objects with a lot of information that needs to be known about them. The professor and TAs seemed passionate about the subject matter which helped keep the class interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I think they could have writing workshops since a significant proportion of the grades is based on that ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n1) Comprehensive course load\r\n2) Gives students a much needed look at decorative arts, which are often overlooked in academic settings\r\n3) Edward Cooke has an amazing trove of experience to draw on to supplement his course\r\n4) The YUAG resources for decorative arts, even those we can personally handle, is honestly unmatched by any other college. Only Yale could do this course so well. ",
            "\u00a0The beginning of the course is process-intensive which makes it kind of boring, but I understand why it's necessary to understand how things are made. It made me think about a lot of things I had not previously considered about ceramics and furniture. Discussion section was engaging, it was nice to be able to touch things we learned about in class. The readings were way too long. ",
            "\u00a0I very much enjoyed the structure and content of the course. The experience of handling objects was informative and irreplaceable, and I learned so much in both lecture and section. ",
            "\u00a0I thought it was a great course! I especially enjoyed the second half of the semester ",
            "\u00a0Very boring but the professor was very passionate ",
            "\u00a0The lectures for this course were amazing.  Professor Cooke was organized, and thoughtful.  The readings were very interesting.  Section in the object study classrooms of the YUAG was also amazing  getting the chance to touch and inspect the sorts of objects we looked at in lecture was an amazing opportunity and really helped the learning. ",
            "\u00a0Section in the OSC is awesome; it's super cool to be able to handle the objects and find out their story. Lectures were good overall but could be a little more organized and clearly worded. Only complaint would be the readings: they are pretty niche decently long, so most students don't end up doing them. If they were shorter or broader, students would probably actually do them. ",
            "\u00a0This course encouraged me to look beyond the surface decoration of a piece to understand how its material and makers informed its importance in the history of art. Each class focused on a different subject, ie: ceramic material, ceramic decoration, haptic and the touch, and was led by a passionate professor. The readings for this class are long and laborious however and not really necessary to do well in the course tbh. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of new things in the course, and I appreciated the opportunity to closely examine and touch objects in section. However, the lectures were sometimes hard to pay attention to, and they went through a lot of material, so it was often hard to tell what was importantoften I would not remember or have anything written down about terms that were on the midterm or final. I would suggest making the object and term list for the midterm and final available at the beginning of the semester and after the midterm, respectively. "

            "\u00a0Yes! Not only a great introductory art course, but a great class to learn about art that some may not even know exists. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this class! I waited until my second semester senior year and I am so glad I did end up taking it. I never thought I would enjoy learning about something like textiles as much as I did - class provides you with a great background for the evolution of different materials and the evolution of decorative arts in general. Section is an incredible addition to the theoretical knowledge gained in class and I loved going. It is incredible how a class like this can change the way you view the world and how you look at things. Also, exam and grading wise, it was always pretty straightforward and the feedback from our TA helped me improve over all. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. An easy and incredibly engaging class, while still teaching you a tonne of things that will stick with you anytime youre in a room with ceramics or furniture. Would HIGHLY recommend. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - I loved this class. Also I love that you could touch the art in section - its a entirely new way to engage wit what your learning about. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this class was interesting and well worth the time. Being able to handle actual pieces of history was a great experience. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Although lots of memorization will be needed, it broadened my view on the world of decorative arts. Previously, I didnt ascribe much value to objects and textiles. Now they have so much more meaning in the context of global interaction. ",
            "\u00a0Yes- wonderful course ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely. Its a good introductory course to the decorative arts, which you often take for granted. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Lots of memorization, but taking this course makes you appreciate and look at furniture, decorations, metal objects, etc. in the world in a whole new, exciting way. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was an interesting course without too much time commitment. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this class! You get to handle art objects in the museum collections, which is a once-in-a-lifetime experience (as I realized, holding an ancient Greek kylix in my hands for the first time), and you gain so many important skills that inform the way you engage with the material world around you. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think its important to know the history of art that isnt painting or sculpture. ",
            "\u00a0Best class I've taken at yale ",
            "\u00a0I guess if youre an art history major ",
            "\u00a0This is one of the best courses I have taken at Yale and I recommend it to any student who is interested in better understanding the material world we live in. ",
            "\u00a0This course is great  I would certainly recommend it to another student.  There is so much to learn about art history beyond paintings, and this class begins to chart that perhaps unfamiliar territory. ",
            "\u00a0This is an absolutely essential course for both students of art history and students just looking to gain a deeper understanding of the material world. Even as an art history major, I couldn't have imagined how much I would learn from this course. Getting an overview of materials for and processes of making furniture, ceramics, textiles, and other decorative arts, in addition to learning about their use, value, and stories, has totally changed the way I interact with objects in my day to day life. The course has made my life even more fulfilling, and I'm so glad to have taken it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the workload is low and section is very interesting, you'll learn a lot about art forms that are not usually emphasized in art history classes ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would highly recommend this course to students, both HSAR majors as well as those who are not, because this course creates a strong foundation and understanding of material culture and how our global material and visual culture has been shaped. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it if you're really interested in decorative arts or are taking it for the art history major, but otherwise, it's very detailed and a lot of memorizing. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course, you won't regret it! You will come out of the course with an understanding of the decorative arts and the beauty and functionality of decorative objects. The course teaches about art with a lens shifted away from Eurocentric understanding of art which very much expands your understanding of artistic objects. The course thereby expands your idea of how history informs the creation of these objects, and how these objects inform history. You also get to go to the YUAG and touch certain curated objects in section, which is a phenomenal opportunity.  Great course for anyone even vaguely interested in art history, and is approachable for any major. "
