            "\u00a0The primary strength of the course is also it's primary weakness --- it's remarkable breadth for a single semester, introductory course. This survey approach means that I feel I've been exposed to a quite substantial swath of the core ideas in NLP, but also means that I don't feel I have more than a surface understanding of any of it. This was furthered by programming assignments that primarily took the form of \"fill in the blanks\" on large codebases. The course could I think greatly benefit from programming assignments that --- even if lesser in total scope --- require students to work from (near) scratch and show they understand the core ideas, instead of just filling in bits and pieces by using examples from elsewhere in the code and snippets of documentation. \r\n\r\nOther strengths are the quality of the lectures themselves and the single written homework assignment given, which I felt was suitably enlightening and challenging. ",
            "\u00a0I think the content in this course needs to be reduced a bit. Especially, there are almost more than 100 different PP slides, and it is really hard to follow. Also, I think the last two assignments can be updated to be more instructive instead of doing some coding puzzle. Other than these issues, I feel that I learned the basics of NLP after this course. ",
            "\u00a0Material was old. ",
            "\u00a0The slides and lectures can be much more organized. The slides are ordered by topics instead of by lectures, which make the course hard to follow. Also there are way too much materials, I think it could be better if some of them are selected to be covered and more in depth. ",

            "\u00a0The lectures were very engaging, but went by faster than I could take exhaustive notes and the slides didn't have all of the information discussed. Neither of these are problems on their own, but it meant that I couldn't review the lectures terribly well. If you were able post recordings of the class (or have longer form notes available) that would be helpful. ",

            "\u00a0Too much focus on old-school NLP methods. Course should instead be focused on deep learning. Please make it more practical by teaching students how to build deep learning models for various tasks. ",

            "\u00a0I'd absolutely recommend it if they were interested in NLP and linguistics. Even still, I might recommend it as an awfully good survey of various topics of relevance to modern computer science, which we covered quickly but well throughout the course as necessary for NLP tasks. Basics of machine learning, probability theory, linear algebra, stochastic processes, and so forth, all of which were familiar to me but might be a good exposure for someone who has taken a more straightline CS curriculum. ",
