            "\u00a0This class provided an overview of some core concepts in the field of environmental engineering, such as aquatic chemistry, water and wastewater treatment, and air pollution. It used a little bit of chemistry, stats, and math to aid calculations done in relation to all of these topics. I learned about how we treat water, factors that influence air pollution, and issues surrounding aquatic chemistry. The course is more about civil engineering as it pertains to the environment, rather than engineering methods of renewable energy or creating green products. ",
            "\u00a0This class gave a great introduction to the main topics of environmental engineering. Prof. Peccia always made sure to bring in the human significance of these topics (rather than just giving us the equations). ",

            "\u00a0I gained a great understanding of general concepts in the field of environmental engineering and the ability to think critically about related problems during the course. This was immediately clear during my summer research opportunity when I would be talking to others and/or reading grant proposals. I understood a great degree of the content whether it be during conversation or reading proposals on my own. ",
            "\u00a0Intro Environmental Engineering provided a highly accessible and comprehensive knowledge of the main models and methods of problem solving engineers use to approach real world problems in water quality and air quality. I learned a lot about water chemistry, the physics of pollutants in both air and water, and the technological flows that treat both air and water. ",
            "\u00a0This course was great at creating good application problems and taking concepts and incorporating them into multistep problems. I developed better critical thinking skills and a good overview of the insights and processes of environmental engineering. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me a foundation to understand the sources and potential solutions to address water and air pollution. We first learned of the origins of much of today's pollution issues, and the public health risks associated with them. We delved further into the chemistry of the bicarbonate system and chlorine system (for disinfection), and quantitative measurements of the effects of climate change on natural systems. We learned to perform the necessary calculations to determine pollutant concentrations that pose a safety risk, and determine the contact times necessary for reactions in various reactors or inactivation of bacteria by chlorine. The class gives us the appropriate systems thinking to go on to other environmental engineering classes. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n1. Professor cares about students and is overall very friendly--scheduling times to meet was very easy + he gave plenty of time on exams\r\n2. Homeworks were hard and tests were much easier, which I prefer\r\n3. Topics were useful and the general information was interesting/important trivia to know\r\n4. I loved when the professor went off-tangent and just talked about life--funny, engaging stories that often made my day much brighter :)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses;\r\n1. Sometimes the professor was a bit disorganized\r\n2. A little bit hard to follow the lecture at times (I'm unsure if this was just me or the course itself--it might have just been the content of the course in general was not easy for me to conceptualize) ",
            "\u00a0Professor Peccia is a great professor. He's very relaxed but clearly smart and wants his students to learn. It's easy to ask questions and the lectures were never very hard to follow. The homework problems weren't always written very well, because they frequently required you to make assumptions that weren't specified. However, the TAs were always helpful with answering questions such as that. This course is a good one for anyone interested in what environmental engineering means in terms of an industry. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Great introduction to the main topics of environmental engineering, with an emphasis on practical applications to issues that impact humans. \r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the class was a bit disorganized and examples in class weren't always clear. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Peccia was great, lectures were engaging, problem sets were challenging but well-structured. I really enjoyed this class as a general introduction to applications in environmental engineering. I would have liked to see more design examples. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that the class does well at giving you a basic understanding of everything. However, the class can be tedious at times, repetitive, and not particularly engaging. I think the biggest issue I had was that each class would start with a summary of the last class pretty much, so we were covering the same material multiple times. It did make it helpful for exams though because the material was drilled into you. ",
            "\u00a0Weakness - lectures were boring, but Peccia is a really awesome and funny guy. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures can be a bit slow and repetitive at times and the psets can be long but this ultimately helps to reinforce and develop a deeper understanding of the material. ",
            "\u00a0Very good teacher, very clear lectures. Submitted homework follows a specific format, which is very annoying at the beginning. Also homework typically requires knowledge and information not provided in class, so be aware of that. ",
            "\u00a0The course was well taught  & the midterms  were  very  fair. The PSETs  took  a good deal of time  to  complete & at times were very challenging but it helped to   practice the material! ",
            "\u00a0Great introduction to environmental engineering concepts. I enjoyed this class so much. I wish I had taken it my first year because it would have avoided me so much trouble and confusion choosing a major and going into my other classes. The class was well taught and covered important concepts that you will see in other classes such as air pollution control and water quality control. I also liked how we discussed applications of what we studied in the real world by looking at studies and data through the mini presentations in the class. I think what makes science interesting is to see it being applied more than just the equations that we learn about. This is rare in so many science classes at Yale. That was my favorite part of this class. ",
            "\u00a0Jordan is a fantastic teacher. The class, in combination with the readings and psets, taught the material affectively, though the syllabus promised design and engineering opportunities at the end of each unit which was not met. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength of this course was how approachable the professor and the teaching fellows were, providing guidance in many different options outside of class and in study halls. Before taking this class I was a bit worried that my math/calculus abilities were not prepared for this class, but concepts were taught in a highly accessible way that were easier to learn and reimplement. Weaknesses n/a. ",
            "\u00a0Given the time we had, it is difficult to go over so many topics as a brief introduction, but our professor did a great job. He balanced the time well and we were able to hit multiple major factors within environmental engineering through the course of the semester. There really isn't much that needs to be changed to this class if anything. ",
            "\u00a0The course is a great introduction to the chemistry, thermodynamics, and transport phenomena necessary to address air and water pollution. We discuss important concepts in class, with the background and historical examples to make them understandable and relevant to the modern context. The homework problems are at times challenging, as Prof Peccia would expect us to do outside research or learn new problem-solving methods to do them. I appreciated that the exams were similar to the homework problems (and easier), and that Prof Peccia truly wanted students to learn and succeed. Many things in the reading were not covered in class but did appear on the homeworks, and it would have been helpful to go over them. I would have also liked to hear more about the research of professors in the environmental engineering department, and it would be amazing if a few could come give guest lectures throughout the semester. Despite the large class size, a trip to a treatment facility or place where students could do their own pollutant measurements would also be an enriching experience. ",
            "\u00a0Jordan is a great teacher and focused the class well on important topics. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The course does a good job of covering a lot of material at a pretty good depth for an introductory course, the professor is incredibly invested in the learning and is accommodating and kind, \r\nWeaknesses: Lectures can get a bit tiring because they can get long and some of the details or the math aren't as interesting, but overall the material is useful and great to learn about. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are the course content and the instructor. I thought the content was very interesting and challenging and the instructing helped guide the way while still leaving room for students to ask questions or learn on their own. One weakness of the course is that some concepts are glazed over a little and could be more thoroughly instructed on. ",
            "\u00a0One of the strengths of this course were the problem sets. Even though they were very difficult at times they allowed me to really think about the ways in which environmental engineers approach complex problems. Cant really think of any weaknesses there were always opportunities for me to ask for more help if I needed it. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of the course is the material and Professor Peccia's teaching style, but many students complained of his speed and lack of legibility, which wouldn't usually be important but are important to understanding the material. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Peccia is awesome and is really invested in knowing all his students and creating an excellent environment to help everyone ace the class. The only problem I had at first was that I learnt a lot when I was doing the problem sets but as time went on, the problem sets became easier to do with help from office hours. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Peccia is a solid instructor and his and the TF's office hours were very accessible. \r\n\r\nImprovements: I think that lecture notes or a list of equations for each lecture would be useful; Prof Peccia's handwriting isn't the best, and even if I take pictures of the board for anything I may have missed, it's difficult to decipher. \r\n\r\nI also think that he could have included something in the syllabus about homework conditions, namely about staples, paper frills, etc. since many of us lost large chucks of homework points for them and were caught by surprise since it wasn't mentioned anywhere. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - structured and coherent\r\nWeakness - low levels of engagement, sometimes unclear on assignments, and not in-depth in derivations of calculations (just using formulas) ",

Homeworks can be difficult, and if you don't understand them, tests can also become quite difficult.\r\nIf you have friends in the class too, it'll make it a lot easier\r\n\r\nStrengths:\r\n1. Professor cares about students and is overall very friendly--scheduling times to meet was very easy + he gave plenty of time on exams\r\n2.

            "\u00a0This course can answer questions that anyone has about what environmental engineering is. However, it's not the most exciting science class to take. It's required for the environmental engineering major and can be good for prospective majors, but people that just want a science credit could probably find better choices. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! If you're an EnvEng major or not, the class is a great way to learn more about how an engineering mindset can be applied to issues that affect human health and the environment. It's not too much work, and you learn a lot. The psets are much harder than the midterms and finals, but Prof. Peccia and the TAs are always willing to help both inside and outside of class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The content is very relevant and applicable to real world issues, and the course is a great introduction to the field of environmental engineering. There is lots of help available (Professor Peccia, TFs) if you need it. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, if you want to get a more scientific introduction to environmental concepts and also it's required if you are an environmental engineering major ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think it's very important that people spend time thinking about where things go once it leaves their daily lives. It's meaningful and interesting. Jordan is very effective at getting people to care. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is a great course for both students interested in environmental engineering and students who are studying interdisciplinary science subjects. ",
            "\u00a0yes teacher is amazing ",
            "\u00a0YES! take this class if you are at all interested in environmental engineering! It was amazing and Peccia is the best! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone seeking to understand the two major pollution hazards for humans and the environment: air and water pollution. It certainly gives you a taste of what environmental engineering is like, and if you might like it (or not). The course gives us the tools to calculate many things I've always been curious about (like if someone coughs in an airplane, how much of the bacteria may reach you, or how much algae production may be required to power certain energy needs). It is a great introduction to systems thinking for environmental problem-solving. I wish the course incorporated more design aspects into it, like ways of preventing the pollution from happening rather than trying to measure and treat it afterwards. You may also benefit from reading the textbook on the topics that interest you. Addressing environmental issues can come from practically any direction - and I've learned its not necessarily through environmental engineering. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this class! The content was extremely interesting, the lectures were engaging, and the science itself was very understandable. Everyone should take this class and learn more about the environment and what we can do! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely. The course was really interesting in my opinion, and the professor is great and is also the DUS of environmental engineering so he's a great person to get to know and is just a really funny and good teacher in general. The course itself is not hard at all/ it is incredibly manageable in terms of workload, and you're allowed to bring in a sheet with notes and formulas for the midterm and finals which makes it less stressful and more focused on your ability to work out the problems and concepts instead of just memorizing things. I really enjoyed it and would recommend it even if you aren't in the major because it's really a fun and useful topic and isn't a very demanding or time-intensive course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. It is a very good introductory course that enables students to learn more about what exactly environmental engineering is. It is taught well and covers engaging topics. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants to gain a general but comprehensive understanding of the kind of work that environmental engineers do. Even though I really liked this course it made me realize that I dont want to become and environmental engineer. ",

            "\u00a0Yes! It brought to my attention important environmental considerations. While the material is fairly accessible especially for STEM majors, it is NOT a gut; psets take quite a bit of time especially since we have to write about why/where the problem is relevant, explain our work, and interpret our answer. I personally felt that the concepts were accesible but did need to practice to fully utilize correctly. ",
