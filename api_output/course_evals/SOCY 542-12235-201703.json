            "\u00a0This course provided a broad overview to fundamental sociological and theoretical texts - reading these historical works has helped me to better situate contemporary theories that I am working with more actively. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about historical and contemporary sociological theorists and the essential tools of theory construction. Additionally, I learned how to consume theoretical arguments and de/reconstruct epistemological arguments with my own writing. ",
            "\u00a0Exposure to a breadth of literature that make up the fundamentals of the sociology discipline ",
            "\u00a0The course really added to my understanding of classic theory and provided me with an incredible overview of how theorists have influenced each other over the centuries. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a better understanding of the canon of social theory, and how various theorists interacted with one another's work. I also feel like I improved my ability to discuss theory with others. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: Emily has significant knowledge about the texts we were reading, and I benefitted a lot from hearing her insights. Regarding to the class sessions - I felt that the first half of the course was very constructive; Emily would help us work through the texts and develop our understandings of them. This was a challenging process given the volume of readings we were assigned, but doing so was definitely useful and pushed me to be a more rigorous thinker.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think at some point mid-semester, one or more students requested that the way the class was run be changed. Our time in class shifted from a close reading of the texts to wandering conversations that were often poor, and dominated by one or two students. I don't think that this was Emily's fault so much as our fault as a class for an unwillingness to engage deeply with the texts. Emily's attempts to focus the conversation on the texts were increasingly rebuffed by students in the class as the semester went on. Some students seemed to like the change in the way class was run, but it was not helpful to my learning.\r\n\r\nHow to improve: I think all students need to be on the same page about the purpose of a theory course, and expectations for how to engage in a classroom. ",
            "\u00a0One strength of this course is that it provides an opportunity for students to learn about the historical sociological canon while also providing an opportunity to learn how to consume, critique, and expand on historical intellectual debates. Another strength of the course is that it allows participants to discuss how controversial social issues have been engaged (or deliberately omitted) from intellectual discourse throughout history. ",
            "\u00a0More diversity in theorists studies (women, people of color) ",
            "\u00a0A great class to learn classic sociological theory, application of theory and critical thinking. ",
            "\u00a0All in all, I really enjoyed the course but at times I thought we were putting too many theorists into one session, leaving us with little time to discuss everyone. I understand that it is difficult to teach theory in such a short amount of time, so it might be tricky to change that. However, the strength of course lies in exactly the vast amount of theorists covered. ",
            "\u00a0I felt like the expectations for this course were very vague, and were fleshed out when it became apparent that they were misunderstood (and things were tense in class). For instance, we didn't discuss the required papers in class unless someone asked about them, and it made it difficult to know what was expected of us. Also, I felt that the expectations for how we would go about the discussion was not set appropriately, because there were often times a lot of tension in class about what questions were on topic or off topic, what comments were on topic/off topic, etc... and it made it difficult to want to continue to participate. I also thought that the posted reading questions were not really connected to the course. I'd put a lot of effort into framing my questions, and then they were often not brought up or discussed in class. I think that, overall, my general feedback would be that the facilitation style and structure of this course should be rethought and then very clearly articulated at the beginning of the course and each class as we introduce a new author.\r\n\r\nThe strengths of the class were that Professor Erikson knows a great deal about the theory, and is very knowledgable. She was able to clarify a lot of misunderstandings for me. I really liked the emphasis on Dubois' work.\r\n\r\nI wish more women would've been included in the course, like Charlotte Perkins Gillman or bell hooks. I also don't know why there isn't a second required theory class for graduate students that covers contemporary theory. There really should be! In my opinion, it'd be great for their to be a required philosophy class, where we cover Kant, Hegel, Smith, Rousseau, Hobbes, etc. separately, then classical social theory (Marx, Weber, Durkheim, Dubois), and then contemporary, like De Beauvoir, Parsons, Bourdieu, Latour, Merton, Alexander, etc. Theory is really one of Yale's strengths, and it should invest more into that. We have to take two required statistics classes because the methods are so central to the discipline. Theory is central, too, so we should have more classes. "
