            "\u00a0I developed writing skills in this class. I read scholarly publications and analyzed them to write argumentative and analysis essays throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I developed my writing, analysis, and proofreading skills in this class. My process of creating an argument was honed, as well as my ability to follow an argument in a given reading. ",
            "\u00a0In this course, I learned how to develop my writing to make a coherent, concise, and precise argument using evidence, warrants, and analysis. I learned how to structure my essay around a hypotactic structure and internalized the importance of specificity on an essay, paragraph, and sentence level. Further, I learned how to put texts in conversation with each other to bring about a new argument and a possible motive (or bigger picture \"so what\") that may stem from the argument. ",
            "\u00a0MLA style, hypotactic paragraph structure, how to refine your writing, research skills, and how to improve specificity. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a considerable amount about my strengths and weaknesses concerning writing. Not only was I able to pinpoint these areas and work on them, but I did so within an engaging curriculum of travelers and tourism. ",
            "\u00a0I have developed the fundamentals of writing academic essays and argumentative writing. ",
            "\u00a0More effect methods on analytical writing specifically how to write a clear, concise thesis and put different texts in conversation with one another. ",
            "\u00a0Constructing and presenting arguments effectively, and analyzing multiple pieces of evidences to create my own. "

            "\u00a0The course is structured nicely to have four essays spread throughout the semester. The instructor is very accessible for help and other sources are available on campus like the CTL. ",
            "\u00a0This class did a great job at improving my writing skills. At times, I wish we could've just discussed the section content instead of writing techniques, because the readings were interesting but not always emphasized. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are that we get to develop our writing and our craft in a variety of settings and in doing so, allow ourselves to learn how to write at a higher level in more than one way. We learn how to write an essay that uses how style influences meaning, we learn how to put texts in conversation, we learn how to properly research, and we learn how to combine all of the aspects into a creative piece. The wide variety of genre and the opportunity to experiment with different writing styles is certainly a strength. A weakness of the course is that we do not get the opportunity to \"bounce back\" in a particular area with a follow-up assignment of a similar kind. For example, if a student struggled with the style/meaning essay, or the putting of texts in conversation with each other, instead of having the opportunity to take what we learned and apply it to follow-up revisions of the same essay or the writing of an entirely new essay, we move on to the next unit and type of writing. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting and engaging readings, fun class, not too bad workload, very detailed comments on graded papers. Weaknesses: deadlines caught up fast. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed each course reading, and a major strength of this course is the brilliantly organized curriculum. ",
            "\u00a0This course was great. The units were excellently put together with relevant information from a diverse set of sources. ",
            "\u00a0The course teaches you to use the key components of academic writing quite effectively using many readings and four essays. It is quite hectic and can be unforgiving if you start your paper going in the wrong direction as deadlines are packed together. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student that is interested in travel and the scholarly debates prevalent in the topic's discussion. It was very enlightening and has changed the way I view travel. ",
            "\u00a0Yes if you are looking to improve your academic writing skills. Pam is a great and supportive teacher. The readings are usually pretty interesting and thought-provoking. If you're not interested in getting better at academic writing, this class will probably turn into a burden. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student because it is a fascinating way to learn about tourism and travel, the nuances of both, the intricacies of both, and what the possible (if any) differences are. We have discussions and fantastic debates that offer ideas about all different kinds of travel and tourism from all different kinds of backgrounds. It is a great course to think about your own travel experience, and think about whether or not there is anything you could/should change to have a more impactful, authentic, and ultimately more meaningful travel experience. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely!! Interesting subject and Pam knows the topic well and is keen on challenging your beliefs to improve not only your writing but also your personal logic. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course as a great introduction into college writing. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. Despite its workload, I believe that I managed to improve from taking this course, and essay writing skills are skills which you use throughout the four years at college and even further. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I found the topic and readings very interesting and class discussions were always very stimulating and made me question my preconcieved notions regarding traveling and tourism. "
