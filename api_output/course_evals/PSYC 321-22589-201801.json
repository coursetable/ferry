            "\u00a0It was a pretty good overview of psych-pharm ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how various drugs work in the brain. I also learned some basic neuroscience and about many mental disorders. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the specific biology behind drugs ",
            "\u00a0I gained a lot of knowledge about the different types of drugs and how to better understand the nuances of their efficacy and safety. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about different medications and their effects on the body. A deep dive into a range of medications -- one of the most interdisciplinary courses I've taken during my time at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0This course did  a really great job teaching about the different effects drugs have on the brain. I learned a lot of life-relevant information about recreational and treatment drugs. ",
            "\u00a0This course is an amazing review of psychotropic drugs, ranging from psychedelics to barbiturates, amphetamines, caffeine, marijuana etc. You learn about the mechanisms of action of each drug, its applications in a clinical setting, side effects and so much more. ",
            "\u00a0I learned an enormous amount about both therapeutic and recreational psychopharmacology, despite starting the class with almost no relevant background (besides Human Brain). "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Weakness: Very unclear at times what the professor considered to be important. Yes, he would maybe bold or start two concepts per lecture of \"for sure\" things to be on the exam but with 70+ lecture slides with walls of text on each, it can be hard to discern what is relevant to be tested on and what is not. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: very comprehensive introduction to psychopharmacology.\r\nRoom for improvement: if each lecture were organized in the same order (e.g. pharmacokinetics first, then pharmacodynamics), it might be more conducive to our learning across multiples classes of drugs. ",
            "\u00a0The course was strong in that it provided a very detailed overview of psychopharmacology at just the right amount of detail. However, the exams relied more on brute memorization than any conceptual understanding. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a lot of information that isn't always presented in an organized way, but if you learn what's on the slides, you should be okay. Prof Brown really wants all of his students to do well and you can tell. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: very interesting content\r\n\r\nWeakness: no weaknesses ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that the topic is extremely interesting and generally relevant to daily life--I found myself telling my friends fun facts I learned in this class very often--and the deep knowledge that Professor Brown has on this subject. The weaknesses are that the lectures can sometimes be fairly dry, and the exams are often unexpectedly specific and memorization-heavy. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The thorough and detailed nature of this class was definitely one of its strengths. The course material was also highly organized, which I appreciated. I also really enjoyed the student talks, during which members of the class did background research on certain topics introduced during the course and shared their findings with other students. \r\nWeaknesses: I really can't think of anything. The lecture slides were a healthy balance of textbook-pulled review and supplementary information, and Thomas Brown was always ready with answers to all of our questions. ",
            "\u00a0This course has no weaknesses - Professor Brown is an amazing instructor, very passionate and knowledgeable about psychopharmacology and caring about students. The 4 non-cumulative exams make the course much less stressful and are very fair (they are almost entirely memorization based and all the information needed is in the lecture slides). ",
            "\u00a0This class was amazing, and I wouldn't change much about it. "

        [
            "\u00a0Definitely. You'll learn a lot, it's accessible to people not in the field but interesting and challenging even if you are in the field, and it feels timely and important. ",
            "\u00a0Eh. It is definitely not what you think a cool-sounding course like this would be. It is rather underwhelming because the lectures tend to be bone dry. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. I took it without much background in neuroscience and was able to catch up. It was very interesting and Professor Brown was great. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Brown is delightful and so helpful. Although the breadth of content might seem daunting, he really wants every student to succeed and gives lots of good study advice in the days leading up to the exams. If you put in the time (about a week to 2 weeks before the exam) to thoroughly review all the lecture slides (memorize mechanisms of actions, drug indications etc.), you'll do very well in the class. Bonus aspects include the delicious cookies and the extra credit presentation. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student truly interested in psychopharmacology. If it is a subject that does not interest you, it will be much harder to learn all the material as it can be a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The information in the course is very close to what is covered in the textbook, but it is extremely interesting ",
            "\u00a0Would highly recommend if you're interested in the material! It would have been a lot easier for me if I had taken more neuro classes before this, but it was still totally doable. The exams can test small details but the curve will make sure you're okay if you're prepared. Prof Brown brings in great cookies almost every other lecture. I really enjoyed this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0yes 10/10 would recommend ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student who has a deep interest in the biology and psychology behind all kinds of drugs. Professor Brown's lectures and demeanor can sometimes be a bit dry, but if you are engaged in the subject matter, you will get a lot out of this course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to another student, especially to other psychology/neuroscience majors. A great overview of the more biological side of interactions between the brain and the body. The comprehensive coverage of drugs and their effects might be a particularly useful sampler for students hoping to be involved in clinical psychology. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to anyone remotely interested in psychopharmacology. The information is extremely applicable since most of these drugs are so widely used among college students and it is generally a good idea to know about their kinetic and dynamic action, mechanism of action and interactions with other drugs and substances. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in learning about how psychoactive drugs, both therapeutic and recreational, actually generate the effects that we use them for. You will learn an enormous amount about an incredibly important and interesting topic without putting too much work in. "
