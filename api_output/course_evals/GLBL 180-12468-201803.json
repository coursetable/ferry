            "\u00a0Learned various models of geopolitical conflict, from rationalist explanations of war and bargaining theory to perfect Bayesian solution concepts in signaling games. The class truly is about half-and-half qualitative IR and quantitative modeling. A surprising amount of reading for a game theory class. ",
            "\u00a0This class is excellent. While I am not sure how useful the actual calculations of game theory are in an IR setting, it provides a unique way on conceptually thinking about issues that I greatly enjoyed. ",

            "\u00a0This class is an ambitious combination of two classes in one: a game theory class and an international relations/history course.  You will come out of the class with the tools for pretty intense game theory, an understanding and the tools to address game theory's limitations, and a historical frame that understands or seeks to understand historical choices and assumptions as well as models about diplomacy, war, and nuclear decisions. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about the theory and application of game theory throughout the semester. The problem sets gave me great practice with the mathematics behind the games while the response memos allowed me a forum to apply the theory to real life historical interactions. "

            "\u00a0The class is designed to walk through the mechanics of game theory in a way so that all can understand and apply the material. The lectures could be a little more engaging. ",
            "\u00a0The class is a little disjointed. The lecture (which feels like a seminar) didn't teach much of the Game Theory, which could be fine if we really discussed the International Relations, but often those discussions were cut short for explanations of games that had to be developed or clarified in section anyway. ",
            "\u00a0I wish more of the lecture had been spent on actual Game Theory.  We spent a lot of time working on the applications in lecture, which made it challenging to complete the problem sets. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course has a lot of strengths and that the content is well put together but that sometimes the lectures could be more engaging. ",
            "\u00a0I think that this course could go over more math problems to help us better understand the problems. ",
            "\u00a0It's a really cool way to get a quick intro into several courses. I think normal game theory is kind of boring, and this class gives you an opportunity to learn it and simultaneously get some quick info on war history. The one tricky thing is that the homework was super variable- some nights it was a single chapter from the textbook (12 pages), other nights it was three 50-page theses on history. Granted, you could skim, as it wasn't examined in great detail and only basic ideas were moved forward. Of course, as with all interdisciplinary courses, the danger is that our view into the history was more as an example and less with the goal of really examining it. ",
            "\u00a0The content was often not explained in a great fashion. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course include the gradual progress through solving each type of problem, really interesting readings, and a good introduction into the topic of game theory. The only weakness is the length of the class, many of the discussions in class had to be cut short because class time was over. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are very hard, sometimes its not easy to follow. However, the content is very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0the connection with the international relations part was weaker; the part with game theory methodology was great ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very interesting approach, especially the marriage of game theory and international relations.  Professor Debs is a very good at teaching game theory and is very passionate about this class.  He takes the time in the game theory classes to go through games step by step thoroughly, and he pauses for questions.  You are not robbed of sophisticated game theory by the addition of international relations.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: this is really two classes, and often the 50 minute lectures were not enough to really cover everything.  You can really only get through a single game in the 50 minutes time, which means that you might only see a massive chunk of the syllabus once in class, and section is not sufficient to cover everything.  A 75 minute class would make the material much more manageable. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of this course: application of game theory to IR is theoretically interesting\r\nWeaknesses: all the game theory content was condensed into the first half of the course and was extremely difficult to learn without intense hand-holding by the Teaching Fellows. I learned all the content from the class from my Teaching Fellow, and because I learned nothing from lectures in comparison, stopped attending after the midterm because it did not significantly change my understanding of the material. Lectures went through game theory examples too quickly, resulting in students not learning the content required to do the problem sets without a huge time commitment on behalf of the students and especially the Teaching Fellows. Historical examples weren't as helpful for understanding the game theory applications. What would have been more helpful would be to go through a game theory example (slowly, and explained much more clearly), and then talking about how that game theory model could be applied to a specific historical event. Basically, we should have been walking through the structure of the midterm/final all throughout the class, since that's the most logical way to learn the connection between Game Theory and IR. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course include its application to real world historical events and the classroom engagement. I feel like my understanding of prominent military events is so much stronger due to Professor Debs' in depth explanations of the game theory at play in these interactions. Also, both lecture and section were welcome to discussion which kept the students interested and involved. \r\n\r\nOne weakness of the course was the lecture time. With only 50 minutes each class to cover both theory, mathematics, and real world application, I felt at times that we went through the calculations too quickly in order to get through the material which made problem sets more difficult later on.

            "\u00a0This course is a good and interesting introduction to game theory, because it is not all math. The international applications are quite thought-provoking. ",
            "\u00a0This class was extremely challenging. Professor Debs is great and wants students to do well. However, it frontloads an immense amount of game theory in the first half of the semester before glossing over historical examples that seem to fly by. This class was rewarding, but consumed my semester. ",
            "\u00a0I do recommend. Prof. Debs is at the forefront of his field, and you'll get to engage with his ideas (and those of the dozens of IR scholars we also read) on conflicts from WWI to the Iraq War and nuclear proliferation. Important to understand and fascinating if you're interested in political science. Math is pretty easy, but if you're not a \"QR kid\" you might have to spend some time on it. It's a pretty contagious subject - one of those classes that'll get you to see certain things in the world very differently. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Professor Debs is truly passionate about game theory, and he knows his stuff. It was a joy to be in class, and he teaches the material well. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class. Professor Debs is phenomenal and keeps lectures interesting and enjoyable (something I never imagined I would say about a QR that was at 9:25). ",
            "\u00a0If you want to learn about Game Theory and how it applies to International Relations then yes but if you are looking for a mathematically rigorous approach to game theory you should probably take the econ version of the course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because I found the material very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you have to take game theory, might as well take it in an interesting format. We finished the normal game theory stuff within the first half and it was basically just learning application from there. However, the curve is dangerous, as the students in the class are there because they want to do EPE or they want to take that specific course, so a high grade will be more difficult than in 159. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Take this course if youre willing to put in the work to understand the material. There are moments where you will be confused during lecture but then after a while the material finally clicks. Its a rewarding feeling to understand this challenging topic. I also felt that if I needed any help, the professor and TFs were more than willing to answer any questions. ",
            "\u00a0No. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, a great foundation that is applicable to most social science tracks. ",
            "\u00a0yes ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to another student, but with the understanding that it is essentially two classes in one.  It is not unmanageable, but you do have to show up for everything.  The tests are hard, and besides comprehensive feedback after the midterm you really have no idea how you are doing.  But that being said, Professor Debs is a very good professor.  He is very good at teaching game theory, even (and especially) the more complicated games.  His pairing with international relations will enhance your understanding of both by giving you a tangible framework and grounding for the games and tools for very interesting analyses of international relations. ",
            "\u00a0I would advise someone to look for a game theory class that only focuses on the content, rather than an application to IR. I don't know if I actually learned how game theory is applied to IR because I was so focused on trying to master all of the content (that was taught way too quickly, all in the first half of the course) on my own and with a TF. ",
            "\u00a0For anyone remotely interested in learning about game theory, this is a great course to facilitate such learning. While the problem sets take a good deal of time to understand and accurately complete, the in class engagement with the material makes the coursework worthwhile. Professor Debs is extremely intelligent and his lectures were quite enlightening. "
