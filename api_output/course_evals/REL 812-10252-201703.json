            "\u00a0Ned was an outstanding section instructor. He was encouraging, honest and gave us consistent feedback on our preaching. He clearly was well educated, articulate and compassionate, and was truly invested in helping us all become better preachers. ",
            "\u00a0Insightful, thoughtful, experienced, and critical ",
            "\u00a0He was extremely encouraging to all of us, provided great comments on our preaching and suggested super helpful reference resources.  He kept the class moving well in a super organized manner.  We all enjoyed coming to this section and gained a lot from full frank and respectful participation. ",
            "\u00a0He gave his insight on preaching and his life's experiences ",
            "\u00a0Maria guided a superb section experience. Her prayerful spirit filled Nouwen Chapel throughout each of our meetings. Cannot speak for others, but the support she represented motivated me to do my best in everything I was called to do in section. She was generous in her compliments, cautious but firm in her suggestions. I felt that she took my presence and offerings very seriously and encouraged me onward. ",
            "\u00a0Dean George has enormous breadth and depth of knowledge.  She also was a remarkably careful and kind instructor - she treated everyone with respect and care, and she made sure less voluble classmates' voices were heard.  She was gentle but still direct with her feedback - which struck me as precisely on point each time, very valuable.\r\n\r\nDean George's written comments on our work were very helpful also.\r\n\r\nI would have preferred to hear even more from Dean George throughout the class.  In our last class, she offered advice and observations on a number of topics, and I found myself wishing she had been more vocal earlier in the course.  I appreciate Dean George's effort to step back and let the students talk in the class - but I think the sections would have been even better if she had spoken more in all the section meetings. ",
            "\u00a0Wonderful helpful responses to preaching assignments, very caring and open demeanor, great background and experience ",
            "\u00a0Very well organised and helpful ",
            "\u00a0(I thought I'd already submitted an evaluation, so this may be redundant.)\r\nStrengths: Thorough, thoughtful, and insightful feedback on section sermons and assignments. Clear instruction on assignments. Encouraging and supportive of everyone's efforts. Sensitive to individual needs and locations. The coaching sessions and video-taped sermons were extremely helpful in getting a better sense of how I present myself. \r\nWeaknesses: None. ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Parker was polite, sensitive to the denominational diversity of the section, and encouraging in his feedback. He brought pastoral experience to his role, and was overall a nice and warm guy. I enjoyed having him as a teaching assistant for this course. ",
            "\u00a0Maria made section home, fair and attentive, she was always fully present with us. She held our cares and concerns and made it possible to be vulnerable in the preaching moment. I cannot recall any weaknesses in her managing of the section ",
            "\u00a0well organized, though in the first few weeks, was not always aware of course expectations (& therefore the things she would be responsible for as section facilitator). encouraging, warm, offers clear & constructive critical feedback in a supportive way; fostered helpful group conversations. I especially appreciated her willingness to follow the interests of the group, & her ability to be an open listener. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent instructor, encouraging, capable, friendly. Julie certainly made the class more interesting and \"user-friendly'. ",
            "\u00a0As noted above:  Prof Carolyn Sharp:\r\n\r\nOutstanding lecturing and section leader. Organized and timely.  Very sensitive and experienced in addressing the various spiritual and cultural backgrounds of her section students.  Her attention to detail and thoughtful feedback to each of us when applicable was greatly appreciated in particular her professional way of practicing a \"trauma-informed\" teaching approach.  What is meant, is that anyone in her classes with the potential of having unresolved past traumas or in the process of healing such traumas could find a safe harbor in her class space during exposition of difficult topics related to preaching content. ",
            "\u00a0Her feedback was great. She is one of the professional preachers in YDS, and I learned and improved a lot in terms of preaching as well as public speech. She was so approachable and friendly. I'd like to ask her help when I have a chance to deliver a public sermon. ",
            "\u00a0This was her first time leading a section for this course and I wasn't confident she was always up to speed with the focus of each assignment. She had a lot on her plate, and sometimes the discussion just felt rushed, or too focused on less relevant logistics. I would have preferred more hands on practical guidance. It was a good group and well led, but just not my favorite class. I'm not wild about preaching and this course didn't do much to encourage my enthusiasm. I felt like very often I just put the wrong foot forward. Not a strength of mine, and I was often not on the same wavelength with our section leader. ",
            "\u00a0See my observations of Prof Sharp above - I thought she was a wonderful section leader and I learned a lot from her about word choice, tone and consideration of the congregation. ",
            "\u00a0Dean George was amazing. The section was by far the most useful aspect of the course, and Dean George's leadership and comments on our preaching were so helpful. This is where I experienced the most growth in my preaching skills. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Very understanding and cultivated a space where I could openly share and experiment.\r\nWeakness: I wish I received more opportunities to receive her feedback. ",
            "\u00a0Dean George was a fantastic section leader. She gave clear and helpful feedback and created an environment where we were supported but also challenged. I learned a lot about my preaching style, my strengths, and my weaknesses. The section was very close knit and we had some very vulnerable moments. Dean George is incredibly knowledgeable and was very helpful, answering questions and mediating when the group had confusion about assignments. I didn't really like the class itself, but I LOVED section. ",
            "\u00a0See above. To add, Professor Sharp created a tight-knit community among our preaching section, a space where students felt confident that we were supported and could take risks and learn with, from, and through one another. ",
            "\u00a0Maria was very loving and approachable. "
