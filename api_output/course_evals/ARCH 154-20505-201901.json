            "\u00a0I learned how to loosen up and just enjoy drawing as a meditative activity. I learned how to analyze drawings and think about what works and what doesnt critically. My drawing skills also improved significantly in this course. The focus was more on drawing in general than on architecture but I also learned about architectural conventions like plan and section etc. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to really appreciate drawing and appreciate my own work.  I had not drawn prior to taking this class but I feel like the TFs were very helpful in dealing with our individual concerns to help improve our drawing. This was a great way to get to appreciate spots on Yale's campus and their architecture. ",
            "\u00a0I gained so much more practice drawing, and especially focused around architecture. I am glad I took this class because I learned to think about architecture in the ways I had difficulty with before. It is still difficult for me to conceptualize certain things, but I gained more exposure with this class. ",
            "\u00a0I developed new ways to think about and represent the built environment, and learned to approach drawing without hesitation. I became more comfortable drawing in a variety of mediums and truly developed a love for drawing. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to draw better. Period. I learned how to think of space and buildings more conceptually. I learned to love drawing. I learned how to do different types of architectural drawings, plan, section, axiomatic, blind contour, and perceptual. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely loved this course. Before taking it, I have never drawn in my life so I was very apprehensive and anxious.  However, throughout the course I not only developed my drawing skills but I developed as a person and I will never see the world the same. "

            "\u00a0Victor Agran and the tfs were extremely supportive and knowledgeable. The environment of the class was v positive and focused on growth. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were that we were able to draw in situ, which is something I rarely get to do.  A big strength is that it was such a welcoming class, and I always drew inspiration from my peers. ",
            "\u00a0Drawing reviews/pin up discussion were very supportive environments and were a way to celebrate everyone's growth throughout the semester. I think it would have been helpful to also receive some constructive feedback/ways to improve so that we could push our drawing skills for the next assignment. Overall though, I think the class was a great way to learn more about drawing/space and to become more comfortable with drawing. ",
            "\u00a0It is hard sometimes to draw with a partner but honestly it isnt as bad as I was worried it would be. You definitely draw a lot, but Victor and the TAs do a great job at keeping it interesting, so it never feels tedious. The strengths are getting to draw in an amazing, supportive, collaborative, and fun environment with great feedback. Also Yale has amazing Buildings and spaces so you can draw some awesome things. Its definitely challenging and some Of the spaces are hard to conceptualize, but you learn a lot in the process. Also it is open to people of all abilities which is amazing. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely. This was my best class this term, it is extremely well taught and pushes you to improve without adding significantly to your workload after class. ",
            "\u00a0yes. If you're interested in architecture and want to improve your drawing definitely take this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It really is a class for all, and if anyone makes you feel otherwise, that's on them. ",
            "\u00a0YES!!! If you are at all interested in architecture, art, drawing, or just learning to see the world in a new way, definitely take this class. Was one of the best decisions have I made thus far at Yale! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone interested in drawing or architects of all artistic abilities. Victor is amazing and supportive. You learn a lot. And you will get much better at drawing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it opens your mind to concepts of space and design. ",
