Pretty cool lineup of topics in PHYS 170, definitely worth a look. ",
            "\u00a0This class was nonsense. Just a bunch of obscure math tricks. I spent way too much time agonizing over problem sets only to realize that the point was not to actually learn physics but to oversimplify everything to the point that it no longer made sense. ",

The first two weeks, I went to bed so stressed every night because I was convinced that I couldn't keep up with the workload and, as a senior, I can definitely say that it was the most work-intensive class that I've ever taken. However, this class taught me how to make connections between things I didn't even realize were connected, work well with people, and adapt to stress more than I could imagine. Honestly, the effort you put in yields good results, and I feel like a much better and prepared student after taking 170. Also, I realized how much I actually liked physics.

A major emphasis was on the interconnectedness of physics, chemistry, and biology in the sense that laws of physics could be applied to chemical reactions and physiological processes. By the end, I was able to see the similarities between concepts like diffusion, fluid mechanics and even rates of change because the derivations of equations used similar processes. I also learned the skill of reviewing my mistakes and actually thinking critically about them because of the test corrections we were required to do. ",

The highlight of the semester.\r\nSo yeah. fluid flow, steady-state diffusion in 1D and spherical. I learned basically everything for the first time, except probability things, because I'd never taken physics. I now can look at something and think up models for why it works like that, which is the best skill I took away. ",

There are updates canvas (daily) which means you will never miss a deadline and always know what you can be working on. \r\n\r\n\r\nA weakness is that the course is very fast paced.

I think the sense of collaboration comes from the fact that there isn't a curve which makes this course so much better! Additionally, the content is actually kind of cool when you come to understand it. I really think you guys did a good job. I like that the problem set questions are application based, but not tested as much so that we get to appreciate cool theoretical models but then not be ambushed with them on the test. ",

Simon knew my name in a 100 person lecture, and was at almost every study hall. I can't imagine this course without him, nor can I imagine the level of student dedication without him. I was blown away by how much he cared about students. I could literally go on and on. The material was well organized and segued into each segment nicely. I'm not even sure what a weakness would be, other than that maybe the introduction to module 1 was a little overwhelming, but I think that was more a factor of my lack of experience with math/physics than anything the instructors can can control. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n\r\nSimon Mochrie is great and cares a lot about the students and the class. TAs were similarly wonderful and helpful. Study halls are amazing - go to every single one of them until you finish your pset, because I found that I learned the most from working through the problems with my peers. The one time I decided to skip on that, I felt like it hurt me a lot on the following exam. So go to study hall. The class isn't difficult if you reach out to people to help.\r\n\r\nModules are well-written and good supplementary material.\r\n\r\nDon't stress too much about quizzes because he gives a lot of opportunity to make up for missed grades.\r\n\r\nExams are fair; make sure to do practice exams and psets thoroughly.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nAt times it felt more like math than physics (ex: eigenvectors). Sometimes the pset answers seemed like they were coming out of nowhere, especially conceptual questions. I also felt like sometimes lectures were confusing, especially derivations. Also ln = log was weird to get used to. ",
            "\u00a0Super collaborative! I am the biggest introvert alive and I was forced to make friends to finish my psets. No complaints on that though, because I met a bunch of great people through this class that I would have never otherwise interacted with. Weakness is the phrasing of questions. You kind of have to get used to Simon's wording. ",
            "\u00a0One strength is that there are many support resources and study halls where I could get help. ",
            "\u00a0Though many people have complained about the way that intro physics are taught in general, it is clear to me from this past semester that no radical changes have been done to improve it. The only thing that really works in favor of the students is the grading system/scale which is very helpful, but the actual method for teaching is poor at best. There were many times when I felt like the TAs were unhelpful. The peer tutors were much better as were my fellow classmates. The worst part was that the psets and tests were not indicative of what had been taught in class. I understand that physics is a difficult and very technical subject, so it is hard to try to come up with a good way of getting students who may not be interested or may not be good at this subject, to really understand the processes and the material. I think that the way we are in taught in lecture does not prepare for the level of difficulty presented in the psets and tests. Though the things we learn in class are difficult, the processes re relatively logical and if the psets and tests followed this same template, they would both be more helpful and more doable. But as the class is now, the psets are ridiculously difficult and require a lot of steps that do not further your knowledge of the topic at hand, but just take a lot of time, i.e. intensive algebra and simplification for some problems. Another thing that I noted was that the tests would present new situations and a different way of thinking that had never been introduced in class. I, for one, do not have an intuitive grasp of physics and unless I have been shown how to solve a certain type of problem or been shown the process, I won't just be able to produce the reasoning out of thin air during a final or midterm. I understand that we do not have enough time in lecture to cover every single topic and every single type of problem that one may encounter that would go along with the topic, but I do not feel like the psets or quizzes helped to introduce me to a problem even like this to make me feel prepared for the tests. ",
            "\u00a0Study hall is life changing and absolutely necessary. I cannot thank our teaching staff (especially Simon!!) enough for the amount of time they put into helping us learn physics. The Monday quizzes are a good way to keep on top of the material. Lectures were sometimes a little dry and disorienting especially when the slides didn't match what we were doing (so that when I went back to look at the lecture slides they weren't very helpful). That being said, the modules are extremely helpful and well written. ",
            "\u00a0One strength of the course was the overall transparency. The expectations were laid out clearly such that students were pretty much always notified about their progress in the course and what they needed to accomplish to ultimately obtain the grade they desired. The grading was also fair, which was much appreciated. A strength and weakness of the course was the study halls. Although learning from one's peers was proven to be very beneficial in this course, study halls tended to be understaffed. Thus, it was often difficult to obtain the help you needed in a timely manner, given that three professors/TAs can only help so many students at once. For this reason, it would be great if more TAs and peer tutors could be present during the study halls. In addition, the problem sets were a weakness because completing them on a weekly basis was a very, very long, arduous process, and the questions were often phrased very strangely. Although Physics is notorious for having students do long problem sets, it would be great if the problem sets could be slightly shorter in order to enhance students' learning of the material. Doing about 10 problems each with 5-7 sub-sections causes a great amount of weekly anxiety that could be improved by having students do less problems. ",
            "\u00a0This course is great in its encouragement of collaborative thinking and exploration of observable phenomena through physical law. I really enjoyed connecting with my classmates and learning together. I think the level of application of concepts sometimes unfairly exceed what was presented in lecture, and sometimes the TAs were even unsure of how to deal with certain concepts without consulting he answer key repeatedly. However, while psets were often a bit of a nightmare, they also sometimes posed fun challenges to complete. I also really enjoyed the active learning through clicker questions, and think that could be further integrated into the course in the future. ",
            "\u00a0I liked how bio-focused this course was since I'm really not a physics/math person but I really didn't think the lecturing style was the clearest. The psets were often unreasonably hard and seemed more intent on testing our math skills and endurance than they were physics concepts. They were basically impossible to do without lots of help. The midterms were reasonable but then the final was much more difficult, which I found inconsistent. In addition, the course seems quite disorganized--students often had to remind instructors to upload materials/fix typos which I don't think is their responsibility. They said they were very open to feedback but I don't think much work/thought has been put into improving this course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- great way to work with other people, concepts build on one another and can be understood \r\nWeaknesses- concepts could be presented in a more clear format ",
            "\u00a0This course was interesting and very well taught, but it seemed to be more like a mathematical modeling course, rather than a straight physics course. A lot of the concepts were similar or the same as concepts from Math 116 taught by John Hall. I spent probably 10 hours on the psets every week, and spent a lot of my energy on this course. The final exam was still difficult though. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths \r\n- Designed to be collaborative and not competitive. \r\n- Module notes are beautiful and self-explanatory. \r\n- Simon really cares about the student experience\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n- Way too much investment of time and energy required when placed in the context of four or five additional courses that students are concurrently taking, especially considering it is an introductory course. \r\n- Simon could have been better prepared for lectures to go more smoothly. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very challenging, intellectually stimulating. Simon was a great professor, very supportive. You can tell lots of thought and effort were put into the slides and presentations. I really liked the themes of the class. Very great collaborative environment. I've never met a teacher who cared so much about his students doing well like Simon does- the effort he puts into the class, from the notes to answering Piazza to staying till 10pm on study hall nights is remarkable and I found his support system to be the reason why I marginally was able to survive in the class.  \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Simon often went by very fast, so it made keeping up a very difficult task. Sometimes the themes seemed very niche, but that was ok. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: topics spread across modules. It's really cool to apply random walks and diffusion and probability in so many ways.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: To me, it's kind of silly that for some pset answers, the only way to get the answer is from a TA/ULA in study hall. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are of course, the TA's, peer tutors, and course instructors who are all very happy to help you if you encounter problems with psets or exams throughout the semester. Most of the learning came from doing said psets and practice problems, not so much lecture. As a result, I feel that attending lecture didn't so much add to my knowledge as much as just reading the modules did. ",
            "\u00a0The study halls were very useful. However, the quality of the teaching fellows was definitely a downside to the effectiveness of study halls and review sessions. They were unprepared for the study halls, and would sometimes give us the wrong answers because they didn't understand what the problem was asking. ",
            "\u00a0It is VERY hard to grasp physics concepts that can be applied to several scenroios when so many concepts we learned in class were tied to specific examples. It was also hard because much of the course hinges upon student interactions and some people (like myself) are not comfortable with working in groups or working with new people. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this class above all is its commitment to helping students learn. I am honestly incredibly impressed by the level this took; the class is uncurved which is initially intimidating but negates competition, plenty of opportunity is given to learn from past mistakes (we were able to recover 50% of points lost by submitting thoughtful revisions evaluating our errors), and there is ample opportunity to interact with classmates, TAs, peer tutors, and even Simon. The set hours for study hall were so incredibly useful, especially with a group of people--the psets are moderately lengthy and often hard, but most weeks it was possible to finish them during study hall hours (cumulatively 7h per week max). The two midterms were quite fair, although the final was unexpectedly difficult. The only weakness is that once in a while, Simon would lose the class in confusion halfway through lecture, but this wasn't especially common. In general, it was very well organized to facilitate learning throughout the entire semester. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated how much Simon cared about our learning. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were its lecturer and the design of the course. Simon was a fantastic professor, who brought energy, humor, and knowledge to the classroom. The class was designed to foster collaborative learning through group work, study halls and even peer tutor sessions. In order to succeed in this class, I had to work harder than any other class, but what made it easier was knowing that my peers were in the same boat. We worked together to solve problems and learn from one another, which created a positive environment. ",
            "\u00a0Lecture was difficult to follow, especially with math involved. Learning happened outside of the classroom through reading the modules, which were usually comprehensive and great. Problem sets are another beast, however. I think it's great to challenge us and have us be engaged with the material, because often times it makes physics fun, or at least rewarding. However, I think everyone would benefit from shorter problem sets. Perhaps more relevant problems and fewer ones that require TA help would make them so much more tolerable. Otherwise, the course is well organized and the time Simon and the TAs put in is admirable. ",

The coursework was also extremely interesting.  A weakness is that the workload was a little disproportionately high, but I had expected that going into the class. ",
            "\u00a0The attitude of the professors, the high attendance by both teaching staff and students at the study hall, and the problem set/midterm organization made the course very successful. I felt that the professors really cared about the students succeeding and really wanted to help us understand how to get the problem right and were thus willing to sit and work with us to make sure that we understood. I felt that the lectures were the part that needed to be improved the most. Many times he would skip steps or go very quickly through hard parts of the problem. Because the lecture would go over the same problems as the notes, I felt that they were sometimes not very helpful and it would be better  if the professor went slowly through the key concepts that were necessary to solve the problem. The p-sets and midterms and quizzes made sure that you were keeping up with the material and did not fall behind. ",

The type of problems we learn to solve are relevant to the MCAT. The course is a lot of work, but any physics course is. PHYS 170 has these study halls 3x a week which are optional but outrageously helpful. It facilitates collaboration with your peers and allows you to ask all questions you may have in a casual setting. The TAs, peer tutors, and professor Simon are all great. Overall, if you are premed and want to take physics, I would highly recommend this class. ",

If you are in between this and 180, I would suggest shopping both. Both are going to be difficult, so it shouldn't be a matter of which is easier but rather which seems more interesting/better suits your specific learning needs. For instance, if weekly quizzes help you obtain a better grasp on the material and the interwoven nature of Biology and Physics seems appealing to you, 170 may be a better fit. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student choosing between 170 and 180 if they found themselves principally drawn to exploring biologicala rn chemical concepts and not pure physics. The class had a lot of sections that were based on statistics and algebra, rather than the heavy calculus focus of many pure physics courses, and I personally enjoyed that. ",

As a bio/pre-med focused person, I definitely enjoyed this more than I would have 180, but I don't think it's a very good course. The psets are unreasonably hard (and filled with arbitrary concepts and math that seem unrelated to what we do in class), the modules/lectures hard to follow and disorganized, and the tests are inconsistent in their difficulty level. It doesn't seem like much work was put into this course, to be honest--most of the TAs (not all of them though) were unapproachable and instructors often had to be reminded to upload assignments and other files. All this in combination made for a really frustrating experience, and it was also grating to be shown weird inspirational videos at the beginning of the semester and told that all our problems with the course were because we didn't have a \"growth mindset\" or whatever when every classmate I knew worked really hard and were still frustrated by the way the course was set up. ",

Grades were communicated clearly throughout the semester. The course was very well-organized. Professor Mochrie really wants everyone to do well. While the course can be challenging at times, there are ample resources to seek out help and overcome almost any challenge. ",

You're going to definitely be working on psets for 12-15 hours each week no matter which class you take. I think the information in this class is more enjoyable to learn than just traditional physics. Also, Simon is one of the most caring and dedicated professors I have ever had at Yale, and he will definitely help you if you reach out. ",
            "\u00a0If you're reading this evaluation, I assume that your are required to take physics. If you're pre-med or have a particular interest in the biological sciences, I would recommend you take this course over PHYS 180! I actually was dreading taking PHYS 170 as a senior and thought it would be the most awful experience. It was  a pleasant surprise when it became one of my favorite classes! If you just allow yourself to be amazed by how Simon elegantly demonstrates the relevance of physics to physiological processes or even epidemiology, you will actually begin to think physics is cool! Woah! \r\n\r\nSeriously, though, don't be scared of this course! You just have to invest a lot of time and energy into learning in PHYS 170. Outside of class hours, you will likely spend 7-8 hours on physics. Here is a sample weekly schedule that may help physics seem less overwhelming:\r\n\r\nSaturday (2 hours) - Review the most recent module and make a one-page summary guide. Take a quick glance at next week's pset problems. \r\nSunday (0.5 hours) - Review the material that Simon says will be on the quiz in particular. \r\nMonday (1 hour) - Weekly quiz in class; Take a stab at 1 or 2 pset problems out of like 9 \r\nTuesday (3 hours) - Go to the study hall and try to at least attempt every single pset problem. The peer tutors and TFs are clutch in helping you through roadblocks. \r\nWednesday - Take a break!\r\nThursday (1 or 2 hours) - Go to the study hall and polish up your pset!\r\nFriday - The pset is due. \r\n\r\nTo prep for the midterms and final exam, be sure to really go through the practice problems he gives you well in advance and then go to a peer tutor's office hours to work through any problems you're still struggling with. Sometimes the same exact question on a pset or practice exam shows up on the real exam! ",

It's expected that you spend 10+ hours on the class on the weekly problem sets, and the material was often very hard and the abstractions difficult to understand. But after pushing through it for a bit, you figure out what to do and it becomes manageable, albeit still difficult. Most challenging class I've taken at Yale, but definitely the one that has pushed me the most to excel. ",

In 170, you learn plenty of the basics of physics without having to deal with the weird \"clique\"-yness of 180 (premed students suffer together and stick together in 170). Some of the material was difficult (but you get 50% of points back with corrections on midterms) and some of it was actually interesting. If you don't particularly like physics and are hoping to do well, this class is a good balance of individual and group learning/cooperation that you will likely do well in and learn something in the process.

This class has a host of people (peer tutors, TA's, and even the course instructors) who are all there to help you if you encounter problems. That said, 170 really kind of just teaches you problem solving more than giving you a strong knowledge in physics. ",

Simon and the TAs and peer tutors definitely care about teaching the concepts well and making sure students understand them, so while my time commitment to this class was quite high (the highest of all my classes this semester), the work put in was reasonable and relatively painless (subjective to a physics class I guess). I do recommend this class. ",

Both classes are difficult, so if you know it's going to be hard, at least choose the one that would be more interesting to you!
