            "\u00a0The discussions that we had in this class were some of the most interesting discussion that I have ever had! Talking about consciousness, humanity, and lived experience through the lens of fiction was incredibly enjoyable and also deeply thought provoking. I learned a lot about novels and their interactions with such philosophical issues. I also greatly improved my analytical skills and now feel much more comfortable contributing to class conversations. ",
            "\u00a0Through this course, I vastly improved my writing skills and my ability to analyze literature. As a result of the novels we read and class discussions guided by Professor Kramnick, I now see the world in a different way and am considering becoming an English major. ",
            "\u00a0In this class, we primarily looked at the style of literature and the motifs that demonstrate the human consciousness. I have a better grasp of different points of view and modes of narration. We also read a lot of contemporary novels, unlike most of my high school classes, which focused on classics. I also learned how to structure a literary analysis paper. ",
            "\u00a0I gained an understanding of how literature has attempted to explore and address questions of consciousness. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the relationships between literature and consciousness, along with various aspects of psychology/neuroscience. ",
            "\u00a0I certainly developed better time management skills with the amount of reading required. I also broadened my literary analytical skills in dissecting aspects of novels I previously had never looked into. ",
            "\u00a0In this course, I not only became a stronger writer and more critical thinker about literature, but also gained insights into human nature and the meaning of life. I learned about the different ways that authors portray \"what it's like\" to be a human-- to use stream of consciousness or free indirect discourse to communicate an individual's external and internal experience. We also discussed the ethics of creating artificial consciousness and what makes us human. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt how to structure and analyse literary essays. I also learnt about the different ways in which consciousness functions and how it is integral to our identity. ",
            "\u00a0I used to only read fictional novels for the plot/characters, but I developed the skill of applying entire books to psychological concepts, which was really interesting. ",

            "\u00a0The best parts of this class were the discussions and the reading. Because basically all of the class was discussion and reading it was an overall awesome class. The reading is pretty fast paced (usually a novel a week), but all of the books are fun to read and very interesting. I would say that perhaps one weakness of this course is that it will probably not help improve your writing that much. The essays are not discussed or workshopped at all in class and are done entirely independently outside of class time. This wasn't a big issue as Professor Kramnick was always available to meet and discuss, but if you are looking for a really in depth writing course, this probably isn't it. ",
            "\u00a0Some of the books (mostly Autonomous), while having interesting subject matter, plot/idea wise, were less enjoyable to read because they felt less like works of art than many of the other books. ",
            "\u00a0It was an amazing seminar. There was a lot of reading, weekly paragraph discussion responses, but only three papers. Reading was very independent and fast paced, but it is a college class. We read 10 novels, and the last 7 weeks were a novel per week. ",
            "\u00a0I loved that we read a book a week, allowing us to shift between interesting avenues of discussion and constantly re-evaluate our understanding of consciousness. Professor Kramnick was very familiar with these novels and guided our thinking so that we had insightful discussions in class each week. I also appreciated the chance to reflect on interesting ideas using the Canvas discussion forum. If I were to modify this course, perhaps I would incorporate the side readings more into the discussion. We talked about these readings less and less as the course progressed, which was a bit of a shame. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- With about one book a week, we definitely covered how consciousness is depicted in many different kinds of novels, with various perspectives, points of view, and styles of narration. We read books ranging from Jane Austen all the way to contemporary science fiction. \r\nWeaknesses- With such a fast reading schedule, we didn't get to go in depth much into any of the books. ",
            "\u00a0Personally, it was fairly difficult to do a close reading when the reading assignments were so large. Therefore, it may be nice to cut down on a few of the books. ",
            "\u00a0This is an incredibly strong course in that the reading material is diverse and fascinating, and there is just the right amount of writing-- a weekly reading response and three very open-ended papers-- and Professor Kramnick is fantastic. He cultivates a close-knit community that makes this seminar truly special, offering insights about the novels, but leaving most of class time for the students to discuss. The only weakness I can find is that sometimes the supplementary readings-- about the brain, AI, or psychology-- are kind of lengthy and dense, not in isolation, but when paired with reading the novel of the week. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - the novels we read were great! The workload was manageable and the discussions were insightful. \r\nWeaknesses - the class could be structured differently. It could perhaps other medium such as videos instead of the complicated psychological readings we were assigned outside of the novels. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: the safe community aspect of discussion, and viewing fiction as craft. \r\nWeakness: I wish we had more time to talk about each book, so we could go more in depth. ",

            "\u00a0I would whole-heartedly and totally enthusiastically recommend this seminar to everyone!!! It was actually so amazing and definitely one of the best classes that I have ever taken. The books are amazing, the discussions are fascinating, and Professor Kramnick will sometimes bring in his dog! The reading in this class, while fast-paced, was so so fun. The books are novels and so they're easy to read and usually pretty exciting. I always looked forward to talking about them in class because our discussions were always so philosophical and really made me think about my own consciousness in a way that I hadn't before. There are only three essays in this class and they can also be sort of fun to write because the topics are so open ended and interesting. This class was so so so amazing and everyone should take it if they can! ",
            "\u00a0This class was one of my favorite classes of my first year at Yale, and I would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone. ",
            "\u00a0YES!!! This class is amazing. Take it! You will learn so many cool insights about literature and also its relation  to consciousness. ",
            "\u00a0Be prepared to read one book a week; heavy workload but rewarding ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course! It gave me different frameworks with which to view consciousness, and I think that literature in particular has valuable things to say about the nature of our minds. I loved reading most of these books and left every discussion feeling like I had spent my time well. Consciousness is a fascinating topic and I believe everyone in our class had a unique and valuable take on it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course, if a student is looking for an interesting seminar with a fast paced schedule and a great range of books. Sometimes it is hard to know exactly what to do on an essay to get a good grade, but there are more important things, like that you get to learn many interesting concepts/ ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I certainly learned a ton and developed some great skills over the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Yes-- take this course if you love to read, a lot, and want to delve into discussion about TEN fascinating novels this semester! There is a huge amount of reading, but since it's novels, it goes quickly. If you wish you had more time to read for fun but always feel too busy, like I do, you'll find yourself looking forward to preparing for this class because it's a chance to really get into some great novels and discuss them with a remarkable professor. If you're interested in human nature, the meaning of life, the minds of non-human beings, the ethics of AI, what it means to be a human, and what consciousness is, you've come to the right place. Be prepared to do a lot of reading, a good amount of writing, and participate in complex, potentially mind-blowing discussions twice a week. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! You would never otherwise read so many novels during the school year, and such great ones too. There is also so much you learn from the novels about yourself and your own identity. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's an extremely interesting writing elective. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! "
