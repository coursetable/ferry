            "\u00a0Before I took this course, I had limited experience with analyzing songs and performance. I am now able to treat both as rich academic texts. I also developed the insight of seeing popular music as often insurgent in some way, and gained a much greater respect for genres of music that I previously didn't know much about. ",
            "\u00a0This course afforded me the opportunity to read books and journals by Black feminist and intellectual scholars, which I was not previously able to do. Also, I was able to better understand how both music and literature influenced Black liberation movements. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me a lot about time management. There are many informative and useful readings from different time periods from this course, and if you divide your time wisely you can truly learn a lot. I also improved my writing skills due to the short papers we had to write and to think more creatively. ",
            "\u00a0This class taught me how to more closely analyze musical works and helped provide me with strategies and lenses to examine Black aesthetical forms. This class also taught me an unbelievable amount about the way that music serves as a form to combat and cope w systemic antiblacknwss, and also taught me new concepts and insights about race and the way that racism functions and has evolved in America. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a significant amount about African American history and literature, along wit myriad forms and techniques of protest. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the complex racial history of America through a music lens. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the history behind the music that I love. This class has inspired me to pursue new artistic and academic questions that incorporate the history of protest music into the music that I listen to and write. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed exploring all types of music and learning about history I had not heard of before. However, sometimes we went over topics too quickly and didn't explore them in depth. We never mentioned many of the readings we did in class. Also I felt like this class had too much lecturing from Professor Brooks and not enough discussion. Overall, though, I highly recommend this course as it is super engaging and fascinating. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Brooks does a wonderful job of keeping class discussion fresh and interesting, and is obviously very passionate about the material. She seemed genuinely interested in listening to our class's insights, and did a great job of facilitating discussion between two students if their ideas were built upon each other. \r\nOften times, there was too much content in one week though. The amount of material in this class is enough for at least two semesters. Sometimes our class discussions felt rushed because we had so much material to get through. I think the class would have been even better if we had more time to delve into a few of the readings/concepts that Professor Brooks presented. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Great course material (readings). The various research field trips throughout the course were eye-opening and extremely engaging. Lastly, pairing music with literature adds new depth to both media.\r\n\r\nWeakness: The course was not as discussion-based as I had initially expected. Most of the classes was a mixture of reading from texts, Professor Brooks asking questions, and the students responding to those questions. There was not much collaboration between the students until the last few projects. Lastly, the \"Oral Presentation\" and \"Final Project\" were difficult to complete because we had a very short time-window and many of the students left for Winter Break before it was finished. ",
            "\u00a0The seminar sessions' discussions got to be a little \"extra\" at times. Everyone seemed to be trying to one-up each other for the teacher's approval and that was very dissuading for those of us that wanted to have a normal conversation. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is that we covered topics from a wide range of time periods so we were able to examine the main focus of the course from different perspectives. The weakness of this course is that sometimes it was too fast paced and it was hard to keep up with the work. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strengths of the class were the texts that were assigned (they were incredible) and the level of depth we went into material in class. One weakness is that many of the texts we read were not discussed. ",
            "\u00a0The different forms of teaching within the class, from readings to lectures to class discussions, were incredibly engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Brooks needs to allow for a more fluid class dialogue that isn't filtered through her every single time someone speaks. I also think she needs to tone down how animated she gets so students aren't focused on getting a reaction out of her, and rather offer more organic contributions. ",
            "\u00a0While the subject matter is incredibly interesting sometimes there is so much reading that it can become hard to delve deeper into one particular topic. ",
            "\u00a0This course covered a tremendous amount of ground and it's strength was definitely that nearly all types of musical protest were covered and presented in context. This being said, there was far too much material to really discuss with meaning in class. Perhaps this could be fixed by narrowing the scope of the course or limiting enrollment. ",
            "\u00a0Although the class was fun and intellectually stimulating, the workload was burdensome and almost undoable. The course would be a lot better if we focused on certain works and only referenced other works without having to read them thoroughly. There was way too much to read at once. "

        [
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, even if they aren't interested in Theater Studies, African American Studies, or American Studies. It truly changed the way I think about and enjoy popular music. Applying often dense, complex readings to our playlist of the week was incredible. I loved finding connections between our readings and the music we happened to be exploring. Additionally, take the class for Professor Brooks. She is an encouraging, kind, enthusiastic, and absolutely brilliant professor. As cheesy as it sounds, I was constantly inspired by her. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course; however, it is important to prioritize assignments because sometimes the workload could be overwhelming. ",
            "\u00a0No. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if the student is actually interested in learning about protest music and is willing to really engage with the course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This is an incredible class that teaches you so much about the role of music in Black freedom struggles. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would. It was incredibly engaging and informative. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone interesting in AFAM, MUS, ER&M, or just wants to understand American race relations through music. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this corse to another student. Many of my friends are musicians and I think that their outlook on music would be broadened by taking this course. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this to other students because if they enjoy studying music, then they will love getting into the roots of what caused the music they enjoy today! ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course! This is the best courseI have ever taken. The material was very interesting, the discussions stimulating, the instructor was passionate, and I was thoroughly engaged through the entire semester. I learned so much in and out of the classroom and am now able to apply what learned in this class to other things that may not even be related. "
