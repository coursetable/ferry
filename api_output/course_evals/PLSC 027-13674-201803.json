            "\u00a0While I don't plan to study political science, I appreciated the introduction to political science methodology and the opportunity to read some important works in the field. I also enjoyed discussing social movements and found all my classmates to be passionate, caring, justice-minded people. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to extrapolate the most information from articles without necessarily reading all of it. Though I would try to, it sometimes felt impossible to read every article in detail, so, instead, I had to learn how to read consciously, getting the most out of what I could read. I also learned so much about political science! I had never taken a course like it and I probably never will again, so it was nice to learn about the different kinds of models in relation to Social Movements. ",
            "\u00a0This course gives a look at social movements from a theoretical perspective. While the theories are applied to historical cases, we looked at social movements from a broader perspective, considering which methods work and which don't. In this way, we were able to think critically about how and why people mobilize and understand what factors play a role in successfully making change in society. ",
            "\u00a0I became a better writer, and more aware of the social movements throughout the United States (and globally). ",
            "\u00a0This course delved into the underlying theories (political process theory, resource mobilization theory, collective identity model, etc.) of how social movements form and are able to be successful. These theories were then applied to many social movements, which spanned anywhere from the civil rights movement, gay rights movement, women's liberation movement, to Northern Ireland's civil rights movement in the 1960s. ",
            "\u00a0The fundamentals of social movement theory, a variety of academic perspectives on social movements, why social movements succeed and why they fail. What it takes to lead an effective social movement ",
            "\u00a0This class really provided me with the tools to analyze different political shifts and movements throughout history. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to analyze social movements from entirely new lenses, understanding how they form, what leads to their success, and why they lose momentum. I got an introduction to political theory. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a much greater understanding of social movements in terms of both the various theories that exist on the subject as well as more tangible, real-world applications. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read and analyze scholarly work in the political science field. ",
            "\u00a0- Engaged participation through questioning, challenging, active listening, and debate\r\n- Empirical analysis often requires isolating movements and occurrences from the emotional weight of them ",
            "\u00a0This course really helped me to think critically about what the role of protest is in our country. As someone who was politically active throughout high school, I thought that I understood social movements. However, this course delves deeply into the interplay between protest, government, social identity, and socioeconomics. This course broadened my understanding of how different people may view social movements and understand their success. ",
            "\u00a0In this class, we studied many components of social movement theory, including some that would not be my primary focus if it were up to me. As such, I learned to carefully take into account the various aspects of a certain topic, even the ones that interest me less, as they are not just equally important to understanding the topic as a whole, but they are also crucial to understanding the specific aspects that do interest me. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely gained a very theory based, poli-sci perspective on social movement formation and operation. It was really cool to study social movements not so much as isolated outcries but as calculated and context-based political actions. Definitely gave me a cool perspective as someone who is deeply interested in social justice and in participating in todays social movements. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a greater understanding of how social movements and social processes work, as well as a toolkit to evaluate such social processes. "

            "\u00a0I would have liked a little more guidance on how to write the final paper. I also wish the professor intervened a bit more to get the conversation back on track - I felt like students sometimes presented their ideas without really listening to what others were saying. ",
            "\u00a0I liked that the students got to teach the classes because it helped me understand the material better, as the students were able to teach it in a way that didn't sound complicated. I do wish some of our readings weren't so complex though. Sometimes they were very hard to understand and that made it hard to present the article to the rest of the class. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, the course lacked structure, and instructions were often vague and not helpful. Because of this, many classes were spent with students giving extremely long presentations merely summarizing readings that were already done prior to class, with little to no productive discussion coming from the presentation. Likewise, students who were tasked with being \"discussion leaders\" (hence, the presentation that would lead the class) would often ask questions along the lines of \"what did X author say on page 32?\" or other non-engaging questions. On days where multiple students would present and summaries would go on for much too long, students presenting second or third would often find themselves having to rush or skip through most of their presentation, which more likely than not, also contained too much summarization. \r\nThrough a more clearly defined structure, not as heavily dependent on student-led summarizations of the readings, the course has potential for more engaging and thought-provoking discourse. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: I think the course gave a great overview of social movement theory, and I definitely feel like I learned a lot. The work was very straightforward (two discussion leader presentations, five short reading responses, and one final paper/presentation) and did not overshadow our focus on the readings. The discussions were always active and guided well, with Dean Barlow helping each discussion leader offer engaging questions.\r\nWeakness: We focused almost entirely on progressive movements, and most of the time we were all in agreement with the motives behind each movement. I think it might be interesting to look at conservative movements for some of the class and see how these relate to the theories even though they might not necessarily fit our ideas of activism. ",
            "\u00a0I think the only weakness is the lack of far-right movements  I think it's a really important thing to understand, and to see if there is a difference  between these far-right movements and other social movements.  I also wish we focused on more social movements in Latin America. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Easy grading, fair weekly workload, interesting material, structured class with clear instructions on how to do well. Weaknesses: this wasn't the class I was expecting in that it was heavily student-led. If I was ever confused on a reading or theory, I felt like I couldn't contribute in class as much as I would have liked because I needed extra help from Professor Barlow to guide me rather than a student presentation. ",
            "\u00a0This course exposes students to a broad range of literature on social movement theory and is a good way to dip ones toes into political science courses at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely loved the readings and discussions in this class. Dean Barlow did a great job at guiding discussions without being overbearing. My only wish is that we covered more controversial or conservative movements ",
            "\u00a0I honestly thought that this course was truly brilliant and well organized. The only weaknesses I found with this course is that sometimes the discussions seemed force because people had little to say. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the readings survey all kinds of social movements, from womens rights to gay rights to civil rights. Discussions are always very interesting. Weaknesses: I wish Professor Barlow took a more active role in the class, rather than having the students lead everything. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths definitely had to do with the seminar-style structure and the discourse within the classroom. The weakness might have been that we constantly read a lot of different scholarly work on various social movements which became a little repetitive at times. ",
            "\u00a0- I would have liked more teacher facilitated discussions or variation with the class structures; it often felt a bit repetitive, which inhibited engaged learning at times. ",
            "\u00a0I think that this course became a bit repetitive very quickly. With each new source or theory we examined, we kept coming back to the same questions and the same answers to these questions. I'm not sure if this is a product of social movement theory itself or if there may be a better way to select readings used in discussion. \r\n\r\nA great part of this class is that it tends to attract people who are equally invested in addressing problems in policy. I think the nature of this course itself brings together a group of people who will be very apt to discuss protest and social movements. Dean Barlow is also excellent at navigating the group and leading their discussions. ",
            "\u00a0As a first-year seminar, students of all levels are in the same discussion and are given the same material to prepare, and some will speak more than others. I appreciate the guidance of the professor in these discussions and the format of the course as a whole, which both served to help all students understand what part of the study we were undertaking (through targeted discussion questions and titles like week 2: political process model and political opportunity). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were definitely the seminar style and Dean Barlow. She was such  a good discussion leader and struck a perfect balance of giving us space to discuss but also asking the questions that would get us to the root of the issues she wanted us to learn about. Also, she took the class out for dinner twice in the semester! Because of the kind and open vibe that she had, the class became a close group of friends. I think one improvement to the class could be a little more variation in the readings. We read almost exclusively dense political science papers, and it would've been cool to look at pieces from artists or from people actively involved in the movements we studied. ",
            "\u00a0This course is great! As a first year seminar, it was a great way to meet people passionate about social issues like myself, and we had the most engaging discussions. Could be improved by reading about more of a variety of movements, including right-wing movements and more local movements from other countries. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. Keep in mind that it's focused on political theory and not history. ",
            "\u00a0If you're into political science, then yes. But realize that it is not a history course! If you want history, look into something else. ",
            "\u00a0Personally, this course was not of great interest to me, and although Dean Barlow is a great person, I struggled to gain clear instruction or feedback throughout the class, as did many other students who often misinterpreted assignments. Unless the student were extremely interested in the political theory of social movements (NOT the history), I would recommend, but because of the vague course structure and heavy reading load, I would not personally recommend. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to another student. I viewed social movements in a way I never had before and am still left with critical questions about how we can change society effectively. Dean Barlow is a great instructor and does a great job at putting focus on discussion. If you do the readings, you will have a great experience in this class and have the opportunity to have incredibly engaging discourse about an important topic in our current society. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to other students  it was wonderfully taught, and very interesting class overall. This class was filled with intellectually stimulating discussions and helped me view social movements in a different way. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course! When I went into it, I thought it was going to be more focused on the movements themselves, but the class is very theory based so it may not be exactly what you expect. However, this is not a bad thing! I feel like I learned so much in the span of one semester and I was able to look at social movements from an underlying perspective and analyze the factors that explain why and how they emerged they way they did. The workload was also very manageable as long as you spaced your time out well throughout the semester (there were 5 1-2 page reading responses due throughout the semester, and one final 10-12 page paper, as well as two 3-4 page papers the weeks you signed up to be a discussion leader). Professor Barlow is a very fair grader as well, and it didn't seem difficult to earn at least an A- in the class - that being said, this is not a gut either!! You do have to write a solid amount, but the class is very interesting and the final paper is written on your movement of choice! Be aware that the class is also heavily student led, and Professor Barlow is mostly there to facilitate discussion rather than teach you about the social movements we studied herself. If you also are not prepared to read at least 40-60 pages for each class, this also may not be the course for you. However, towards the end of the course I found that generally skimming the articles was sufficient for good discussion, because discussion leaders presented a summary and analysis of each reading at the beginning of every class. This first year seminar also provides a great environment to become close with other first years - Professor Barlow took our class out to dinner twice throughout the semester and we got very close as a class! ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! The material is very riveting and carries a lot of weight in the current political climate. It provides inspiration for aspiring activists. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. My favorite class taken at Yale thus far. The readings are amazing and Dean Barlow is a fantastic professor ",
            "\u00a0I would most definitely recommend this course to any student interested in politics or sociology because much of the course was focused on these areas ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to someone who is interested in getting an introduction to political theory and the framework of social movements. Its an interesting course, but beware that the reading is pretty difficult and long. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Dean Barlow is truly amazing and the subject matter is fascinating. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student looking to decide whether the field of political science is right for them. ",
            "\u00a0- Yes, if they have a basic knowledge or awareness around political science and empirics. ",
            "\u00a0Social Movements is a great class for those with an interest in politics and a broader interest in fixing those problems that our country faces but often refuses to acknowledge. The reading is dense and often quite difficult to understand, but the class itself is quite rewarding. If you keep up with politics, you may often find yourself comparing what you've learned in class to those situations you see happening around you. Even if you do not plan to major in a political science-related field, this is a great First-Year Seminar to take to engage in deep thinking, improve your writing, and experience great discussion. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student who already has an interest in the subject, as it would be hard to form an interest in it only after getting into very specific and intricate discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I definitely would. It's information that you wouldn't really get otherwise. And Dean Barlow is the best! ",
            "\u00a0Highly reccommend to first years with a passion for politics or social issues! "
