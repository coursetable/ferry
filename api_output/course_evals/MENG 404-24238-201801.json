            "\u00a0I learned an incredible amount taking this course, probably more than I've ever learned in a Yale course.  I learned about the field I'm hoping to work in for the future, I learned hands on skills in engineering (which doesn't happen in any other Yale classes), but more than that, I learned what it truly means to work in a team.  I have been on sports teams for years and that experience was the closest to this, but being part of an inter-disciplinary team where everyone truly needed to carry their weight was a great experience and learning moment for me.  It forced us to work together and trust each other to make decisions alone for the group, so that was a truly special experience that will serve me in great stead. ",
            "\u00a0The main thing I learned in this course was how to develop a project independently from scratch. From figuring out my own problems, I grew a lot as an engineer and gained more confidence in my abilities. ",
            "\u00a0The iterative design process, team organization and effective communication and presentation of your work, insights into the medical device design process, coding skills and experience, fabrication skills and experience ",
            "\u00a0I learned so so much! I have a better understanding of what the design process is like (including the use of Gantt and Pugh chats), how to use power tools, CNC machining, material types, SolidWorks, etc ",
            "\u00a0This class is a unique opportunity in the engineering department to actually work on a tangible issue and build a product that serves a client. Along the way, you learn so much  about working in a team, about the medical device industry (from amazing guest lecturers every week who share their insights from the emergency room to big medical device corporations to biotech startups), about what it takes to create a product from scratch, about how to machine parts or CAD complex systems, etc. This class was a continuous learning experience for everyone involved in the best way possible. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about the design process- how to take a problem and ideate a solution, and then actually prototype the solution. ",
            "\u00a0How to go through the design process from beginning to end in a team setting applied to the field of medical devices. ",
            "\u00a0I learned all about the process of designing and building a medal device. Furthermore, we learned about how the devices eventually make it to the market and the process of getting there. ",
            "\u00a0You gain a great deal of knowledge about design and the world of medical devices. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a hands-on engineering design class. I learned how to identify and approach design problems, and to work towards solving those problems by gathering information from experts, generating ideas, building prototypes, presenting concepts, and receiving feedback from experts. I was also able to develop some skills like CAD, 3D printing, rapid prototyping, and machining. By being organized around a set of very specific problems proposed by clients, and by incorporating extremely wide-ranging perspectives on engineering solutions to those problems, the course offers a perspective on engineering that is unique from that of the other BENG and MENG courses at Yale. In 404, engineering involves weighing options, meeting with many many people, and going down rabbit holes. These are very real engineering skills that I did not gain in any other course. "

            "\u00a0I think the only weakness could be the amount of work.  This class will hurt your soul.  But that is also not a real weakness because you need to work that hard, you'll want to work that hard, and it is 100% worth it and the end.  I think the class made some adjustments and I think it has a reasonable balance of writing, outside lecturers, and work time.  I just loved this class and can't stop saying good things about it. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Really dedicated teaching staff, great opportunity to work on a team, really unique experience working with physicians on real-world problems\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course is very fast-paced, which makes some parts of the class feel rushed. Also, Joe is extremely dedicated and made his best effort to help all the teams, but this course really needs 2 professors. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- this class has been held for a few years now, so most of the kinks have been worked out. Joe puts a lot of time into organizing the class and helping out with each team, so this class ends up being a rewarding experience for everyone. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses- I don't think this can be addressed, but it would be great if this were a year long class so that projects could have more continuity. Placing the course in the spring especially is hard for project continuity because most seniors will be leaving Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing guest lecturers, very well put together class, devoted and brilliant teaching staff. Weaknesses - your experience is very dependent on the team and project you end up with. ",
            "\u00a0Incredible all throughout! I loved the guest lectures and I appreciated the weekly meetings with Joe. The only thing that would be nice would be having more technical workshops or a class prior to this for BME and other students who havent has much experience to the knowledge needed to complete the class project. Having more teaching staff members who could help with machining and assembling during the last couple of weeks of class would have been super helpful! ",
            "\u00a0Overall this course was one of the best classes I've taken here. The amount of resources it has and the amazing dedication of Joe and the teaching staff make it an amazing experience. It was very time consuming, but every minute spent felt worth it. Joe cares so much about his students and making sure they're getting the most out of the class and spends hours structuring an amazing learning experience. However, one thing that could be improved is the grading- throughout the semester we had very little sense of the letter grade we would get (I still have no idea as I'm writing this review) which was a little stressful at times. However, the course is good because it removes the focus from the grades and to the actual learning process. ",
            "\u00a0This course is by far one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. I think that the class has reached a very refined state with many strengths.\r\nOne area I think can be improved was how the last part of the project (realization and testing) felt rushed, relative to the earlier part (research and brainstorming) that felt a bit drawn out. One possibility is to start prototyping and making the final device sooner so that we can allocate the last week or two of class to testing the device. ",
            "\u00a0The course is incredible well put together. Furthermore, Joe works incredibly hard to make sure every project is as good as it can be. The only weakness is the machining bottleneck that occurs at the end of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0This year there needed to be a second teacher to help Joe teach the class. Other than that, everything was great! ",
            "\u00a0The class is very well organized, and Prof. Zinter does an excellent job of structuring assignments and timelines to be relevant and feasible for projects that range in diversity and content. Prof. Zinter sets the projects up for success from the very beginning, and gives students all of the support they need (and then some). So doing the work for this class is a real joy. One weakness of the course is that little feedback was given on assignments, and students are given relatively little chance to learn about what they can improve for future assignments (whether written work or presentations).

            "\u00a0I CANNOT recommend this course more highly.  Everything you hear about the workload is true though.  Towards the end of the semester, this class was a grind unlike that in any other class.  You will not sleep, you won't leave the CEID for days, your eating schedule will get weird.  But, you'll have some awesomely weird time with classmates, you'll bust your ass for something without caring about your grade, and in the end, it will all be worth it.  I had wanted to take this course for years, but after getting in, I was pretty scared of the workload because I was doing research for a thesis and was in season for athletics.  At times, it made life super difficult, but it was 100% worth it.  What do you get from this class?  A chance to actually do some hands on engineering which is both an incredible learning experience and unfortunately, a rarity at Yale.  You get a chance to do a group project.  But not the group project you're thinking about.  No one can slack off, you'll spend hours on hours with your group, you'll learn to let other people make big decisions for your project and trust them to do it, and to trust and learn from the skills of your classmates.  I have never been prouder of a project at Yale than I was when I stepped away from our final presentation.  The teaching staff is super dedicated and everyone in the class is just amped to be there.  If you're ready to dedicate your time, try try try to get into this class because it will absolutely better inform how you feel about engineering and possibly be the highlight class of your time at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Take it if you are interested in engineering, medicine, and/or medical devices, but know what you're getting into. It is a LOT of work and occupies a lot of head space and time, but is extremely rewarding! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This is definitely the best engineering course I have taken at Yale. You actually get to make your own device and learn about the entire process behind making something new. The class is broken up into teams, and each team addresses some unmet clinical need. It's awesome working on a real-world problem and creating something you know will help others. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. If you're willing to put in the time, you'll get a ton out of it. It's a super unique course, it's no coincidence they use it as an example to show off to donors/visitors ",
            "\u00a0I 100% would recommend this course to anyone. It is a lot of work, but it was the most rewarding class of my Yale experience. It increased my confidence as an engineer immensely and gave me a lot of new technical skills that make me more comfortable with the idea of entering the workforce. Joe and the teaching staff members were incredible and super committed to making this class the best it could be. Definitely not a class that makes sense as CR/D/Fail because youll probably get super invested in your project and will want to put in the work anyway. ",
            "\u00a0I remember my first shopping period of my Yale career shopping this course and knowing that I wanted to take it as an upperclassman. As a result, I came in with incredibly high expectations. To say that this class is the best engineering course offered by Yale is an understatement. This class is unlike any otherfrom the most dedicated teaching staff to the amazing guest lectures to passionate clients to incredibly smart classmates, its an inspirational environment to be a part of. Prof. Zinter truly wants everyone to succeed and to build something theyre proud of. He pushed us to deliver a design we loved, and Im so grateful to have had the opportunity to take this course. If youre a MechE major, take this as your senior project! Youll find no better experience to cap off your academic career! ",
            "\u00a0YES. If you get in, absolutely take it. The best engineering class at Yale. You will be forced to think outside the box and push yourself in a way that no other engineering class here does. ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend the course to another student. It is a lot of work, but you'll definitely gain a lot from the course if you put in the time and effort. ",
            "\u00a0This is one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. If you are ready to put in the work, you should definitely take this class. ",
            "\u00a0If you are an engineering student, then you should take this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The course is lots of work, but it is absolutely worthwhile. "
