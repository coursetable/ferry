            "\u00a0I learned about the research of faculty members in Biomedical Engineering. I also learned about research writing, presentation skills, and proposal writing. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to consider an unmet medical need and to be creative in designing a solution to this problem. This was the first time doing an assignment like this and I thought that this was very useful. ",
            "\u00a0Gave me an in-depth and broad understanding of biomedical engineering research in biomaterials, biomechanics, biomedical images and signals, and systems biology. Also had guest lectures on Biomedical Engineering writing and product development. ",
            "\u00a0During this course I practiced reading technical papers ",
            "\u00a0This course provides a broad overview of the research that goes on in the BME department at Yale. It's great to hear from the BME faculty, but their talks provide very little insight on what it's actually like to run a scientific lab and to conduct research at a university. The NIH-style project proposal was the most rewarding part of the course, and was a great exercise in conceiving of and selling an engineering project from scratch. ",
            "\u00a0I think that sounds course was really important for facilitating a continued interest in biomedical engineering. Moving it to sophomore year is a great idea and will make less people drop the major ",
            "\u00a0From the syllabus: \"The goal of this course is to expose you to different research areas in BME, and to gain experience in writing, presenting, \r\nand critiquing novel research ideas.\"\r\n\r\nThe course achieved the first part of its goal. I gained knowledge about different research areas related to biomedical engineering. However, this knowledge would have been far more useful to me when I was a first or second year considering the biomedical engineering major. It was a waste of time for me, a senior who has already decided on a track and committed to a lab, to accumulate this knowledge.\r\n\r\nTaken literally, the course did succeed in providing \"experience\" in writing, presenting, and critiquing novel research ideas. Was this experience well-organized such that it translated into \"skills and insights?\" No, and in this respect the course was a failure by Yale's standards of rigor and instruction. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Interesting and generally engaging. Prof Tagare was terrific!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Perhaps could have included more people from industry. I didn't get grades for anything yet, which would have been nice. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course should focus more on the designing aspect (the last assignment) because we aren't exposed to this too much in our other BME classes. ",
            "\u00a0Perfect senior seminar which exposes you to a wide variety of research. Combined format with sophomores complicated organization, but this is supposed to end within the next year or 2. ",
            "\u00a0I think the major already knows that this class would be better served coming earlier in your college career.  They're already in process of switching it over to a sophomore seminar.  I think that will really improve this class because for seniors, you're mostly just sitting around listening to different research talks all year. ",
            "\u00a0Nearly every speaker in the course was interested in their research, and chose to go into detail about specific research projects instead of describing why they're interested in their research and how they got to where they are. The latter would have been so much more useful for the seniors taking the course, who are already engaged in research and in many ways are too late to take advantage of new research opportunities. That being said, it was great to hear about the diversity of research that goes on in the BME department. ",
            "\u00a0Strength - final project was fun and pushed me to really think, weakness-there seemed to be a disconnect in grading criteria between te ta and the professor ",
            "\u00a0The course's main strength is its breadth. It presents a wide array of research topics through faculty presentations.\r\n\r\nIts main weakness is that at this point, senior biomedical engineering students don't need breadth. More time could have been spent helping students develop their writing and presentations skills. We heard a great presentation at the beginning of the semester on scientific communication. Beyond that, we received no other instruction on the subject.\r\n\r\nGiven that very little time was devoted to defining the contours of good writing, speaking, and discussion in different scientific and professional contexts, the criteria by which we were evaluated were vague. This lack of transparency was reflected in the bare-bones feedback that we received on ungraded and graded drafts of our work. Discussions with the TA and professor didn't help clarify expectations. The TA was unfamiliar with the details of the work she had apparently graded and the professor didn't elaborate on what \"good writing\" or \"more engineering\" meant.\r\n\r\nTo return to the language of the syllabus, I was frustrated with the \"critiquing novel research ideas\" part. The course did its best to enforce an appreciation for scientific novelty by putting novelty requirements in the presentation and proposal assignments. It tried to make us \"critique\" ideas by requiring a few students to prepare questions for each guest speaker. This is the bare minimum. \r\n\r\n\"Novelty\" is a thorny philosophical concept. Is a theory or invention novel because it was previously unknown? Or perhaps it is novel because it's counter-intuitive. And for that matter, can a theory or invention be novel in the first place if we believe that the basic methods and ideas underlying inquiry/invention must be defined a priori in order to serve as a foundation for future work? The course takes the brave position of refusing to define novelty in the beginning but still grading it in the end.\r\n\r\nAt best, the course was a waste of time listening to presentations of varying quality; at worst, it was a frustratingly disorganized affair. I wish this course actually accomplished its goal. I wish the department and professor had spent more time to work out an intellectual and pedagogic structure. I wish I had known this was to constitute a \"senior seminar\" when I had selected my major. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the course. I think the format is good and should not be made harder. It was refreshing to be able to learn a lot without having to do too many assignments. The only thing is that the final proposal kind of sprung up on us, so a reminder about it and explanation of what it entails should be given earlier than just 2 weeks / a week and a half before the first deadline. I also didn't like having to come up with questions in a group at the end of the presentation. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are it has high number if seminars and few workload. Weakness is tight curve I think. ",
            "\u00a0Some of the professors proposed interesting discussion topics, while others did not do as good of a job in leading the discussion, especially during the classes with the 280 students. It may be helpful to give the professors a more standardized format for how to lead the discussion. I also would have preferred if we were assigned questions within multiple topic areas, like imaging and biomaterials. I was assigned questions for two imaging professors and wished that I was asked to engage more deeply within more than one topic.\r\n\r\nI really liked the proposal/peer revision process and would have liked to spend more time exploring the creative side of biomedical engineering, either with a longer proposal or more small projects along those same lines. The group project was interesting, but honestly, a very frustrating process due to quite a bit of difficulty with my group members. Smaller groups may make the process more manageable, because a lot of the difficulty arose with trying to find meeting times that worked for all six people. ",
            "\u00a0The level of feedback on the final project could certainly be improved. The guest lecturers often assigned readings that were unrelated or at best tangential to the lecture, it would be nice if they were better connected.\r\nFor strengths, it definitely exposes you to a wide range of BME applications that you don't see elsewhere in the curriculum.

            "\u00a0If you have to take it in the next two years, it'll be fine and after that it will disappear.  So senior BMEs of next year, enjoy a fairly easy chance to hear about different professors' fields while doing relatively little work.  Tagare is a cool guy who will help you if you have any questions about the couple of assignments you actually get. ",

            "\u00a0As a BME major you have to take the class, so it doesn't matter if it's recommended or not. That being said, if you do the readings and pay attention in class you can walk away with knowledge about some pretty cool BME applications and fields of research. "
