            "\u00a0I learned a year's worth of French! I went from understanding literally nothing apart from a few phrases to being able to compose entire stories and understanding basic conversations! ",
            "\u00a0I learned almost be entirety of French grammar. I began developing an ear for picking up languages and accents more easily thanks to the structure of the class and the skill of the instructor. ",
            "\u00a0A beautiful introduction to the French language - immersive and incredibly effective! ",
            "\u00a0I have developed a solid foundational of French thanks to this class and the Capretz method. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to speak, write and understand French. I mostly learned all the basic grammar, a large amount of fundamental vocabulary and some French culture. ",
            "\u00a0I learned basic French vocabulary, grammar, and conversational expressions. The regular practice was very helpful  I ended the semester feeling comfortable with having a conversation in French. "

        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: The course takes no prisoners--you will be required to put in tremendous work, but you will get extraordinary results. Your class will likely become very close.\r\nWeakness: This course is tremendously difficult--exams were challenging, as were compositions. ",
            "\u00a0I can't think of any ways to realky improve this class. The pace is quick, the workload is a lot (not excessive, though), but it's all worth it and overall the structure of the class maximizes the amount you learn and the depth to which you learn each topic. ",
            "\u00a0A well rounded course with no weaknesses, in all honesty! (Although a 10:00 start would be appreciated!) ",
            "\u00a0The class is designed in a way that helps develop all four areas of your language ability, with a particular focus on speaking and writing. The weekly tests and compositions may seem like a lot at first, but they're incredibly helpful and you will get used to them really fast. ",
            "\u00a0This class is really amazing if you want to learn French intensively. It is a lot of work, so you need to make sure you have time for it in your schedule, but I felt like all the hours of class time and of homework were generally very productive and really helped me improve my French. One of the biggest strengths of this course is how well it mimics natural language learning. You are exposed to lots of words in the videos before formally studying, as well as much of the grammar, and then it is reinforced by the class work and homework, so you learn the vocab and grammar without having to sit down and memorize it. ",
            "\u00a0This course does a good job introducing Parisien French, but I would have liked to learn more about dialects of other Francophone countries. ",
            "\u00a0The regular meeting time was rigorous but extremely helpful  (2 hours per day, with an extra 2 hours for a review session and exam once per week). Likewise, the fast pace of the course required a lot of work outside of class, but was very productive and rewarding. Madame Sherak was a wonderful instructor. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course--as someone taking a five credit load this semester, I didn't feel that these two credits were actually that bad. I certainly didn't do every piece of work assigned to me (I don't think anyone did), but you will make amazing gains in French, and I feel set up for success in further French studies. I know, especially, I've made amazing gains in oral production and I attribute that to the intense, bootcamp nature of the course. ",
            "\u00a0If you love languages and you're willing to put in the work, absolutely. It was an incredibly rewarding experience, and Madame Sherak is an exceptional teacher in her style of teaching and in the care she shows towards each student's success. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! ",
            "\u00a0DO IT! I am so glad I made the choice to take this course. At the beginning of the semester, to be honest, I had some doubts about whether I would be able to keep up with the fast pace and heavy coursework load. While it did definitely take up most time out of all the classes I'm taking, it is certainly manageable. Since the class size is really small, you get the opportunity to form a strong bond with all your classmates, both in and out of classroom. And your French would really improve rapidly! ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student that wants to learn French intensely. If you just want to fulfill your language requirement, there are easier ways to do so, however if you are really interested in learning French and enjoy learning languages, this is the class for you. You will be surrounded by classmates that are all trying their best, and also enjoy learning languages. If you have Madame Sherak, then you will have a teacher who is always kind and understanding, as well as very talented and organized. She assumes that her students are putting in their best effort, and treats them accordingly, which creates a wonderful environment in which to learn. If  you struggle, she will support you as best as she can, and she takes effort into account greatly in terms of grading, which means all the kids are worried about learning instead of stressing about their grades. Overall, a great course, so just make sure you leave your schedule light enough to accommodate the workload (on average about 2 hours per day) and you will be fine. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! "
