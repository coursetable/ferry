            "\u00a0I think it would be preferable if every problem set were graded instead of just four. I had no incentive to try on the other problem sets that were not graded, and overly pressured to do well on the ones that were graded. The final exam was very reasonable. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the first half of the course could have been facilitated in a way that made learning more engaging.  Maria should talk to Marina to pick up some ways to keep the class more engaged and make the material easier for us to understand. ",
            "\u00a0The material of the class was its biggest strength. It progressed in a very clear, logical manner, and started from the basics to build up to some very complicated topics that could actually be applied to the real world. I thought the material was good, but class was never always engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - It's a very interesting topic. And Marina is a good lecturer. Weaknesses - not many, maybe too slow initially for some people but it picks up. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of the course include devoted professors, helpful TF's, interesting material, and none to challenging math nor assessments. Weaknesses are that the psets are usually beyond what was covered in class and require outside research, plus the TF's are not \"supposed\" to help with the graded problem sets. ",
            "\u00a0The Problem sets were helpful for exercising the concepts learned in class. However, sometimes we would not cover much in section which seems like a wasted opportunity. ",
            "\u00a0Not always consistent grading across problem sets. Other than that I don't have any major complaints about the structure of the course. I think it facilitated student learning well. Both Professors gave engaging lectures and there were ample opportunities to practice the material. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the four graded problem sets and weekly non-graded problem sets were a strength of the course. They kept you engaged on a weekly basis and let you know if you were falling behind without the pressure of an eight-hour assignment every week like some other classes. This class had few weaknesses, but the sections were not very useful. ",
            "\u00a0The class is taught with a mindset of \"these are some equations worth memorizing\" no proof is ever given. ",

            "\u00a0Excellent lectures and lecture notes. Good course structure. ",
            "\u00a0This class was taught according to incredibly fascinating material. The pace was rather fast, but this is not necessarily a bad thing. The presentations were useful, but the format of only grading four problems sets, I believe, was a mistake. I would rather have had all my problem sets graded to spread out their grade weight. I wish office hours could be more helpful in terms of understanding the material as it is relevant to problem sets. Although I understand that the TAs cannot simply help us with our problem sets, many of hte problem sets involved modifications of the material we had gone over in class, so sometimes making that jump was difficult. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: learn about a very different aspect of economics that can produce a lot of counter-intuitive results that can be seen in the real world \r\n\r\n\r\nOne weakness in the midterm was that if you set up the first part of the question wrong all subsequent parts were also wrong. I took 122 (intermediate macro) last semester and one nice part about the exams was that the answer was kind of given and you had to find a way to get there, which I think would be a more fair assessment than the high-stakes way these exams are set up. ",

            "\u00a0This course was taught by two professors and I think it would have been more effective with just one for the entire semester. There would have been more consistency in teaching style and in the course in general. The strength of the course was the range of questions that we were able to cover from business to biology; we had the opportunity to connect game theory to a lot of different fields of study and this was really interesting. ",
            "\u00a0The first instructor, Maria Saez, was very unclear and disorganized. The course would be improved if only one instructor taught it. ",

If problem sets are graded, then there would be no need to go over problem sets in section. Instead, section could be used to go over different problems. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: clear structure and expectations. Weaknesses, at times the course is too slow, at other times too fast. The change of instructors is confusing. Personally, I have liked Prof. Saez much better and was sad to lose her after midterm. ",

            "\u00a0Not really econ enough to be an econ class, not really math enough to be a math class, but it's interesting material so I would recommend it if you need it for your major. If you are only interested in learning about game theory just for fun, then I would probably recommend just getting a good book on it, or watching YouTube videos. ",
            "\u00a0If this course if fixed so that Marina teaches the whole thing or so that the first half of the semester is somehow made more like the second half, then yes, I would consider recommending this class to another student as long as they're up for the challenge because overall, the concepts regarding decision making that we learned in this course is extremely interesting!! ",
            "\u00a0Yes - I took this class to fulfill my social science requirement and it did not disappoint. The workload was pretty light and some of the topics we covered are really interesting. ",
            "\u00a0This class was stressful. Fundamentally, I think the material was really interesting, but whenever we had to turn in a graded pset or when it came time for the tests...oh mah lawrd. Stressssss. I thought I was the only one, but when you have a study group of like 8 and everyone is confused about what's going on, you start to think....yknow I'm probably still dumb and all, but like, maybe it's not just me that feels lost?? Forming a study group for this class is essential. A lot of this class, especially in the first half of the semester, was honestly just teaching yourself from the slides. Marina was seriously a g though in the second half of the semester, she's pretty dope. \r\n\r\nI'm going to assume if you're reading this, you have to take this class for a requirement anyways, and to you I say: the class is not THAT bad at all. Like it's honestly fine. But if you don't have to take this for a requirement, I'd say just save yourself the trouble and probably take something else. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this if you're at all interested in game theory (I took it for fun as a non-major). It's not a lot of work and it's not too hard, but you'll learn a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's a great course. The problem sets are difficult but the TF's will help you answer them correctly. Be prepared to devote quite a few hours to the graded ones. The midterm was challenging, but the final was comparatively easy. Marina Halac is a great lecturer. No complex math involved and the class provided a reprieve from purely economics material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes interesting course that really does change the way you think about most issues in the world. ",
            "\u00a0I was taking this class for a QR credit (wanted an interesting, manageable coursenot a gut!), so I think I was in the minority as a random humanities major, but I enjoyed it. Game theory is an interesting discipline within economics. The workload was totally manageable and both the midterm and the final were quite fair. Adds an interesting perspective to every day life and decision making, which is cool. ",
            "\u00a0This is the best econ class that I've taken at Yale. I was excited to go to lecture, the problem sets were fair and the material was fascinating. The workload is very manageable and Saez and Halac both explained the material well in lecture. ",

            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course to another student. It is challenging, but a sort of challenging that motivates you to work in the class. The material is incredibly relevant to anyone's life, and it presents a good challenge for a student who might not normally take this sort of course. ",
            "\u00a0Solid econ elective with an average-to-low workload (only 4 graded psets), starts out kind of slow (although the midterm was still not easy) but the material is fairly complex and rewarding to grasp by the end. ",

            "\u00a0Definitely! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely. This is a great course for everybody to take, because it helps you think about interpersonal interactions in a very interesting way. Great instructors, fair evaluations, and fun content! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students who are mathematically minded and enjoy seeing the world through numbers. As the class progresses throughout the semester, more math is introduced and this can be a little challenging if you are not expecting to use numbers for the course. I think the course is organized in a way that encourages learning the material more than doing the work. There are a lot of problem sets that are not graded with only four graded ones. This encouraged students to learn for the sake of learning and not so much for the grade. At the same time, this could be a little dangerous too as there is less incentive to work through the ungraded problem sets thoroughly. ",
