Furthermore, the theory and physics underlying the subject were well described from basic index notation concepts up to complex non-linear problems. I developed important mathematical skills and a more profound insights specially with respect to heat and mass transfer problems. Based on matched asymptotic methods helped me understand well posed problems in the literature such as the similarity solution of boundary layer problems. I wish Prof. Amir had more time to cover the last chapters of the book which would definitely broaden my understanding of the subject. "

            "\u00a0The homework assignments were way too long, especially in the first half of the course. It would have been helpful if lecture notes were posted at least a day in advance so that we could review them before coming to class. The first exam felt fair. The second exam was much too long and difficult, especially when you had to be able to get the first part to complete subsequent parts of the question. I would suggest shortening the exam and making the questions more independent of each other. ",
