            "\u00a0I gained a lot of factual knowledge about the Euro crisis and the way the EU functions as well as useful tips on improving my writing. ",
            "\u00a0This seminar provided a deeply enriching foundation for understanding both the European Union and its recent financial woes.  I improved my financial literacy and knowledge of global macroeconomic principles in addition to honing my argumentative skills, since Prof. Aslanidis asks students to buttress their arguments dutifully. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about economics (since I didn't have much of a background) and a lot about the structure and functions of the European Union and affiliated institutions. Taking this course also developed my critical thinking skills, and helped me learn how to critique arguments. ",
            "\u00a0How to make a solid argument under 1,000 words. How to integrate different sorts of arguments (cultural, economic, etc.) to make the argument stronger. The large picture and the specific details of the Euro crisis and its applications to other economic and cultural crises. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt a lot through this course! You examine a different European country undergoing an economic crisis every class, so you get a really comprehensive outlook of how the financial crisis and Eurozone crisis impacted the entire continent. ",
            "\u00a0knowledge of financial crises ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me a good grounding in the macroeconomics of the Euro Crisis.  It was very much a political economy class and in that sense different to the majority of other classes I have taken in the Political Science major. I enjoyed the different perspective and basis for discussion. ",
            "\u00a0This class really helped me to understand the causes of the debt crisis in Europe, the way it developed and its causes in the individual member states, as well as the short-term and long-term effects of the crisis. I'm glad that this class gave so much background information on European Union institutions and world financial institutions and generally gave me a lot of background knowledge on the EMU and the consequences/implications of this union. ",
            "\u00a0I became comfortable in talking about economics in a political context. I also gained a better understanding of the European project. ",
            "\u00a0This was a fascinating course with a well-selected compilation of literature related to the financial crisis in Europe. In taking the class, I developed a deeper understanding of the unique socio-economic situations prevalent in the countries that experienced the crisis most acutely. In addition, the analysis and discussion of the countries and organizations that played a major role in devising solutions to the crisis was helpful in informing our own ideas on how to resolve outstanding issues in light of our knowledge of the unique political and social factors that often shape the economic policies of euro-area countries.

            "\u00a0Phenomenal professor - readings were extremely informative, and flow of the class was perfectly crafted to maximize engagement with the full picture of the Euro Crisis ",
            "\u00a0The course layout is near perfect.  2-hour seminars can sometimes drag but Paris always strove to engage the class throughout.  He did this through intensive debate and interesting guest speakers.  The amount of writing seemed appropriate for the level and workload of the seminar.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness would be that the final reading response (~1000 words) was due exactly one week before the final paper (~3500 words), which made for some late nights.  I assume Prof. Aslanidis thought we would start earlier on the final paper, as most rosy-eyed professors do.  But like, come on.  Of course nobody did that, and we all were crunched for time as a result. ",
            "\u00a0It's very structured, but student-driven in that it was discussion-oriented. Rather than lecturing at us, Prof. Aslanidis often introduced ideas through the readings, presented some supporting data or explanatory videos in class, and spent the remainder of the time encouraging us to develop our own perspectives. Essay topics were also open-ended, which was nice. For at least the first half of the course, though, the class seemed to focus much more on economics than on politics, which was frustrating. We rarely discussed the consumer behavior behind the numbers, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Fabulous class! Engaging topic with Professor Aslanidis, a wonderful professor. Fascinating material with an in-depth look at a very current issue. Professor Aslanidis encourages student participation and creates a good mix of lesson time and class discussions. He often began the class with a 15 minute or so introduction to the material to provide context and current event updates (e.g. the 2017 Bundestag elections).\r\nThe one suggestion I have is spreading the reading and writing more evenly. Some weeks had a pretty low workload, but then there were a few that had a tremendous amount of reading in addition to an essay. I think that it would be better to spread that out more. In the similar vein, the last reading response was due one week before the final paper, so most students did not start their essays until after the first paper was due. Perhaps make the third reading response due just before Thanksgiving, so that students can get ahead on the final paper over break. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- definitely the seminar style of the course and the teacher, since Professor Aslanidis kept us all engaged and involved in the debate, which was really interesting. The only weakness is that sometimes the economics of the course seemed to be a bit heavy. ",
            "\u00a0Quality of conversation hinges on student participation ",
            "\u00a0Course was really engaging and had a great group of students in the class who were all interested in it. It covered an increasingly broad range of subjects toward the end, but I think it all fit together. My one recommendation is a slightly smaller class size. ",
            "\u00a0The readings were really interesting and helpful and I liked the fact that at the beginning of each class the professor gave a short presentation with more information on each week's discussion topic to complement the readings. I sometimes found it hard to participate in the discussion, however I thought discussions were generally well moderated by the professor and helped me gain a better understanding of the readings. ",
            "\u00a0I wish we had talked more about one of the different parts of the Euro crisis in more depth. Maybe an extra hour dedicated to discussion would add to the course ",
            "\u00a0Overall this course was well designed. The readings were engaging and relevant. I appreciated Professor Aslanidis bringing in current events to class, and integrating them into the discussion where relevant. Additionally I particularly enjoyed the guest speakers, who added unique perspectives to our discussions. \r\n\r\nThe reading responses were a successful way to ensure engagement with the material, and help even out the weight of the graded assignments, so that the final essay was not weighted disproportionately high. However, the timing of the reading responses could be improved in the future. The first response came too quickly after registration for classes, leaving many students scrambling to complete the assignment a day or two after finalizing their schedules and committing to the class. In addition, the last reading response was assigned a week before the final paper was due, backloading much of the assignments. A reading response placed in the middle of October would help with this issue. \r\n\r\nWith regard to the classroom structure, I felt that discussions were often challenging to maintain for the full two hours. Classes during which the professor primed the discussion with a presentation were often more successful. In the future, I would recommend using this strategy regularly, and in doing so, not only address current events and outside perspectives, but also summarize the main points from the readings to help enhance the discussion that follows.

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course! The material is very engaging and Professor Aslanidis is incredibly intelligent and engaging as a Professor. The requirements of the course are certainly very demanding but it is worth it- you will learn so much and improve your writing tremendously. ",
            "\u00a0This class was phenomenal - primarily because Paris is an amazing professor; he really doesn't hold back his criticisms, which is tough to adjust to at first, but the class really helped with regards to critical reading and writing. ",
            "\u00a0If you have never studied European politics before, this course is a great on-ramp.  Paris never asks for too much out of students; instead, he pushes them to an ideal point of classroom comfort where they confront new ideas in foreign territory.  I'm very happy with this course and gladly would recommend it to anyone with any level of understanding about Europe and the financial crisis. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but make sure you're prepared to invest a lot of time and energy. If you aren't serious about this, it's not worth it. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course!!! The Euro crisis is a fascinating phenomenon, and it is not over. It applies to many different fields, such as economics, politics, sociology, and others. This course is not overly difficult and the material can be easily applied to other fields and phenomena. Professor Aslanidis is fun, engaging, and always has something interesting to say. If you are interested in current economic or political issues, this class is for you. ",
            "\u00a0Paris is an engaging professor and the material reaches into different areas of study. Would highly recommend, although some background macroecon knowledge would be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this class, you become a much better writer and analytical thinker ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course because the discussions were really interesting, and I felt the material was covered in a way that was very applicable to the world in general and to other classes. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very interesting and gave a good overview of the Euro Crisis, particularly focusing on the macro-economic issues. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course as it is a genuinely fun and interesting way to learn about the Eurozone crisis and get some more in-depth knowledge through the readings and essays. The class has quite a lot of readings each week but other than that the workload of the three essays and final paper is pretty manageable. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course because it is challenging and rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0Even as an economics major, the depth and complexity of economic themes addressed in the course material for this class were at times daunting. With that caveat, the course is well worth the experience, as the opportunity to engage with brilliant scholastic minds on one of the most relevant global issues of our time is not one to pass up. ",
            "\u00a0Take the class if you're more interested in the economics of the crisis than the politics (although the two are deeply entwined). Aslandis tries his best but there were moments you could see no one in the class had any idea what was happening a lot of the time or even how to ask a question about the material as Aslandis can be intimidating and quite strict. If you don't care about the IMF or World Bank, don't take it. Lots of dense reading of journals and reports. Take note also that Aslandis has a particular format for papers, aka, they are single-spaced so keep that in mind. "
