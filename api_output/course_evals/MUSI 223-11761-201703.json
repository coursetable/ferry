            "\u00a0interesting class. the concerts in the beinecke are actually such a great and unique experience  youll be able to tell your friends you got to play music there! ",
            "\u00a0I learned quite a bit about the history of early music, and became a more proficient sight reader. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my sight-reading skills; learned interesting facts about tuning, instruments and modes in Renaissance Europe; and got the chance to sing transcriptions of Beinecke music scores. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed learning some of the unique music theory practices of early music, which is something that most classical musicians don't get much opportunity to study. ",
            "\u00a0I got to play a harpsichord and practice my reading of figured bass! ",
            "\u00a0I developed my sight-reading/singing, German pronunciation, and the development of musical notation and theory in the early Renaissance. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my sight-reading and singing in German and learned to recognize the unique modes and characteristic musical techniques of the period. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about early music performance practice and the history of early performance. Specifically about the predecessors of modern instruments, and how the reformation manifested in German music. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a how to play a new instrument - the theorbo - and developed a new professional skill in learning to read figured bass (basso continuo) in the 15th/16th century style. Additionally, I learned valuable historical information about performance practice, style, and important composers of the era. ",
            "\u00a0So much help in sight reading and getting acquainted with early European music! "

            "\u00a0learned a lot for pretty minimal effort. ",
            "\u00a0Performance of Early Music is super fun. It is relaxed in feel, yet we learn a lot of music and always sound good by the concert. My only complaint is that the pace of the course can be somewhat imbalanced. At the beginning of the semester, Grant tends to spend a lot of class time telling us about the history of the music, etc. While interesting, this always makes the one or two rehearsals before the concert super stressful [and Grant consequently becomes frazzled]. Perhaps more thorough scheduling/outlining of the class would help fix this problem! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Grant is AMAZING. Such an engaging, witty, and knowledgable professor. He has tons of connections in the early music community (which I imagine to be small, but nevertheless), which meant we got to perform with some really talented pro musicians. ",
            "\u00a0No improvement needed for this legendary course ",
            "\u00a0This is an excellent course - I'm not sure of any improvement that could be made, besides maybe another performance or two. ",
            "\u00a0Although it only meets once a week, it meets for 2.5 hours in the afternoon. We have plenty of work to get through but a 5-10 minute break in the middle would be welcomed! ",
            "\u00a0The singing and sight-reading instruction in this course is great. \r\n\r\nThe test at the end is always a bit confusingif we're going to be tested on music theory, it might be useful to learn it more formally throughout the course, or have one or two assignments throughout the semester analyzing written music.

            "\u00a0yeah it's a good experience and not that much of a time commitment at all, but still fun ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend! A truly great experience if you enjoy performing music. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to anyone who is a confident sight-reader/musician and is looking for a fun and easy fifth class! ",
            "\u00a0Strongly recommend if you're looking for a light course that is fun and has a performance component! Was always a highlight of my week. ",
            "\u00a0If you are a musician and like to go back 500 years, take it! ",
            "\u00a0Unclear how this course gets Yale College credit, but I'm not complaining! You get asked on the final exam what grade you want in the class ",
            "\u00a0Love being able to sing some music for two hours a week. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a blast. Grant truly cares about his students and the music. I got to make high quality music in a genre that generally doesn't get performed as much. Would definitely take again. ",
            "\u00a0I recommend this course to any musical Yalie! ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes:\r\nClasses are mainly spent rehearsing the songs for our concerts with interesting information about the time period. The music is fun to perform, as is learning about and interacting with the variety of period instruments.\r\nThe course isn't time consuming, but it's worth-while to take. There is a final at the end, so don't expect that you'll get away with a credit free of work. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any music majors and non-music majors alike. The course is what you make it: if you want to take on the challenge of learning a new instrumenr, you have the incredible opportunity to do so. If not, you can still be engaged in this very special kind of music that is not often performed. ",
            "\u00a0If you have any interest in studying early music history and performance practice, absolutely! Prof. Herreid is particularly knowledgeable in this field and is quite generous with his time. ",
            "\u00a0the collegium is a joy to be a part of and I'm so thankful that it's offered as a class at Yale. It creates such a good balance between other more reading-heavy courses, but I feel like I'm constantly improving my musicianship and learning about music history and styles. "
