I honestly think everyone should have a basic understanding of networks since it's the reason we can do so many things today, so this class is awesome for that. You don't need to be an EE major (I am Poly Sci) to keep up in the class, just have a basic understanding of programming and be genuinely interested in the topic. Go for it! ",
            "\u00a0It's very interesting learning about something everyone uses everyday and is a near-invisible experience. ",
            "\u00a0This course is amazing. I gained a deep understanding of what the Internet is and how it works as well as familiarized myself with the architectures and algorithms used by the Internet. HTTP, TCP, SMTP, FTP, all that jazz. It's not like Computer Networks so it won't be very code-heavy, but more conceptual. I liked this as it gave me a break from my other CS classes (I'm an EECS major). You don't need to know much math either- they'll teach everything you need to know (for the scope of this course it's pretty much all basic probability, algebra, etc.) Professor Leandros was great and so was the TA. There's homework from the textbook every two weeks or so which you can usually write on paper. And let me tell you about this textbook, so modern and so easy to read- the author knows the subject is tough but he makes it interesting and understandable. It's a great supplement to Professor Leandros' slides in class (which are what I learned the most from anyway). Each of the two midterms are open notes and open textbook, so make sure to take decent notes! The final project, if it's like this year, will be in Python and a virtual Linux environment that you'll install on your computer, so there's your code portion. There are other, smaller coding tasks in some of the later homeworks, though, as well. If you're straight EE and don't know how to code, don't fret, the TA will help you learn what you need to learn. TL;DR Take this course if you're looking for a nice, more conceptual and chill EE elective about probably one of the most interesting and practical topics to date: the Internet. "
