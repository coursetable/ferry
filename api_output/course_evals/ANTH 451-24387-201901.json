            "\u00a0This class taught me so much about what it means to live in America. You become exposed to many marginal populations, and how they navigate American living. ",
            "\u00a0how to critically evaluate ethnographies, their themes, their shortcomings, and their policy solutions ",
            "\u00a0The class provides insights into several different topics that are relevant to women's health and intersectional feminist analysis. The course opens with a more general discussion, as well as a week covering the basics of intersectionality theory, and then is divided up by theme, covering the effects of things like geography, addiction, STD status, immigration status, and racism. Instead of writing normal papers, you write book reviews, which is actually really helpful to learn as I had never done it in any class at Yale. Furthermore, the book review structure (which talks about methodology, a few major themes, strengths/weaknesses, and intended audiences) is just really helpful for teaching you how to be an engaged reader of academic books. ",
            "\u00a0I gained insight into the fields of ethnography and anthropology, and practiced analyzing and critiquing texts. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to critically analyze ethnographic work and to understand and *apply* intersectionality theory. I gained a better understanding of social determinants of health through the numerous amazing books and wonderful discussions in this class. "

            "\u00a0This class is a gem. As described in the syllabus, it is \"a student-led feminist book group\" and it truly fulfills this promise. Each week students read a different medical ethnography about a different group of women in a different location in the US. A different student each week presents on the reading, prepares discussion questions, and facilitates the class with the guidance of Marcia. The readings are varied and fascinating, although time-consuming (and certainly do not plan on taking this course unless you plan to do all of them), and the reading responses are generally straightforward and relatively short. The discussions are though-provoking, and students in the class brought diverse perspectives that complemented the reading very well. As someone who is relatively new to anthropology, this class gave me a new appreciation for the field and gave me new ways to think about health and public health in the US. ",
            "\u00a0Marcia is incredible and the class size facilitates great discussion--it truly is basically a feminist book club. Highly recommend! ",
            "\u00a0Reading a book a week is a lot of work, but the books are generally good. The discussions are not not always engaging, and it is sometimes frustrating that a peer leads them rather than the professor. Also, the book reviews did not always feel generative but rather static. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: marcia is a great moderator\r\n\r\nweaknesses: too long; might have benefitted from other learning methods such as videos ",
            "\u00a0Professor Inhorn leads an insightful discussion section which doesn't shirk from critiquing works. Student-lead seminars were very high quality and interesting. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely - take this class if you have the opportunity (although you likely won't be able to unless you are a senior, WGSS or anthro major, or MPH student). ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are interested in the material! ",
            "\u00a0yes, if you're interested in ethnographies; if you're interested in seminars, look into others that might require less reading ",
            "\u00a0Anyone who is interested in feminist activism, anthropology, public health, or health policy should try their hardest to take this class! It is one of the favorites that I have taken at Yale. Marcia does such a brilliant job of structuring the course, facilitating discussions, and creating a sense of community within the class. Even though the subject matter is often heavy, everyone in the class approached discussions with such care and thoughtfulness that every class was a high point of my week. Marcia is one of the nicest professors that you will have at Yale, so don't miss out on this awesome class! ",
            "\u00a0The exposure that I gained to ethnographic research methods through this course was invaluable. I would (and have!) recommend this course to other students. ",
            "\u00a0This is an excellent class for anyone hoping to expand their understanding of women's health and who would like to learn about the meaning of \"intersectionality.\" ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think people from a variety of disciplines should take this course. It helps you understanding how one's personal circumstances impact their health and leads to fruitful discussions of policy and how to make a difference. "
