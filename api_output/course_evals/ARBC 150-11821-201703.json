            "\u00a0Skills: Reading mid length to long Arabic texts, discerning tone and style in modern Arabic literature, responding in writing to texts. Insights: vitality of contemporaryArabic literature ",
            "\u00a0My Arabic fluency in writing, reading, and speaking has improved tremendously throughout the semester. I never felt behind or lacking in my Arabic skills, as professor Elbousty does a perfect job making everyone feel welcome, knowing that some may be a bit ahead of others. He values any and all participation and your answers always feel welcome. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths are the literary readers amazing breadth of writers from every corner of the Arabic speaking world and Elboustys literary expertise and facilitation/encouragement of discussion. The TA sessions were just as fruitful as class.  I would have liked more instruction with styles of writing, more oratory practice, and to stick to Arabic all the time, like in immersion. ",
            "\u00a0Very fun and interesting course! Low stress, but if you want to gain anything out of it you should put in the required amount of work, which is not too much compared to other classes. You get what you put in. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this course. It was difficult at first because we all came from different backgrounds. Students who had not taken Yale Arabic before struggled initially with understanding the media vocabulary as they had no exposure to it. After ample practice, this became less difficult, but it would be nice to review such vocabulary early on in the course. I would make the same recommendation with literary vocabulary. Arabic literary analysis is very different from its English counterpart, and it would be very helpful to study some of the main terms and parameters of Arabic literature.\r\n\r\nRegardless, this is a fantastic course with an amazing professor. I learned substantial amounts in a short period of time. "

            "\u00a0Yes!!! It is an excellent introduction to contemporary Arabic literature and learning to write stylistically in Arabic by reading the craft. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Any student willing to learn Arabic and at an advanced level will appreciate the rigor and fascinating course material we discuss. "
