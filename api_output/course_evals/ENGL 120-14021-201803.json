            "\u00a0I found this course incredibly helpful for learning to write about myself. I have never had the opportunity to write creative essays but I feel that it was a critical learning experience even as a senior. Even though sometimes I hated the pressure to do revisions, I really appreciated learning how to improve my writing through multiple drafts. I thought it was important to be pushed to write a draft and then intensively review and improve it. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me find my voice through the work of other writers. Throughout your life, you read a lot of great literature  Shifra helps you elevate that appreciation to tangible growth in your writing. ",
            "\u00a0Learning to tell your own stories is a very valuable thing. Not only do you improve your writing through detailed feedback from your professor and peers, but it's a wonderful insight into yourself because most of the essays you are writing revolve around you. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to look for specific literary techniques rather than focusing on content; it took a while to train myself to focus on WHY an author used a metaphor, rather than the meaning of the metaphor itself, for example. It was also a great class to take first semester of my first year, as it was a good intro to seminar style discussion and the class definitely got more comfortable as the semester went on. That being said I think my writing improved more through practice and revision than from anything in particular I picked up from our readings. ",
            "\u00a0I read many wonderful texts and gained skills in how to analyze essay strategies to use in my own writing. I learned how to hone my writing voice and experiment with different types of writing. ",
            "\u00a0Developed stronger writing skills, became more succinct in communicating, and how to more logically construct arguments. ",
            "\u00a0- Simple writing is often better writing\r\n- To end an essay being \"of two minds\" is OK, as long as a clear tension is explored \r\n- The benefit of modeling my essays off of other essays ",
            "\u00a0Improved my writing skills considerably. ",
            "\u00a0This class definitely gave me an appreciation for the process behind writing essays, as well as taught me that a good personal essay can stem from any topic. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write modern nonfiction essays based on examples by various diverse authors and writers. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to discover my creative writing, get outside my writing comfort zone, play with different styles, and gained a wonderful mentor in the process. ",
            "\u00a0This class covers several strategies to essay writing. Each unit covers a different method of approaching writing: a story, an object, a place, a set of instructions, and a book. Most of class was discussion format about published essays we had read for homework. This class teaches you strategies to greatly improve writing and reading skills. "

            "\u00a0The strengths were certainly Shifra and her diligent effort to give every student serious individual attention. I thought the reading was so short and concise yet it accomplished its goal of giving students a model to learn from. Most classes at Yale I feel are oversaturated with unnecessary readings, so this was refreshing. The short readings allowed me to focus on the writing. Honestly, not many weaknesses. I think the grading was fair, but certainly harsher than most other intro Yale classes. For my first three years, I was dissuaded from taking this course because I knew the grading was harsh. I think I will probably get a B+ which is fair, but if I put the same amount of effort I put into this class in other classes, I almost certainly would have gotten an A. Just an observation. Who doesn't love grade inflation ! ? ",
            "\u00a0The course structure is great  the 5 essays are not too demanding in themselves and allow you to grow as a writer. There is a little over an hour's worth of reading for each class which is very enjoyable and helpful during class discussion (and necessary to help you grow!). Workshopping your essay can be an overwhelming experience; classmates give a lot of advice and it can be tough to decide to which pieces you should listen. ",
            "\u00a0This course was well organized. The readings were engaging, the conversation centered around writing and rarely strayed from that, and the essays flowed logically from one to the next (aka I liked the order). The only thing I would recommend is incorporating more student writing into the course. ",
            "\u00a0Weakness is that grading and feedback can be frustratingly vague, strengths are that we read so many amazing and diverse essays and I liked our prompts. Sharlins sections in particular undertook a research project in the Yale archives/manuscripts library to write an essay relating to Yales history, which was both difficult and very rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are how lively the class discussion is and the close and welcoming classroom environment created by the process of workshopping each others' essays. It was also wonderful to receive a lot of individual feedback from the professor on each paper. The class could be improved by more clear guidelines on how grading is completed for each essay. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very strong.  Shifra is amazing, the workshops are very helpful, and the essays we read are great guides.  The only thing I have to say is that the prompts felt somewhat limiting, but that was a minor inconvenience. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the closeness of the class, comforting and supportive class dynamic, workshops that challenge the writer, learner-centered environment ",
            "\u00a0Some strengths include a discussion-based class that provided a space for students to share their opinions. I also really enjoyed the workshop portion of the class because it was very helpful. I just wish there was more of a way to meet with the professor/get more detailed notes before the final turn-in. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were  the range of essays we read as examples, the feedback from classmates, and workshop days. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - Shifra is a kind, loving, dedicated teacher and mentor who cares more about her students than any teacher I have had. She is dedicated to one-on-one work, which is the most effective in my opinion, and cares about us beyond just the class. I loved that she brought us treats and invited us over to dinner, for instance; she seemed dedicated to making the class a community. She gave careful, constructive feedback that was never overly negative.\r\nWeaknesses - Her teaching style took a bit of time to adjust to. She was less clear than previous teachers in her expectations and preferred to have the class discussion lead itself. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are the depth of discussion and variety of essays we wrote and read. Every student was challenged, both by each other and by the material. It is also incredibly organized. \r\nThe downside to this class is that the grading scale is quite difficult. An A is defined as a piece to be nominated for a departmental prize. "

            "\u00a0I took this class as a senior because I needed a writing credit, and honestly was one of the best classes I took at Yale. No matter what your major is, I think E120 is one of the \"must-take\" classes at Yale. I will admit the grading is slightly more harsh than the average Yale humanities course (as in you may get an A- or B+ ... I know tragic) but honestly getting a flat A is pretty challenging. Nonetheless, I would really recommend this course, you will find it rewarding if your willing to spend a few hours every Sunday cranking out a short 4-5 page paper. Its all about you so you can write literally anything. ",
            "\u00a0English 120 is a really great course, and Shifra Sharlin is truly a fantastic professor. Don't take this course if you only want an A (they give out mostly A-'s and B+'s, but not a ton of As), but do take it if you want to come out with a solid grade and having improved tremendously as a writer. The readings were consistently interesting and our class discussions were incredibly engaging. Shifra, in particular, was wonderful. She consistently demonstrated that she cared about each of us as individualsshe even had our whole class over for dinner. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! The class absolutely brightened my day. Shifra leads a great discussion, asking solid questions without ever dominating the discussion. It will help you grow your awareness as a writer and allow you to reflect on your personal experiences. ",
            "\u00a0YES! If you can, take this class. I think everyone at Yale will benefit from it no matter what their major is. Every professor who teaches it is wonderful, so you can't go wrong, but if you have the opportunity, definitely take it with Shifra Sharlin. She is an absolute gem. The workload isn't awful, and the readings are so well picked and enjoyable that you'll WANT to go home and read them all in one sitting. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course if youre interested in creative nonfiction, i.e. writing about your own life and twisting it into social commentary. We read so many interesting and diverse essays and Shifra Sharlin is so wonderful and kind, even if a frustratingly vague sometimesyou have to push to get direct advice from her sometimes. She doesnt teach lessons directly, she waits for us to dig it up from the readings in our discussion, or tries to guide our discussion in that direction. This can feel frustrating in that someone might make a cool point but shell pass over it in an attempt to steer us in a different direction, but I understand why she does that and it makes class feel really organic and enlightening. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Shifra is a wonderful professor who truly cares about her students and their lives beyond the classroom and creates a really friendly classroom environment. I always looked forward to attending class and reading the wide variety of interesting essays we were assigned. If you are a great writer, you may not improve tremendously but will have the chance to practice your skills and write about a range of topics. If you are coming in as a less confident writer, you will probably improve significantly. ",
            "\u00a0Yes.  My writing improved greatly, and I think this is an important skill regardless of what a student chooses to study.  Other than that, it truly was an enjoyable class. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. My writing improved immensely and I enjoyed myself quite a bit. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Strongly believe that English 120 is a must-take course at Yale, regardless of your major / academic interests. Shifra was a wonderful professor, too, so I'd recommend taking with her if you can. ",
            "\u00a0Yes because it is a good overview of an English class, and I think many students would enjoy the ability to write about topics of their choice. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I personally had little experience writing nonfiction essays and I came away with some really great writing samples I can now use, as well as the skills useful for writing them. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I discovered so much about myself, my creative process, and became a more confident writer and thinker. And it only got better as the semester continued. Thank you so much Shifra! ",
            "\u00a0This is my favorite class to date. If you want to be challenged, read incredible essays, and have wonderful discussions, take this class. Please note, however, that you are writing a lot. There is almost always a paper or draft due each week. You have to put in a lot of work, but it is worth it. "
