            "\u00a0I developed the skills to evaluate and analyze literature, to write creatively, and to engage with texts in literary critique. ",
            "\u00a0I have acquired knowledge about Orientalism and how the west views the Arab world through the study of many literary works. I have also learned so much about the writing style of western authors and their literary strategies. "

            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the readings in this course. I think that the coursework was likely the best that I've seen in an undergraduate level course of its kind. Class engagement could have been at a higher level, but I understand that it is difficult for professors to manage that entirely on their own. A lot of that must come from the students themselves. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this course because it was a very well organized seminar with incredibly talented people. Professor Jonas made it very easy for us to engage with the topics as well as discuss with each other. He made us develop a strong passion for the topic throughout the weeks and made us very intrigued to learn more about the topic. The readings he assigned to us in class were extremely engaging, and he provided personal anecdotes with some of the authors which made it even more engaging. "

            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to other students! The amount of literature that we explored was great for the short time we spent together. I also think it's very important for students to engage with literature from Arab and North African writers. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend taking this class with Professor Jonas as not only the material of the class is extremely interesting, but the instructor is also very engaging. He knows so much about the topic and tries to answer as many of our questions as possible in class. If you are interested in Orientalism and literature, this class is for you! "
