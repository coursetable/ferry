            "\u00a0The breadth of material covered in this course is truly impressive, and I would say it has completely changed my perspective on death and ways of dying- as well as ways of living. On the first day Prof Radin said that she could have easily called the course something about living, and I think the material reflected that statement. It was some of the best reading I've had in a seminar at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Taking this class was very refreshing. Thanks to the variety of possibilities to express our ideas that was offered by Professor Radin, I feel that I have, for instance, learned to use such formats as blogpost to engage in the discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge of a variety of literatures and theoretical approaches. ",
            "\u00a0To expand the ways that I think about death and the ways that it is applicable to a range of fields, including history, history of science and medicine, geography, etc. To rethink negativity, absence, and inaction. ",
            "\u00a0I became much more familiar with the number of fields/disciplines that have sought to establish authoritative knowledge about life, death, life/death processes, and theories of finitude in multiple scales. It was fascinating to read how these concepts are taken up by different parties at different times. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the many aspects from which to consider death, degeneration, and decay. One of the major benefits of the course was the space to develop my own ideas, including critiques of academia. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The course was very strong. Sometime discussion was hard to get moving but I don't think it was because nobody cared, rather I think it was because some of the texts had some serious barriers to work through in order to speak on them usefully. Prof Radin was attentive to this. In the future I wouldn't change a thing. ",
            "\u00a0This course had an unusually heterodox reading list (both in terms of subject-matter covered and discipline), which I enjoyed for such a wide-ranging topic. It also meant quite a wide range of disciplines and experiences in terms participant make-up, which was also a plus.\r\n\r\nClass discussion was relatively free-floating, which had advantages and drawbacks. On the one hand, given the potentially fraught topics it was good for us to explore them collectively, and leave space for whatever form of discussion was warranted by that week. On the other it, it did mean less time for close reading of the texts themselves, which I sometimes missed.\r\n\r\nReally minor point: sometimes it was hard to get a head start on readings, because they were usually posted the week of. ",
            "\u00a0It was sometimes unclear what we were meant to get out of particular readings. Conversation tended to flag in these moments. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: A wide range of readings from various disciplines, and thoughtful engagement with negativity, broadening one's conception of death.\r\nCons: Sometimes a lack of understanding of the reading's historical positioning. Sometimes unaware of the grand trajectory or structure of the course taken from a historical lens. Sometimes a flimsy grounding in the ways death was approached in the history of philosophy and the philosophy canon. ",
            "\u00a0I wish that each class started with a discussion of the text that the largest number of students wrote about in their weekly response. This way, our conversation would foreground what was most exciting for the largest number of students, starting class with more robust participation so that everyone can build confidence and work their way towards the more difficult texts. ",
            "\u00a0A major strength of the course was the professor's enthusiasm for the topic and willingness to engage students at every level, especially when we didn't understand the material. One challenge of the course was its interdisciplinarity. I enjoy reading across the disciplines but I personally could have used more of an introduction to the different fields from which we were sampling. Nevertheless, each class resulted in a thought-provoking discussion that offered talking points beyond the classroom as well. One improvement would be to pare down the readings and go more in depth with a few of them. There was always so much interesting material to discuss and little time to do it in. "

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I thought it to be one of the best if not the best course I've taken in my time here. I would say that if you're prepared to be mentally dextrous and to really test your ways of thinking in engagement with the material, this course can offer you a whole new way to see life. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to any student regardless of the department they're in. There is a lot to learn for everyone. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, of course! ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend if the subject is interesting to you, even if you feel \"underqualified.\" As an undergraduate, I was, in fact, underqualified. In practice, this just meant that I learned a lot more per week than I would in a class I was \"qualified\" for. I never felt like I was drowning, but I never thought it was easy.\r\n\r\nThere was plenty of weekly work (so much reading!), all interesting in its way and rarely dry beyond belief (unusual for a seminar!). Said work was both interdisciplinary and intersectional. Written work is less daunting than one would expect from a grad class, but the writing isn't the point of this course. Your understanding isor at least should bewhat is important, as it clearly is what is most important to Prof. Radin.\r\n\r\nThis is a real seminar, not a glorified mini-lecture, so a lot of your experience will depend on your classmates. Prof. Radin does a good job of facilitating discussion but does not force it. This can lead to the dreaded Multi-Second Awkward Silence after someone has made a point to which no one has a direct response. (This was rare and correlated directly with how dry the reading being discussed was.) I'd prefer silence to someone pulling something out of thin air just to fill it, so this was fine by me. Your mileage may vary.\r\n\r\nProf. Radin is very understanding of those who would rather be attentive listeners than ever-active contributors. She encourages students from a slew of programs, so expect viewpoints on the material that you would, er, not expect. She's also just generally very understanding.\r\n\r\nI have no idea what my grade is in this course, but I don't care. I got a lot out of it. ",
            "\u00a0yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course's topic is broad enough to warrant students from a variety of disciplines to attend this course. This course also does a good job at easing students into the themes of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course for people from various fields looking to think differently about death, degeneration, and decay. There was ample space made to bring in (sometimes literally) things that are going on in life that relate to the topic. This made the course very relevant to daily life. "
