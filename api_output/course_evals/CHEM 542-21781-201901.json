            "\u00a0The key concepts that can been seen in various (and most) types of spectroscopy. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated the more classically inclined approach to topics in chemistry that are often thrown into the realm of quantum chemistry. While usually necessary to adequately describe the problem, it sometimes wastes intuition that we could have kept had we used a more classical approach. In this manner, this class helped me to get a more intuitive grasp on:\r\n\r\nangular momentum, spin-orbit coupling, the cause for the shapes of orbitals, electronic transitions, and especially electronic excitations.\r\n\r\nThis aspect of the class was sensational, as these are all topics I've covered before. It was refreshing to approach these topics from a different angle. ",
            "\u00a0Course material was really quite mind-blowing; really expanded the way I look at many aspects of physics/physical chemistry. Also, good deal of fundamental content that I'll definitely need to know. "

            "\u00a0It would have been nice to have the presentations posted before class more consistently. It was nice to be able to write notes right on this slides they corresponds. Other than that, the course was run very well. ",
            "\u00a0I would say the only weakness of the class was the clarity of the slides. They were usually fine, and worked well when guided by Mark, but they were inadequate/ insufficient labeling and descriptions on the slide to learn alone. This is not a huge issue, but it is an area I thought could be improved. ",
            "\u00a0Great course overall, only wish we could've covered even more material laid out in syllabus, but that is always a struggle in any class. Plus, glad we didn't rush through anything and understood what we learned. "

            "\u00a0YES! The class did with minimal stress on the students what others fail to do with much more pressure: impart a new manner of thinking about complicated issues in our field. Additionally, I would strongly recommend this class to both theorists and experimentalists. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely agree that this is essential course for any physical/theoretical chemist "
