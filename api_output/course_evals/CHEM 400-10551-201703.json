            "\u00a0This course provides the space to take a break from the routine study of an existing body of knowledge in the chemistry field. You get to realize that a lot of what we're learning in organic chemistry, for example, is knowledge that has emerged in the last 100 years and continues to be studied. It makes the learning of science feel more immersive and real, a perspective anyone who wishes to be a scientist must begin developing before they begin research. ",
            "\u00a0you learn a lot about current research in chemistry and what's going on at the various departmental seminars. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read and write chemistry papers, how to use Web of Science, and how to prepare to attend a chemistry lecture. I also learned several new chemical methods and techniques (such as EPR and cyclic voltammetry). Finally, I learned a lot from Prof. Parr about how chemists think and go about their work. "

            "\u00a0class was pretty cool in that you'll end up reading papers and learning about research that you'd probably never otherwise want to read about in your life. however class discussions could have been more directed / focused, e.g. by specifying which papers we should read beforehand instead of just having us go over a speaker's entire oeuvre (and it gets really fun when someone reads a paper you didn't and you have no idea what's happening in discussion, or when you're the only person who read a particular article). also would thus avoid the awkward silences when everyone's skimming and trying to make sense of an article no one read. ",
            "\u00a0Chem 400 was a very good classI enjoyed the lectures, I liked the class discussions that followed them, and most of all I enjoyed hearing Prof. Parrs thoughts on how the field of chemistry really works. The main suggestion I have is to cut down on the time we spend picking the lecturers and the pre-lecture discussions  I thought they werent quite as interesting as the discussions we had after watching each lecture. Perhaps we could start off with a lecture that occurs earlier in the year, or alternatively spend the first part of the class on something else (perhaps talking about the different subfields of chemistry, and some interesting topics of current research within each?) Also, I would recommend requiring the students to attend one or two of the lectures in person (perhaps the students assigned to present that lecture). They would get to see how watching a lecture in person is different from watching it on the computer, and would have the opportunity to ask questions. "

            "\u00a0Very interesting and fun ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Parr is great. This class is great. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class-its seminar format is nice, and we got to engage with very interesting and exciting material pertaining to contemporary chemistry. The workload is also very reasonable. ",
            "\u00a0senior requirement so you can't avoid it if you're doing the BA. pretty low workload, just 5 response papers and a paper at the end that's similar to the final paper for 251L if you took it WR. Parr is really smart and knows what he's doing and pretty funny and chill. just make sure to come to class prepared or at least having skimmed the papers and know what's going on. ",
            "\u00a0This class fulfills the senior requirement for pretty much everyone who takes it, so if youre reading this, you probably have to take the class. I will confess that I had a bad attitude about Chem 400 at first. I didnt think it was a real class and I was kind of annoyed that I had to take it. I didnt do much outside reading or bother to prepare for class. You might be able to get by like that since Prof. Parr isnt a very hard grader, but its no fun. Once I changed my attitude and started really trying, the class became much more interesting and meaningful. \r\n\r\nIn Chem 400, you watch five guest lectures hosted by the Yale chemistry department (in person if you can, but theyre also recorded) and discuss them in class. There are discussions both before and after the lectures. Before each lecture, I would recommend reading some of the speakers most recent papers (from this year or last) since they will usually discuss their current work. Talk about those papers in class. Then, when you watch the lecture, take good notes on it! Your notes will help you when you discuss it in class and write a paper on it. Most of all, though, try to have some fun! Prof. Parr is a great guy and can make class discussions entertaining, especially if you bring up the philosophy behind chemistry or how chemists think about their work. "
