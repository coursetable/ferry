            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about how to read literature and analyze texts in the context of which they were written. We explored the interplay between what a text wants to say, and how it goes about saying it. This definitely was outside of my comfort zone, but I think I learned a lot about textual analysis from this class and will be able to carry it into the future as I learn to be a more voracious reader in literature.

            "\u00a0You read (sometimes more) than a book a week from contemporary Japanese authors, covering a diverse range of issues such as the anxieties of the post-bubble generation, Okinawan and Zainichi literatures, gender, and sexuality. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to read and analyze literature both on its own and through the framework of various secondary readings. I improved my writing skills, and learned about Japanese thought and events after 1970 through the works we read. ",

            "\u00a0I thought this course was especially strong in allowing for student discussion to take precedent over the professor's lecturing, even if there were sometimes awkward silences before a student spoke up. I really liked that we were all able to build off each other's ideas, and I think some of the most interesting insights came from student thoughts. This is definitely not an inherent flaw of the class and perhaps something more systemic, but I thought that a larger class size or a few more talkative classmates would have generated even more thoughtful discussion. ",
            "\u00a0The course tackles really well both the study of individual authors and the study of historical influences. I've learnt a lot and have developed a more thorough understanding of the factors that make Japan as it is ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: At the pace of one book a week, you go through a ton of authors and you feel well-acquainted with the main issues that Japanese literature grapples with. Professor Poland is an excellent discussion leader and is very knowledgeable about the subject.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course definitely feels extremely fast at times. In some weeks, we would read an entire 200+ page novel only to spend one of our two sessions discussing it. I definitely think we should be using at least two days even if it sacrifices some secondary readings as it otherwise feels like our efforts to read the books, and the books themselves, were underutilized. One week on modern poetry would also have good. \r\n\r\nWhile I appreciate the aim of the midterm, I also felt it could have dealt more with the texts we've already studied up to that point. ",
            "\u00a0The assigned readings for this course were some of the best and most interesting I've read so far, and in my opinion, very appropriate works through which to approach the themes we were discussing, from questions of selfhood to the blurring of reality to the representation of climate change in literature. The weekly discussion posts were also a very useful way of reflecting on the works we were engaging with. I also thought that the assigned films in the first half of the course were important to our understanding of the role of literature or film as mediums for telling these stories.\r\nThe weaknesses of this course are that it was not very well organized in terms of assignments and class discussion. The deadlines for both the midterm and final papers were postponed, the first deadline change relayed to the class only a little over a week before the original due date. The discussion threads on Canvas were often published late, and in a few cases, not published at all (in which case even pushing the deadline for posting on the threads was an unfair solution because of the way students might plan their work for the rest of the week). During class, I felt like there was not enough time to discuss all of the themes or questions brought up, sometimes because of poor distribution of time between the instructor's introduction of the author and the context of the book (or film) and the actual class discussion.

            "\u00a0You should definitely take this class if you are interested in literature form! Rather than thinking of it as a class that strictly read Japanese literature, I thought of this class much more as an exploration of how to read literature in general, and I thought it was very useful to my growth as a reader and thinker. This ranged in questions explored, from \"What does it mean to be a minority and have a minority culture?\" to \"How can people write about experiences and be as true to the experience as possible while translating it into words?\" ",
            "\u00a0Yes, anyone who is interested in Japanese literature should take this course ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, this course will give you into a literature that is sometimes wholly different (your conception of Japan as the idyllic land of cherry blossoms gets very quickly disrupted), sometimes surprisingly similar than the ones you're used to. This course is like Directed Studies on crack (which is fantastic), in that you read the equivalent of both a book and concomitant secondary literature each week, and you learn a \"canon\" but over a much shorter time period, which is nice. ",
            "\u00a0For anyone interested in Japanese literature - yes! Interesting class, great readings and an engaging professor "
