A list of terms, definitions, and equations would have been very, very helpful. \r\n\r\nThe Wednesday 6-8 time slot was very challenging, especially in an underfilled large lecture hall. Its the sleepiest time of the week.... ",

Great for anyone not wanting to dive into a full accounting course but would like some appreciation of some basic accounting lingo and knowledge. "
