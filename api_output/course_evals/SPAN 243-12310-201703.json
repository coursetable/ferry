            "\u00a0Learned a lot about spanish grammar and how to speak/write correctly. Also learned a little bit of culture through the films and literature readings that we were assigned. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the more complicated aspects of Spanish grammar, including the subjunctive mood, where/when to use it, conditional statements, vocabulary, and so much more. This class really improved not only many Spanish grammar, but also my speaking, and writing. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about grammar and spanish, and I find myself able to apply what I have learned to speaking and writing (which was my goal for the class) ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me a great deal about Spanish grammar, and it involved lots of practice with writing and grammar-based excercises.\r\nAlthough I was hoping for more speaking-based practice, this course gave me a much better command of Spanish in general, and finer instincts when it comes to the nuances of grammar. ",
            "\u00a0The course gave me a broad overview of (almost all) the mechanics behind the Spanish language. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to form grammatically advanced Spanish sentences. ",
            "\u00a0My Spanish grammar did improve a lot after taking this course. I began to think twice about the way I wrote in Spanish and how I communicate with others when speaking Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0I learned some of the many, many intricacies of Spanish grammar to a degree that left me thinking, \"what is the point of this?\" at many points throughout the semester. Nevertheless, this class greatly helped me improve my writing and speaking in terms of fluency. It delivered on the advanced grammar it said it would deliver. ",
            "\u00a0I have a much better grasp of the Spanish grammatical structure ",
            "\u00a0Learned to speak Spanish more fluently. Enhanced my understanding of grammar topics. ",
            "\u00a0I placed in level 3, but because of departmental policy, I was made to take an L5 after scoring a 5 on the AP (my mum is Puerto Rican, so I know the present tense and a ton of vocabulary). Professor Seymour was the best in helping me try to catch up. In the first week, I self-studied the conditional and future tenses, and got a solid recap of the preterite v. imperfect. I was new to the subjunctive (I saw it briefly for a week 3 years prior), so I really did learn a lot about the subjunctive as that was the emphasis on the last two exams. The class moved at a very fast pace, so I found it hard to follow what was happening in class and thus had to do a lot of self study and office hours and meeting with my tutor, but for me that was because I had such a weak foundation. Really, taking this class will give you a huge skill set, and I wish I can take it again to solidify the grammar I didn't get as well the first time due to bad prior preparation. I kept the textbook so I can study the concepts again over the summer. I am really grateful to Professor Seymour for all her help learning the material in her class; I put in a lot of work, but I really couldn't have done it without her. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Covers material well, many different methods of learning (reading articles, movies, music, different learning exercise), the peer you get assigned to in Ecuador to practice conversations \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nThere is a lot of work, however this is not necessarily a weakness because it is probably necessary to gain a full understanding of the grammar concepts. ",
            "\u00a0The course was a lot of work which helped to review much of the material covered. I found the organization of the course a bit frustrating, only because the topics of our readings usually did not correspond with that day's homework. ",
            "\u00a0The class needs more long assignments and less short assignments. ",
            "\u00a0This was a very strong class that began first with the professor. She was always very engaged and dedicated to helping students. The classes were engaging and fun, and the workload was tough, but helped me learn a lot. Speaking to another student from Ecuador boosted my confidence in speaking Spanish a lot. Perhaps in the future, there could be more speaking/writing activities as groups in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- the material was presented in a very organized and easily understandable manner, the professor was extremely helpful, caring, passionate and high energy (which made the class enjoyable)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- it seemed that a lot of the homework assignments were busy work, although much of it did help in understanding the grammar ",
            "\u00a0This class focuses very intensely on grammar, giving students a good understanding of how to write and speak correctly in Spanish. It provides large amounts of practice, with good feedback and methods for learning how to apply the grammar rules that are covered in class. Overall, the course is very well structured and fosters a good learning environment.\r\n\r\nHowever, this course does give a large amount of work, and it can be difficult at times to keep up with the material in the class and the assignments. The pace of the class may throw off some students at first, who might find themselves having to study on their own more often than anticipated. I would have also liked more practice with speaking in addition to the four-week Skype partner program.\r\n\r\nOverall, Advanced Spanish Grammar is a challenging but rewarding class. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the class sessions. I felt it was the only time where I was most engaged and able to absorb the information well. On the other hand, the heavy homework load was a little unnecessary, as they mostly required too much memorization and repetition. I only wish there was more emphasis on the class sessions. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The class is designated L5, so it satisfies the foreign language distributional requirement. The course is very organized, so students know what is expected and when. Since class sections were small, Prof. Seymour interacted with every student and encouraged participation; as a result, I never felt drowsy. The lectures reinforce lessons from the textbook. Students are allowed to retake the online quizzes as many times as they want for full credit, and the correct answers are displayed after each attempt. Finally, exams are graded fairly.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course description says \"some English-to-Spanish translation,\" but that's an overstatement; Prof. Seymour rarely ever spoke in English, even when it could have helped. Grades are inflexible, and the course isn't curved. Worst of all, the amount of homework is unbearable; I had to keep this class because it satisfies the foreign language distributional requirement, so I was forced to drop a course for my prospective major. Not only does the quantity of homework diminish its value, but many of the assignments are unhelpful. For example, students were required to watch two Spanish movies (one of which was violent and disgusting), and the only grammatical benefit was that they provided topics for some of the worksheets. Students were also required to converse with Ecuadorian college students via video chat for an hour each week over four weeks near the end of the semester, after which we had to write reports about them. Fortunately Prof. Seymour provides topic ideas with suggested questions, but the conversations were not grammatically beneficial.\r\n\r\nThe course could be improved by addressing the weaknesses outlined above, especially by reducing the amount of homework. ",
            "\u00a0I honestly believe that the structure of this class was great. The homework and quizzes for this class were good practice of Spanish grammar. ",
            "\u00a0This class was very straightforward in teaching us advanced grammar topics that would have otherwise gone unnoticed and many times do go unnoticed in everyday life, but it also helped me avoid some grammatical blunders that would have made me appear foolish. I think the content of this class was of high quality, however there is a lot of class-to-class homework that requires a fair amount of time if done right. I also felt some of the readings and movies used to offer some context with the grammar we learned left me wanting more in terms of engagement. I realize this is just a grammar class so maybe asking to delve into a story or movie is leaving the scope of this class, but if that is the case, there is no point in making us read/watch these pieces. We could have just as well applied the grammar topics we learned to arbitrary pieces and saved a good chunk of time. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes the explanations as to why you use a certain verb tense in a specific example were very unclear and confusing. ",
            "\u00a0The course moved at a good pace. It thoroughly articulated each of the grammar concepts. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Seymour is well organized. She has a take-home practice exam that is the exact same length and format as the ones we saw, which was very helpful. She also gave a concepts sheet that listed the exact concepts and textbook pages we should focus our review on. I wish the powerpoint were more organized on canvas, but if you took notes in class, you should not have to ever go back to find the powerpoint. ",

            "\u00a0Take this class - its material itself isn't hard but there is a lot of work. It will help improve your Spanish and is a great L5 course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I really would recommend the class. It makes sure that you are well prepared to write and speak correctly and with confidence. The class focuses strictly on grammar and will ensure that you understand the rules and how to communicate. A must take if you are striving to become fluent. \r\n\r\nHeritage speakers would also benefit from the course because it really trains you to understand how the rules work and fixes the little errors in your speech/writing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - if you can deal with a few bad grades but really want to improve your Spanish, take this class. The workload can be a lot at times, but looking back on this class, I really improved my Spanish enormously after not speaking Spanish for 2.5 years. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially if you want to get better with high level grammar and writing (as well as understanding of the spanish language. There is quite a bit of homework, but the grading is quite fair and it is manageable as long as you don't start it late the night before. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it, especially to students who have placed into L5, but are perhaps less comfortable with Spanish than some of their peers. I went into this course after not having seriously spoken Spanish for more than a year and I felt I was able to recover my language skills quickly. The material is not too difficult, but it's important to invest the proper amount of time in it--the workload is solid but steady throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student only if they are truly interested in learning the finer points and nuances of Spanish grammar. Students who want more practice speaking, or learning how to improve their general fluency in Spanish might want to take another class instead. ",

            "\u00a0This class is best suited for a student that is dedicated to doing homework well for every class and is truly trying to improve their Spanish. This class goes in-depth to a lot of intricate details that may seem irrelevant for a student just trying to learn enough Spanish to get by on a vacation. But if you are really trying to learn how people talk, this is the class for you. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It is important to know how to use the correct grammar in any language. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to another student that enjoys memorization and learning about grammar topics in Spanish and less desire to learn about Spanish culture or literature. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely would recommend it. Take it if you are interested in learning to write better and have a more nuanced grammatical structure to your Spanish. Only take it if you genuinely want to improve your Spanish and will put in the corresponding work. For reference: I had the lowest score in the class on 2/3 exams, and the second lowest on the other one, and I still recommend it. ",
