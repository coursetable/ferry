Sometimes it was hard to keep up notetaking with the pace of the course, but only because I was really fascinated and wanted to get every single word down. I like how we got an excellent overview of texts throughout Ancient Egyptian history, while still involving enough detail that we could really engage with the texts and compare them, both with each other and with architecture and material culture. The assignments (such as the mini-essay for grad students) were especially effective for this. ",
