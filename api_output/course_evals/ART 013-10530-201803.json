            "\u00a0I was exposed to a wide range of art I probably never would have found on my own, and thought about weird metaphysical concepts that kind of shifted the way that I approached all of my other classes. ",
            "\u00a0The course definitely helped me understand more about art, especially architecture and buildings, from different parts of the world. We looked at some really interesting works and artists. ",
            "\u00a0This course focused on how humans interact with space and considering space as a societal construct in contrast to a strictly Cartesian view; taking this course was my first time studying art really intensively, and I found it interesting to see the different ways in which artists and philosophers considered space and how we interact with it. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to consider art from a viewpoint I had previously found intimidating because of its great depth and complexity. However, through this course, I learned how to consider space as something multifaceted and even emotional rather than purely a geometrical arrangement of an area. "

        [
            "\u00a0It kind of branched off of an interesting syllabus, but the content was still really interesting! We had really fun projects and it was super fun to see how differently people interpret creative assignments. ",
            "\u00a0This class was very self-directed. It's entirely conversation based, so if you engage with the readings and the assignments then it's a lot more fun. At times, I wish it had a bit more structure, but also I can't think of a single class where I wasn't actively participating in whatever Markus wanted to talk about that day. ",
            "\u00a0One of the strenghts of this course was that it had a very global perspective - we looked at spaces and art from around the world. The homework were also creative and fun to do. However, the readings were often a bit too heavy and difficult to understand. ",
            "\u00a0The course could be organized/structured better, and theres not much to hold you accountable for your work. I think I would have learned more under a little more pressure since it was so easy to skim/not really do a reading. That being said, Markus is an amazing professsor that really made the class. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated how freeform the course was; the homework and assignments were engaging and allowed for individual interpretation of assignments / interesting group discussion. Talking with Markus about his work and past experiences was also a lot of fun and a highlight of the course. I think having another major project halfway through the course (or starting the final project earlier) would have been cool, because we were only really able to get into the final project after the class had mostly finished, and I would have enjoyed being able to work with Markus on it more closely beyond the one meeting we had. ",
            "\u00a0This course is great for anyone regardless of previous exposure to art because it doesn't focus on a specific medium or skill but rather greatly explains the though processes behind various forms of art in relation to space. One improvement I would suggest is having more interactive assignments that involve hands on projects. There were a few we did over the course, and the reason I would suggest more is not because there was a lack of engagement with the readings (since there clearly was during class discussions), but I and other students agreed that we had so much fun and learned a lot with those assignments we would simply like more. "

            "\u00a0Totally! This class was really fun, and the Markus was so nice! He was so encouraging and always saw the best in our projects. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. Markus is the best. It was totally unlike everything else I took this semester and I always looked forward to it. Assignments would be things like reading Freud and then designing a wallpaper based on the concepts of the reading. I didn't have expectations coming into this class and it was strange and fun to figure out how it worked. ",
            "\u00a0I would but only if you have an interest in the field. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! Even without any previous experience studying art, I found the course engaging and was familiarized with a wide array of art styles I had previously been unaware of. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this to other students regardless of their intended major. While also being a nice introductory course for a type of artistic focus, this course also teaches students various methods of thinking that, while in this class apply to art, also can be applied to other areas of study.
