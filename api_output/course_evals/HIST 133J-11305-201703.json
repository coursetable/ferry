            "\u00a0I didn't come away from this class learning that much, but it wasn't a bad course. Professor Freeman line-edited our final papers, which was the best part of the class. ",
            "\u00a0This class was my first deep dive into early American history, and I really enjoyed being able to explore primary sources (and attempt to decipher 18th C handwriting) while being exposed to the critical thinking of other prominent historians in the field through interesting secondary readings. I definitely have a better understanding of the period and tensions at play, but also of the decisions and factors that shape how people today collectively remember and distort it. The research paper process was immersive and incredibly helpful as I start thinking about my thesis, and it felt like a great combination of support and independence. ",
            "\u00a0I greatly developed historical research, analysis, and writing skills. Additionally, I gained a much greater understanding of the political atmosphere of the early American republic. ",
            "\u00a0This class taught me to write a 20-page paper. Between Professor Freeman's line edits of the rough draft and her guidance throughout the research process, I can't think of a better class to have written my first expansive research paper in. ",
            "\u00a0The Creation of the American Politician was like a lot of history seminars: about a book per week, one large paper, and a small class size. However, our classes - and the semester at large - flew by. I appreciated the broad amount of material that Professor Freeman covered and that she tried to incorporate as many historical perspectives as possible - not just white men but other people too! ",
            "\u00a0In this course, I learned about the political culture of early America, and understood how certain assumptions I had about the period were not necessarily true. I also learned how to use the primary sources from this time period, and how to use them to write a historical argument. ",
            "\u00a0The main thing I learned in this class was how to write a research paper. The discussions are interesting but not particularly worthwhile. However, it's a great class to take in preparation for writing a thesis. I have a good understanding of how to gather sources and research a topic, and how to develop a single paper over the course of a semester. I also learned how to footnote, and how to research with primary sources, which are both valuable skills. ",
            "\u00a0Worked with primary sources, learned to read and incorporate these into an essay. ",
            "\u00a0Over the course of Professor Freeman's seminar, I learned how to look for patterns and meanings in primary sources, how to craft an original argument about a specific topic in early America, and how to critically engage with the work of historians, while still allowing the primary sources to speak for themselves. "

            "\u00a0Its a very chill workload besides the final paper (since there aren't any reading responses/other assignments), though I do worry about the grading because theres barely anything to base it on. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was great because it looked at a very specific historical period through a lens that started out broad and narrowed in on various nuances over the semester. I think it was very clear how all of the pieces fit together, if anything perhaps a little repetitive in that sense. I thought Prof. Freeman had fascinating things to say and did a great job getting all of us to engage with the materials and with each other in discussion. The paper process was very practical and rewarding, and didn't feel as stressful as I had originally anticipated it would. ",
            "\u00a0The way that research paper is spaced out throughout the semester makes it both more manageable and a great learning process. The readings were also great and gave the course a clear arc. It was just the right amount to have a rich 110-minute discussion without being too much to manage. Professor Freeman enriches the discussion with anecdotes from the period studied and created a positive class environment. The only thing that could have made this class better was if the research paper had been due during finals period instead of the final week of class. ",
            "\u00a0Thank you for having us do a rough draft on the paper (and for checking it over)! Writing the final draft was so much easier knowing that I didnt have to scramble to finish it. My main challenge in the course was simply not having a grade breakdown. Im not super grade-conscious, so sometimes I appreciated the flexibility, but not knowing how much the final paper was worth was also nerve-wracking (given that it was our only assignment!). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: We got extensive feedback on the prospectus and rough draft, so that we could incorporate all of that feedback into our final papers. Professor Freeman knows so much about the time period, and she always had entertaining and informative anecdotes to share in class. Visiting office hours was also extremely helpful and I always left feeling excited to get to work on my paper with the new ideas we had talked through.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Because there were few other assignments besides the small assignments planning for the paper, and the paper itself, it was difficult to get a sense of how I was doing in the class. Although we received extensive feedback on the draft, I do not have a sense of what my final grade will be based on. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this class is Professor Freeman - she is a gem. She line edits every single students rough draft, which is incredible. She is without a doubt the most knowledgeable professor in her field, and it was a wonderful experience to be in class with her. \r\n\r\nI think the major weakness of this class is the structure and organization. For starters, the only grade in the class comes from one research paper, which is intimidating. You do turn in a rough draft, but only two weeks before the final draft. I wish there had been more checkpoints - I know my paper would have been better if I had to turn in additional drafts, or an intro paragraph, etc. It is very difficult to work on a paper throughout the semester if there is nothing to turn in, because everyone will ignore the paper in order to tackle the work that does have to be turned in for other classes. Although I am happy with the paper I turned in, it's not my best work because it was hastily written in the last few weeks of the semester. \r\n\r\nI also wish that the discussions had been a bit more structured. It was nice that we could talk about what ever we wanted, but I do think they could have been more purposeful if they had been more directed. ",
            "\u00a0I loved that the entire course helped us build toward a final 25-page paper. I also loved how Professor Freeman took the time to meet with individually, as well as to line-edit our papers. However, while I appreciated the fact that there were only two major deadlines--the first draft and the final draft--as it enabled me to focus on the readings for the course and to research at my own pace, part of me wishes there had been more deadlines. In other words, I think I would have benefited from a deadline that required we have an introduction and an outline, or that we have ten pages of the essay, before the entire first draft was due. "

            "\u00a0Yeah it's pretty chill but still interesting, and also a preindustrial credit. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student for sure. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This course is excellent. If you are interested in American history, political history, or if you want to greatly improve your historical analysis and writing skills, then this is a great course to take! ",
            "\u00a0I can't think of a better set-up for a junior seminar. Professor Freeman walks you through the research process step-by-step and her passion for the material is contagious. ",
            "\u00a0If youre interested in early national America, this course is amazing. Its a great survey with a fantastic professor. I wasnt as passionate about the subject as some others in the room, so I wasnt particularly gung-ho about my final paper, for example. But Professor Freeman is very reasonable with students and works with us every step of the way - she makes it worth it! ",
            "\u00a0This course was a lot of fun, if you're interested in the time period! I really enjoyed it, but definitely underestimated the challenge of using primary source documents from this time period. Professor Freeman is wonderful and provides plenty of feedback for the final paper. ",
            "\u00a0I would say yes, but only because of Professor Freeman. She is fantastic, and everyone should take a class with her if possible. She puts more work into her class than most professors do.\r\n\r\nMake sure you pick a paper topic that interests you or you'll be miserable! If you don't think there will be a topic that interests you, don't take the class. Also, if it will bother you that the seminars themselves don't feel very worthwhile, you probably shouldn't take the class either. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student! Professor Freeman is unbelievably passionate about this time period, and in every seminar discussion she brings the cast of characters from early America to life. In addition, it is exciting to spend all semester building toward a final paper that has been thoroughly researched and carefully written. It is rare, in college, that one gets the opportunity to devote so much time to a single project, and even rarer that one has someone such as Professor Freeman take the time and energy to guide each student in the seminar through the process step by step. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely recommend - interesting subject matter with a great professor. "
