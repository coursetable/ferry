            "\u00a0I learned how to think in this class.  I learned how to encounter a material text and unpack its every details to reveal more about its context and the culture which produced it. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a new experience for me. Working with the books and manuscripts in Beinecke was a little overwhelming at first, as the class progressed I started to feel more comfortable working with and handling the materials. I thought that the weekly assignments were very challenging, but extremely effective for deeply engaging with the materials. "

            "\u00a0This is a fascinating course about some of the unexpected and intertwined histories of printing and manuscript. Peter Stallybrass has unbridled energy and knows so much; it is a joy to learn from him. At times the class discussion could meander a bit, but for a crash course in thinking about material texts, this class is a great way to work with one of the most influential and inventive book historians around today. ",
            "\u00a0Yes.  This is a marvelous class and suits a student willing to explore beyond their own period or specification. ",
            "\u00a0It was such a privilege to have access to Beinecke's vast resources. I enjoyed looking at different materials every class, and being a part of the discussion each week. "
