            "\u00a0I did learn how to think about grand strategy and how to consider grand strategy in the context of my own life. Though I think the scope of the course is far too wide to reasonably fit within one semester (and specifically in one 75-minute seminar per week), I gained exposure to a ton of great works from different disciplines and different time periods. I also found the dinners and the rest of the programmatic aspects of Grand Strategy to be really fantastic. ",

            "\u00a0I developed more empathy for leaders and the difficulties they face in making decisions. I also learned to think more broadly about the environment in which decisions are made, and to ask myself under what conditions attaining a goal is possible. We covered historical examples of strategic decisions starting from ancient Greece and read the foundational texts that led to the creation of Grand Strategy as a field and skillset. ",

I also learned much about the paradigms of theory versus application, and the overall difficulty of the execution of GS. ",

What are alternatives to war? What is a politician's primary role?) and because the course selects students from different programs and majors, we were able to have conversations in seminar informed by many different perspectives. Asking these questions helped me frame things I learned in other courses throughout the semester. "

            "\u00a0This course tries to do too much in too little time. There was not sufficient time for us to explore really any of the readings we did, and there were too many readings to reasonably complete. Sometimes we'd have upwards of 300 pages of reading per week, which is frankly unreasonable. I was in 5.5 credits this semester and definitely did not have enough time to complete all of the reading. It's hard for me to figure out whether the professors actually expected us to do all of the reading, but I think it would be much more effective for them to select fewer key parts of books than assign us entire books to read. I estimate that less than 10% of the students actually completed the reading, and many students were so overwhelmed by not knowing what to prioritize that they simply did almost none of the reading. We also had no way going into the seminar each week of knowing what was actually the most important, so I felt like I was always throwing darts at a dart board trying to pick and choose the right things, and honestly I almost always chose wrong. I think that the syllabus is pretty good, but I think we'd benefit a lot more from taking the works slower and actually delving into them more deeply. I feel like I got a very shallow understanding of a LOT of things, but I didn't understand anything fully. I understand that this is somewhat inevitable when trying to paint a broad historical picture, but this wasn't done as well as it could've been. \r\n\r\nI will say, though, that the programmatic elements of Grand Strategy really are quite good. The speaker events and dinners are really special, and our summer research project is also amazing. I think the class itself wasn't that good, even though the professors are absolutely brilliant, but the program itself is quite strong. ",
            "\u00a0They changed the structure this year a bit, and I think it worked pretty well (I, obviously, did not experience the previous structures). I enjoyed the Monday lectures, but my biggest suggestion would be around the Wednesday seminars. They're just too short. 75 minutes is not enough time to adequately discuss the material. I'm not sure if the program could have a 75 minute lecture on Monday and a longer seminar on Wednesday, but it would dramatically improve the classroom experience, in my opinion. I also wonder if switching professors week to week might be good. There's definitely a lot of value in having a main professor and forging a closer relationship with them, but at the same time I regret that I never got to really know the other professor, and vice versa. ",
            "\u00a0Both the lectures and discussion sections are strengths and weaknesses. The discussion sections could be improved by dicing directly into the material being discussed. All the summaries should be done on Monday. They could also be improved by alternating the section leaders since Gage and Garsten have very different styles of teaching and students would benefit from having both. The lectures are especially great with several professors speaking. The variety of lecturers and professors needs to improved, the weeks that they brought other professors for specific topics were excellent. The semester started with professors presenting conflicting opinions on a topic-this was great since it made us think deeply about the different sides. However, with the end, the discussions became too homogeneous and the professors just kept adding to each other not challenging each other. Additionally, the weeks on social movements, the class kept going to US government. It doesn't have to. Sometimes, the discussion sections would be improved highly if the students were allowed to guide the discussion a bit. Also, is common sense really the definition of Grand Strategy. ",
            "\u00a0Check the reviews for the fall ",
            "\u00a0The course readings were enlightening but the amount of reading was sometimes overwhelming. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the alternating lecture and seminar format, but I wish we had longer to discuss the substantial reading load each week. This could be done by having to seminar sessions and one lecture session. Lectures were good, but at times they felt more like summaries of the texts and the discussion of previous weeks rather than an opportunity to offer new insights and pose new questions. ",
            "\u00a0I don't know if the professors have a very clear vision about how they want the new version of the program to work. Comparing and contrasting the various \"grand strategies\" for creating social change or military strategy is a tenuous connection to draw between the historical figures and events the course examines. I'm not sure if it's always that fruitful of a project. It is a strong program overall, though, and makes you think about both your career and history in a different light. \r\n\r\nThe course packet is badly laid out, and should be better formatted (some typefaces are far too large, and others too small). It should be printed in multiple smaller sections.\r\n\r\nGrading should be done more clearly. Grades on past assignments should be inputted to Canvas. ",
            "\u00a0It was incredibly poorly organized this year- grading, dinners, responses to administrative questions. I think the saving grace of the course was the pre-existing structure. I found the class to be less about learning and more about being Grand Strategy- I thought Garsten had a great balance between the two and could guide this aspect of the course much better. It would also be great to receive regular feedback ",
            "\u00a0The breadth and inclusion of newly-defined \"grand strategic\" historical events is important, but the syllabus is currently crowded and it might be worth focusing on fewer texts. ",
            "\u00a0This course had way too much reading. I would have done more of it if there was less. ",
            "\u00a0This course packs a lot into one semester--the combination of lecture and seminar, additional guest lectures, dinners and events that happen outside of class--and though it can be overwhelming sometimes, it is for the most part a huge benefit to the learning experience. I really appreciated the combination of lecture and seminar, as it allowed for a better opportunity to discuss the readings assigned each week. One idea could be the switching of professors teaching sections, so that students get a sense of both professors, and a good mix of teaching styles. ",
            "\u00a0I honestly feel like I learned very little political theoretically. There was also too much reading for the type shallow class discussions that were had. Professor Gage was really engaging so it definitely wasn't her fault, but I do wish there were other assignments or discussions that better integrated more specific rather than general themes. I do wonder what difference each of the sections was experiencing since Professor Garsten, a political theorist was teaching the other one. \r\n\r\nAll three of the professors worked exceptionally well together and complemented one another in areas of expertise. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very history oriented. We spent most of the time studying the cold war. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were amazing, especially when the professors disagreed with each other. I think discussion could be improved; sometimes it felt like students were just spouting something and then someone else would say something unrelated. If people listened to each other more rather than just saying something to say something it would be a more valuable discussion. Another improvement would be feedback! We got virtually no feedback on our graded writing, and the professors were extremely hard to organize a meeting with. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the lecture + seminar format of this class. I felt that the lectures gave a good framework for analyzing the key themes of the readings and provided students with a more focused lens for discussing them. This was particularly useful for the earlier \"classics\" readings like Thucydides. Needless to say the missing seminars on terrorism and Alinksy was disappointing, but beyond the control of the faculty. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the students are great. Weed out the snakes, and then you have some excellent -- of course highly ambitious, but it's only a matter of degrees at this school -- and really interesting people with diverse interests and experience. Everyone's essentially interested in working in policy from some angle so thinks about important issues in thoughtful ways. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the course is more of an experience than a course. Intellectually, the project is strange -- you're not really sure what the discipline is or how you're supposed to read things or think about them or write about them (or at least I wasn't). The lectures are fragmented and quite hit-or-miss. Sometimes, they were amazing -- captivating, insightful. Sometimes it was very random and so self-referential: \"strategy, strategy, strategy...\" without really being self-aware. I don't think it's the evil neo-con project it's made out to be on campus but I'm also not sure what it has become or what it is in the process of becoming. ",
            "\u00a0I'd say the biggest strength of the course is that it's multidimensional. We did readings and papers like in typical courses, but then also have the great privilege of receiving generous funding to pursue a summer research project, which obviously adds an infinite amount to the learning experience. Then, next semester we'll be placed in smaller modules that will allow us to focus on specific questions that emerged from last semester. We're also invited to speaker sessions and dinners throughout both semesters, that are great because we get to hear directly from \"pracitioners\" who have experience in organizing and politics. I'm grateful to have access to these different opportunities.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, this course suffers from American, European-centric tunnel vision. I had heard critiques of this program before I started, but was told that the program was evolving to be more expansive and generally progressive. However, the syllabus did not reflect this. I wouldn't be so critical if this course had been advertised more as a class about high level U.S. politics or the evolution of American political theory, but this is not the sense that I got when shopping the course. Our syllabus was almost entirely male, and almost entirely made of up U.S. or European authors. This feels wrong to me, seeing as we were analyzing things like the Vietnam War and U.S. containment policies during the Cold War, which HEAVILY impacted countries all over the developing world, leading to destabilization of political regimes, some of them democratically elected, and leading to political violence that exists until today. I felt that when I tried to bring this up in class, it was treated more as collatoral damage than something to be seriously considered. I think if we had been made to read anything on the syllabus by authors from other parts of the world, the conversation would have been more balanced. "

            "\u00a0If you get into the class, I'd say do it just because it's a really cool opportunity. I think the people you'll be able to hear from and learn from are really incredible, and the instructors are clearly very talented. I think they're working with an outdated syllabus that is too expansive to actually learn from, and I know that Beverly Gage is notorious for assigning exorbitant amounts of reading in her classes, so I'd really recommend that they change that. I don't want to be too harsh because I know how hard everyone has worked to make this program happen, but frankly, students aren't doing the readings because there's too much. That's the reality, and it's not going to change, so if the instructors actually want the class to engage with the content, they need to scale it back. ",
            "\u00a0If you get in, take it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Take it. Before that, educate yourself about what you are getting into first. If you want to learn about US Government Grand Strategy and it's applications, you'll love this course. It's perfectly molded for you. For other interest areas, be careful. The social movements parts that were added are poorly developed and the discussions regarding the social movements often revolve back to US government actions. You'll learn a lot either way. ",
            "\u00a0Impossible to say since there's another half of the course left. Check back in a semester ",
            "\u00a0I would. The dinner discussions are invaluable, as is the opportunity to think seriously about individual professional and life plans. The course forces you to move away from a disconnected and idealized perspective and into one where constraints to your aspirations are real. ",
            "\u00a0To an extent ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course because the set of questions and materials are well organized and unlike any other Yale class. Hopefully the execution of the course itself would improve. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's an all-encompassing, worthwhile experience. ",
            "\u00a0If you can get in- take it! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Although this course is a lot of work, the opportunities it provides are worth it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because I truly learned a lot from this course, and took a lot away from it. Though the workload and time commitment of this class is significant, it is definitely worth it because of the opportunities it provides, as well as the quality of discussion held in section. ",
            "\u00a0It depends on what they're trying to learn. For a course that claimed to be political theoretical, it was lacking that. But for a course about Grand Strategy, which is quasi-political theory and more empirically rooted in ex post facto analysis...It was that. Perhaps this was my fault in having different expectations. ",
            "\u00a0yes. The readings are important for anyone considering a career in policy making ",
            "\u00a0I'm not sure I would. Do it to think about yourself, and your goals, and how you might want to get there. Do it to meet interesting people and have nice dinners and have money to do random unstructured research. Do it also to be around brilliant professors -- Gage and Garsten are among the best. When the stars align in the lecture hall or in seminar it can be exceptional but it is not consistently so. \r\n\r\nDon't do it to have a meaningful intellectual/academic experience in a particular field; don't look for that here. It's not your usual upper-level, departmental seminar where you're learning how to think in a particular academic way. It's the opposite of that -- it's trying to think outside the academy in ways that would be helpful, essentially, in high-level positions. Be sure you want that and that this course is worth the opportunity cost. ",
            "\u00a0For the confluence of opportunities that it provides, I would reccomend this course to people friends who are interested in policy-making. But I would surely warn them about the fact that they might experience similar frustrations as I did about how the course is not, as it is advertised, simply about how to accomplish big things with small means, or about how to accomplish the changes we want to make in the world. The first semester is largely about analyzing U.S. foreign policy, and not from what I would call the most critical perspective. "
