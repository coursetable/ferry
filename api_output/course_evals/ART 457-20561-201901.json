            "\u00a0It was a re-learning of a skill set that I had not practiced in awhile. Silkscreen printing, and also photoshop and other adobe suite programs. ",
            "\u00a0I had no initial experience with screen printing, and by the end of this course I felt much more comfortable with the process. The hardest part was adapting to using Illustrator, but the instructor was very helpful in aiding/guiding students in the right direction. I walked out of this class with about two pieces that I'm quite proud of. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to screen print, but also how to screen print successfully and aesthetically. "

            "\u00a0The course could have been more rigorous in driving students to work on more projects throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated that the instructor was open to just about any type of printing the student was interested in, and was willing to help them obtain the supplies needed and learn new techniques. While this is not an explicit weakness of the course, printmaking is a time consuming process and it is hard to get a comprehensive understanding in such a short period of time - there are so few iterations that it is hard to markedly improve over the course, but you will still feel that you have learned a large amount.

            "\u00a0Yes absolutely! The printshop is a great space to work and Alexander is a great resource in printmaking. ",
            "\u00a0If you would like to learn more not only about screen-printing, but also the power of communication via print, I would absolutely take this course. The workload was manageable (even without any prior experience), the class was small and tight-knit (which made for a really fun, relaxed environment), and it's nice to not have to worry about anything other than making art for approx. 2 hours. This may not be as high reward as a drawing class where you churn out something new every other class or so; screen-printing is time consuming and it may take weeks to see a finished piece, so you should have a long-run reward mentality going into it. All in all, I really enjoyed this class, and it's a fun, niche skill you probably won't get the chance to learn elsewhere. "
