            "\u00a0For me, this course was an opportunity to learn to read again--which is maybe the best thing an 'English Lit' course can offer a student.  Perhaps because the course was organized around \"reading,\" \"attention,\" and \"distraction,\" each week's readings brought a renewed opportunity to become acutely aware of my own reading practices; there was an interesting self-reflexive demand to consider my own reactions--attentive or distracted--to texts that had thematic or analytics of those same modes of consciousness.  Reading texts that covered a broad swath of time and tracking different historical and cultural frameworks for what could otherwise appear programmatic 'features' of readerly consciousness was also valuable.  In my own case, I want to add a note of gratitude for how much I learned from listening to the other students in the course; the breadth of the readings was matched with a breadth of interests and expertise(s) among the students in the room, and I was always humbled and fascinated to hear the way others had approached, appreciated, or interrogated the week's texts. ",
            "\u00a0This course was devoted to close reading in a what that was not familiar to me before the class. The class was extremely critical and insightful, but open. It was an experiment, so it was not always clear what the take-home message was on any given day, but there was always valuable discussion and l often walked away considering something I had not previously. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this class did a really good job imparting knowledge and schools on at least three levels. First of all, it demonstrated how one might go about engaging theoretically and methodologically with ongoing debates in the discipline. This involved usefully historicizing our own moment, by situating it within a larger constellation of texts. To that end, and secondly, it provided a nice introduction to the mode of genealogical scholarship. This furnished plenty of occasions to deal with rich and important texts that wouldn't typically find a common home on a single syllabus, and it also, at least for me, drove home the point that historicist scholarship can operate at different scales, putting Thoreau (say) not only in the context of 19th century social and educational movements, but also in the context of a discourse reaching back to antiquity. Lastly, the class taught us a lot about Thoreau--above all, that he is inexhaustible. ",
            "\u00a0The class was helpful in thinking conceptually--how you construct an argument that is not based on a specific historical period but one that draws on longstanding debates and anxieties. ",
            "\u00a0This course offered me the opportunity to familiarize myself with a large amount of influential critical theory that I had not previously been exposed to or discussed, at least not to the same extent and depth. It also made me more aware of my own critical approach to texts. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to think more in-depth about the critical humanities, and the kinds of questions that are being asked within the discipline. This course also introduced me to important theories regarding reading, attention, and teaching, and how they tie into the larger framework of literature and the humanities at large. "

            "\u00a0The strengths were manifold.  I'll pick one potential point for improvement because it's easier to isolate: there was a kind of 'sub-theme' in the course that tracked the secularization of 'attention and distraction,' and I think that this angle deserves fore-fronting in some later iteration of the course or a similar course.  The opportunity to identify and/or debate metamorphoses of so-called 'devotional' reading as specific 'turns' to the therapeutic, for example, or 'turns' to inattentive ideals for reading in a way that tracked and questioned a particular arc would be interesting.  I think we accomplished this to a great degree. . . perhaps ending with (so to speak) close attention to Thoreau's *Walden* makes me wish that I had a more definite sense of where I think that work lies in a history of the secularization of attention/distraction?  \r\n\r\nAt the same time, I really liked the fact that each week was its own reading 'event,' and that I found my own stances on the course's guiding thematics shifting from week to week on the basis of the texts we were comparing in isolation.  So perhaps my suggestion for improvement is moot. ",
            "\u00a0I would have like to read more fiction ",
            "\u00a0In addition to the strengths mentioned above, this class did a very good job working with different genres, and showing how different genres yield up different insights about the subject of attention. It also helpfully exposed us to a lot of important critical theory and to a lot of recent scholarly engagements with it. \r\n\r\nAs for weaknesses, I don't know if this was exactly one, but I did notice a curious thing at the end of the semester. A huge percentage of the class wrote about fiction, even though that was probably the only genre we didn't actually cover (unless I'm forgetting something). This is perhaps not so surprising, since \"the novel\" has become central to the discourse about \"deep attention\" and immersive reading in literary studies. The novel was also a primary point of focus in the texts we read by Heather Love, Eve Sedgwick, and Fredric Jameson. I'm not sure if future iterations of this class should try out fiction or not -- but I personally would have been eager to try out that experiment, too. ",
            "\u00a0The strength and weakness of this class was the same: we focused on the same concept every week of the course, investigating the idea of attention and distraction over a wide range of historical material. On one hand, we learned about many different things and explored a concept in depth. On the other, at times it seemed as though we had ran out of things to say about distraction/attention, and the breadth of material made it feel as though we were skating over historical details. I think these issues are inevitable with a course designed in this way, however. ",
            "\u00a0The readings that Professor Smith has selected and combined are a great strength of this course. I especially enjoyed the thoughtful and insightful pairings of poetry with critical theory texts, as well as the fact that Thoreau infused so much of our discussion without ever overwhelming it or becoming the sole focus of the class. The syllabus is incredibly well balanced, varied, and interesting. I also found that the seminar-style approach to these texts was particularly helpful for developing my thoughts about them. ",
            "\u00a0The readings were excellent -- they were wide-ranging and diverse, but the way that they were organized in such a way that the readings spoke to each other across the different weeks/themes. I also enjoyed having visitors whose works we read, and having the opportunity to discuss with them some of the ideas that we've been thinking about in the course, and how their works engage with these ideas.

            "\u00a0I recommended Professor Smith's courses to many of my friends who will still be at Yale next year.  As I said, I felt that this course was an opportunity to re-learn how to read--an opportunity that I think everyone who reads should take as often as possible.  The course also presented a really interesting face of 'American Literature' to me, and--maybe most of all--it brought me from being someone who had previously thought of Thoreau as a kind of cut-rate boyish Emerson and, yeah, generally a 'Boy's Own' kind of thinker, to a completely different assessment.  Reading Thoreau with Professor Smith was a distinct 'conversion' experience for me--and, as I said of 'learning to read again,' I think that one should take every opportunity for a 'conversion' that comes one's way. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I am very in favor of experimental class designs and I think Caleb handled it extremely well ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this class to any student with an interest in Thoreau, in current methodological debates in literary studies, or in the theoretical challenges of genealogical research. I would also recommend it to anyone interested in the function literary studies has begun to occupy  within the political economy of cognitive capitalism. I think I would simply note that the class from beginning to end felt like an experiment, and thus had all the benefits and limits of an experiment. ",
            "\u00a0The class was really interesting--my only hesitation would be that this course does not really fit in any specific historical period, so if someone is looking for a class that has a more traditional set of texts this might not be for them. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student, because it encourages a fresh new prospective on texts that students of english literature are often required to read but not encouraged to think about it new ways, and because Professor Smith is a pleasure to be taught by. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great class to think outside of the box, in the sense that you get the chance to step outside of what you're used to -- I've never really been in a course that engaged metacognitively about the nature of reading, learning, and thinking. This course tackles this topic in diverse lenses and scopes: psychology, education, sociology, aesthetics, etc. "
