            "\u00a0I gained a very detailed insight into how complex and rigorous psychological research can be. I got the chance to work alongside a great team and learned much about emotional regulation strategies and different methods for assessing them. ",
            "\u00a0This course I was essentially continuing the work I have done on a study in the ARC lab and specifically applying one aspect of that to the first semester of my thesis. In doing so, I definitely became more involved in the aspects of the lab and was paying closer attention to the study itself as well as gaining skills needed to analyze/interpret data. ",
            "\u00a0I have learned an incredible amount through this opportunity to conduct independent research! From the initial literature review, to choosing the measures, and finally to designing and implementing the protocol, I have had a chance to see an entirely new side of research. I now have a much better understanding of the research process, and I am extremely grateful for this opportunity! ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much in this course - it was individual research so I got hands-on experience working in a lab and learned so much from one-on-one time with my advisor. ",
            "\u00a0It was great working with Professors Brackett and Seppala ",
            "\u00a0Over the course of my semester long senior project, I learned how to think analytically about data and was engrained with the importance of details when managing research. I hope to continue to live into the thorough and passionate culture of the clark relationship lab in my final semester. ",
            "\u00a0I learned hands-on the skills of experimental design, creative problem-solving, and subject recruitment. I was able to continue developing my data analysis skills with real-life data, which was an exciting and rewarding challenge. "

        [
            "\u00a0I have nothing poor to say about Dr. Joormann's lab. The lab meetings are very engaging and the hands on, open atmosphere of the lab is great for developing at ones own pace. ",
            "\u00a0The senior project allows for an immense degree of flexibility so that each student's project matches her interests. This is an amazing opportunity to work closely with Yale's wonderful professors. It can be a bit tricky to understand the requirements, but Dr. Ahn's regular emails make sure that everyone is on track. ",
            "\u00a0This course is what you make out of it. It is very strong because I learned so much being one-on-one with my advisor and actually having the opportunity to work in the lab. ",
            "\u00a0You can push yourself as much as you want! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the invitation to take ownership over my own project and studies; the organization of deadlines and structural rubric for each part of my final essay  \r\nWeaknesses: the lack of feedback on my writing ",
            "\u00a0This course is well-designed to facilitate students taking initiative with their independent research while still have significant guidance from their advisors, and this balance is a huge strength of the course. "

        [
            "\u00a0If you get the chance to work in a lab during your time here, work in Dr. Joormann's. You won't regret it. ",
            "\u00a0Of course, if you want to pursue a B.S. in the psychology/neuroscience department I highly recommend finding a lab to work in. It gives a hands-on approach that seminars just can't offer and I got so lucky with how amazing the group of people I work with is. I have been exposed to not only what its like to work in a lab but many aspects of post-grad and professional life in the field, which is something that you can't take away from any other class here. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This has been a truly unique opportunity that has been one of the highlights of my senior year. I would highly recommend this to all Psych majors! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course because I learned so much and had the opportunity to explore topics that I'm interested in. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0Yes--this class is a great capstone to the psychology major and a way to experience the field and the research process more independently. PSYC 499 was the psychology class that allowed me to fine-tune skills that I anticipate will be most valuable after college. I appreciated being given the space and time for independent exploration. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in getting hands-on experience of designing and running a psychology experiment, then I would absolutely recommend this course. You have significant freedom in designing an experiment that aligns with your interests, and you also have a say in your checkpoints and evaluations, which is helpful for tailoring it to your own needs.
