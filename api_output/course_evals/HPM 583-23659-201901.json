The format of this class should change from being lecture-based to lab-based and allowing you to practice the methods in a smaller, more focused environment. The large lecture hall setting doesn't work with presentation of such technical material. ",

It provides a strong foundation in health services research for those who wish to explore this topic further and equips students who do not wish to pursue health services research to understand the evidence base to craft better informed policy recommendations. I had limited confidence in this topic area prior to taking this course, and while I do not anticipate I will pursue a career in research, I feel well equipped to understand this topic area. Specifically, I appreciated the logical progression of course topics which built on one another. In addition, the assessments made a lot of sense and I could see how they helped to build my skills in this area. The assessments were very reasonable and clearly measured mastery of the material. Lastly, each lecture contained a broad set of examples that illustrated how these concepts were applied, \"in the real world,\" which was extremely helpful to understand the material, recognize these research practices, and better understand health services research overall. The only weakness of the course was the timing-- 5:00pm on a Monday meant that students were generally tired and paid less attention and attendance was usually pretty low. ",

Quizzes were timed in a way that considered our mental health, and were a bit offset from other classes.  Final project allowed us to practice what we learned in a real way.  Satisfying course. ",

Prior to this class, I was pretty uncomfortable with doing anything quantitative and I didn't really want to learn more about coding but after this class, I feel like I'm pretty comfortable with Stata and look forward to learning more in this realm. I think that this class does a good job at teaching us how to use our preferred coding language (whether it's SAS or Stata). I think this class was also great for teaching us the methods to determine causality that we will interact with a lot in the future, especially those of us pursuing PhDs or going into more research. Overall, great class! Only downside of the class was that it was set for 5-7 pm: I think this was too late just because the material can be slightly not exciting all the time so an earlier time would help a lot! ",

While these methods were taught in an econometric context, I think they are applicable to other disciplines, including epidemiology. I enjoyed working on a group project, but I wish there were first draft and second draft deadlines for students to receive feedback from the instructors as opposed to getting most of them during the group presentations. There should also be a rubric for students to know what was expected of them. We just came in doing what we thought was appropriate and expected, but our assumptions aren't always correct. Nevertheless, exams were straightforward, and it is clear that the teaching team wanted students to do well! Overall, I had a positive experience in the course. ",
            "\u00a0Please assign groups next time. My friends signed up to be in the same group and it was extremely stressful as one member decided to take a back seat because we were all his friends and did not contribute until the very end, putting more work on everyone else's plate who had already completed their portion weeks in advance. If we had not been friends, they would likely not have done that. And this happened in multiple groups. ",

The labs were graded harshly with few corrections, which also led to me not learning much.  Overall, it was pretty pointless for me to take this class and I didn't learn really anything new of note.

Earlier assignments might be a bit challenging for someone who does not have more intensive training in SAS, but it's definitely manageable to pick up the codes in a few weeks! The material is applied and assignments are meant to give you practical skills. ",
            "\u00a0It's a great introduction to health econometrics and SAS if you haven't had experience in them before. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot in this course and would highly recommend it to a student. I would also recommend taking anything that Professor Chen teaches. He is a great professor and I hope to be able to take more classes with him next year! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to all YSPH students. ",
            "\u00a0One of the best courses I have ever taken!\r\n\r\nDefinitely provided knowledge to assist in future research in health services.  \r\n\r\nThe professor and TFs were incredibly helpful and the quizzes were fair.  Final project was a lot of work but interesting and applicable. ",
            "\u00a0interesting about the application of statistices ",
            "\u00a0Yes, useful skills! ",
            "\u00a0tough, but can't get out of it. ",
            "\u00a0Mandatory requirement. Get through it. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I would not have taken this class if it weren't required. The main concepts are covered in biostats/other stats classes. ",
            "\u00a0its a course that reteaches concepts from biostats and requires completion of a sas/stata problem set weekly where you do most of the learning ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take it to learn the content. ",
            "\u00a0Take it your first year ",
            "\u00a0Very hands on and applicable ",
            "\u00a0Yes for health policy if you want to understand how to do the simplest health research. ",
            "\u00a0Well it is a required class, but I wouldn't recommend it for others to take. I took nothing from this class except less appreciation for statistics. ",
            "\u00a0This was a relatively standard course, as far as workload goes. I learned a tremendous amount about the various methods one could use to establish trends and causality using datasets. For my concentration (health policy), I knew that this would be an essential skill to learn, and I'm very glad I took this course. ",
            "\u00a0Great learning experience. Requirements are reasonable. \r\nWould recommend attending lab sessions and meeting with TFs in order to progress with Homework assignments.\r\nMore difficult to figure out some questions solo without these resources.\r\nAssignments are a great way to solidify concepts.\r\nExcellent course "
