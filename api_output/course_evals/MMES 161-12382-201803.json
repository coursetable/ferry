            "\u00a0I learned how to write in Hebrew at an academic level, which is crucial, especially because most students coming from Jewish day schools don't know how to write. We also developed general academic skills of reading academic articles and conducting research. We also developed a keen awareness of the sociology and demography of Israel. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about various issues that are relevant today in Israeli society. I learned most about the demographics and the political structure of the government, as well as the source of current tensions. I also learned to type in Hebrew very well, as this was not something I had to do in high school. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about Israeli politics, and Israeli history. In addition, I became more familiar with the demographics of Israel today, and the various events that led to these demographic break downs. ",
            "\u00a0Extensive insights and knowledge regarding Israel's history, society, and different Zionist and other Israeli political ideologies. "

            "\u00a0This course is genuinely fantastic and taught by a professor who I am sure numbers amongst Yale's brightest and most devoted faculty members. One of the strengths is the ability to develop and deepen understanding of Israel's culture and society at a very high level, learning from your peers who have extensive experience and knowledge about Israel, as well as Professor Roginsky. The small class size (at least when I took) as well as the intensity allows for discussions about a variety of topics relating to the subject matter, not just what's on the syllabus. Our tangents are always interesting and informative. However, the small class size was also a weakness of the course, because having only 5 people can sometimes be grating. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are the topics that we cover. The weaknesses are the assignments and the grading structure. There will be long periods without serious assignments and then short bursts of hard assignments. ",
            "\u00a0The course had an interesting idea, as well as some interesting conversation that took place in class. The small class size allowed for students to be comfortable sharing their opinions. I would say the class had more weaknesses, than strengths, however. Class was often boring, and I felt as if the readings we were given tangentially prepared us, but were broad readings that had been somewhat arbitrarily chosen. I didn't feel like any of the homework actually made me language skills better. "

            "\u00a0Yes, I would, if the student really wants to challenge themself in Hebrew. This is not an easy L5, and you should be prepared to talk constantly and work on your writing. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students interested in Israeli society and culture. I don't think this course is good for people that need to improve on their Hebrew because it will be hard to focus on language improvement and the subjects of the course. ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend this course for students who are fully fluent in Hebrew. The expectations for students in truth are higher than a typical L5; in order to excel in this class one really has to be a native speaker. This class felt like it had a lot of work, but often the work felt like it wasn't towards a specific means. Homework was rarely checked, and feedback was seldom given in a helpful way. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommended course taught by Israeli faculty. A combination of theoretical-Academic expertise and real-life knowledge from Israel. "
