Connections were made to philosophy of science, history and historiography, and science within society. "

            "\u00a0There was a lot of reading and experiments to be carried out. These were all helpful and necessary, so I'm not sure I'd call that a weakness. The history portions could have covered more of the medieval Islamic tradition of scholarship, as much of the history was focused on Greece and Mesopotamia. Class discussions and lectures by the professor were very helpful and insightful. "

            "\u00a0Yes. The interdisciplinary nature of this course makes it useful for students in a number of different fields. It brings students together to learn from each other in a collaborative way and in itself models the way that science and human knowledge proceed as a giant conversation. "
