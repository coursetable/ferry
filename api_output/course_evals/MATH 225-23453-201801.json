            "\u00a0This course teaches a really solid basis in basic linear algebra. We learned about vector spaces, subspaces, linear transformations and their matrix representations, systems of linear equations and Gaussian elimination, bases, change of coordinate matrices, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and orthogonal and orthonormal bases. This class is proof-based, so I also learned how to write mathematical proofs and a little about logic used in proof-writing. This was the first theoretical and proof-based math course that I'd taken, so I got a little bit of experience thinking about math differently from the way that you do math in a course like Math 120. ",
            "\u00a0The class provided a rigorous introduction of proof-based math as well as a survey of concepts from vector spaces to eigenvalues that are broadly applicable to many fields. I gained experience writing proofs and some of the computational aspects of linear algebra. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write proofs, understand more rigorous mathematics, and a lot of linear algebra. ",

            "\u00a0Ever wonder WHY things are the way they are in math? This class will help lay a foundation for you to figure that out. I had some limited exposure to proof-based math in high school, but this class will help you establish a solid base for higher-level math if that's what you're interested in. With that said, the material itself is interesting as well. You'll learn about what linear algebra is (solving systems of linear equations, essentially), and how the seemingly simple problem of solving equations is more complex than you might think. You'll learn to do some pretty cool things with matrices, such as finding an expression for any given term in the Fibonacci sequence and modeling the Google Pagerank algorithm. ",

This class is absolutely amazing and you will come out of it with a very good understanding of the basics of linear algebra. It is also a great introduction class to proof writing, and while you won't get super clear feedback, you will get a whole lot of practice writing proofs! ",

This  course was unique in that the approach felt very distinct from my high school math classes. The difficulty of the work and the intellectual challenge of the material proved very stimulating for me, and I am considering the math major more seriously as a result. ",
            "\u00a0Throughout this course I learned about many linear algebra topics including vector spaces and fields, linear dependence, rank-nullity, linear operators and matrix representations, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and much more. I learned the skills required to write a rigorous mathematical proof, and I learned how to think about math problems from a theoretical point of view, applying theory to solve even non-theoretical (and thus computational) problems.

The specific topics that we covered can be found on the course syllabus, but the important note is that the proof-based nature of this course was extremely important for students to develop intuition associated with linear algebra that encourages them (us) to pursue further study in mathematics and related fields.

I've been told this is meant to be a pretty useful class going forward - and while I haven't found any uses for it yet - I'm confident I'll be able to use the stuff I learned and skills I developed in the future.

            "\u00a0The strengths of the course is its excellent teaching, rigorous work load, and it is a great introduction to proof-writing for those without experience. Its weaknesses are that the workload is sometimes prohibitive, but I suppose that is necessary to some extent. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Although this is a difficult class, there are many resources to help you succeed if the student is willing to engage. Asher Auel is wonderful and explains everything clearly and really seems to care about the class and his students. The teaching fellows and peer tutors are all great resources as well.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The psets are rough. ",
            "\u00a0Asher is one of the best math lecturers I have ever had. If you take 225, definitely take it with him. ",
            "\u00a0This class was fantastic! Prof. Auel is a wonderful teacher and does a really good job explaining new concepts, especially in light of the fact that most people taking this class are taking linear algebra for the first time. The lectures were always very accessible, and Prof. Auel made himself available during regular office hours. The problem sets were long and challenging, but they really made us think and doing them made me understand the material much more thoroughly. They were also well-tailored to the course material, so nothing that we did on a problem set felt pointless, it was all helping us learn. This semester we had to two great peer tutors, Charlie and Noah, and peer tutoring was an amazing help throughout the course. I went to office hours for both of them regularly, as did several other students, and their office hours provided a really great atmosphere to work on problems together and swap ideas for the proofs. This class felt much more like it was a part of the math department than Math 120, so I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in math! \r\n\r\nOne thing that I think could be improved would be if there could be more resources or sessions about proof-writing at the beginning of the course. For the first problem set, those of us who had never taken proof-based math before had no idea what the expectations were -- I had no idea what a sufficient proof looked like, so I wasn't sure how to go about answering a lot of the problems. One of the TAs for the course held a session about proof-writing that I went to and found helpful, but I think it would have also been helpful if we could have seen a few examples of proofs more similar to the types that we were asked to do on problem sets, to get a sense of what was expected. ",
            "\u00a0This class was exceptionally well-taught and thoughtfully planned. Although the problem sets are long and challenging, the work is ultimately rewarding, and we learned the material thoroughly. Exams were challenging but not too difficult. I really appreciated the application to Google PageRank and quantum mechanics that he discusses as well as they way he presented proofs. ",
            "\u00a0This course had a heavy workload, but Professor Auel was phenomenal.  He was very passionate about the material, and he really motivated the heavy work. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The course is designed very well. Professor Auel does a fantastic job of lecturing in class, and the problem sets really make you think about what you're learning in class. He even throws some really cool applications of linear algebra into the homework.\r\nWeaknesses: None that I can think of. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of this class was the rigor with which we covered all of the topics. Each chapter/section really laid the foundation for the chapters to come, and I always felt that there was a solid base to build on with every new topic that we covered. I also felt that some of the extra problems on the problem sets were a great strength as well; while the non-textbook problems would oftentimes take the most time, they were also often the \"coolest\" and most satisfying to solve. The one qualm I might raise with this class would be that the problem sets sometimes felt excessive in length; granted, the difficulty and number of problems certainly contributed to my understanding of the topics, but there were most definitely times where the problem sets felt a little longer than necessary. ",
            "\u00a0Math is really hard, but its also cool. Professor Auel, TAs, and peer tutors do a really good job at being available and engaging and answering questions. PSETs are a LOT, (10-15 hours a week) but they force you to have a better understanding of the material and are very helpful for the tests. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of this class is hands down Professor Auel. He was maybe one of the best teachers I've ever had! His teaching was so clear and thought through. He was very engaging and clearly interested in the material. \r\n\r\nI was also actually a big fan of the PSETs in this class. They are suuuper long, but actually most of the questions are pretty interesting and it can be fun to think through some challenging proofs. \r\n\r\nMy one criticism would be that I wish we could have gotten more in depth feedback. I would have loved to have gotten more feedback on how to improve my proofs or how to make them more technical or thorough. ",
            "\u00a0This class taught me the material and definitely made me a better proof writer. The workload was pretty difficult to keep up with but there were lots of office hours and resources to help. I think overall this class is well structured. ",
            "\u00a0Well-designed curriculum, logical progression, great textbook, helpful additional sessions to teach proof-writing in the beginning of the year ",
            "\u00a0Very well structured! ",
            "\u00a0This course has been my favorite course that I've taken at Yale so far. Not only is the content super interesting, Professor Auel's method of fluidly transition between topics in a logical ad effective manner really mad the class for me ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are that it presents intellectually fascinating material and does so in a way that not only gives students access to new techniques but encourages them to think creatively about the course. The problem sets are very long, but this is a vital part of the class. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very well structured. The problem sets were very relevant to the lectures, as we were required to prove concepts discussed in class as well as apply them to other problems. The exams were easier than the problem sets because their main focus seemed to be to allow us to apply the theory we'd learned and proved to more computational problems, rather than proving more theory. The peer tutors were amazing -- Charlie and Noah were truly fantastic, and having them made the problem sets much more manageable when stuck on a tricky problem, and would have been very difficult at times without their help. There were plenty of review sessions available surrounding exam times, which was great. I have no weaknesses to add. ",
            "\u00a0Teacher was an amazing lecturer and homeworks helped immensely with comprehension of course material. ",
            "\u00a0The quality instruction, the extensive out of classroom support, and the challenging, proof-based problem sets of this course were the greatest strengths. I have not spoken with one student enrolled or currently enrolled in 225 who disliked Asher Auel as an instructor or personeven the students who dropped the course who I knew did not have anything negative to say about Asher, those students I spoke to were only dropping for workload reasons. The proof-based nature of the course itself was very challenging but extremely rewarding, as looking back many students will admit that it was through working through the thought process of a proof that they learned, and they wouldnt have learned as much through simple numble plugging. \r\n\r\nAll this said, one weakness of the course is the intense workload if a student is not prepared, doesnt know where to find support or resources, or has too intense of a courseload otherwise. It is important to have a difficult courseload on a whole to ensure that students are learning, but students should not expect any of the class to be easy. ",
            "\u00a0It was extremely well-taught and we learned the rigor of writing proofs. \r\n\r\nHowever, the weakness is that the problem sets were too long. ",
            "\u00a0The psets are hard and long. Not sure if that's a strength or a weakness, probably depends on how frustrated you're feeling on hour 12 of a pset on Wednesday night. The class is well structured, there are clear expectations, and lectures are engaging and meaningful. The final exam was a bit of a curveball though :( ",
            "\u00a0This class is great in that there are lots of resources to help its students succeed and get help. Asher is an amazingly nice and helpful guy and he is very sympathetic to how hard the class is. A weakness of the class is that Asher often moves too fast (for me at least) so a lot of your reading is from the book (a lot of other students did not have this problem, however). Also, the workload is TREMENDOUS. Like, you look at the syllabus and think \"Oh okay, 15-20 hrs of work per week, that's okay, I came to Yale to learn and work hard, not to take the easy route!\" and that sounds noble and all, but I was honestly getting myself into too much and ended up dropping the class. ",
            "\u00a0I found the balance between the problem sets and exams to be a significant strength -- the psets are where you're asked to construct proofs; the exams also test for conceptual understanding but are more computational. This made the problem sets good practice for the exams, in that by the time you are tested on a concept when you sit an exam, you've already done several proofs related to the concept so you know it pretty well. "

        [
            "\u00a0Asher Auel makes this course.  I learned so much from Prof. Auel during the semester.  This class taught me how to build logical arguments and overall how to reason and think in a different way.  I was debating between 222 and 225 in the beginning of the semester, and I'm really happy that I ended up choosing 225.  A lot of people say that this class is better for people who are interested in pure math and not just the applications of math, but I truly think that everyone should take this class.  Also, the exams are really fair.  Our class average on the midterm was a 99.  Take this class!! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because it teaches hard work, time management, rigorous thinking, and an appreciation of math. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but be prepared to spend hours and hours on a pset per week. ",
            "\u00a0Wholeheartedly. This was probably the best math class Ive ever been a part of. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This is a hard class, because the problem sets really push you, but if you're interested in math and you want to learn the material thoroughly then it's definitely worth it because you'll learn a ton. I think you should consider what else you're planning to take in the same semester, since the workload is fairly considerable and this isn't really a class to take on a whim, but it's definitely manageable if you leave yourself enough time to do the problem sets and you work with other students or the peer tutors when you get stuck. Prof. Auel is great, so I would definitely recommend taking it in a semester when he's teaching the course if you can. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in thoroughly learning linear algebra for future math classes or other fields, this class will teach the way to think as well as delving into the important concepts of linear algebra. Problem sets could be fun, although they were long. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course, especially if one wants to take linear algebra.  It takes a lot of time, but that time is necessary for adequate understanding.  Also, it is quite fulfilling once the material is completely understood and able to be applied. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this class is really an amazing experience. Professor Auel is fantastic, and linear algebra (at its core) is very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! You will learn fascinating things about mathematical theory, and you leave this class wondering about the theoretical basis for many of the things you might have taken for granted in earlier math classes that you have taken. Also, Professor Auel is a fantastic teacher, and with few exceptions, you will find lecture to be pretty engaging. With that said, be aware that this class constitutes a significant investment of time and energy and that you will need to be dialed-in to avoid staying up all night on Wednesday's trying to finish the problem sets for the week. Even so, don't let the heavy workload scare you off: there is a great feeling of satisfaction that comes with completing this class and mastering the material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only if you like proof based math. If you don't know whether you like proof based math or not thats fine, because either way you'll definitely learn a lot. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class to everyone! It is soooo well taught and super engaging. Yes, the PSETs are long, but don't let that scare you off. They aren't always that difficult and you can always get help with them at study hall or office hours. This math class was absolutely amazing and Professor Auel is a true gem! Definitely take this class if you get the chance! ",
            "\u00a0If you are considering being a math major and are interested in the theoretical side of math, definitely take this class. However if you enjoy more computational work I think it might be better for you to take 222 just because the work load is so significant. ",
            "\u00a0Yes for sure. Not only does Linear Algebra have important applications in many STEM fields, but this course is also very well-structured and taught. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Very good course if you want to learn linear algebra in a proof based approach. ",
            "\u00a0I would definietly recommend this class to another student if they are interested in learning Linear Algebra the way it was meant to be learned. The class is a lot of work, but by the end of the semester you'll see that it was all worth it. ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course to another student. It is a unique experience, and, while it can be stressful at times, it is intellectually stimulating and a lot of fun. I made some great friends staying up working on the psets, and I hope to take another class like it. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely take Math 225, especially with Professor Auel. He has a masterful grasp on the material and explains everything clearly in lecture. The problem sets are extensions of lecture, proving discussed concepts and applying them to more computational problems. While the problem sets take a very large amount of time each week, the peer tutors are an amazing resource. Also, the exams are nothing like the problem sets -- they are much easier because they're computational, as you're expected to apply the theory you learn through the problems sets to computational (non-proof-based) problems on exams. I learned SO much from this course and the problem sets really make the material feel second nature, and the strong grasp on linear algebra and matrix theory that I've gained through this course was well worth the workload. Take it! ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! It's a lot (a LOT) of work, but it's well worth it.  You'll do well, you'll learn a ridiculous amount, and there will be a sense of pride in your work that's tough to match in other classes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Yesprovided that they know what theyre getting themselves into. A student needs to be passionate about learning linear algebra, okay with not being perfect, committed to hard work, dilligent, and have an academic schedule otherwise that allows 8-20 hours (depending on work speed) to complete psets. Psets for me took upwards of 15 hours per week. ",
            "\u00a0If you don't mind hard problem sets that destroy at least one of your nights per week, then I would definitely recommend this class, especially to someone who's very interested in theory and proof-writing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, take this class if this is taught by Professor Auel. Lessons are engaging and this subject is important for engineering and machine learning! ",

The Asher Auel effect is real and exists for a reason. One of the best math professors I've ever had. Don't take Math 222, don't take 225 in the fall without Prof Auel. This will be one of the best math classes you've ever taken. It's elegant, and challenging, and beautiful. Do it. ",
            "\u00a0It depends. Are you a pure/applied math or CS major? Then yes, go ahead and take it. Are you a physics or chem or engineering major? Save yourself a lot of blood, sweat, and tears (mostly tears) and take Math 222. I know that Math 222 isn't super great, but my self confidence and GPA could have benefited a lot if I just took 222 from the outset. However, I was one of the few that did bad on the midterm and dropped the class, and I knew a lot of other physics majors in the class that did great, so I'm probably just a pleb. Most people really love the class and find it very rewarding, but I wasn't one of those people. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely! Especially to students wanting to practice mathematical proof-like thinking; since most of the proofs are in the problem sets and not the exams, I found this class an intellectually challenging but low-stakes place to practice this kind of thinking. "
