            "\u00a0Many methods, an idea of where chemical biology is currently as a field ",
            "\u00a0Basic concepts in chemical biology. It was a broad survey so I learned a little bit about a lot of things. ",
            "\u00a0I learned many new and relevant techniques and experiments pertaining to the field of chemical biology. Most of all I am taking away a newfound appreciation for how the principles of chemistry can be applied to biological problems. ",
            "\u00a0This was one of the most useful courses I have taken.  Prior to the course I had very little experience or knowledge of chemical biology concepts or lab techniques.  Because of this I was also not comfortable with reading the current literature.  The course exposed me to major concepts such as directed evolution, chemical probes, and CRISPR.  The weekly lit readings reinforced concepts through well led discussions on relevant and high impact papers.  I am now comfortable reading articles in the field and can grasp the main takeaways. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me various modern techniques used within chemical biology research. ",
            "\u00a0A survey of popular chemical biology techniques ",
            "\u00a0this course allowed to gain appreciation for different experimental designs and tools used in chemical biology. I was able to learn a lot about cutting edge research and applications of the material. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much in this course that will help me to be successful as I continue through grad school. I learned how to think like a chemical biologist, read scientific articles, analyze figures and data, critically think about deeper problems and applications. ",

            "\u00a0I liked that there were multiple assessments beyond exams. The problem sets were useful and I really liked the NSF grant proposal assignment as it strengthened my writing and understanding of a chemical biology concept of choice. The survey nature of the course was a little frustrating because we kept changing topic. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated that the lecture slides were printed out so we could take notes during class as well as keep the print-outs to study later. The readings were often interesting, too. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very up to date and relies well on both current literature and major papers from the field. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: great information; learned a lot about a field I knew little about beforehand\r\nweaknesses: sometimes difficult to translate concepts to problems ",

            "\u00a0Yes, this is a really interesting class. I learned so much in such a short amount of time. Sarah was really engaged with the material. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah, it's a very thorough survey of important topics in chemical biology. Makes you a much more literate scientist in chemical biology. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students interested in biology who also have an appreciation of chemistry. I would also recommend that students who plan to take this course take biochemistry and introductory biology first. ",
            "\u00a0Yes.  I had very little experience beyond basic biochemistry prior to this course so my knowledge in the field is greatly expanded. ",
            "\u00a0I would indeed recommend this course to other students, especially if they intend to conduct research within chemical biology. The techniques covered throughout the course are ubiquitous throughout modern literature and thus should be well understood. Moreover, the problem sets and exams, though difficult, are isomorphic with problems one would encounter during research. As such, learning to solve these problems in a classroom setting can be incredibly helpful for later endeavors. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Especially if you are considering a chemical biology or biologically-relevant chemistry career ",

            "\u00a0Yes ",
