            "\u00a0This course prepared me effectively for the comprehensive exam. It was a great survey of Classical literature and history. ",

            "\u00a0I think that we ended up just translating from the beginning of each section in class, and I wish that we had been doing the chunks in class that were either the hardest or most memorable in the corpus. I think it would have also been helpful to be incorporating history more into the context of the texts that we were reading. I often found that I was not able to link the texts to their respective political moments.\r\n\r\nI think that the strengths of the course were that it forced me to consistently engage with a new text each week and provided VERY comprehensive study sheets for each corresponding class. It was very impressive how much Cara had done separately to provide us supplementary material. ",
            "\u00a0Because we were splitting time between Greek and Latin, we rarely finished going over an assigned translation. It might have also been nice to have had assigned English readings because ~100 lines won't tell you much about an author's content. Otherwise, the historical and literary timelines provided were extremely helpful, and the readings were useful. ",
            "\u00a0The course is difficult because we have to cover so much ground. As such, however, it was very well organized and helpful. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course or type of course to students who want some consistent motivation to study for the comprehensive exam. Obviously, there is a lot that still needs to be done outside of this course, but it's a really good way to get yourself to do a little bit each week and get in the mindset. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course if you want to pass the comprehensive. It will give you great resources and get you to engage with the necessary materials. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It is a great way to make sure that you read a lot of ancient literature from a wide array of authors in order to prepare for the comprehensive exams. "
