            "\u00a0My favorite part of the course was learning about asteroseismology and using MESA to model stars. I already had some knowledge of stellar astrophysics from previous classes but I had never been taught asteroseismology  and I found it really interesting how we can use it to study stars in a way thats different than what is usually done. I also really enjoyed learning to use MESA for the homework and final project. ",
            "\u00a0Competency with analytical and numerical problem solving. Intuition for stellar astrophysics. ",
            "\u00a0Looking back at it I realise how much I did learn from this course. It went from basic stellar modelling of early 1900s to state-of-the-art research front in stellar astrophysics. Also it polished some of my computational skills which I required for this course. "

            "\u00a0I think one major strength is having us learn to use MESA for modeling. Since it is one of the more widely used programs for stellar evolution, if we decide to go on to do research in stellar, we will already have some experience using a stellar evolution code. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n1. Some of the stuff were rigorously derived and mathematically modelled, while several other aspects were used with hand-wavy arguments and physical reasoning. I think the presence of both of these things is fantastic as it gives both the flavours and also teaches us how to proceed when something at the cutting edge is still not fully understood and yet we have t0o go forward as far as we can using analytical reasoning and smart approximation techniques.\r\n2. The course was designed in a way that also followed the evolution of the field itself from its earliest days to its latest publications, hence giving students a holistic view.\r\n3. Including the computational part was one of the best thing in this course. Only deriving equations would have made it so appealing if we didn't have the chance to apply the things we learnt by actually doing stellar modelling ourselves. The TAs were absolutely fantastic, they helped us a lot with our different hurdles, yet giving us enough space to learn the things on our own.\r\n4. I completely felt that this course would have provided a wonderful head-start to anyone who is interested to do research on stellar astrophysics, that I think is the biggest success of this course.\r\n\r\nScopes of improvement:\r\n1. I don't think it's possible to accommodate any more on the already vast syllabus of this course, without compromising some other aspect of it, but I just wished I learned a bit more about stellar evolution in this course. I know that would mean sacrificing something else in it. Also, since there aren't many scopes in the dapartment's courses to learn about compact objects, may be going through the end states of star would have been exciting.\r\n2. As I've mentioned before, I really felt that this course is perfect for someone who'll be doing research on stellar astrophysics. That is absolutely great, but I felt there were some scopes to connect this course to other branches of astrophysics as well, like how astroseismic modelling can be relevant to people wanting to work on planets, how understanding the stellar evolution can be relevant to someone doing observational work on galaxies, or how stellar outflows, chemical evolution, metal enrichment, etc. can be relevant to galaxy formation and late universe cosmology. I think drawing those (and several other) connections with research forefront of other subfields would have elevated the course to supreme heights. "

            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to someone interested in stellar astrophysics or who wants to do research on stars, particularly in asteroseismology. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to other students if they are willing to put a lot of effort into it, which is definitely greater than the average effort one needs to put in for other courses. I can promise that the learning curve will be very steep, but that comes at a cost of investing significantly large amount of time into it. If someone is not willing to do so, and is more keen on picking easier choices to invest more into research during the semester (which is also a fine choice), or if someone is taking too many courses in that semester, then taking this course might be a bit overwhelming.
