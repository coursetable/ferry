            "\u00a0I learned how to think critically about post Soviet film and literature. I also feel that this class was extremely productive in developing my writing and analytical skills! ",
            "\u00a0A lot of post soviet Russia knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0Analyzing films and literature, how to better write comparative papers ",
            "\u00a0I feel like I really improved as an analytical writer. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a phenomenal fusion of film, literature, art, and history. ",
            "\u00a0Through this course, I developed my writing skills and my understanding of literature, film and art from the post-Soviet era. I sincerely enjoyed getting to read and watch material from this period. There were three significant writing assignments throughout the course, including a close reading, a comparative essay, and a longer final paper on a topic of the student's choice. ",
            "\u00a0We learned about art and film in post-Soviet Russia ",
            "\u00a0This course explored prominent works of post-Soviet art, encompassing various works from literature, film, and other mediums. We started by looking at works reacting to the collapse of communism and the overall lawlessness of the 90s, before eventually transitioning to various forms of protest art criticizing Putin's regime. For me, the most novel aspect of this course was analyzing various mediums at the same time. This really helped me to appreciate the differences between mediums, both in their intentions and their limitations, a difference which I will take into account when analyzing pieces of literature and film in other classes. ",
            "\u00a0General overview of radical (and a bit of mainstream) Russian and Soviet art. We situated each piece in its cultural context, then discussed their various aims and implications. We also learned how to produce written analyses of film and artwork more generally. "

            "\u00a0The seminar discussions were fascinating due to great leadership by Marijeta Bozovic, and her incredible intellect. She responded thoughtfully to every comment and pushed us to think harder about the material. The papers were also very flexible, encouraging us to write about anything as long as we were interested in it, and we got great criticism for improving. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Bozovic was very helpful with essays, and her assignments were very clear. She gave constructive feedback that helped me improve a lot ",
            "\u00a0amazing professor, amazing TF. the only thing is that you have 2 Slack responses a week, which is kinda a lot. ",
            "\u00a0None! I really enjoyed it! ",
            "\u00a0Loved the course ",
            "\u00a0All of the materials we read/watched were really fascinating, and made for interesting discussions. I liked how class varied between normal round-table discussions and smaller group work, since I'm one of those people who is more comfortable discussing in small groups. ",
            "\u00a0Making my essays more organized is something I can improve with ",
            "\u00a0Very good course  perfect for what it aims to be. ",
            "\u00a0One of my favorite parts of the course was getting to read and see a wide variety of materials that were often in conversation with each other. Class discussions were engaging opportunities to discuss and compare these materials. One of my favorite aspects of the course was the time Marijeta took to meet with every student after grading our writing assignments. She gave personalized feedback on each of the assignments in a way I have never experienced at Yale. I found myself returning to her advice as I worked on later papers and work for other classes. My one complaint about the course is that I sometimes felt that we didn't have enough time to discuss each of the books and films, but I understand that with such limited time in the semester this is a difficult tradeoff to avoid. ",
            "\u00a0Very good course ",
            "\u00a0The course was very well-taught and well-organized. Professor Bozovic was very engaging, and I could tell that she was very enthusiastic about all of the material she was presenting. The majority of the material, especially the literature, was very different from anything I've read before, and I'm happy I was able to be exposed to it. All of the course materials were very easily accessible, especially the films, which were all on flash drives given to each student at the beginning of the class, and the use of Slack, as opposed to Canvas, made reading responses much easier to submit. Professor Bozovic and the TA Mina also gave each class member excellent, in-depth feedback on each essay, which helped me grow as a writer throughout the course. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this course! I thought the selection of course materials was great. It did a really good job of giving us a fascinating and fairly comprehensive glimpse into the works of a really broad range of influential Russian artists. I also thought that Professor Bozovic did a really good job of leading in-class discussions; it was the perfect blend of lecture and directed open discussion. She also gave amazing feedback on every paper and made sure you really understood how you could improve your writing. I did find the in-class group exercises to be kind of hit-or-miss. Some were pretty helpful/interesting, but a lot felt like they took up too much time for what we got out of them. Overall though, I really enjoyed this course! "

            "\u00a0Absolutely! I looked forward to this seminar most of all my classes during the week. The readings were also a great mix of material on modern Russia. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. Even if you aren't a Russian major, you learn to appreciate the country's culture. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Incredible course. Amazing feedback. Interesting topic. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend taking this class. The instructors provide clear writing feedback and the discussions are amazing. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! You should 100% take this class! ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0This course was a fascinating look at post-Soviet and contemporary Russia through the lens of literature and film. I really liked being exposed to contemporary Russian works, since so many classes focus on the periods of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky. Professor Bozovic is a really great professor; she is really committed to the learning and progress of all of her students, and is great at leading discussions. Definitely take if you want to learn more about contemporary Russia from more of a cultural perspective. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This course is continuously fascinating and the group discussions are very engaging. It was very easy and natural to participate in class, and my classmates always had very interesting things to say. The professor and TA are awesome and had so much to offer. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely would. Whether or not youve tried out the topics before, this can be a wonderful course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is an interesting class ",
            "\u00a0Yes. If you have any interest in post-Soviet Russia, or Russia's place in the 21st Century, I'd definitely recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you find modern Russia interesting and want to learn more about it's artists, definitely take this course! It's a really interesting look at the artistic scene, and Professor Bozovic does a great job of getting you through some of the more (frankly) weird works that you look at. She's also super good about giving feedback and meeting outside of class, and did a good job of leading discussions. "
