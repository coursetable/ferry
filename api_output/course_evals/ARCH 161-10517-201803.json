            "\u00a0I learned a good deal about how buildings are put together and the basic equations behind construction. This course has caused me to ponder how the buildings that I love are built. I would not consider myself a math person, but I gained an appreciation for how certain equations are incredibly useful in determining what sort of structure will be used. ",
            "\u00a0I learned concrete calculations. ",
            "\u00a0This class gives a basic overview of the main concepts of architectural engineering. My take-aways were more conceptual than anything else, since the course stuck to simple algebra. ",

            "\u00a0I learned the math behind structures in architecture. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the nature of materials and how they relate to the forces that affect structures. I also learned-- and appreciated learning-- calculations that help determine the amount of force on structural members, and how knowing these calculations allows for a practical understanding of a building in its entirety. I feel more confident in my capacity to design sound structures, and as a non-math person, am grateful for it! ",
            "\u00a0This course taught us the fundamentals of structural analysis. We were able to develop an understanding of structural systems such as beams, trusses, arches, cables and columns. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about structural concepts and systems and applied this knowledge to existing buildings. ",

            "\u00a0In this course, I learned how to see buildings as engineers see them--structures subject to countless forces that need to be carefully designed and built in order to ensure the safety of the occupants and the intended function of the building. ",

            "\u00a0Prof. Hatfield (who travelled from NY twice a week for our 9am) always made the class very engaging and lectured very well. The TAs were very helpful and the assignments were dealt with very well. Not many complaints! ",
            "\u00a0The class was well structured (pun unintended) with regular homework and quizzes. The spaghetti bridge project was fun and the presentation on a famous structure was interesting as well. The site visit to a construction site was super interesting and helped me see how the class material mattered in the real world. I think there probably could have been fewer quizzes, at times it felt like every week there was a quiz. I wish there was less time spent on the introductory material and more time spent on the more interesting aspects of the subject like beam design and arches. ",
            "\u00a0I think the strongest parts of this course were the application projects where we got to design things using what we'd learned. I think the weaker parts of the course were where we just learned a calculation in one context and didn't either have to apply it to another context or use it to design something physical. ",
            "\u00a0I feel like I got a great survey of the concepts, but would have liked for it to be more in depth. As someone with a math and physics background, the problem-solving was often frustratingly basic. I understand that many people in the class do not have that background, but it would have been cool if the professor had taken things the extra step in class, even if we weren't going to be tested on the more advanced material. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The TF's were very good. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The lectures seemed a bit unorganized and often hard to follow. Sometimes incorrect material was presented and we would receive an email clarifying the mistake. Professor Hatfield was really nice but didn't really seem to know how to teach very well and/or was confused about some of the material herself. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses was that the lectures and the quizzes and tests didn't necessarily correlate so it was always confusing. The slides didn't include many actual examples of problems and so the homework was incredibly tough. The grading was very strict and it was a very hard course. A strength was that the lectures were sometimes interesting and the TAs at times were helpful. Also the pasta bridge lab was great. ",
            "\u00a0The grading is interesting-- not bad. I oscillated between 100% and 40% on most assignments, which was unique for me. The number of assignments and opportunities for extra credit really helped this approach to grading. Overall, I thought that the course was well-taught, and that slides and assignments were helpful. The homework review sessions were invaluable! I didn't really find that I used the textbook very frequently until the end of the term for final exam review. ",
            "\u00a0The course was well structured and grading was fair. Both the professor and teaching assistants were very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of the course is the hands-on teaching style demonstrated by the various projects and demonstrations in the woodshop. \r\n\r\nThe class moves rather quickly and it was sometimes difficult to keep up with everything during lectures. ",
            "\u00a0very thorough explanation of structures, good to follow ",
            "\u00a0The lecturing could be improved. I felt like we passed by concepts too quickly in class and I was often confused. ",
            "\u00a0A weakness of this course is that its set up to be very math-y even if its not portrayed that way at the beginning. It was much harder than I expected and many students struggled. There were also a lot of homework and quiz problems that were not covered in the lectures and were dealt with by the TFs in the optional review sessions, but you really had to go to them to be able to do the work because it wasnt taught in lecture. ",
            "\u00a0The material was interesting, but the content was sometimes taught a bit unclearly, which then made the homework assignments difficult. The weight of assignments was also strange, since homework counted more than the quizzes, which I didn't know until halfway through the course. ",
            "\u00a0This was the first time this course was offered with this teaching staff, and potential issues with the flow of the course appeared during the semester. The topics did not always build off previous topics, and appeared out of order at times. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to an architecture student looking to fulfill a QR or SC requirement, but not to anyone looking for an extensive overview of structural engineering. It is definitely not a course for engineers, it relies primarily on theoretical ideas and not so much on the mathematics and physics of the subject. ",
            "\u00a0Yes because the topic is interesting. ",

            "\u00a0Absolutely! For those who are interested in understanding how buildings stay standing or are curious about designing structures of any kind, I would highly recommend this course as a really enjoyable, friendly way of understanding the relevance of forces on structures. As a non-math person, I am very happy to know how to calculate things with respect to structures! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student, whether mathematically inclined or not. It teaches essential information in an accessible way. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to an Architecture major or non-engineering major who is interested in looking at the basics of how an engineer would look at a building. ",
            "\u00a0I took this course as a humanities major looking for a science credit, and it ended up being such a source of stress with not a great reward. Its not a terrible class and I definitely learned something, but there are much better ways to get an Sc or QR. There isnt that much work, but you have to have a good understanding of structures already to do well. Professor Hatfield is a lovely person, but doesnt necessarily teach you how to do anything in class, so it comes down to getting help from the TFs. She moves incredibly quickly during lecture, and the lessons are full of extraneous information, making it difficult to pick out whats important. I would only recommend this class if youre an architecture major or you really love structural engineering. ",
            "\u00a0If you are truly passionate about buildings, I would take this class. Otherwise, look elsewhere. ",
            "\u00a0If this class is taken, it is likely as a requirement. If taken out of interest, perhaps  a statics course offered by physics or engineering would be a better option. ",
            "\u00a0I would because I learned a lot and it was enjoyable. "
