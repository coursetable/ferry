            "\u00a0I learned some important fundamentals of conducting technique from this course, but more importantly, I learned to what extent conducting is a silent art form.  I became increasingly comfortable standing in front of a group of people and conducting them. ",
            "\u00a0basic score reading and a much deeper knowledge of the role of a conductor in an orchestra, especially with regards to the psychology of conducting. sadly not enough actual conducting per student ",
            "\u00a0I originally took this class because I wanted to improve as an orchestral player and I figured that seeing things from the other side of the podium would help, and it did. I feel much more aware of other parts when I play in an ensemble. Also, I now feel more comfortable rehearsing a group or conducting pieces. ",
            "\u00a0A great understanding of both technical conducting techniques and leadership advice in the orchestral setting. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the fundamentals of conducting, and improved my overall abilities as a musician. Specifically, my understanding of tempo and meter, as well as how to convey expression as a conductor were augmented greatly. ",

            "\u00a0We were able to work with an actual ensemble. This was extremely helpful.\r\n\r\nHowever, we had little time to conduct and were learning so much that it was difficult to know what to prepare. ",
            "\u00a0This course was an excellent opportunity to practice conducting real musicians (rather than a recording, for example), but in my opinion, each student did not have the chance to conduct the group frequently enough.  It was helpful that everyone could have fifteen minutes or so of podium time, but the drawback was that it meant conducting once every two weeks.  I believe that it would have been beneficial to more frequently have classes where everyone conducted for about three minutes just to keep everyone in practice.  It also would have been helpful to have had more change of pace classes where we worked on other skills such as score study. ",
            "\u00a0needs to be more organized, and students need to be given a chance to conduct far more often. advance knowledge of when you will conduct and what part of the piece youll have to conduct would be immensely helpful and would aid both student performance and general attittude. the class would benefit from being smaller ",
            "\u00a0I thought the structure of the class - where we would play and a few of us would conduct every day - was fine, but I think we could rotate a little faster through people so that everyone got more chances to conduct. I also would have liked to see more emphasis on score reading and clef/other instrument transpositions. After the class I felt like my conducting technique had improved, but I still wouldn't be able to look at a chord in the score, notes spread across several instruments, and immediately see that it was, say, a French augmented 6th. ",
            "\u00a0I was never really sure how to prepare for this course, or how we were being evaluated. I didn't really feel like there were specific things I was working towards improving. "

            "\u00a0I would strongly recommend this course to another student because the conducting experience is invaluable and because I learned so much about the art of effective conducting. ",
            "\u00a0only for more serious musicians or YSM students who are willing to put in work on their own. since the class is loosely organized it can be very rewarding for someone whos willing to practice and learn independently, but its also easy to get away with not doing much. the class is not difficult, and it can be a lot of fun, but a lot of the reward might be less attainable for less serious musicians or younger students, especially if theyre surrounded by very qualified graduate students with prior experience in conducting ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student who wants to learn the basics of conducting technique and how to rehearse an ensemble. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely would recommend this course to anyone interested in music direction or even just in working in any instrumental or ensemble setting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course. I feel that it improved my skills, and also was very enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0I would, although this is not the \"fast track\" to learning to conduct. This is to get a rudimentary feel for the patterns and ideas behind conducting an ensemble. "
