            "\u00a0As a seminar class, this class does a great job of relying on student involvement and participation. The material picked off where Spanish L1 left off, but starting from the middle of the textbook was not a challenge. The teacher went over grammar, assignments, and examples in class so that every student understood the material. I feel like I really started to learn Spanish for the first time in this course. ",
            "\u00a0The cultural connections from this class are fantastic. Its really cool to learn about different spanish-speaking countries and how they differ from one another, but the actual learning of grammar and vocabulary is only used in the context of the textbook. I wish there were more vocab/grammar activities that were used to synthesize my learning. ",
            "\u00a0A different cheaper textbook could be used! But otherwise, the class was taught super well! ",
            "\u00a0The course helps the student better immerse into the culture of the language based on the works of authors we studied. It can be improved by having more writing assignments. ",
            "\u00a0This course was good, I learned a lot, and it could be improved by giving out project or group work assignment further in advance. "

            "\u00a0Yes!! Learning Spanish is really important ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it really helps you learn not only tenses and grammatical aspects of the language but also immerses the student in the culture of the language. ",
