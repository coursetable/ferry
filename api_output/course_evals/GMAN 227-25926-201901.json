            "\u00a0This course allowed me to delve deeply into one text, understand its logic, its project, and think within that milieu. It was also a useful exercise in reconstructing philosophical arguments rather than just analyzing them. It really is helpful to undertake an expository writing project once in a while to own the logic of a text and fully consider it rather than just making potentially under-thought arguments about that text.

            "\u00a0The lectures are fantastic and really engaging. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very engaging  and Prof. Hgglund's lectures are very interesting. I wouldn't change anything content-wise or thematically. I do think that there were sometimes too many questions taken during lecture, which although useful, really threw a wrench into the flow and momentum of the class. Some questions asked by my classmates were really not helpful or well thought out, which was detrimental to understanding the text. Maybe if there was an alternate method of submitting questions to Prof. Hgglund (like the Piazza platform in STEM classes), students would be forced to ask questions in an intelligible manner, and then all responses to questions would be seen by all. ",
            "\u00a0I'll start with the strengths: the course is about an important book, which is important to understanding subsequent developments in philosophy; the book is extremely challenging and virtually incomprehensible for someone who isn't reading it in an academic setting, so it is helpful to take a class in it. Martin Hgglund has earned his reputation as a lecturer with his confidence and often quite clever way of phrasing things.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class is VERY badly organized. Sometimes, Professor Hagglund gave the impression that he was not particularly invested in the course or his students. He cancelled a total of 4 or 5 classes because he was sick or for some other reasons, and only made one up. He often made promises that he didn't keep, e.g. that he would go over so-and-so topic next class, or that he would make up the missing classes, which made classes often feel very bewildering. For the first assignment, he didn't get around to sending the prompts until right before the first paper was due, and so ended up pushing the deadline at a very last minute. He does not give out any notes and his handwriting is near-illegible, although he kept talking about getting around to using powerpoint slides ( i think he should strongly consider this). \r\n\r\nMore substantively, Professor Hagglund offers a very distinctive interpretation of Heidegger. In fact, the course is more \"What Martin Hagglund thinks\" rather than a strict interpretation of the text. This is of course fine and he is clear that he is teaching how he thinks Heidegger SHOULD be read, but it would still be nice for him to first, actually refer to the text to show us where he's getting his evidence from, and second, explain various interpretations of similar thematic threads in Heidegger. If not it is very difficult to feel like there's a point to keep up with the readings and I think most students give up at some point. \r\n\r\nProfessor Hagglund is also frankly not very good at answering student questions although he devotes a lot of time to it. Most students start zoning out when questions are asked. The course might be particularly frustrating for philosophy students who are here to do serious thinking, which of course Heidegger offers a lot of, but Hagglund presents a lot of Heidegger's insights as mere stipulations, and does not do a lot of work to justify it.\r\n\r\nI was really disappointed by this course because I had high hopes due to previous good reviews and the fame surrounding both Heidegger and Hagglund. I think the course is pretty polarizing, and it's very possible that some people enjoyed it, so see during shopping week if you like it. Note that it does NOT get better from shopping week onwards, so if you are already skeptical then, chances are you should not take the course. \r\n\r\nOne last thing - Heidegger was a Nazi, and it's quite remiss in my opinion that Hagglund did not take this up once during the class, and did not once question/push back against anything Heidegger was saying. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures and sections worked well individually, engaging us throughout the semester. Sometimes I wished that Prof. Hagglund would only pause for questions at the end of his classes. \r\nIt was somewhat odd that the sections and lectures did not always synchronize with each other thematically. In general, Ted stayed closer to the week's assigned readings. This never became a real issue, however. ",
            "\u00a0Strength:  This course does not get too in the weeds with the concepts that Heidegger brings up, so even people with limited philosophy background can take this class without being lost.  Often times lectures will correspond to just a few pages or even just one page from a chapter since one page of Being and Time is often quite dense and can presents many important ideas. \r\nWeakness: Sometimes it can feel futile to read all of the book since most of what you read will not be discussed in section or lecture, and most of what you read will be quite hard to correctly understand. ",
            "\u00a0I think the professor needs to prepare more before the class (way more) ",
            "\u00a0I think the lectures were engaging and entertaining. Professor Hagglund did a very good job breaking down a text that on its own would be difficult to parse. I think one thing that could be improved would be somehow having more contact time to so that we could rehearse the concepts or discuss about them in a more organised manner. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures are extremely good, with time for questions from students interspersed throughout the lecture. Hagglund really makes an effort to address these questions from students, which are for the most part not substantive, poorly thought out or simply bad. But it's good that he spends the time and effort to really address these questions. \r\nThe course might be better if there was more feedback from TA about the short essays, of which there are 3 over the semester.\r\nThe first half of the course on Division One of Being and Time is extremely good. As the course proceeds to the second half, or Division Two of Being and Time, Hagglund starts to repeat himself and his ideas a lot of times, and the lectures start to become pretty uninteresting. But it might be the case that this is not really a fault of the class or of Hagglund's teaching but simply because Heidegger repeats a lot of his ideas and extensively builds on the ideas from Division One in Division Two. ",
            "\u00a0Fantastic course. Professor Hgglund provides a succinct and understandable framework upon which students are able to understand a text that otherwise might have been quite confusing. ",
            "\u00a0Hagglund is so engaging and I loved the philosophy. I wished he had moved a little more quickly -- he repeated himself a lot. I also wish he had sometimes stuck a little more closely to the text and cracked open the book more to show us where in the text he was drawing from. But overall I learned a ton about Heidegger and had a great experience. ",
            "\u00a0This was a fantastic class! I very much enjoyed the class before spring break, but the second half of the class after break felt repetitive and didnt add much. It may have been helpful to discuss the books relation to philosophical works following it / its impact on philosophical thinking. ",
            "\u00a0I think the strengths of this class lie in the fantastic lectures from Professor. Hagglund. Students were excited to come to every lecture and learn something new and novel in an accessible way. I believe that a lot of students were a little confused though over time as the lectures topics began to match up less and less with the readings from the book and section. At times it seemed that topics were very different between all three. ",
            "\u00a0The course is incredibly engaging and interesting. Hagglund is a great lecturer who captivates and excites students. Section is a great chance for students to clarify issues they've had. I really think the class is as good as it can be. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: The course very much focusses on Professor Hagglunds interpretation of Heidegger. it could offer a more comprehensive view of other scholars. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: The lectures usually consisted of a pretty long Q&A section, where students would ask questions about the lecture. However, the lecture is huge and the content is very rich. Thus, students might have very different questions about the lecture. As a result, I was only interested in a small subset of the questions asked, and felt that a substantial amount of time was wasted answering questions. Perhaps the Q&A could be done in a different way, such as with a real-time poll of questions which students can vote for, so that shy students (like me) could also get a say in the questions that the Professor chooses to answer.\r\n\r\nStrengths: The professor is brilliant, and I love the way he teaches his reading of the book (while arguing that other existing readings are wrong). This really makes the text come to life. "

            "\u00a0Yes, it is relevant to any course of study. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely. I felt my life changed by Being and Time, and especially Hgglund's exposition of the text. ",
            "\u00a0No, I would not. The class is very frustrating, badly organized, more to do with Hagglund than Heidegger, and made me dislike Heidegger much more than when I started. Not sure about other TAs, but mine seemed apathetic, dismissive, patronizing, and did not give clear feedback and graded pretty arbitrarily. I once went for office hours with him and he yawned the whole time, seemed distracted, and ended it after 5 minutes. If there were any other instructor who taught this important book, I would really recommend taking that course again, because heidegger is interesting and it's good to have a whole course about one very difficult book. It's a pity that this is the only option. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! The course offers students the chance to study authenticity in a light that would shine on much of 20th century philosophy. Plus, the workload is very reasonable throughout the term, and Prof. Hagglund is a dynamic lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to everyone.  Though this course may at times seem abstract, the ideas we discussed have concrete implications in daily life and will affect how you go about your daily life and how you reflect on your life as a whole.  I don't think I have had any other class that has facilitated my personal development nearly as much as this class has. ",

            "\u00a0If you're interested in the book, or the concepts, or continental philosophy or existentialism in general, definitely take this class. Heidegger's ideas can serve as a primer to a lot of existential philosophy and Professor Hagglund provides a very strong interpretation of it. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend if you're interested in a de re reading of Heidegger and existentialist philosophy more generally. Keep in mind, however, that HEIDEGGER WAS A NAZI. Hagglund will not spend a lot of time dwelling on this in his lectures, and the class does not elaborate upon Heidegger's politics at all. In fact, Hagglund only discusses Heidegger's support for Nazism when there is a question raised from students on this issue; otherwise he will not discuss this at all. \r\nAgain, when you are thinking about taking this class, remember that Heidegger was a Nazi and decide for yourself how much this will influence your decision to take the course and study Being and Time for a whole semester.

            "\u00a0Yes, this was an amazing course with an amazing professor. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It is an extremely interesting class that will make you think in completely new ways. It will change the way you approach life itself. It will be a reading challenge like you've never experienced. It will help you understand your own existence. "
