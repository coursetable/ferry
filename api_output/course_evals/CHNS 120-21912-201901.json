The only weakness is how quickly the course can go sometimes it is difficult to catch up if you miss a class. ",

I believe the Chinese department here is pristine and all of the professors care, and are passionate about their work and their students. The small class size is another motivation as it allows you to really get to know both your instructor and your classmates in a fun but challenging environment. ",
