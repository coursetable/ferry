            "\u00a0This was a great course for pinpointing the aspects of writing that I needed to improve upon. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write fiction and develop my ideas into stories. ",
            "\u00a0The art of writing fiction, designing plot, convey motifs through specific settings and the ability to workshop. ",
            "\u00a0This class allowed me to improve my creative writing techniques and allowed me a formal setting for working on short pieces.  My confidence in writing fiction improved and the class forced me to write much more often than I otherwise would have since we had weekly assignments.  I practiced revising stories and giving constructive feedback to my peers for their stories.  We also read and discussed professional short stories which helped me better understand different narrative styles and symbols. ",
            "\u00a0This class improved my ability to write and think critically about others' writing. I felt creatively challenged by this course more than any other class I have taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write, critique, edit and think about my personal fiction as well as fiction by my peers and by published authors. I also learned that going out of your comfort zone can be incredibly rewarding, especially for a writing course as amazing as this one! ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about my strengths and weaknesses as a writer. "

            "\u00a0The course was well organized, though I did wish that it had more readings. Although there wouldn't have been class time to discuss additional readings, they could be accompanied by out-of-class assignments relating to them so that there is engagement with the story. ",
            "\u00a0Overall I enjoyed the course a lot, as it was extremely helpful to my writing and also a lot of fun. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this class is Professor Choi. If you get a chance to take a class with her, please take it. Everyone interested in writing or fiction needs to take a class with Professor Choi. She is so articulate, kind, clever, and insightful. \r\nI wish the class would have a stronger focus on learning the different techniques of writing fiction by having more in class exercises or even out of class. ",
            "\u00a0I wish we had more writing exercises! But for now I love the readings and workshops we had. ",
            "\u00a0This class had many strengths!  I loved the readings we were assigned and our in-class discussions.  All our writing assignments were interesting and fun.  In addition to feedback from peers, we received generous feedback in the forms of corrected manuscripts and personal letters from Professor Choi.  If I were to improve this course I might assign a few more writing assignments or longer exercises. ",
            "\u00a0I think this class did a very effective job of constructing a small, close-knit community of writers. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strengths of this course are the workshops and Professor Choi. Both of these wonderful resources lead to wonderful feedback on your piece and not only helps you write a better finished product but also gives you a ton of confidence and improves your abilities as a writer! There weren't any noticeable weaknesses, but I will remark that you will not get much out of this class if you don't put much in. You have to be active during class, give long and insightful feedback, and really put your heart into your work if you want to reap the benefits of this class! ",

            "\u00a0This course is a wonderful course for anyone who wants to improve their fiction writing. However, most students who take the class are genuinely interested in writing and put a lot of effort into their pieces, so students who just want to take it as a gut would likely feel out of place. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend this course to any student serious about writing fiction, who wants to join a class with other such students and devote two solid class hours per week to discussing the craft. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in writing fiction, whether you're just starting out or have been working on a lot of pieces on your own already. You will definitely learn a lot, and get helpful feedback from everyone! ",
            "\u00a0If you get a spot in the class, TAKE IT.  Take it for Professor Choi above all else. Everyone interested in writing needs to take a class with her. No, EVERYONE needs to take a class with her at some point so you know what a professor should be like. She is so articulate, kind, warm, clever, and insightful. Such a gem of a human being. This was the class that I looked forward to going every week, which says a lot. It was a lot of fun to read and discuss everyone's writing in class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only if they are dedicated writers and are willing to read through others' works carefully and provide lots of feedback. ",
            "\u00a0Apply to this course!  It is so much fun and so well taught.  Professor Choi fosters smooth, interesting discussions about short fiction and workshop stories.  I really appreciated all the feedback I received from my peers and from Professor Choi.  Having creative writing homework forced me to write every week and to push forward with my short stories when I would have otherwise lost motivation.   I feel that my writing improved a lot during my time in the class. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, as it provides both the opportunity to be challenged as a writer and be part of a workshop community. ",
            "\u00a0YES! If you have even a tangential interest in writing fiction, do take this course! You DO NOT have to be a (prospective or otherwise) english major nor do you have to be a seasoned writer or whatever. All you have to be, is willing to give it your all! Do take it with Professor Choi if you can, she is an absolutely amazing professor who will give you great feedback (and invite a lot of dissent from other students too, at times). ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It was a fun and supportive environment. "
