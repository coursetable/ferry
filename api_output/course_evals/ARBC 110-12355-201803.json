            "\u00a0I am astonished at how quickly the course moved. I can already hold a basic conversation in Arabic, which is incredible for one semester's worth of a language. ",
            "\u00a0I learned reading, writing, conversation, and listening. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the Arabic alphabet, how to read and write in MSA, how to speak in the Shaami dialect, and some basic grammar and vocab. ",
            "\u00a0This class gave us a breadth of knowledge regarding the Arabic language. We learned speaking skills, focusing on the Shaami dialect, and skills in areas of reading, writing, and listening (in both MSA and Shaami). ",
            "\u00a0By the end of the course I was able to read, write, speak and understand basic Arabic sentences. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a good understanding of the basics of the Arabic language in writing, reading, and conversational skills. ",
            "\u00a0We learned the Arabic alphabet, vocabulary, grammar, and verbs in the present, past simple, past continuous, and future tenses. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the Arabic alphabet, how to write in MSA, and was introduced to the shaami dialect. After taking this course, I can speak in the present and past tense, discuss my course load, where I live, my family, and food items. "

            "\u00a0I thought the skits, while a lot of work to put together, were an excellent way to practice spoken Arabic. I'm very happy with the balance of written and spoken Arabic, and think that this is a perfect intro to the language. ",
            "\u00a0This course was fun and challenging but I advanced my skills a lot and enjoyed it. My only suggestion is that getting feedback on assignments sooner would have made it easier to learn from mistakes and change what I was doing for next time. ",
            "\u00a0A strength is the level of engagement and support available. All the TAs are always willing to help you and Ustaadha Elham's office hours are an invaluable resource.\r\n\r\nA weakness is perhaps the pace as sometimes it can be very overwhelming but I don't think it's too much of an issue you are learning a new language after all. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very good at teaching Arabic effectively and the only weakness was that there was a lot of homework that was time consuming more than it was effective. ",
            "\u00a0This class is very engaging and I learned a lot, and although there is a lot of work, all of it is relevant to helping students learn the language. ",
            "\u00a0The workload for this class is much more than any of the other classes purely because you meet every day and the homework can take 4 hours a night sometimes. ",
            "\u00a0This course is really amazing in how much you learn in such a short period of time. After only L1, we were able to write 800 word autobiographies! The final project is a 15 minute speaking section with a native Shaami speaker, and you will be amazed at how you can actually pick up a new language so quickly (even though the conversation won't be eloquent or enlightened). \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the course moves at an extremely quick pace. You learn the alphabet very quickly, and it was hard to learn all of the new sounds and train myself to be able to produce them. This semester Prof Elham had many students, so feedback was less timely than it had been in the past. I wish that I had gotten work back sooner, but it was nice that Prof Elham gave us feedback on our daily homework. "

            "\u00a0Yes - it is rigorous and a lot of work, but if you're dedicated to learning the language, you'll learn quickly, which is quite gratifying. ",
            "\u00a0absolutely, it was a lot of work but it was fun and payed off. ",
            "\u00a0YES!!! Arabic is such a fun language to learn and Elham is the absolute best. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. If determined to learn Arabic, this course is necessary and also helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend it for students who are particularly interested in learning a Arabic or are unsure of what language they want to learn and want one that is interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is an amazing course for those serious about learning the arabic language ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to another student. I feel much more capable in Arabic than I expected to be at the beginning of the semester, and although the workload is heavy, it is manageable and worth the effort. ",
            "\u00a0If you have a genuine interest in learning Arabic, it's worth taking despite the workload. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student. I was mainly interested in learning a non-Romance language and taking a language course that stretched me beyond my 12 years of French classes. ARBC 110 did that and more! It is an incredible language to learn, beautiful in script and in spoken word, and the grammar constructions will interest people who like to think about language systematically like an algorithm. "
