            "\u00a0I learned so much Chinese this semester. I can now read some basic paragraphs in Chinese, advertisements, and even Chinese magazine covers sometimes, which is a huge improvement from what I could read from first semester in Chinese! ",
            "\u00a0reading and writing chinese, Chinese culture ",
            "\u00a0I felt that my Chinese skills improved markedly after this semester. This semester focused a lot on composition of Chinese, which was very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to memorize characters much more effectively.\r\nMy Chinese level improved immensely compared to last semester. ",
            "\u00a0I furthered the knowledge and skills I began developing in CHNS 110. I improved control over Chinese vocabulary and grammar while increasing my confidence in speaking the language. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0It would be helpful to students if the grammar tested on daily quizzes was switched from Day 1 of a lesson to Day 2. As in, on Day 1 of a lesson, test the students on comprehending a sentence comprised of characters, and on Day 2 of a lesson, test the students on constructing a sentence using pinyin. ",
            "\u00a0This course is extremely engaging, and you develop a close relationship with everyone in your section as well as with your teachers, since you see them everyday. Your Chinese improves very quickly because you are speaking, writing, and listening to Chinese for over an hour every day. On the other hand, going to class every day (especially in the morning) can be a little tiring by the end of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: very efficient \r\nWeakness: could take more time to go through grammar, reviews ",
            "\u00a0I think the course is really strong in keeping you constantly engaged with the language, and also asking you to compose your own Chinese rather than just learn existing dialogues. I think that the course could be improved if more of the narrative memorizations focused on the student having to write their own narrative based on the dialogue read in class. ",
            "\u00a0It's very fast-paced, which is a blessing and a curse. Some days there is less work, and you should use that time to get ahead on other days. I think there are almost no weaknesses to this course, but I think class experience also depends heavily on the classmates you are with. Depending on your classmates, you will get more out of group talks and practice more effectively during class. ",
            "\u00a0Overall a really well-run course. It is fast-paced, but all the assignments are valuable and worth-while. ",
            "\u00a0Tutorials have limited benefit, TA sessions could be replaced with review sessions for the previous chapter once a week or something like that. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course because it's well-structured to help you learn a new language quickly. It may seem like a lot of work and effort to go to class and do homework every day, but it's well worth it. You will notice how much you improve, especially as your oral grades and test scores go up throughout the semester. It's a very rewarding class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are prepared for a heavy load of work ",
            "\u00a0Anyone interested in learning the Chinese language or learning any language in general should take this course. It lays a very good foundation for learning Chinese by forcing you to constantly use the language in original and multi-faceted ways. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I think you can learn a lot of Chinese even just through L1 and L2. The grammar is not that hard compared to some other languages, and if you do study abroad you will become even more excellent. The hardest part is remembering how to write characters and remember tones. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I've been very impressed with the way that Yale runs the Chinese language department. You get a lot of one-on-one instruction, the professors are all great, and after one academic year of Chinese instruction, I already have a basic proficiency of the language. "
