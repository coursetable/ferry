            "\u00a0This was my first time taking a workshop and I thought it was a great introduction to how the format works. As I learn more in my other classes, I hope to be more engaged. "

            "\u00a0I thought the tenor of the workshop was really great. Other workshops I attended were often combative and some of the participants were downright disrespectful. I was impressed that that was not at all the case in the IR workshop. The participants consistently offered thoughtful critiques without being rude. \r\n\r\nA weakness, though, was some of the subject matter of the workshop. It was very focused on political economy, which makes sense now but which I did not anticipate when I signed up for the workshop. Some of the work was so niche that I had a hard time understanding how it fit into broader IR research (the paper on medieval Florentine monetary policy stands out in this regard). "

            "\u00a0Yeah. Good way to learn about other works in progress in the field and get a sense of how scholars analyze research. ",
            "\u00a0Given my interests, I think I will probably sign up for the ISS workshop as my primary workshop next semester. However, I would definitely recommend the workshop to students interested in political economy and I plan to keep an eye on the upcoming presentations to keep attending on occasion. "
