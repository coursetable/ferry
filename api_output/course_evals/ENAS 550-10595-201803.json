            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how the human body works. The grad lab was helpful in developing a deeper understanding of the topics and giving me a background in using MatLab. ",
            "\u00a0Connecting structure and mechanism to larger functions ",
            "\u00a0I gained a deeper understanding for human physiology as compared to my undergraduate physiology courses. The fact that this course is taught primarily by BME faculty offers an interesting perspective that I would have otherwise been ignorant to. ",

            "\u00a0The graduate labs were great, and very useful!\r\n\r\nSome of the exams were a little unbalanced in terms of material covered. The second midterm shouldn't have had short answer parts which involved basically just rewriting the first part. The quizzes also took a shockingly long time to do. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - very thorough and I like that it taps into the expertise of many instructors\r\nWeaknesses - I honestly cant stress enough that this class does not meet the needs of graduate students. Making us take a weed out undergrad class during our first semester just sucked (I mean I made it to grad school, I dont really see a need for further weed out classes), with quizzes that ate up hours out of each weekend (have you ever thought about having the quiz open on Monday and due on Friday instead of dominating my weekend?) and lab assignments that added to our workload. I can promise you without a doubt in my mind that my research suffered so that I could pass this class. ",
            "\u00a0The learning objectives were very helpful in guiding us how to study for the exams. The graduate lab also helped reinforce a lot of the in-class concepts - hands-on work with certain topics made them easier to understand. The first graduate lab was a little disorganized, so it might be helpful to encourage students to download Matlab ahead of time. ",
            "\u00a0The professors are very engaging and care a lot about our experience learning in the course. The grad lab was very helpful. The quizzes were too long. Writing so much for each short answer in order to receive full credit took multiple hours. Quizzes could contain some multiple choice and true false so they are more similar to exams. I would've also liked to use more math on exams and rely less on memorization. It would have been helpful for the correct answers for the practice exams to have been posted as well. ",
            "\u00a0Strength- well organized \r\nWeakness- guest lectures seem a bit disconnected to the rest of the course in terms of expectations and learning objectives ",
            "\u00a0I noticed throughout the course that many of the powerpoint presentations did not have figure legends/figure numbers that correspond to the book. This made it difficult to reference the book when I needed further clarification. \r\nThe graduate discussion section was very helpful, but the fact that it takes place on Tuesday and often involves material that will not be covered until the end of the week makes it somewhat challenging. \r\nThis course provides a phenomenal understanding of the renal system that I really appreciated. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: General knowledge useful for any career focusing on human biology/physiology\r\n\r\nWeakness: Weird emphasis on certain systems and ignoring other, more important systems. Why did we have 5-6 renal lectures and only half a lecture on the liver when even the instructors said it is both more important and more complex? \r\n\r\nThe Tests were also poorly administered. There was a fair level of challenge in the actual questions, but it was ridiculous to not have an actual exam period for the two midterms. It really stinks, because the class was very good, and you could tell the instructors put a lot of time into it, but then it just appeared as if they didn't even try to make the exams an accurate assessment of student knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0Some topics had different pace and depth. An extreme example is how reproductive systems was taught in just one lecture, whereas, some other systems took up to 6-7 lectures. ",
            "\u00a0Graduate lab is interesting and it could be better if we can do other things instead of matlab ",
            "\u00a0The material was intellectually challenging and interesting, but the amount of detail I needed to know seemed a bit irrelevant to my topic of study. ",
            "\u00a0Reinstate extra credit for going to discussion section for grad students ",
            "\u00a0Exams were too long. Expectations for some open response questions were somewhat unclear. Final exam would be better off being on the last third of the class only--way too much material to prepare for in my opinion. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: A wide spectrum of knowledge. Weekly quiz helps reinforce what you learn. \r\nWeaknesses: Just like other biological courses, too many contents to memorize before exams. Though helpful, the weekly quiz prevents me from enjoying my weekends. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: The course invited several professors from the school of medicine who could teach the course in a clinical-case-study way.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Homework took too much time to complete. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the combination of lectures, quiz, discussions and TF sessions is very helpful for students to understand the course.\r\nWeaknesses: the final exam contains too much details which are hard to remember exactly.\r\nI think the course should emphasize on main idea of physiology system rather than trivial details.

However, I will not recommend this course to students who only needs a moderate level of knowledge in biology because the workload of course is quite high and most of the knowledge may not be necessary for them.
