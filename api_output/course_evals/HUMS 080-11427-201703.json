            "\u00a0I learned a lot about different operas and how librettists and composers work to create operas from literature and other source materials. ",
            "\u00a0How to write a better opera libretto and compare the evolution and adaptation of texts ",
            "\u00a0As the name of the course suggests, I learned about what's gained and what's lost when converting a work into an opera. Not only did I learn about different operas and composers, but I also had a lot of fun along the way. Great class. ",
            "\u00a0As a multi-disciplinary artist, I developed a wide range of insight and perspective on collaboration, and how people come together to develop a shared concept. Opera is a very intense art form, and it was fascinating to see how the composer and librettist would engage with the literature and text, ultimately developing a show that varied from the most truthful of adaptations to completely unique concepts. ",
            "\u00a0In taking this course I gained a lot of familiarity with opera and its conventions, and some of the methods of adapting literature, mostly plays and short novels, into the operatic medium. Along the way I ended up developing an appreciation for opera and all the work that goes into creating one. A generally fun time. ",
            "\u00a0In my childhood, I performed in the Met Children's Chorus. Taking this class was meant to rekindle the memories and experiences I had from then. Definitely, I was able to take away a deeper sense of what opera is as an art form, what it means to play a character, and how the different aspects of text, music, narrative create the opera. ",
            "\u00a0I learned operatic history, as well as the artistic process of transforming and adapting works of the literary canon for the operatic stage. ",
            "\u00a0I was introduced to a variety of literary classics as well as classic operas. I learned about the process of making stories and plays suitable for the stage and the history of major composers and writers. "

            "\u00a0Strengths- Super fun! Most of the work involves watching a 2.5 hr or so opera every week, along with reading some source material and occasionally doing a short assignment. A nice change from more intense courses. We also got to go on a class field trip to the Metropolitan Opera to see La Boheme!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- No real weaknesses! ",
            "\u00a0The introductory class should be more welcoming to people who aren't familiar with opera and give a better overview of what the art form is. ",
            "\u00a0We essentially cover one opera a week, which is both a strength and a weakness. It's great because we get to learn about many operas, but we also don't go super in depth. I really liked the structure of the class and had no problem with the pace of it. ",
            "\u00a0Quite honestly, there were no weaknesses in this course. Judith is a very honest and deliberate professor. She knows how to build a curriculum that will ultimately deliver exactly what you would expect of this class. The material covered was diverse in time period, topic, development, and genre. As a woman who has dedicated her life to music and opera, she was an invaluable resource, and was always skilled at maneuvering the conversations to ideas that no one in the class would have expected. ",
            "\u00a0This course tended to use multiple types of media, like videos of different versions of a certain opera. We also got to visit the music archive in GML, where we learned some of the history of operatic convention and listened to record cylinders. The willingness to use several different types of media helped me engage with the business of adaptation and I thought it was a strength of the course. On the other hand, I thought that because the course was discussion based and everyone in the room was so excited about music and opera, the conversation easily veered away from the big questions in the syllabus. We often ended up talking about musical aesthetics rather than what was lost or gained in adapting a work of literature for the stage. If we had a more structured set of questions to discuss I think we might have stayed more on topic. We also didn't have very many small assignments besides reading and watching - the few writing assignments that we had were pretty fun, but might not have stimulated thought about authenticity and adaptation. Would have liked to have had more thought-provoking writing assignments. Maybe reading/watching responses? ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are the variety of operas that we got to see and the way that we went about moving from the source material to the libretto to the opera. ",
            "\u00a0Because of the scheduling of the class, we occasionally only had two days to do two hundred or so pages of reading. Other than the scheduling, very strong course. ",
            "\u00a0This course is wry loose and can be personalised to the individual. There are no weaknesses I wish to note. "

            "\u00a0Yes! I knew almost nothing about operas going in, while a friend in my class was essentially an expert already, and we both loved the class. Professor Malafronte knows a ton about opera and will give you greater insight into the works we watch than you could ever get watching them on your own. If you have any interest in theatre or music, you will probably enjoy this class and the operas you watch in it. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely ",
            "\u00a0Yes, take the class, especially if you know nothing about opera. It's entertaining and informative. ",
            "\u00a0Anyone considering a career in art, whether you be a writer, composer, performer, actor, or artist, I would highly recommend this class. One of the most fundamental parts of art is learning how to translate your thoughts through your work, and there is no better way to develop that ability than to study multi-disciplinary art like opera. ",
            "\u00a0The seminar, at least in my experience, attracted many musicians and people who were already interested in opera. If one is well-versed in opera, it might be very fun to delve into the inner workings of the final product. For people who had never seen an opera before but were interested in music, like me, the experience might have been a little different. Some of the references and comparative discussion went a little over my head, but I still managed to have a good time in the class and cultivate an appreciation for the art form. I'd take the class if you are at all interested in classical music, plays and drama, or how one piece of art becomes another. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to students interested in learning more about opera in a very broad sense. We did hone in on the literary aspects of the artform, but the study of opera was still quite holistic. ",
            "\u00a0I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this course. The material is fascinating, the workload is light, and the company is great. ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this to fans of opera (or even Broadway musicals), a very fun and stimulating class. "
