            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how to structure a paper and make clear figures. As well as gaining an overview into many different aspects of cell biology. ",
            "\u00a0The material that we covered was newly published findings in cell biology, but the main skill developed in this class for me was reading scientific papers outside of my comfort zone. I also learned that even when I am not familiar with the field a paper is coming from, my general observations about the quality of the science aligned better than I first thought with what those who did know the field thought. ",
            "\u00a0Having no previous background in cell biology this course allowed me to become familiar with common techniques and approaches. ",
            "\u00a0This course developed my basic knowledge of concepts and techniques in cell biology. The course allowed me to practice reading papers for both content and clarity as well as judging paper quality. This course also gave me new insights into cell biology as a field. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: the professors' comments helped us to pay particular attention to analyzing the paper, instead of describing the context figure by figure. The presentations were also helpful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I don't like the way that each of us described one figure or panel since it made us focused on only the figure that we were supposed to talk about. ",
            "\u00a0the student in the class is too many ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the discussions, but there was one dude in the class who was really annoying and disruptive. He was condescending and didn't listen to women most of the time and I feel like his behavior kinda killed discussion sometimes and I wish the professors would have intervened and made him talk less so other people could talk. Otherwise, everything about the class was really great. ",
            "\u00a0Strength - introduction on what are the questions for the figures\r\nWeakness- No representation of women faculty until the last 2 classes. Also in one lecture it seemed as if the professors were mocking graduate students and undergraduate interpetation of a figure which followed by a comment about a female guest speaker invited to the the cell bio department a mentioning a comment if her research could be seen in \"reindeer feet\" seemed disrespectful. Therefore, I didn't have the guts to talk about my ideas or misunderstanding of the paper discussion for future classes ",
            "\u00a0It needs to be smaller to allow for productive discussion. ",
            "\u00a0I think it is a strength that the students were allowed to suggest the papers, however sometimes the discussion wasn't as engaging as it could be since the paper was new to everyone. A different format in which the professors use the same papers every year I think can lead to more engaging discussion. ",
            "\u00a0I liked that the paper topics and individual papers were chosen by the students. I also liked that there was a mix of strong and weak papers that we could discuss as a class. I liked the course much better than the Fall seminar in cell biology because of the ideal mix of professors leading the course and its consistent learning structure. This has been the best class I've taken in grad school so far.\r\n\r\nWhile I felt that the grouping system worked well because of the large size and mix of backgrounds in the class, I would have liked having a class of 10 or less people with discussions that didn't split students into groups to go over the paper. I think it's worth considering offering multiple sections of the course because of its high demand. ",
            "\u00a0The major strength of this course is that the discussions are led by the students which forces us to read background information and be familiar with every detail of the paper.  The major weakness of the course is that the majority of the classes we didn't finish the paper, sometimes we either skipped or sped through some of the most interesting parts of the paper.  To improve this, students leading the discussion should be encouraged to select only a fraction of the panels from each figure to present. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- discussion based format. 2 presentations a semester was great because we could go in depth on two different topics. \r\nweaknesses- I didn't like the 'split into groups and review each figure' format we adopted part way through the year. although it forced everyone to talk, I didn't think it helped the discussion. Also, the class size was a bit too big "

            "\u00a0Yeah, especially students that don't have as much background in cell bio because you'll learn a lot. ",
            "\u00a0If the centered topics revolved around lipids, neurons, and immunobiology then each week for each group assign them to choose 1 paper out of 10 that the faculty suggest to present on that week. Additionally, it would be beneficial to described what about the research in the paper we discussed contributed to being put in high tier journals. ",
            "\u00a0Only if they are in the Cell Biology department ",
            "\u00a0Yes as the work load was manageable and the papers were interesting. The professors were also fun to work with. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course because I gained practical knowledge of reading papers more thoroughly in addition to an increase in didactic knowledge of the literature itself. This type of learning is impossible to achieve through a traditional lecture-based system, and the instructors did a great job of facilitating healthy discussions over both the content and the context of the literature. I wish that more graduate school classes were structured this way. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I feel the ability to read and understand a paper is a skill that graduate student must learn to become successful, this class excels in teaching that. It also provides info on a wide range of cell bio topics I wouldn't necessarily read about, which expands my understanding of cell bio. "
