            "\u00a0This course is like being pressed slowly through a meat grinder. When you come out the other side, you might be broken, but you'll be able to speak French. Tons of grammar and tons of French media ",
            "\u00a0This course was a continuation of perfecting many of the skills that are learned in previous French classes, especially oral communication skills because high quality and frequent participation are necessary. ",
            "\u00a0This class enriched my vocabulary and improved my grammar. Now, I can read and write in French with relative ease. ",
            "\u00a0Went over basically all of basic french grammar, got into the annoying nitty-gritty stuff. Helped with my conversation abilities because the class really forced me to participate. ",
            "\u00a0I developed my confidence is speaking french. Through group discussion in class I was forced to think and speak off the cuff, this improving my fluency. I also furthered my knowledge of vocabulary and grammar. ",
            "\u00a0I developed my skills of speaking French, writing French, and learning about French culture and literature. I also learned a plethora of grammar and grammatical techniques to use in writing and speaking French. This course advanced my French abilities immensely. "

        [
            "\u00a0The books and films are ~hit or miss~ but for every piece that is tedious, there is another that is great and no one agrees on the good or bad ones-  its purely preference ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The books/short stories we read and the movies we watched were super interesting and always led to engaging in class discussions, which made it easier to participate. Madame Schneider is a fantastic French teacher and her energy and enthusiasm for teaching made the class even better.\r\nWeaknesses: Not really a weakness, but this class definitely requires a significant amount of preparation. ",
            "\u00a0This class is really engaging and interesting. You need to be ready to participate multiple times throughout each class and you should expect that your mistakes will be used as teaching opportunities. Once you accept this, you will find that the class is very enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths and weaknesses are inherently linked for this class. There is an absolute TON of work. Mme Schneider can really be forceful about participation and doesn't hold back when you've made a mistake. The strengths are that my French did improve. The weakness is that I hated myself every day, I got no sleep, when other work came up the french you still had to do washed over you, and it wasn't really rewarding at all because I was too tired to realize my french was getting better. ",
            "\u00a0The amount of oral work in class is a strength. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: mix of grammar, writing, and speaking techniques; teacher is very willing to meet outside of class; read interesting books/plays and viewed interesting movies; feeling of rigor and intensity in class.\r\nWeaknesses: not much room for natural error in learning a new language; grading very harsh. ",
            "\u00a0I think we need WAY more conversation practice in L5. More speaking practice. "

            "\u00a0Entirely. Sometimes the overload of reading and grammar and essay-writing is hellish but it really does improve you 10-fold ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! My French improved so much over the course of this semester and this class was amazing. Everything we read / watched was super interesting. This is definitely a challenging class and requires a lot of preparation outside of class to be able to participate and get all of the work done, but it is so rewarding to see your French improve so much over the course of the semester! ",
            "\u00a0Take this class if you want to invest in your French skills. You will almost certainly improve. It is not easy, but it is certainly feasible to get an A if you put in the work. Madame Schneider is an incredible teacher with a ton of energy. ",
            "\u00a0No. I'm sorry but no. If you have an easy semester and you're just doing this to get your language out of the way, I guess. But really, you could do anything else. This one hurts and is depressing. there were 10 major assignments. That's just ridiculous. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is a good course to develop oral skills and further knowledge of french literature and film. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to other students who want to learn to speak French fluently and completely. It is definitely a difficult course, but it is worth it in terms of the breadth of material that we learn. "
