            "\u00a0I learned a lot about when to use the different verb tenses in French. I also developed my speaking through the discussion of important works of French literature such as l'etranger by Albert Camus. ",
            "\u00a0In this class my french only improved. My writing and reading skills especially have increased remarkably since when I finished French L2. ",
            "\u00a0I feel more confident with my vocabulary and understanding of different verb forms such as the subjunctive and conditional, which were shaky before I took this class. ",

            "\u00a0I think the books and the movies are the strength of the class because they lead to good class discussion and they make the students utilize their French vocabulary in different ways. I think the main weakness of the course are the MMP's that follow the film Jules et Jim. They do help us learn but a lot of the things seem redundant. ",
            "\u00a0There are no weaknesses, I think the balance of books and movies we read was adequate. ",
            "\u00a0A focus on speaking in the classroom, I felt as though there was not much of a focus on speaking, writing or forming sentences. ",
            "\u00a0I feel like the French speaking portion of the course should be emphasized a little more because I still feel that speaking and listening was a weakness for everybody. ",
            "\u00a0Heavy workload that doesnt always feel valuable, class would be stronger if there was more time for students to practice speaking the language instead of just memorizing "

            "\u00a0Yes! It was a very effective and engaging and ENJOYABLE French class and I highly enjoyed it. "
