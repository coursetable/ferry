            "\u00a0I gained a better understanding of the evolving relationship between business and government, especially in former socialist countries. The course was focused on analyzing specific case studies from various countries, and I learned how to compare and contrast these examples. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much important political theory and practical knowledge about developing countries around the world. I learned how to write a political science research paper. ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge of several case studies that highlighted different facets of the dynamics between business and government since the fall of the Soviet Union. ",
            "\u00a0I only developed a few insights from this course: mainly that the line between private and public sectors is being blurred, and that big business can actually exert political influence in constructive ways. I gained scattered knowledge about political economy transactions around the world, which was interesting but difficult to tie together. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me to apply my prior political science and economics knowledge to analyze and learn from countries experiences transitioning to market based economies. I wrote a self-directed research paper. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a strong understanding of how the collapse of the USSR and the end of the Cold War recast business-government relations in the former Communist world and the West.\r\n\r\nThis course did a phenomenal job of giving us tangible instances in which the business and government have worked together harmoniously (i.e. BEE in South Africa, Breaking the Impasse in Israel/Palestine) "

            "\u00a0The strengths of the course come from the variety of topics that are covered as well as the expertise of Professor Shapiro and the guest speakers he brought in. Weaknesses were the lack of depth in our studies, and how the order of the course curriculum was largely shaped by the availability of the guest lecturers, not necessarily by a logical sequence. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Shapiro is a well of knowledge, and the guest speakers he invited all came with real-world experience. The reading was very manageable, and the discussion was enlightening. \r\n\r\nweaknesses: the class began to lose some steam towards the end (guest speakers' lecturing styles differ in engagability, for example, and there was less room for discussion then). The grading was also fairly harsh, and there is no real way to know how you're doing in the class while you're in it. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Incredibly well organized, with excellent and knowledgeable lectures and guest lecturers.\r\nWeaknesses: There could be more feedback on reading responses. Feedback on midterm is good. This is a larger seminar that's more lecture than discussion. I liked the format but it may not appeal to everyone. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were certainly the speakers that Professor Shapiro brought to the class. Each was well-versed in their field and conveyed very powerful ideas clearly and concisely. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are that the premise of the course is interesting and the guest speakers help to engage students with real-world issues.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses of this course is that the syllabus is far too scattered to provide students with a cohesive body of knowledge or skills. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course was definitely the amazing speakers that Prof. Shapiro brought in on a weekly basis. Each speaker brought country-specific expertise and their own perspective on transitions to market economies. It would have been great to analyze these transitions from a theoretical lens as well. ",
            "\u00a0S:\r\n\r\n-Guest speakers (most of them)\r\n-Focus on tangible instances of business-government relations\r\n-Personal / Empirical experience of Professor Shapiro (SPZs, visit to USSR)\r\n-Mix of undergraduate and graduate student population\r\n-Crisp presentations with a ton of useful information\r\n\r\nW:\r\n\r\n-Some guest speakers not engaging\r\n-Most valuable parts of course are when Shapiro speaks so when he doesn't it's almost like we're missing out on content. He connects information and analyzes really well.\r\n-Reading responses seem almost unnecessary, primarily because they are barely factored into the class "

            "\u00a0Yes, take it ",
            "\u00a0Yes it was intimidating at times being in a class with mostly graduate students and with Professor Shapiro, but it really opens your eyes to the potential of business in more areas that you may think. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely! The class composition (half SOM/half senior EPE majors) was different and engaging. Definitely would recommend, but be aware that it is hard to cruise by without doing the work--the exams and papers are not forgiving. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course is an incredible experience. Professor Shapiro knows EVERYTHING and invites the most fascinating guests. It is challenging but worth every long walk to the SOM building. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student interested in analyzing the issue of business and government through case studies (not a survey course), and engaging in these discussions with SOM students, who make up the bulk of the class. ",
            "\u00a0This is an amazing course. It brings together people from all across the university to think about how business and government work together in various contexts. Shapiro brings in some of the best speakers, by the end of the course you will feel as if you know a little bit about many country's transitions to market based economies. The course is broad but if you elect to do the long research paper you will also have a chance to delve deep into a topic of particular interest to you. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in the unique ways in which business and government can work together harmoniously, then take this course. Professor Shapiro is a stud and really really knows the material that he is teaching (often incorporating personal experience like his trip to the old USSR). The content is tangible and I found myself learning something really interesting every class (taking place in SOM).\r\n\r\nThe workload is manageable and you have to do the readings to really get something out of the course. Other than readings, you're expected to submit 4 short reading responses over the course of the semester and then you have a final exam (or final paper). "
