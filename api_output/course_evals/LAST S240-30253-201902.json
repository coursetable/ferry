            "\u00a0Over the course of my time in Ecuador, my fluency in the Spanish language and my knowledge of the country's culture both improved tremendously. Learning occurred both in the classroom and in the local communities. These dual settings allowed me to learn about the language in an academic setting while also developing my everyday speaking ability. ",
            "\u00a0During this course, I learned so many skills and insights. I learned about the indigenous people of Ecuador in the Amazon, the Sierra, and the coast. I learned to delve deeper into a culture and learn about the indigenous people suppressed by Spanish culture and basically erased from their own country's history. I absolutely loved going to talk to these native communities in a foreign language and learn about their history, culture, and status in the modern Ecuadorian society. I also learned how to efficiently speak Spanish and how to communicate my expressions more. ",
            "\u00a0I was able to improve my Spanish through speaking with locals and learned about Ecuadorian history, art, politics, and contemporary social issues through various Ecuadorian films. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely improved my Spanish in both vocabulary and pronunciation, but my biggest gain was probably in confidence with the language. It's not enough time to really get fluent, but I feel excited to keep working on it this year and into the future. I also learned a ton of Ecuadorean (and Latin American) history and culture. ",
            "\u00a0I learned an extensive amount about the culture of Ecuador and what life is like in another country. I also greatly improved my ability to speak and understand the Spanish language. As well, the course helped me gain an outside perspective of the United States. ",
            "\u00a0Improved Spanish, learned about Ecuadorian history and got to visit the many different ecosystems in Ecuador. ",
            "\u00a0Being in Ecuador, I had the experience of speaking Spanish in an everyday setting. This allowed me to grow in my confidence of speaking Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0expansion of my worldview and understanding of Ecuadorian culture, more confidence/fluency in Spanish "

            "\u00a0The main strength of the program is that it took advantage of the diversity that exists in Ecuador to facilitate real world learning. Through visiting many of the local communities, we were shown many different aspects of Andean culture and how they affect Ecuador today.\r\n\r\nThe main weakness of the program was the lack of communication on many of our class trips. While I greatly enjoyed most of the trips, I often had little idea what we were driving to whenever we got onto the bus. This made it difficult to pack and difficult to plan the day. This could be improved by a daily announcement of some kind that informs the class what to expect for the day and what to bring. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, we did not return to Quito until late Sunday night for two or three of our weekend trips. As I avoided bringing my laptop to the more remote regions of the country, it was extremely difficult to complete the work that was due for class on Monday. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the trips and learning opportunities we had outside the classroom, but I found the coursework to be disorganized and not the most educational. Often times our assigned readings and in classwork seemed to be scattered in theme, lacking clear focus.  A lot of the class centered on films, including interviews with prominent Ecuadorian filmmakers. While I really appreciated this opportunity to meet and talk with the artists, I think we lacked the knowledge about film theory and filmmaking to properly discuss these movies, especially in a Spanish. I would recommend more instruction about film theory, or better yet less of us interviewing the filmmakers and more of them presenting their work and explaining their artistic choices. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: exploring so many different regions of Ecuador, being able to make new close friends, learning about native history, going to a local university\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: professor, some of the scheduling, communication between organizers and students. \r\n\r\nI loved the professor's attitude going into the program, but when we had guest speakers she constantly interrupted them and sometimes spoke in a space in which it was not her space to speak. She would not communicate what exactly we were doing in a given day and we would be ill prepared for the day ahead. On some of the weekend trips, furthermore, we got back late Sunday night but still had class the next day, which seemed a little unfair considering the amount of homework that would accumulate over the weekend. ",
            "\u00a0One of the biggest strengths was being in a setting where you have to speak Spanish at all times with locals, which helped me improve my Spanish rapidly. In addition, classes were only three days a week for a reasonable time, balancing outside activities with classroom activities. However, the course was often disorganized which gave the students much unnecessary stress. Homework was concentrated at the worst possible times where we actually did not have enough time to do it due to scheduled activities, and a lot of the homework was not necessary. There was very little transparency on what we were being graded on for our presentations and final exam. Some of the excursions were a bit disorganized too (i.e. Esmeraldas cultural presentation/Archidona). Assignments were either not graded until after the class was over or were returned a day before the next. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very interesting poetry, literature, and film from Ecuador. Also, it's super cool to actually meet the people behind all these things. Level of Spanish is challenging but very manageable. Weaknesses: sometimes readings are excessive and expectations for the class not always clear. Also it is not truly full immersion because a lot of time is spent with the other Yale students. This is great to meet people, but even when speaking to each other in Spanish, it's not as helpful as conversing with native speakers. ",
            "\u00a0A major strength of the course is the immersive nature of it. Being able to travel and interact in Ecuador was what taught me the most. I cannot think of any specific weaknesses to highlight. ",
            "\u00a0There could have been better communication between organizers and students. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is the location. Ecuador is beautiful, and the people are very willing to speak Spanish with you. The course could be most improved if it had a different professor. ",
            "\u00a0I kind of wish there was less emphasis on film. More organization and clarity would be helpful. (we didn't know what was on the final until a couple days before, and then the topics on the exam changed less than 24 hours before the exam) "

            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. Spending five weeks in Ecuador is a once in a lifetime experience, and the program is organized in such a way that it takes full advantage of the diversity of the country. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student specially for our excursions to different locations in Ecuador. I appreciated the focus on education through travel and interaction with Ecuadorian culture, and I learned the more through these trips than I ever could have in a classroom. However the work we did have in class was often tedious, and I would warn potential students about the disorganized nature of the academic side of this program. ",
            "\u00a0Alrighty, I would not entirely recommend this class but hear me out. The class is amazing; you get to explore an entirely different country with so much cultural diversity and biodiversity that it is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Truly incredible. However, the professor and some of the scheduling weren't the greatest. They would not always tell us what we needed on trips sometimes so it made a lot of us frustrated because there was such a prevalent lack of communication. In terms of the professor, she tends to interrupt guest speakers quite often and had offended a couple friends of mine who were people of color. We tried to enlighten her at the end of the program about some of the flaws and she seemed to just make excuses for them and dismiss the matter. I would definitely recommend this course to EVERY student but only if there were a DIFFERENT professor. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, despite the course's many flaws, the overall program was amazing. We went to a ton of different places not just in Quito but also in other parts of the country like the Amazon and the beach (Esmeraldas) which were quite fun. In addition, I particularly enjoyed the homestay aspect of the program - my families in Peguche and Quito were friendly, welcoming people who helped me improve my Spanish and immersed me in Ecuadorian culture. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would. It is a great way to learn some Spanish and a ton of Ecuadorean history and culture. If you're considering study abroad for Spanish and you don't want to hear more about a European country (Spain) then this is a great course to take. It's a fair amount of work, but super fun to travel all around the country. You will also get to see a lot of films and meet the directors behind them which is a pretty awesome experience. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The course material provided a comprehensive summary of the history of Ecuador. Additionally, the course included many outside activities that were just as important and enjoyable as the in class activities. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, you get to visit so many beautiful places, and learn a lot about the history of Ecuador. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, taking this course is a really nice opportunity. They have the opportunity to meet people who live the culture and history that you learn about in class, and they get to practice Spanish all of the time. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend it for the cultural immersion experience, but less for the strength of the class. "
