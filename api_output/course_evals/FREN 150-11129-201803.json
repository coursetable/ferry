            "\u00a0A good treatment of important topics in French grammar, and great practice in reading, writing, listening to, and speaking French ",
            "\u00a0solidified more grammar skills (much like in FREN 140), learned important vocab words, read great books (e.g., Boule de Suif, Tous les matins du monde), and watched some great films ",
            "\u00a0This course really helped me improve my grammar in French and improve my reading and speaking skills. I learned a lot of vocabulary over the course of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0French 150 really strengthened my grammar in a very rigorous way. I also learned more about French media and literature in general, as well as deep diving into a few well-known contemporary and historical writers. Overall, I learned the most in this class out of all my classes this semester, and I'm walking away with a much better grounding in high-level details of the French language. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of French grammar and vocabulary, and my written and oral French improved a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Greatly improved my grammar and comprehension skills, as well as my ability to think critically in French. ",
            "\u00a0Extensive knowledge of French grammar and a wealth of vocabulary. Greatly appreciated the readings, particularly Ionesco and Maupassant (Quignard too, since he offered a portrait of Versailles France; Maupassant similarly, with regard to the Franco-Prussian War). Emphasis on speaking in class was particularly helpful. Felt my French improved in this course more than any other. Madame Schneider is absolutely wonderful, always cheery yet at the same time challenging -- and very dedicated to her students. ",
            "\u00a0Taking this class helped me perfect my basic and intermediate French grammar (to the point where I am confident that I will never, ever make basic grammar mistakes again). It also helped me practice advanced grammar, although I think I will need more practice in the future in order to truly perfect it. I think my oral French has improved greatly  the oral examinations were a little stressful but ultimately forced me (in a good way) to practice speaking in French. Also, through reading works by Ionesco, Reza, Maupassant, etc., I learned a little more about French literature and history (especially about the 16th century and the Franco-Prussian War). I also feel that my aural comprehension has skyrocketed; now I can understand much of French movies/ TV without having to rely on subtitles. "

            "\u00a0It was an outstanding course through and through ",
            "\u00a0This course's strong emphasis on grammar and vocabulary is great for anyone looking to improve their French grammatical skills and to expand their knowledge of the French language. It is engaging and rigorous. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: seminar style setting allows for constant speaking practice, and development of a close class dynamic. The fact that our course packet was written by Madame Schneider herself also made the content really accessible and more understandable. I also really loved the detailed feedback on all the writing we produced in the course, as that really helped me improve. The vocabulary requirement was also crucial in helping me to improve my french. \r\nWeakness: French as a language has lots of exceptions. Sometimes I wish we could have been given a little more direction on which were the most common/important ones to focus on. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: absolutely loved this course. Mme Schneider is such a great teacher, and every class with her is really fun and engaging. I think my French is the best it's ever been since I started learning the language.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It's quite a lot of work, but I feel like after a few weeks, you can figure out a way to manage the work. And if you put in the work, it will definitely pay off. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: high level of student-professor interaction, due to the small class size, and thought-provoking discussions in class about readings. Weaknesses: very high workload, sometimes with many assignments due in a very short period of time. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths: emphasis on class discussion, on developing a broad vocabulary and methods of grammar, etc. My only complaint would be that essay writing is left to the students to really work at. Would suggest incorporating great French essays into the curriculum, so that students can really learn to write in a Francophone style. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very well designed. The workload was constant but not too crazy, and every day I was learning something new. The grammar exercises were repetitive enough but not boring. The writing exercises and redactions helped push our French writing abilities by encouraging us to produce meaningful/ thoughtful responses (in other words, our responses were just as complex and thoughtful as any papers in English we would have in other classes). We all had equal and frequent chances to speak in class. It was a little stressful to not have word banks on the test, so we just had to remember what words were/ werent on the vocab list. Other than that, I dont think there are any major issues to this course! "

            "\u00a0Absolutely, if you are motivated to learn French and out in the time and effort, this is a great course ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to any student looking to improve their French at an advanced level. This class is super engaging, the texts were interesting, and while the grammar exercises were a bit dull, they are really helpful in improving grammatical skills. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely. This course is very rigorous and will make you learn a lot about both French language and culture. ",
            "\u00a0100% yes. If you like French and want to improve your language skills (both spoken and written), please take this course! ",
            "\u00a0Yes - especially if the goal is to quickly improve grammar and speaking skills in French. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I think if you want to take literature courses in the future, or simply gain proficiency in speaking, the vocabulary you develop in this course is essential. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take it! If you have come this far, it doesnt make sense to stop now! FREN 150 really is when you get to start interesting conversations and writing exercises. Its challenging not only in terms of foreign language, but also in terms of literature analysis. It only meets three times a week as opposed to five, and the workload is pretty manageable. However, it is very challenging and you need to be on your A-game during every class  be ready to speak and give thoughtful contributions. Suivez ce cours et bon courage! "
