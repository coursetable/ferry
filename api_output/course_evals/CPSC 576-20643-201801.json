            "\u00a0The strength of the course is its seminar-like organization. The lectures are not information heavy, but leave you with enough information and knowledge to go look up the material in the provided notes or online. A lot of the things we discussed in class are active research fields, which made it even more interesting to me. \r\n\r\nI liked the organization of the course, but I wish there were fewer topics, and more time dedicated to each one. The homework assignments in this course were great too. However, I would also have liked more frequent and regular homework, because the quantitative nature of a lot of the material made most sense to me when I did the psets. Honestly, I would have been very lost without them. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely. The course assumes a fairly solid background in linear algebra. Knowledge of graph theory would help too. Take the intro course in Fall first, before you take the advanced course. What you learn from this course is a very solid function of the amount of time you are willing to spend outside of the class. The lectures are fine, but not information heavy, and so you need to find your own way through. ",
