There was no syllabus, so we had very few assignments at the beginning of the semester and a lot at the end. This was not ideal in theory, but the assignments got easier towards the end despite there being more of them, so it wasn't a huge problem. The material was very understandable and explained well at the beginning of the semester, but towards the end I found myself relying heavily on the textbook because I felt that I was not learning anything in class.

In class, it can be hard to follow R code and I feel there needs to be a more interactive element to question understanding as the professor teaches code in class, because it is easy to check out of the lectures. Sometimes the questions on the problem sets weren't easy to answer solely based on what material was covered in lecture; it required a more complex understanding. The professor made clear what would be covered on the quizzes and the tests, which was helpful. ",

Lectures were pretty hard to follow because a lot of the information was written out by hand on the blackboard and it was easy to miss. The textbook made understanding a little easier, but I would have appreciated some lecture slides to review after class. \r\nOtherwise, the grade distribution (homeworks, quizzes, exams, projects) were all pretty straightforward. I appreciated the pretty even grade distribution between all different parts of the class and that it was easy to improve your grade. ",

Code was often provided for trickier parts of homework assignments, but it was hard to truly gain an understanding of the course material. The final project was also not explained particularly well; most of us were confused as to what the professor was looking for in the project until the very end of the class. ",

The main takeaway from the course was the different graphs you would use in different scenarios. We barely learned any math that one would use in statistics. It was just one chapter that wasn't even covered on the final. Also, the textbook used has very poor explanations. I am surprised that Yale does not preapprove textbooks because this was Prof. William's first couple of years teaching at Yale and he is already using his own textbook. ",
