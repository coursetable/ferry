            "\u00a0I learned about the antitrust framework employed in the US/europe and some other countries. Most of the class takes you through different areas of competition enforcement via case studies (there is a lot of reading), you cover cartel dynamics, different monopolization strategies, as well as mergers and joint ventures. Definitely provided me a fascinating new lens through which to look at the overall macro structures in the US economy/ongoing developments between companies and analyzing that in relation to other problems we have in the US (ex. increasing inequality). A cool intersection between law and economics as well. ",
            "\u00a0Mind blowing insights into how things like scheming credit card markets work or how Google is taking over the world. Do not join a cartel, you will go to jail. Some practical knowledge about how to avoid being prosecution. ",
            "\u00a0You will learn a lot. Without much business background, you'll be introduced to basic strategy (most of it is pretty intuitive/common-sense) and then thrown into legalese. This is not a bad thing. I was very ignorant about the American legal system and more fundamentally what anti-trust meant; I had always thought that anti-trust and anti-competitive were completely distinct terms. "

            "\u00a0Fiona is hilarious and insightful. She logic chops her way through some interesting cases and definitely makes early morning lecture worthwhile. She doesn't always use lecture slides though and that would be incredibly helpful for reviewing material/following along. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: \r\n-Fiona is an an intelligent and engaging professor - she is smart, confident, and way more than competent. she knows her material and it's her bread and butter, and you can tell. \r\n-the content is important and relatively well-organized \r\n-if you're in Yale College, the chance to meet and work with YLS/SOM students is pretty cool \r\n\r\nweaknesses: \r\n-I really liked the presentation/paper at the end of the semester -which there were more, smaller opportunities for engaging with course material throughout the semester \r\n-at times felt like way too much memorization needed to succeed on exams because of the sheer amount of ground we covered ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course is Prof. Scott-Morton. She's wonderful and you'll be hard-pressed to find another professor who has the same mix of academic firepower but also real-world experience. Her going off-tangent and speaking about her experiences with the DOJ or her off-the-cuff remarks against the FTC made this course. \r\n\r\nAs for improvements, I think the discussions in class could be better. I remember participating a lot early on, but that died down as the expectation to contribute and the level of the discussions weren't that great. There is a huge gap between the Law students and the SOM students that becomes pretty apparent early on. As an undergrad, it is tough to navigate between these two parties, but try. "

            "\u00a0The R coding assignments are reasonable but you don't get feedback/help with them which is not ideal. The readings aren't always gripping (legal docs) but Fiona is a great lecturer and contextualizes their importance. Economics intuition is helpful/important but the class has very little  quantitative material (other than the R psets). ",
            "\u00a0This class is really good. Professor Scott Morton is excellent, and you learn a lot about past cases that have influenced how the US views antitrust issues. ",
            "\u00a0It's a lot of work! And you actually need to keep up with the readings or you'll be lost and never truly internalize the material. Fiona can be a little intimidating at first because of the lecture setting (and you're supposed to ask questions in class to engage) and the exams are hard (although relatively fair - it's just a lot of content to remember for each one of them), but I think in the end you get out some pretty interesting conclusions that make you think about companies, the economy, and the government's role in regulating everything a little more differently. I think it's given me a much better grounding for understanding that institution-market relationship and I view many firms (you study many of the big companies we tend to admire like Apple, Microsoft, etc) and their success through an antitrust lens now. ",
            "\u00a0YAAAAS. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Anyone who is interested in understanding the interplay between business, government, and consumer welfare should take this course. It provides a much needed contrast to the more theoretical parts of the econ department. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Take this class. I can imagine this class would be really useful for the consulting-types and the law-types alike. In terms of value, I would think that the aspiring legal folks would have more to gain; I was in the former category and still learnt a tremendous amount. I would wholeheartedly recommend this class to either, no doubt.\r\n\r\nThat said, I don't think someone doing the bare-minimum to pass Econ would enjoy this class; the readings are dense (very legal) and the problems sets can be tough if you're not computationally-minded. Professor Scott-Morton also discourages sophomores from taking this class so keep that in mind. "
