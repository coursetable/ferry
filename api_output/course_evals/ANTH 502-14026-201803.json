            "\u00a0Reading ethnographic writing, discussion theoretical concepts, drawing conclusions from a variety of sources. ",
            "\u00a0This course was EXTREMELY valuable. Prof. Inhorn taught students how to write funding proposals, and, most importantly, did so by actually requiring students to draft Fulbright and NSF proposals. These exercises demystified the grant writing process, and I can't recommend the continuation of this courses highly enough. In addition to grant writing, I came away from this class with a greatly improved research question that will guide my doctoral researchthat was also invaluable. Prof. Inhorn really helped students to consider what it means to develop a research question, frame a research problem, and conceptualize a coherent project. ",

            "\u00a0The strengths of this course have been described above in Question #1.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't call this a \"weakness\" of the course, but future students might benefit from having more time to turn around their *final* NSF proposals, after having received feedback on their first full drafts. For example, this year, I was in a group of students who submitted their drafts on Dec. 10 to be reviewed on Dec. 12, and then a final revised draft was due less than a week later. That wasn't unreasonable, but, given the timing of this assignment at the end of the quarter (a time when other lengthy research papers are also due) these final products might be improved if the deadlines were pushed up/earlier, so that students have more time to incorporate the feedback offered on first full drafts.

I hope that the Anthropology Department continues to offer all graduate students the opportunity to develop professionally by learning how to write the grants that are particular/specific to anthropology.
