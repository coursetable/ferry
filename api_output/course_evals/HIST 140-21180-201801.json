We touched on many different topics, so I learned a wide range of information\r\n\r\nHowever, lectures were disorganized and never uploaded in a timely manner. On multiple occasions, Professor Rogers held us past class time and tried to finish her slides, thus making us all late for our next class. I think she need to re-evaluate how much she puts in her lectures, or how fast she goes, and needs to upload her slides on time. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, having a final paper and a final exam that account for 70% of your grade it too much. The paper needs to be due earlier or there needs to be two midterms instead of one midterm and a final, just to break the grade up a little more. ",

It is engaging and the readings are really interesting.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes lectures are hard to follow/a little too fast but not bad, Prof. Rogers is a very interesting lecturer and I enjoyed her knowledge of the material.

I think the course could improve in the way the slides are created and presented in lecture to help highlight the more important aspects. ",

Workload was fair. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures went too fast sometimes, and parts of them felt irrelevant to public health (although I later made the link, it would have been better if lectures had been slowed down to make the links more obvious).

The readings for section could have been a good way to incorporate these topics more into the class. ",

Dr. Rogers is amazing, and the TF's are some of the best at Yale. We also don't just talk about them factually; we also analyze the social, political, and ethnic response to the issues.
