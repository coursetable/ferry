            "\u00a0I learned much about orchestral conducting from this course.  I developed my skills with a baton and with my left hand, and I also developed my sight-reading and transposition skills at the piano.  I also gained many insights on the purposes of the conductor and on music in general. ",
            "\u00a0Score-reading, intra-orchestral dynamics, leadership skills, conducting mechanics and some larger formal insight into symphonic works. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about what makes a good conductor and how to prepare a score. ",
            "\u00a0Interpretation decision-making, score reading, how to run rehearsal "

        [
            "\u00a0The course is an excellent opportunity for live conducting practice, but it would help to have a more complete ensemble to conduct.  It would also help if every student had the opportunity to conduct at least once a week; sometimes we rotated too slowly through everyone. ",
            "\u00a0Smaller class sizes would be of enormous benefit. I felt that Boughton's teaching was excellent, but that I didn't get nearly enough time conducting as to implement everything I was learning. ",
            "\u00a0Weakness: this class needs an orchestra so it's not just the members of the class playing for each other. Also, it was very repetitive--we did the same thing every day for the whole second half of the semester. Strength: it was really engaging! Boughton knows so much and is a really engaging educator! Also the musicians in the class are generally really good because its half grad students. ",
            "\u00a0No lab orchestra. "

            "\u00a0I would strongly recommend this course to anyone who is interested in either pursuing conducting or simply being a musical leader of some kind.  It helps you learn how to work with people, and it also helps to train your ear for any kind of music work. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend studying conducting with Boughton. He is an excellent teacher and a real professional with worldly experience in the field that makes for invaluable contributions. Be aware, though, that something like conducting is highly dependent on professor (and somewhat on class size, smaller being better) and if Boughton isn't staying on then I'd be careful if you really care about conducting and want an intensive introduction. Work-wise, very little - only score preparation and some practice. Great class! ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely would recommend this to anyone who is interested in conducting, plays an instrument, sings, or is involved in any type of ensemble music! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! You can take this even if you haven't taken the first semester of the course. You do need to have a decent level of musicianship beforehand (know basic piano and be able to sightread). He will teach you about transposing if you don't know about it. But overall, it was such an engaging course! I really learned a lot about conducting and really enjoyed hearing Boughton talk about what makes a good conductor. Would highly recommend. "
