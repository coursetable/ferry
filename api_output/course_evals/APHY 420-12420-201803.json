",

            "\u00a0I learned a large amount of thermodynamics and stat mech (as the name of the course implies), including the maximum work theorem, Maxwell relations, phase transitions, combinatorics of microstates, partition functions, ideal Fermi and Bose gases, etc. ",

            "\u00a0In this course you learn most of the basics of both Thermodynamics and Statistical mechanics. Some of the coolest elements are understanding (roughly) why phase transitions happen (including bose-einstein condensation and degenerate fermi gasses), most of the derivation of the ideal gas law, and entropy of ideal gasses and why there is a maximum efficiency for heat engines.

            "\u00a0I've been looking forward to this class since I came to Yale. More than anything else, this class gave me a model system (Classical Thermodynamics) that I now understand how to model with the mathematics of differential equations. I learned about sources and sinks in this context, quasi-static processes, fundamental postulates, phase transitions, and stability. This class also gave me an introduction to Statistical Mechanics that I will be able to build on going forward. I learned about different microscopic models (Einstein, Debye, Ising) and how well they fit experimental data. "

            "\u00a0Very well taught, problem sets were ridiculously long but engaging, fascinating, and informative. ",
            "\u00a0Psets were super long but awesome to do. I loved that they were multipart and we were guided through the longest and most difficult questions. ",
            "\u00a0This course is A LOT of work, but I would actually call that a strength of the course. I think the pace could be slowed down a bit though, cause I felt like we were rushing through material at some points. ",
            "\u00a0this class moves so fast but it's really necessary in order to cover all the pertinent material. Honestly though, if it could be split into a 2 semester course as well as having a laboratory component, that would really be the only way to truly cover and understand all of the material. That being said, the balance of the two textbooks as well as Nir's lecture style made this tough situation the best it could be. ",
            "\u00a0This was a really strong course. The instructor, Professor Navon, was excellent and really good at answering questions and teaching the material. The workload was high but was very suited to the demands of the course and we really came out of it with a good understanding of thermodynamics. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely learned a lot in this course, but I think one thing that could be improved is the nature of the questions on the problem sets. Many of them became tedious and were bogged down in endless algebra, which I felt did not facilitate learning. I think questions could be made cleaner and more directed toward student learning. ",
            "\u00a0The material is this course was incredibly interesting, and the strengths were primarily in the content. The major weakness of the course was in its speed. Two entire courses were crammed into the syllabus, and there was almost no time to elaborate on many of the most important concepts. I very much think this course should be two classes, especially with regards to statistical mechanics. I do not feel as though I am coming away with much concrete conceptual knowledge about what statistical mechanics is and why it is important. On the other hand, I can now do the math. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are enjoyable, and Professor Navon is truly knowledgeable on the subject, but this class tries to cram too much material into one semester. The problem sets are very long, unless we are on a break, then the problem sets are even longer. Also, the exams are the longest and most in-depth of all of the exams I have taken at Yale. While splitting this course into two would alleviate a lot of the pressure from the fast pace and high workload, I don't know how feasible that would be in practice, because physics majors already have a lot of course credits to take. ",
            "\u00a0Prof navon moved pretty fast but that was still dope. if only the class were a little later than 9 am!!! ",
            "\u00a0Professor Navon does a great job of teaching a course that shouldn't exist. Specifically, In almost every other four year physics degree, statistical mechanics and thermodynamics are separate courses. Putting them into one semester means that you do get interesting insights about the close connections between the two topics, but it sacrifices the depth in each course, sleep, sanity and as a result retention. While I came out of this class knowing a lot and being able to use it, I also found that there was a lot I think I didn't retain because many of us couldn't actually dedicate the time necessary to fully deal with all of the material. While I think there are problems created simply by trying to cram two classes into one, I think there are one or two things that would make the class significantly easier, and would allow people to learn more. I'm sure other people have written this already, but I highly recommend that in future versions, answers to problem sets are given to students after they have been handed in. Especially given the difficulty of the problems, seeing where you went wrong and/or how they could have been solved better and what you didn't understand would be really useful. If the worry is that students will give future years the answers, I've never seen someone give or ask for a previous year's answer key. Even if someone did, I think that asking for past year's answer keys would be at least as harmful as taking the 100% final option and not doing them at all. In addition, I think keeping the PSets at the difficulty of past years but curving them would be helpful. Similarly to exams, I think a model where students aren't expected to finish the problem sets, but to seriously attempt all of the problems and be able to show that they have done so, where it is understood that most people won't complete 100% of all of them, would mean that people get more out of the work. ",
            "\u00a0The problem sets sort of guide you through derivations of important laws and concepts. Doing the psets actually facilitate learning rather than just being work for the sake of work. One weakness would be that the course tries to cover way too much in a single semester, so a lot of things are skimmed during the course despite being crucial to concepts that come after. You need the textbook. ",
            "\u00a0One major change is that the solutions to psets should be released. Without it, and even with the TAs best efforts to provide feedback, it was difficult to know best practices / alternate solutions to solving problems. ",
            "\u00a0I really appreciated the assignment where we were asked to compare different models to experimental data. I thought this was very important and not something that enough classes at Yale do. "

            "\u00a0Physics 420 is an excellent course; it is certainly one of the best courses in the core physics sequence. The subject matter is fascinating, and presented clearly and engagingly by Nir Navon. It could, however, benefit from expansion into a two-term sequence, as the amount of relevant material is far greater than that which can possibly be presented in a single semester. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you're interested in physical science you learn a lot. Of the core physics class, this was easily one of my favorites. Nir wants you to learn and knows the material on a very deep level. ",
            "\u00a0If you're taking this course, you have to take it. It's an intense course that really should be split over two semester, one for thermodynamics, one for StatMech, but no one will ever do it, so we cram two semesters haphazardly into one. The material is necessary in the education of any physicist, and while you might not recall much after the course is behind you, working with the material and getting a sense of the methods used (remarkably different from other branches of physics) is absolutely essential. ",
            "\u00a0Chances are, if you're considering taking 420, you're a physics major and you have to take it. This course is mad hard but it's super rewarding and you'll walk away with a very deep understanding of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. The psets took me and my friends ~15-20 hrs on average, but the result is that you learn the material really well. Also, this course is a staple of the yale physics major, so you sorta just have to suck it up and get through it. Nir was a great teacher, though he didn't give us very much feedback on how we were doing. That said, take it with Nir if you can. ",
            "\u00a0you probably are taking this class because you have to. but that being said, it's probably not as bad as people are making it out to be. Yes it's hard and probably the most difficult class you will encounter in your physics career, but that being so this is not that bad. Plus, it's really fun necessary material (sometimes). ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would as long as this student had the time and motivation to put in the work required. ",
            "\u00a0Id recommend it to any student who was very interested in this subject, or to anyone who is required to take it. ",
            "\u00a0If you are a physics major, take this class. You will learn so much material that will prepare you for any type of physics or research in the future. If you aren't a physics major and won't need stat mech or thermodynamics in your career, I don't see a good reason to put yourself through all of the pain of the problem sets and exams to learn this stuff. ",
            "\u00a0would recommend to anyone w an interest in the subject - which should be everyone! an amazing foundation if you put in the elbow grease to build it, and nir is a great professor. ",
            "\u00a0This course is necessary for the physics intensive major, and much as I hate to say it, is probably a fairly good idea for anyone hoping to go into physics or (god forbid) engineering. It is painful, and the workload (even in our year when it was reduced somewhat) is without a doubt places it among the most strenuous classes at Yale. My recommendation is that you at least skim the textbook either before or after lecture, and that you start your Psets early. Otherwise you get into a cycle of staying up late the day before they are due, and have difficulty understanding the next days lecture or starting the next PSet early in the week. If you get behind, this class can become a nightmare. That said, parts of it are really fucking cool, and because of how difficult it is, when you get things intuitively it is extremely rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0Grit your teeth. The workload is actually on another level, and I had to sacrifice all of my time for this class. It moves at a pretty crazy speed (going through a graduate textbook - Callen - one chapter per lecture. Just dedicate your breaks to 420 and you'll be fine but don't take too many other difficult classes along with this one. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very fast paced, which is much of the challenge - you don't have a lot of time to mull over material, and very profound things are often covered too fast. This is less Prof Navon's fault than the departmental organization, but should be taken into account. But as alluded to, part of the fun in covering a lot is that we spanned a great deal of interesting physics week to week, and began to glimpse the process central to physics of taking real-world systems and fitting theory to them.
