            "\u00a0Leadership is not what what we think it is and it never has been ",
            "\u00a0This class, although we are only one semester in, has already been one of the best Ive taken at Yale. \r\nI have learned an incredible amount from both Stan and Chris about their own leadership techniques, and about the various ways we normally think about leadership that maybe arent the most accurate or helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Leadership structures; interpersonal skills ",
            "\u00a0I loved the Lincoln book, and gained so so much from reading it (and wouldn't have otherwise). From that read and the course in general, I gained a deeper understanding of how to lead a team outside the traditional hierarchy. ",
            "\u00a0The three myths of leadership caution against seeking specific formula to be a specific leader, attributing too much to a single leader, and focusing solely on objective results as the key metrics by which to judge a leader. \r\n\r\nTo be successful, leaders must understand the context in which they operate, along with the context of their subordinates and subordinate leaders. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: the best run seminar I have been a part of at Yale thus far. Discussion rolls along because of the high expectations and demands of the professors, as well as their willingness to force things along by calling people out to add to the discussion.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: leadership is very much talked about from a military/corporate perspective. Leadership found in other sectors not widely considered, so issues that arise in other areas are not generally discussed. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength is the students selected for the course.  It's a solid group with varying opinions which makes for productive seminar discussions.  I think having the course take a year rather than a semester was a good choice as well.  This first semester was a little hands off, so it would be nice if there was more balance between the semesters, but I have no major complaints. ",
            "\u00a0I think the strengths by far lie in the people and the discussions. I learn so much from my classmates and all that they have to say, and so have gotten the most out of class discussions. ",
            "\u00a0strong course; specific subject breakdowns ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The Lincoln focus. The simulation from day 1. Conversation topics.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses/Room for Improvement: Sometimes, discussions feel a bit freeform/lacked structure. More directed facilitation may help focus conversations on the topics. For example, starting discussions with guiding questions and the goal to try and answer with a consensus (or articulated disagreement) them collectively may help take the freeform into a structure. I would also be interested to hear more lectures. Chris and General Mcchrystal have so much expertise in the military context; for a civilian like myself, their unique opinions and perspectives would be valuable. I also like the diversity of the class - I have made friends whom I value and may not have made otherwise. \r\n\r\nAs stated previously, I loved the Lincoln book. I would have valued additional sessions on that one topic and how lessons from the book could be applied to our lives. I wanted to talk about the book even more, and would have loved a space to do so (although, I did end up discussing it informally with friends from the class as well, and valued that supplemental experience that the class produced). ",
            "\u00a0The seminars are very engaging and the trip to DC was a great ice breaker for the class (simply being on a bus together for 10 hours over the weekend helped us get to no one another). \r\n\r\nThe \"Diversity\" seminar got off the rails a little bit. Students did not focus on \"How to create and foster diverse teams to better an organization\" (which I assume was the purpose of the class). Rather the focus of the comments strayed to discussing the systemic societal issues that serve as roadblocks for diversity, equality, and inclusion. "

            "\u00a0Yes. At the very least, it provides the opportunity to get around the table with other people from other schools who are doing other types of work than you are. Despite the limited scope of \"leadership\" it still is engaging topics and principles that anyone who may be in a future or current position of leadership could value from learning/engaing with. ",

            "\u00a0If you get in, definitely take the course.  You learn a lot from the instructors and the other classmates.  Everyone has something interesting to share and it makes the discussions productive. ",
            "\u00a0Taking this class was the best decision I have made in my time at Yale. I am thinking deeply about things I never had the chance to before and am having deliberate conversations about topics I never addresssed before. Take the opportunity if you have it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think there's a lot to learn from the instructors that is specific to them. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The course is definitely what you make of it. However, I've really enjoyed writing both of my essays so far for my own exploration of these topics and feel that I have a lot to learn going forward. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Many of the issues that this course addresses, several other courses at SOM attempt to tackle. However, the SOM courses do not allow for sufficient discussion; in essence the SOM courses only address \"what is wrong\" and sidestep the much more difficult question of \"how to fix it?\" "
