            "\u00a0I learned about 16-18th century music. ",
            "\u00a0A great survey course for Western music history up through Mozart. Very dead white male-y, but that's to be expected I guess. ",
            "\u00a0I learned quite a bit about the history of music and the music of history. ",
            "\u00a0In this class, I learned why the music we perform today is considered \"good.\" Before, I did not understand why Bach was amazing or what was so cool about Baroque opera, and now I do. I have a newfound appreciation for all classical music, and I feel much more informed about why some music and composers have earned a place in the standard repertory. ",
            "\u00a0A general view of music history from 1600-1800 and the trends that influenced it. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about the music of courts, churches, and theaters in Europe from c. 1600 to c. 1800.  It was fascinating to track the development of different types of music, particularly instrumental.  I also learned much about the controversies of the classical music canon. ",
            "\u00a0I developed my abilities to think critically about the history of music, in both a broader non-musical context that created it and the musical canon that it is a part of. Also, I have a certain grasp of the European musical history of the period covered by the course, both being able to identify the music of the era and say something about some of the movements that took place. ",
            "\u00a0A very detailed understanding of musical composers, works, and intellectual trends in Western Europe from 1600 to 1800. A greater ability to evaluate the work of historians and identify its inherent biases, especially with the final essay. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a full overview of European music history 1600-1800 ",
            "\u00a0I gained a deeper understanding and appreciation of European art music of the 17th and 18th centuries, and specifically, how form evolved over this time. I feel like I understand the historical implications of sonata form. I also feel like I have gained a broad, useful knowledge of the historical context and forces that shaped music over these two centuries, which will inform my choices as a musician from here on out. ",

            "\u00a0This was an amazing class with Prof. Hepokoski. Really sad that he is leaving next year. Nothing could be improved, was perfect. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures are engaging, exams and listening quizzes are very doable. Could be improved by covering a broader range of music happening during the time period, not just music by the elites. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very organized and I always knew what was coming up. I also thought the listening quizzes and in-section exams were difficult, but not too difficult. Studying for these exams was time-consuming, but I never felt like the difficulty was unreasonable. The one thing I would improve about the course would be the essay. The idea of understanding how different historians shape different narratives is a fascinating one, but we could do better than comparing two dense music history textbooks. ",
            "\u00a0It was generally good. Not perfect, but hard to put my finger on exactly what could be improved. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Hepokoski is an amazing lecturer, and I learned so much! However, the listening quizzes and the factual exams can be quite stressful just based on the amount of information covered in the class. The test are also very open ended, and I found it difficult to anticipate exactly what the TAs were looking for in each answer. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were always fascinating, and the assessments were helpful.  However, the lectures would have been even better if there had been more opportunities for class participation. ",
            "\u00a0I liked how the exams were non-cumulative - this made the course easier to study for and manage. I also liked how the essay was due before the end of classes. ",
            "\u00a0I loved Prof. Hepokoski's lectures - they were engaging and impassioned, and breathed a new life into music that seemed rather dead to me otherwise. I also liked a lot of the music covered in the course. A weakness would be a lack of engagement with the read material. It felt as though the whole course content was simply the lecture content, and the readings were simply an interesting added commentary. I don't really know if I want there to be more discussions of the specific readings we did, but I think I could have gotten more out of them if they had been discussed. ",
            "\u00a0An incredibly organized course that covers a very wide range of concepts in European art music from 1600 to 1800. Completion of all assignments ensures a thorough understanding of factual information (composers, pieces, broad trends), historiographical methods and pitfalls, and the ability to recognize styles and influential individual pieces from each composer and time period that is covered in the course.\r\nMy only criticism is that throughout the course, I found myself wishing for greater coverage of performers and performance practice. Music is, at its essence, an experience, and is only possible through the expertise of highly skilled musicians. Additionally, many students who take the class are performers more than composers or scholars, and this sort of information would be very applicable to the kinds of musical endeavors we are likely to embark on in the future. ",
            "\u00a0The listening quizzes are extremely difficult, and I wish we were given some strategies for how to study for them. Additionally, I wish the terms and concepts sheets were released earlier. ",
            "\u00a0I love the lectures and the material in this course. I feel like I have a real feel of music from these centuries now that I didn't have before. That being said, the course does focus a lot on minutia. I did tend to stress over details that, even if I included in essays, seemed a little unnecessary. I just wonder if the time spent memorizing every date of pieces not on the listening list, as well as keys and forms of pieces in extreme detail might be better spent on something more useful. Obviously, this course is always going to be a lot of work--and it should be. It's important to have a strong historical base as a musician. But, I think, going forward, instructors should choose very carefully what they really want students to get out of it. Students in this course are pretty dedicated, for the most part--they'll put in the work. I hope that future professors really know that and choose carefully what they want students to learn. ",
            "\u00a0Incredibly engaging and fun, while still challenging to learn all of the material. One of the best courses I've taken. "

            "\u00a0100 percent but I guess it depends on who is teaching it in the coming years since Prof. Hepokoski is leaving. Best class I have taken at Yale and within the Music department. ",
            "\u00a0For music majors, definitely. For non-majors, only if you have a strong interest in Baroque/Classical music. I'd recommend 352 over 351 in general. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student, musician or not. By the end you'll have learned a lot about the factors that lead to the development of different styles in European music (and you'll be able to look cultured at cocktail parties!). If you are a musician, the ideas from this course may influence how you play certain mainstays of the classical repertory. ",
            "\u00a0It's good. I didn't think it lived up to the hype - Hepokoski is good, but he definitely didn't blow my mind - but if you're interested in music, it's worth learning about its history, and this class isn't a bad way to do it. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in classical music and music history, this class is amazing! It is super interesting, and I feel like I am a much more intelligent performer because I have taken this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The lectures are works of art, and the material is interesting in the context of the history that everyone already knows (French revolution, aftermath of Protestant reformation, etc.). ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student.  I would recommend that all music majors take all three music history courses (even though they are no longer all required) because it is fascinating to see how the entire story fits together.  I would also recommend this class to a non-music major who loves music from this era (1600-1800).  The course covers the famous music, but it also covers lots of interesting lesser known works. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you have enough interest in the music of the period covered in Western Europe to discuss it extensively. If you find this music boring, this course won't really help. It's only if you're interested and want to learn more. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! This is the best course I have taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but I would warn them that it is a lot of work. But Hepo's lectures are incredible. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but take it credit-D if you don't need it for the major. ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely! The class is incredibly interesting but also challenging... so you really feel like you are able to learn something. It is lots of fun and if you have any interest in the subject, you will love it! "
