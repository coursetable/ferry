            "\u00a0I loved this class it definitely made me write more than I am used to doing and I learned how to create a research paper correctly. I loved the course because we had such an interesting section topic. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to sharpen my writing skills through this class. Through the different papers, I learned more about what structure and style of writing entails. ",
            "\u00a0how to write a research paper, analyze sources and how to revise a paper ",
            "\u00a0English 114 is essential to understanding how to write a scholarly paper at the college level. My conceptions about the nature of writing changed so much throughout the course. Additionally, I was introduced to research at the undergraduate level and how to go about collecting sources from scratch. It truly provides you with a skill set that is helpful in classes down the road. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write better, including how to revise and structure essays. We broke down how to write introductions, body paragraphs, quotations, and annotated bibliographies. I also learned about how to find sources at the library. ",
            "\u00a0This class was such a great opportunity to improve my writing skills. When I began the semester I was not confident in my abilities to make coherent arguments, but with the help of Professor Deli I really got to a place where I was doing better in all my classes. The structure of the class was also really great for brushing up on proper research techniques. In terms of our section, the subtopic that Professor Deli taught was a ton of fun too. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about writing and how to write specific of essays. Ms Deli taught me so much about the writing process and how to write specific paragraphs and types of papers. I also learned a ton about celebrities, gossip, and how write about them academically. "

            "\u00a0It is a great course, if grading time was faster so that we could see what improvements need to be made from paper to paper that would be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that it teaches you how to write papers. The weaknesses is that some of the readings are very drawn out and boring. ",
            "\u00a0strengths were that it was engaging and fun while also teaching important skills for writing papers ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: You receive lots of instructor and peer feedback on your writing; the assignments are spaced well as to not be overwhelming for the students; the research aspect to the course was very rewarding; the readings were theoretical and abstract in a way that improved my close reading skills\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the mass amount of criticism can really be overwhelming, especially at the beginning ",
            "\u00a0I think the strength of the course is the feedback given about writing. I think I was able to improve my writing, and I really learned what it was like to revise essays to make my writing more clear. Also, Maggie is extremely open to meeting with her, and she is always willing to address any of your questions and concerns. The weakness of this course was the timing of everything and organization. I felt that a lot of times, things were rushed, especially the first drafts of papers. We would usually only talk about something necessary to write the paper, but then the first draft is due only one or two days later. It feels like a time crunch to finish and think about the papers. The grading and comments were also kind of slow because we didn't receive our first grade until 2/3 of the way into the term, which was not helpful. I felt like I did not know what I was doing as a result. ",
            "\u00a0The class could use more explicit teaching of specific writing techniques. Broader coverage of topics and concepts was very good, however. ",
            "\u00a0I honestly loved every aspect of this course and can't think of any ways to improve it. "

            "\u00a0Yes the class is awesome and the teacher is amazing and so funny and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, in order to improve your writing. ",
            "\u00a0yes, it taught how to edit and revise papers which has been helpful in other courses ",
            "\u00a0Yes. If you are going into college and are not confident about your writing abilities, English 114 is a great course to get up to par and see how surprisingly different college writing is from that of high school. You tighten your arguments and learn how to use sources and specific quotes wisely. It is a worthwhile investment for future courses down the road. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it if you want to improve your writing for the main part. You learn how to write essays better, and some of the readings were interesting. Just be aware that papers will probably take longer than you think to write and revise. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. English 114 is a great opportunity to get a writing credit while preparing yourself for future writing assignments in other classes. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I loved the subject matter and the discussions and the papers we wrote were all interesting and different. I also think the readings were fun and informative and Professor Deli is so fun to learn from. "
