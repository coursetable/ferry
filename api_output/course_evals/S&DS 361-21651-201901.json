However, there were a lot of gaps in the way knowledge was presented. The project-based structure made it easy to practice coding skills, but often times I wasn't even sure what I was coding, or how any of the theory in the course related to the techniques we covered. Ask if there is a concrete plan for each lesson and each assignment before taking the course, because a lot of the potential was lost in the last-minute planning and changes. ",

            "\u00a0The projects and lectures were disconnected (the lectures were mostly theory while the projects were like 95% coding). Dr. Brinda was very open to suggestions and always available for help, though, which was nice. It's an engaging class. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: It was nice having a class to learn the theory side of statistical technique but also back up that with applications to help better understanding.\r\nWeaknesses: The theoretical side of it was pretty hard to understand and the lectures were sometimes dry. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course did a good job at expanding my programming abilities and enabling me to conduct more simulations than I had in previous statistics classes. However, I wasn't sure that the material was enough to take up a whole course as there was a lot of repetition from previous classes (such as S&DS 312 and S&DS 230). So I felt like while I learned something/while my viewpoint on some of these tests became slightly more sophisticated, it didn't justify the entire course (ie I'd have preferred to have done more topics that aren't covered as closely in other courses  and that I think could be beneficial here (for instance learning more about how to clean/deal with large datasets, more on statistical writing/how to structure a report, more on techniques like time series (that don't receive much attention elsewhere), dealing with violations of core assumptions (ie presence of outliers, leverage points, etc), more advanced web scraping techniques, etc). Additionally, I felt like this course was at a weird place mathematically where we tried to discuss a decent amount of the theory but didn't really get very far into it/it was presented in a confusing way (ie just through slides rather than blackboard work). Finally, I didn't love the grading structure where you got some grade on a 0 to 5 scale in half point increments as it didn't feel very nuanced in terms of the grading and different TAs graded differently. That being said professor Brinda is definitely a very nice/engaging professor and I did enjoy the content even if I didn't learn quite as much new material as I had hoped. ",
            "\u00a0There was a lot of support offered by the TA's and professor, and Professor Brinda was exceptionally willing to go out of his way to help. However, there was little sense of how difficult the material being presented was, no chance to actually practice the theory of the math, no materials other than the slides provided that discuss the theory. We moved far too quickly through some important math, and were never given a chance to really sit on the derivations of different statistical math and how it relates to the purpose of data analysis. Basically. bridging the practical analysis skills and the theory would be really good, and making the assignments clearer as well. ",
            "\u00a0All in all a pretty frustrating class. Prof. Brinda is very nice and has a very good attitude in class but was unprepared for lecture and seemed to be recycling 90% of class material from his linear models class. Class in general was unguided and failed to provide a better understanding of R and data analysis. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was not very engaging. The material covered feels slightly out of data with more data science methods that are hot right now. ",
            "\u00a0The psets were interesting and helpful but poorly organized and released sporadically. Classes did not correlate with homeworks at all and class was way more theoretical than I would have liked. ",
            "\u00a0It's a really chill class with few assignments. That being said, I felt that I didn't learn very much because I already knew most of the techniques. ",
            "\u00a0We spent a lot of time learning the theory. I wish we had learned more practical statistical methods. Besides LDA & PCA, and a technique that Dr. Brinda made up (iterative fitting which is pretty cool), you don't learn many new statistical skills. I wish the course had been less focused on theory and more focused on new ways to approach data sets and different types of models. ",
            "\u00a0I get the feeling that Brinda needed more time to prep this course. The prereqs need to be made more clear, and the connections between linear algebra and theoretical concepts should be a more major teaching point. ",
            "\u00a0While the content is interesting and very practical, the class is somewhat disorganized (particularly with the assignments) and I thought the lectures and notes were often hard to follow. ",
            "\u00a0I think this class would have been much better if it were a little bit clearer in its expectations of stats background and in what it planned to focus on. It started out really strong, and felt very practical and useful, but eventually wound up feeling at times like our professor was just recycling his lectures from his linear models class in the fall. I also did not feel prepared for the class having only taken intro stats, and never knowing having learned how a chi-squared distribution was defined. Likewise I had much less linear algebra than it seemed that we were expected to know. Clearer listing of pre-requesites would have been helpful, and a more systemmatic approach to the structure of  the course would have also been good. ",
            "\u00a0There could've been more classtime devoted to working on projects and more work in Python. ",
            "\u00a0This course was just incredibly sloppy. It wasn't well-organized. I went into this class thinking it would be focused on data analysis skills, so I was really annoyed when the class turned out to be some sloppy version of linear models or whatever. It was shocking to me that the professor didn't really know much of Python or didn't focus on the actual coding aspect. The homework was also annoyingly long and tedious.\r\n\r\nAt the end, I do feel like I learned something, but definitely not as much as I hoped. ",
            "\u00a0I did not understand any of the theory.  Loved the first month or so.  Then became completely lost! ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were poorly presented especially when it came to linear models, although Dr. Brinda did go over them again with better explanations later. I think more and higher quality graphs should be presented for linear models. Seeing what is perpendicular to what can be overwhelming when everything is slapped onto a single graph and is never returned to again. Perhaps go step by step in visualization and derivation and the content will flow much smoother. ",
            "\u00a0*Strengths:* Brinda is a great, approachable, and knowledgeable professor and picks interesting and practical datasets to work on for the homeworks. I felt like statistical techniques first introduced in the homeworks were presented in sufficient depth (even if they were not touched on during class), were well motivated, and above all followed a logical progression that made practical sense and seemed applicable to other datasets we may encounter in the future. I feel like working through the homeworks greatly improved my coding and my ability to apply statistics in real life contexts -- and this was the highlight of the course. The datasets for the homeworks were interesting and well chosen. The grading, in general, was fair and timely. Office hours were also very helpful. This class ultimately had no in-person exams (breakdown I think was 70% psets, 30% take home final), which makes sense because all the work for this class was done on the computer. Originally, Brinda planned to make the final an in class test on the theory presented in class that no one followed (more on this below), but the class was so stressed about it that he changed it to a take-home and held office hours on it. This was definitely a net positive, and refreshing to see a professor so receptive to feedback! He also spent class time reviewing before the final, and made a practice final that was very helpful for studying and understanding the material we would be accountable for.\r\n\r\n*Weaknesses:* The lectures. Brinda said he wanted to teach this as a practical data analysis course, but around the halfway mark things started going *heavily* into theory no one could follow. Not even hyperbole. I think maybe two kids truly understood the theoretical portions, and theyd ask one or two questions at the beginning of class then grab their bags and leave halfway through. Lectures were Brinda puts several infinite dimensional matrix abstractions on the screen or Y with different combinations of subscripts, superscripts, bars and hats to represent different quantities, then he reads you the math with some gesticulations. Brinda tried really hard to get people to understand, sometimes spending the next class to go back over the previous class material when he realized he botched a lecture, but ultimately kids just ended up on YouTube or playing Hearthstone during class because halfway through everyone was totally lost. I think its valuable to cover theory, but this was not the move, since starting at such an advanced level just meant that either it went over your head, or we needed to spent time backtracking -- either way resulting in lost time. It would probably have been quicker to start from basics and build up the foundation, and ultimately I feel like I only absorbed 60% of the theory thrown at us. Guidelines for sections of the homework projects could often be ambiguous and Brinda had to clarify what he meant during class. Additionally, it felt kinda dumb and contrived to adopt a roleplaying persona to fulfill the report write-up format of the homeworks. The English write-up took extra time and made the projects overly lengthy, without enriching understanding at all. Also the above and beyond part of projects (if you just did what was asked of you in the homework you got 4.5/5) felt sort of weird; it would be better to just have a last part with a few different options to choose from instead of something so open ended (which Brinda started doing towards the end of the course -- thanks!). Also, Brinda would often not have done his own assignments in advance, so sometimes if you asked him a specific question about the pset, he could only give a sorta vague conceptual answer. In general, there was a lot about this course that made it feel kind of disorganized. Granted, this was the first time Brinda has taught the course. "

            "\u00a0If you're looking for a relatively low stress class as an S&DS major, this is good, although you will have to put in work around the time the project is due (go to office hours for clarification on the problems, because sometimes his wording is vague). ",

            "\u00a0It's hard to make a recommendation either way for this course as it's a course which changes so so much depending on who is teaching it and where their interests like (even more so than other courses). What I would say is to be skeptical if you've taken other courses that discuss common statistical techniques in detail (ie courses like S&DS 230, S&DS 363, S&DS 312, etc) and check the syllabus/talk to the professor to ensure that it's not redundant (this version had some overlap with both 312 and 230).

            "\u00a0Would recommend if you want a relaxed class that isn't too much work. You won't learn too much math, but you'll refresh your R/ Python class. ",
            "\u00a0I think Dr. Brinda is a very smart professor that knows a lot but I think that his Linear Models class is probably better because you know that you are going to learn a lot of theory. We didn't do a whole lot of data analyzing despite the course name. The projects are good in that you get a lot of practice with coding but I don't feel that I learned a whole lot about different models. I know he can make the course less about theory so you should still shop it! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0Interesting in theory, and hopefully better next year when there is a clearer structure  and plan. I would not recommend that  you take it if you have a very weak stats background going into it. ",

            "\u00a0I wouldn't really recommend this course the way it is taught right now. For most of the semester, I found this course to be extremely frustrating. I was frankly really, really annoyed that I had to sit through this class this semester.\r\n\r\nThis class was honestly like some version of linear models, but worse, because a lot of us didn't take the linear models course, so the professor kind of just rushed through what should have been a whole semester of linear models in a few days of classes, taught in a really sloppy way.\r\n\r\nThe whole class was just really sloppy. There were always typos in the lecture slides and typos in the homework. It was clear the professor didn't really prepare for the class or prepared really last-minute.\r\n\r\nI feel like this class wasted so much of my time. ",
            "\u00a0A good class for tackling real-world like statistics projects. The grades for the course were just 5 projects and a final, which was essentially just like any other project. Lectures are pretty poor, and projects can be challenging to understand what exactly the instructor is looking for or even what he wants us to do. However, each of the projects presented something new and engaging. Overall, psets were solid but cannot rely on lectures to help. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. I felt like working through the homeworks was actually meaningful, improved my R and Python skills greatly, and could ultimately help me with data analysis I do in the future. The homeworks take a lot of time, but you do have two weeks to do them, and a part of the project is assigned at the end of each class (so the project is built up over several classes). Be warned that some parts take wayy longer than others (and Brinda sometimes had trouble gauging this since he thought up parts without actually doing them himself in advance lol). I remember there was one part on a pset that took longer than the other seven parts combined. The theory in the lectures was kind of a mess, but I do feel like I got something out of it, even though if executed better I probably could have gotten more. "
