            "\u00a0Survey of political thought during the French Revolution and historical writings on the Revolution. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read really, really quickly. I did not learn how to skim or pretend like I'd read 400 pages when I hadn't, which is probably a good thing. ",
            "\u00a0I ended up taking a lot from the course. I didn't really know the details of the Revolution, but I feel like I do now. ",
            "\u00a0Gained a great deal of insight about the political thought and historiography of the French Revolution. Also improved my writing and presentation skills. ",
            "\u00a0Close reading of many philosophical giants who wrote before, during, and after the French Revolution. "

            "\u00a0Prof. Luban sometimes didn't direct the discussion enough, but otherwise it was a great class. Very interesting readings and insightful discussion in class. ",
            "\u00a0I like that each student had to give a presentation. Made sure we all read at least part of the curriculum! I think having the class last ~2 hours helped us dive into some good discussions. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths and weaknesses lay with the professor. The professor was super kind and chill all the time, which made us feel free to participate. But, I don't think that he really made us WANT to participate during the class. All the same, the course was amazing! ",
            "\u00a0Really liked the structure of the course. Discussion was great thanks to Dan. Thought the workload was light but still facilitated student learning. ",
            "\u00a0A great selection of readings and interesting discussion that was guided well by the instructor. ",
            "\u00a0This course was great! Prof. Luban was very engaged and led discussion well while also allowing for student leadership. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Dan Luban knows how to lead a seminar. The structure itself was super open forum, but he would always provide insight and keep the conversation going. \r\nWeaknesses: organization. It would have been nice to get a little bit of context about each reading for the next class, before the next class. The presentations were really helpful, but I think maybe circulating some questions to consider for each reading would have helped me focus my attention more. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the syllabus was thoughtfully curated and the readings rewarding. Dr. Luban is a gem and consistently led thought-provoking discussions. He was exceedingly receptive to student contributions and created a very welcoming and collegial seminar atmosphere.\r\n\r\nMy only suggestion for improving the course would be to restructure the  assignments so as to encourage ongoing engagement with the course. Students wrote only one or two papers all term, and therefore had only their own love for learning as an incentive to keep pace with the readings. I think weekly and perhaps informal reflections about the reading: would help instill a class culture of consistent engagement. With that said, I mean that more as a remark in the abstract, and I was heartened to find that the course tended to attract individuals genuinely interested in the readings, so the above was less an issue than it might have been.

            "\u00a0Absolutely - super interesting if you're into political philosophy or French and European history. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I enjoyed it a lot, but Professor Luban is leaving so it won't be the same class :( ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It's really cool to learn intensely about a historical event that you've heard of, but don't really know the details for. ",
            "\u00a0Would absolutely recommend. It's a great joy to study a specific historical event in such detail. Great option for anybody interested in political philosophy, historiography, history, French thought, French people, French things, France. Discussion was generally very good (Dan was an excellent facilitator) and I learned a lot from the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I'd absolutely recommend this course. It was a great selection of reading and Dan did a really good of guiding student discussion while also inserting his own thoughts and knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0yes ",
            "\u00a0Yeah! It's a solid course, and you're not learning just about the French Revolution, but also political and revolutionary thought on a grander scale. Dan is wonderful and definitely knows how to keep a conversation flowing. Just make sure to meet up with him or ask questions before you begin your essay. He's super helpful with that and always available. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely, although this is mainly attributable to Dr. Luban, who will sadly be leaving this year. "
