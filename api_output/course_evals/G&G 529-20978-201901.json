General knowledge of the Earth's history was appreciated for students who may have not had a background in Earth sciences.\r\nWeaknesses/Improvements:\r\n1. Assignment of relevant weekly readings would have helped.\r\n2. Less relevance could have been given to strong form and weak form coding methods, which would have given more time to spent on problems in geodynamics. "
