            "\u00a0I learned about the innate and adaptive immune system and their responses to different pathogens. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this class so much!!!!! By far the highlight of my first semester at Yale. I think that I benefited the most from the approach Dr. Kavathas took to ensure that we all learned the materials. She made an extra packet of materials that highlight her lectures. It was essential in developing an understanding of the course material. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of detailed immunology, learning how to close read and pick out important parts for discussions and psets, understanding the human immune system in larger societal contexts - this class focuses a lot on the interconnectedness of society and immunology (i.e. stigma, outbreaks and society, etc). ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to connect what I was learning in class to current events in science ",
            "\u00a0I learned good note taking skills and presentation skills. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a significant amount about the human immune system (adaptive and innate immune response) both at the molecular, biological level as well as the broader social implications that microorganisms and disease have on the human population. I learned a great deal of presentation and communication skills in the course through discussions on readings. I learned a significant amount from both the assigned readings, lectures, and the comments/perspectives offered by my peers. I believe my understanding of diseases and the immune system has grown substantially after taking this course. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about the immune system as a whole, the intricate mechanisms used by the immune system to fight pathogens, as well as the history of diseases such as Polio, Influenza, Yellow Fever, etc in the United States. ",
            "\u00a0I became familiar with the immune system and all the different aspects of it and how they function individually and together. ",
            "\u00a0Im this course I learned about the immune system and all the cells and mechanisms behind it. We also in discussed specific diseases and epidemics such as HIV/AIDS, polio, and influenza. Not only did we focus on the immunological aspects, but also the social, political, and economic aspects of epidemics. We also explored the importance of the microbiome and microorganisms such as bacteria and viruses. ",
            "\u00a0I understood the concepts behind the immune system and also got a better sense of how it worked. ",
            "\u00a0Learned all about the immune system and the politics of the medical world. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a basic understanding of the immune system and how it responds to pathogens. I also learned a lot about the cells of the immune system, their functions, and how they are activated. "

            "\u00a0Sometimes it's hard to view a lecture presentation in a room with a round table meant to facilitate discussion. Generally, I liked the discussions, although sometimes they felt kind of drawn out and long. Additionally, sometimes there was a lot of homework to do and sometimes there was none, which was somewhat annoying. ",
            "\u00a0At time the materials we were expected to know were just well above our heads; however, I think that Dr. Kavathas would notice this and then dial it down a bit to explain the concepts more clearly to us. A strength of this class were the people that took it and how well versed Professor Kavathas is in her field of study. ",
            "\u00a0strengths:  welcoming professor, prints out powerpoints and lecture notes for each class (incredibly helpful), prints out all readings if there are any (also v helpful), close-knit community amongst students, reviews notes from the last class every time\r\n\r\nweaknesses:  everything is in a lot of detail without a lot of background knowledge, lecture-style parts can be a bit dry and slow at times, takes off a lot of points on psets ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course is the interactive element of having a small class size for discussion and also how we were able to take trips to the medical school, New York, and listen to talks ",
            "\u00a0I wish the entire class was more like the second half of the semester where there were more student discussions. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very well organized. The assigned readings were both challenging yet comprehensible, and the lectures were very effective. I really enjoyed the class discussions and the trips we took as a class to expand our understanding on concepts we learned about in class. I wish we met more frequently (three times a week) since I really enjoyed the class and the content taught. ",
            "\u00a0The seminar style of this class was a clear strength and the community it fostered was great. ",
            "\u00a0The class is more like a lecture than a seminar. ",
            "\u00a0I think a great strength of this course is that we were able to get outside the classroom and go to the Yale art museum, museum of New York, and Yale medical school. These out of class experiences were extremely enriching. Also the readings were very informative and interesting. I cannot think of any major weaknesses ",
            "\u00a0It is a very fascinating course but I feel that the professor was very unclear about how she graded the problem sets and many felt like they were arbitrarily graded. "

            "\u00a0Yes. Looking back, I'm really glad to have a basic understanding of immunology, as it is really interesting and applicable, once you get through the beginning lectures. I liked having a small class to get to know some other first years and take trips to the medical school, the art gallery, and a museum in NYC with this class. ",
            "\u00a0To anyone interested in biology or any discipline for that matter definitely take this class. Outside of the science we also discussed books that called in the social aspects of science as well. This class is truly fascinating and a must take if you can get into it. ",
            "\u00a0This class is great if you are interested in very detailed immunology and also how outbreaks and diseases affect societies!  There is a good amount of \"humanities\"-type readings for a more science class (i.e. not scientific journal articles, more stories and books).  There are psets due about every/every other week, and prof K has a tendency to take off lots of points of these.  However it's great because all of the answers are in the purple lecture packet she distributes at the beginning of the semester.  Our year had a great class that bonded together really well which made it much more enjoyable.  Although it's a seminar, this course is a mixture of lecture and seminar style. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to students who have a strong background in biology ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I loved this seminar. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. The course is incredible for students who choose to pursue biology/medicine and those who simply want to learn more about how diseases affect us both biologically and at a social scale. The course is structured very well and the instructor did an outstanding job communicating to us and incorporating a variety of interactive learning experiences (from a project and field trips to discussions and in-class reviews) which helped us learn the content of the course through multiple perspectives and methods. ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course to another student. The class was engaging and Prof. Kavathas cares about each student's development and progress. There were also fun trips to museums in NYC that solidified the community-feel of the seminar. I learned a great deal, had fun, and became friends with a group of other first-years! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because it taught me very interesting materials. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would highly recommend that everyone take this course because the immune system is not taught as in depth as it could be in most general classes. It is very enriching to understand this aspect of your own body. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is a very interesting course and the material is fascinating to those who are interested in this field. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course was a great introduction to immunology and was very informative. "
