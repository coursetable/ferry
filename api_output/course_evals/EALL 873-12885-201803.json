            "\u00a0Knowledge concerning late Qing China and presentation skills ",
            "\u00a0In this course, I think the most important thing I've learned is how to situate modern Chinese history in the world history. The readings assigned in this course cover a wide range of topics: Chinese nationalism, the formation of China as a national state, the gender issue in modern China, etc. If you are interested to have a bird-eye view of the world circa. 1900, then this course is a must. ",
            "\u00a0Chinese history with various topics, compared with those of other countries in some cases ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me an understanding of the value of transnational history and greater insight into a period of late-Qing China that I had not studied closely before. I felt that the variety of the assignments in this courses helped me to develop skills in different areas and become more competent in historical analysis. ",
            "\u00a0In this course I gained knowledge of major themes in Chinese historiography, particularly late-Qing history. "

        [
            "\u00a0The course is co-taught by Professor Jing Tsu and Professor Peter Perdue, thus offering the rare opportunity to see how historians and literature scholars approaching historical literature differently. ",
            "\u00a0The range of materials marshalled for the course was excellent and incredibly helpful, especially as an introduction to many of the topics under consideration (as it was for me). I wish that the time limit on student presentations had been invoked somewhat more often, as they often began to crowd out conversation. Though this was not under instructor control, I found it difficult to build a conversation with the other students in the class, and though it was an unusually reticent (though nevertheless capable and intelligent) group of people. Lastly, though I know modesty is always a consideration, in light of the fact that both Professors Perdue and Tsu have published on topics very close to topics that structured the course, I wish that they might have included some of their own writing a bit more often. ",
            "\u00a0useful reading lists \r\nassignments including presentation and discussions ",
            "\u00a0This course has a great syllabus and I really enjoyed the books we studied. Professor Perdue and Professor Tsu encourage an active class discussion, which is a strength of this course. For me it could have been helpful to receive feedback on some presentations or discussion posts. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the student led discussions. However, a clear template for presentations would help to control the length of the presentations, which could eat up a significant amount of class time. "

            "\u00a0Yes, if they have a strong interest in East Asian history and global history. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The content of the course is very interesting ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student interested in Chinese history. It is a challenging and rewarding course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I believe that not only was the material genuinely interesting and useful for my academic development, but also having professors Perdue and Tsu teach allowed me to gain new perspectives on the material we covered in class. "
