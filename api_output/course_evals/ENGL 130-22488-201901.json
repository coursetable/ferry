            "\u00a0This course was amazing! I loved the texts that we read, and Craig did such a wonderful job teaching and facilitating discussions! ",
            "\u00a0Close reading of Odyssey, Aeneid, Inferno, Don Quixote, Emma, and Ulysses. ",
            "\u00a0Developed deeper close reading skills to approach challenging texts, especially the modern novels like Ulysses. ",
            "\u00a0We read 6 huge books and were able to discuss them broadly or in depth at times. We learned what the hype was around famous epics like the Odyssey and Don Quixote. ",
            "\u00a0This class acts as a jumping off point for \"The Western Canon.\" You trace motifs throughout epics and often how these books were in conversation with each other and \"rewrote\" each other throughout the years. Each book, obviously, represents a completely unique culture and time period. As such, with the beginning of each book comes information about the culture: politics, language, and social norms of the time. \r\nIn this class, you will learn just as much about reading as you will writing. For each book, every student is expected to complete a reading response (on canvas) and a paper between 5-7 pages. These are heavily student-directed, meaning that you will also learn how to form an opinion and direct that into discussions and theses of your own design. \r\nSince there is so much material to cover, you MUST develop time management skills to complete all the reading. And, since the entire class is discussion based, you must keep up with the reading. That being said, your ability to make references to the text and between texts will grow if you put in the work. ",
            "\u00a0My close reading skills drastically developed over the course of this semester. I became a better writer both through repeated practice and Professor Eklund's feedback. I learned how to look at a piece of literature beyond face value, and more importantly, how to navigate a difficult work and avoid the expected frustration. ",
            "\u00a0I read six incredible books, and learned a lot about the relationships between them and the themes that preoccupy Western minds. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: reading a lot of awesome texts! Weaknesses: reading a lot of awesome texts in a short period of time ",
            "\u00a0The discussion is amazing. Professor Eklund led the discussion really well and I gained a much deeper understanding of the texts than before! Tho I wish we could have spent more time on each work, especially Ulysses and Don Quixote ",
            "\u00a0I didnt think Emma added anything to the course. It didnt fit very well with the theme and we werent able to give it enough time to explore it on its own. As is, it took a week away from books that we already had to rush through. ",
            "\u00a0Strength of course if you get to read really great material. Weakness is that there is not enough time in class to get to everything. ",
            "\u00a0Craig, the professor, clearly cares SO MUCH about his students and about the material. It is also clear that he knows what he's talking about and can lead students to finding deeper meaning in every text. It is also remarkable how much ground this course covers. The sheer number of pages, obviously, is impressive, and finishing this course feels like an accomplishment. But, it also exposes students to so many different writing styles and historical moments. Being incredibly under-read in the Western Canon, this acted as a catch-all crash course; I feel much more prepared for my next three years at Yale. Also, the structure is incredibly clear. Each unit is broken down into two books, two reading responses, and one paper. Students always knew what was expected of them, taking away a lot of stress.\r\nThe weakness is sort of a catch 22. Although it is great to cover so much ground, it often felt like so many important things were glossed over in attempt to read more works. I am often an advocate for quality over quantity, but I also appreciate having been exposed to so many important works. Again, this caused some problems in discussion. So often, the discussions felt rushed, and we always felt \"behind\" the syllabus. I hesitate writing this, because I would NEVER advocate for reading less women, but Emma seemed to be the outlier in the course, both in content and in time allocated towards it. If we were to spend the week that we did on Emma discussing another work to a greater extent, I think that our timelines would feel less rushed. \r\nAlso, the following is not necessarily a problem of the class, but it definitely manifested in its discussions: there existed a clear divide in accessibility of knowledge. A lot of the students had extensive backgrounds in mythology and other high level texts that made the works so much more accessible than for students like myself. Again, I don't know how this one class can fix this, because it is a problem of Yale as a whole, but it was still difficult. ",
            "\u00a0S: warm and engaging environment of discussion, student run discussion, significant resources for assistance\r\nW: too much material for one semester and therefore not enough time with each book (students feel rushed a lot) ",
            "\u00a0I think perhaps the number of books could be decreased - it felt like we were trying to cover way too much in this course, and while nearly all the books could take up their own semester, maybe cutting one.  Also, there was a distinct lack of female voices in this course, which though understandable, was unfortunate because we spent so little time on the one book written by a woman. "

            "\u00a0If you are willing to put in the work and keep up with the readings, this class is so rewarding! I especially loved reading Ulysses (maybe an unpopular opinion). Our class was so engaging, and Craig was awesome! ",
            "\u00a0YES. This will be one of the few chances you get a guided reading through Ulysses! Its amazing If you actually do all the readings! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Read Don Quixote and Ulysses with a class. They are both amazing and very intimidating to read on your own. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student if they haven't taken directed studies and want an overview of famous works. The amount of reading of is kind of a lot so I would caution them about that. If you can at least do some of the reading, I thought the class was great. ",
            "\u00a0I took this course because I was tired of reading poetry and more modern novels and missing so many fundamental references that stem from these works. So, if you feel the same way, then yes take this course. \r\nHowever, if you are just looking for a writing credit, do not take this class. There are so many easier classes that this that you can get a writing credit for. You really have to want to learn the material and be dedicated enough to stay on top of the workload. If you miss one or two days, it would be almost impossible to catch up. I do not write this to scare students away, just know what you are getting to. \r\nBut all in all, I feel really proud of the work I did and what I took away from the class. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone looking for a literary challenge beyond the ENGL114/120 level. For STEM or humanities majors, this course gives you a new perspective on the works you read, and arms you with new skills to approach future pieces. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course that covers a lot of important works in the western canon and all of the books link up really nicely to one another. Sometimes the reading is a bit demanding but it's definitely manageable. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely!  If you didn't take DS, this is an incredible course to take where you get to explore some of the coolest pieces of literature out there!  A warning - don't take this if you don't like to read.  It's essentially a directed reading course with some writing and discussion! "
