            "\u00a0Learned about many public health issues, national and global, that we face today. Had very interesting in-class discussions and looked at issues from varying perspectives. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about different aspects of public health and controversial topics such as vaccines, cancer screening, and the history of the tobacco industry. ",
            "\u00a0I gained an incredible respect for, and understanding of, the global healthcare system, and everyone who works within it. I learned all about the history of treatments and diseases, and now understand how they affect us today. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a vast knowledge of topics in public health, scientific journalism, and associated topics ",
            "\u00a0Critical analysis of scientific papers and medical reporting, research skills ",
            "\u00a0I learned about some of the world's most common medical and public health-related issues, such as infectious diseases, cancer, tobacco, etc.  I learned how to analyze scientific articles for credibility and accuracy. ",
            "\u00a0Various facets of public health, issues surrounding them and an overall enrichment of many topics affecting the world today. ",
            "\u00a0i acquired the ability to throughly analyze scientific papers and understand the flaws that come with them. Also, our discussions into current issues in public health allowed me to have more insight in this field and is definitely something I look forward to exploring in the future. "

            "\u00a0Strengths are that the small class size and relaxed nature allowed for class-led discussions, but weakness is that most of the homework that class discussions were based off of were readings. Many of the readings felt repetitive. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths\r\n- manageable work\r\n- different final project (wikipedia article)\r\n- incredible topics\r\n- knowledgable professor\r\nWeaknesses\r\n- none that I can think of ",
            "\u00a0It was a little bit freeform, but that was kind of what made the class so great. It gave students room to apply the skills they learned to their topic of interest in the final project. ",
            "\u00a0This class was really helpful in exposing multiple issues at a surface level, with some being more deeply explored and analyzed than others.  However, the class discussions sometimes dragged on longer than needed.  It could be improved with more interactive and diverse activities so that not each class is the same. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Bazell is very monotone in the way he teaches and not that engaging. ",
            "\u00a0More structure for improvement. I believe it to be taught by a good teacher and a fun environment. ",
            "\u00a0This course was definitely based on student discussion which allowed us to lead the class and have very insightful conversations. Aside from that, I believe a large part of the course depended on powerpoints, which I think sometimes may not be effective at getting to the point for the subject at hand. "

            "\u00a0Yes, the course gives a good introduction to many healthcare issues and the things that have been done to combat them. Discussions are very fun and the readings are very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you are looking for a low-stress course in which you will learn a little about different topics in public health. It is a good overview of current issues in the field. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This course expanded my general understanding of global health, and the state of our world today. Whether a student is a STEM major or not, they could gain a lot from the course. ",

As someone who was not sure if I wanted to pursue studies in the health field, this class definitely gave me an exposure to many interesting subjects in the field that I never knew much about. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, it is a great course to expand your horizon and be introduced to many different ideas and issues that you man not be exposed to in a classroom. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would recommend this class to another student because it is based on student discussion. For anybody who has a deep interest with public health and the other subjects it intersects with, this a great course to be a part of. "
