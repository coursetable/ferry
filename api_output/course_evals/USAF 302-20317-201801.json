            "\u00a0Strengths would be the breadth of speakers who presented. Most were extremely engaging and I always felt I walked away with new knowledge of not just the topic at hand, but life skills in general.\r\n\r\nThis is a small weakness, but accessing the readings was confusing. I personally much preferred when the readings were in the email attachment the week before class, rather than having to find the syllabus, find which week were at, see which lesson is being taught. Then having to navigate the det blog and look for the reading. I know that process in itself deterred myself and a few of my peers from even looking at the lessons. ",
            "\u00a0This was an excellent course which brought in many guest speakers for many different perspectives. One area for improvement however might be to include more examples of historical leadership rather than contemporary leadership. This might boost moral and patriotism in the detachment. ",
            "\u00a0The course was great because Lt Col Hermes switched up the format of classes so that we were always engaged in the material. "
