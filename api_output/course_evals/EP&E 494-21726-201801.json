            "\u00a0This course introduced me to contemporary philosophy, particularly feminist philosophy and black feminist philosophy. I got better at writing philosophy papers. ",
            "\u00a0I developed knowledge about Professor Stanley's theories about propaganda. I also learned about actual events like the Flint, Michigan water crisis, the Rwandan genocide, and Richard Nixon's prison expansion system. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to question the assumed \"facts\" around me and gained a better understanding of the more ethical aspects of our government. ",
            "\u00a0This class did a wonderful job of delving into the ideologies we hold, and how they contribute to and perpetuate stereotypes.  The books we read were enlightening and from a multitude of perspectives.  We spent a lot of time addressing the intersectionality of ideologies and how they threaten democracy -- which was great!  I feel like I learned a lot in this class, and I am glad that I decided to take it. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about history, the use of certain language to persuade us, the depth of certain ideologies, and a lot about the use of propaganda in general. We also discussed some (few) ways to remedy these things. ",
            "\u00a0As my first Ethics class, I learned so much about philosophical debates, historical and contemporary analysis of propaganda dissemination and writing! ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot more about ideology in America and gained the skills to better articulate myself. ",
            "\u00a0This course introduced some of the basic political and philosophical ideas behind various forms of propaganda and ideology. It made me think more about the information we get in the news as well as from our own teachers and peers. ",
            "\u00a0The unit about ideology was very influential on how I think about the world ",
            "\u00a0I learned to critically analyze how information is communicated to me and recognize bias in reporting, especially as it applies to larger frameworks of communication. It was particularly useful in finding parallels between current events and historical instances of threats to democracy. ",
            "\u00a0Critical thinking across both philosophical and critical race theory lines. ",
            "\u00a0PID gave me a framework for thinking about hierarchies in the world. It was really fascinating to learn about the mechanisms of hierarchy and how they are supported by propaganda and rely on widespread ideology. ",
            "\u00a0knowledge about what propaganda is and connecting different social issues together by comparing how they each use propaganda ",
            "\u00a0A keen understanding of propaganda and how it affects our social system. ",

            "\u00a0Lectures were inefficient, disorganized, and difficult to follow. I would've liked more rigor in lectures. It felt very rambling. The syllabus is great. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Some of the readings are very insightful.\r\nWeaknesses: Very unorganized with a lot of reading, most of which takes 50 pages to convey an idea that can be summarized in a single sentence. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course could be improved if Professor Stanley more clearly laid out what we were covering in class; sometimes it felt as though we were bouncing between many different topics and it was hard to follow. I think our breadth of readings were a big strength of the course, even if they were numerous in pages. ",
            "\u00a0In the future, this class could be better if there were fewer readings.  I think it would be beneficial to have more depth in the syllabus rather than breadth, so that students have more time to think about the concepts were are reading about.  Additionally, PID is a form of liberal ideology and propaganda, and I think it would be beneficial to take more time to acknowledge this in future years.  It is one think to criticize other problematic ideologies, but I think it is even more important to take time addressing that there are issues with our Neo-liberal, democratic ideology. ",
            "\u00a0Very interesting and interdisciplinary approach ",
            "\u00a0Very accessible Teaching Fellows; but the lectures we sometimes uninformative or only tangentially connected to the readings. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the details of the lectures, and weakness is the necessity of some of the readings. Less extra readings that we don't end up discussing in class. Also, all of the books we had to buy were not read in full. ",
            "\u00a0There was a lot of reading. Maybe the scope of the class needs to be reduced and Professor Stanley could teach two classes on this subject so that he doesn't feel like he has to squeeze so much into one semester. It would have been nicer to be able to spend more time reading and understanding each text instead of zooming through. Also, the information and opinions we were given were very one-sided. Professor Stanley is obviously liberal, and I'm glad I am also liberal because it would have been very uncomfortable and unwelcoming to be conservative in that class. I wish we could have heard a few more different voices and perspectives on the issues we were discussing (beyond simply giving a devil's advocate opinion for the purposes of shooting it down). ",
            "\u00a0The reading material and the insight Professor Stanley brings to class is amazing, but one way the course could be improved is if we did close-reading. The texts are so dense and we would definitely get more out of them if we go into deep analysis rather than having a general review. ",
            "\u00a0It was sometimes unclear what the readings would be each week because they would frequently change ",
            "\u00a0Professor Stanley, while undeniably brilliant in his field, cannot finish a sentence when lecturing. Some days art better than others, but he very much struggles to articulate his thoughts. Also, he is incredibly liberal and this entire course is about bashing Trump. ",
            "\u00a0The readings are very interesting, and the reading load has improved as of Spring 2018 (it used to unbearable, I'm told) -- analyzing the texts in section was always super informative and interesting. but the main weakness of this course is its absolute organizational disarray. Some reviews will tell you that this is the most \"Yale\" course you'll ever take on account of its chaotic nature, but don't fall for that: it is chaotic, and in a very bad way. Lectures never seem to have a corresponding lesson plan -- they're horribly inefficient, and while Professor Stanley is very knowledgeable on the topics that he's teaching, I'd much rather read his work than listen to him talk. To put it bluntly, he wings it. There never seems to be a plan, and this leads to strange tangents, unfinished sentences, and awkwardly long pauses that feel like a gross waste of time. Students start to skip lecture very early in the semester, and Stanley seems to not know why -- the truth is that it's possible to do fine in the course without being there, even though the information communicated is useful as a supplement. On top of this, readings hardly ever correspond with the syllabus, and waiting for Stanley to send the Saturday evening email telling us what the readings are for the following Monday was frustrating. This course has a lot of potential, content-wise; I just wish it was taught better. ",
            "\u00a0content was very interesting, lectures were disappointing. Stanley just summarizes the readings so theres no incentive to go to class ",
            "\u00a0Great readings and topics of discussion. Slightly disorganized lectures. ",
            "\u00a0The course is a bit disorganized. Prof. Stanley veers from the syllabus with frequency and sometimes does not update the students on the required readings. His lectures are sometimes a bit disorganized. That being said, he is a brilliant professor and you will usually leave class with a new framework for thinking about something. He engages with the class well, answering questions and posing them. In short, the reading list is fantastic, he is interesting (especially in office hours), but it can get disorganized. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: good at making connections between different issues\r\nweakness: moves very quickly, little depth ",
            "\u00a0It is a bit disorganized, but the material is super fascinating and topical. ",
            "\u00a0The lecture was honestly pretty bad. I didn't know what was going on. Furthermore, the scope of the class was ridiculously large, so I had no idea where we were in time or topic. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this class were: interesting & important topics, great TA. The weaknesses were: the Professor is a bit all over the place in his lecturing style, the class also felt a bit disorganised in that our readings were only posted one week beforehand and he was constantly changing the syllabus. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the class was well planned out, although some of the readings which we did not cover in lecture felt unnecessary. ",
            "\u00a0Very interesting readings, lecture was a bit all over the place. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: evaluates different subjects and topics\r\nWeaknesses: a lot of dense readings\r\nImproved by taking more time in class to discuss readings ",
            "\u00a0I think the reading requirements should be made clearer earlier in the week. ",
            "\u00a0The course material is interesting and tackles questions extremely relevant to today's political climate. However, the lecture was often disorganized and I was underwhelmed by the extent to which we engaged critically with readings outside of essays. The amount of reading is definitely above average-high, and it didn't always feel as though the amount of work I put in reading was enhanced by the lecture. ",
            "\u00a0The readings are very interesting and varied and we delved into a lot of very different yet inter-connected topics. The discussion sections were also extremely helpful, as they really enriched my understanding of the readings and helped me to connect them to each other and to real life examples. However, the lectures, while often interesting and filled with helpful anecdotes/examples, can be quite eclectic and unstructured. While they summarise the readings, I wish the lectured had been more organised and given some more background on the authors and historical context of the readings. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are the discussion sections (especially with Joanna!), which provide opportunities to explore new ideas and defend your existing ones. Most of the readings are incredibly thought-provoking and will give you a new framework for viewing political structures and psychological phenomena. ",
            "\u00a0Great lectures. Sometimes topics felt a bit rushed from week to week. "

        [
            "\u00a0If you are someone who does the reading, yes. I wouldn't take the class for the lectures, but the material makes for great discussions in section, and the paper topics are very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I hesitate. If you enjoy philosophy and debating theories and principles, or are very liberal in political and social views, take the course. If you hate arguing about principle and need facts, do not take the course. If you are politically or socially conservative, do not take the course (Professor Stanley calls President Trump a fascist in every other lecture). Lectures are unorganized, with Professor Stanley often struggling to vocalize points, and often giving political opinions (you will consider them great if you are liberal, but they will annoy you if you are conservative or dislike politics). All assignments are due before reading period; essays are based on principles and logic but not evidence, and sign-posting is a good strategy (forget everything you were taught about writing essays in high school). ",
            "\u00a0I would. I would warn them that the lessons can be a little hard to follow at times but overall a really fascinating course ",
            "\u00a0Yes.  It was an interesting class, and it had great readings!  There was a lot of reading, and Professor Stanley did not get to all of the reading in lecture, but for the most part the class was fine. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! Prof. Stanley is very interesting and engaging lecturer ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The course was really influential in my life and learning. It was very intellectually stimulating. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, great professor and great TF's! You really expand your thinking. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Stanley has a lot of interesting things to say about propaganda, ideology, and democracy. Take this class to know what those things are and to get an example of propaganda in the classroom. This class is really about ideology, with a little bit of democracy and propaganda thrown in. So if learning about various oppressive ideologies (patriarchy, racism, Antisemitism, etc) is what interests you, and you're liberal and/or don't mind an ideological echo chamber filled with Prof. Stanley's rants, by all means take the class. ",
            "\u00a0Even though the section discussions we had produced important insights and the readings were great, I would be hesitant to recommend this class to everyone. Sometimes the lectures were disorganized and everywhere (which is predictable since we are trying to cover dense readings which has more than a week of classes worth of material to be discussed in a day). ",
            "\u00a0Yes, to consider more how ideology influences out everyday lives ",

            "\u00a0Yes, take it! Don't stress too much about the unorganized nature of the course. You'll get a lot from it all and be glad you've taken it as it gives you a terrific foundation for thinking about pretty much everything you come across in news/pop culture. ",
            "\u00a0yes, if you want an \"overview\" type of course! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if they are interested in propaganda, linguistics, and political science. ",
            "\u00a0Hm... it's not the best lecture. The readings are very good but there are a lot of them and often they aren't assigned until it's way too late to actually read them. But it's interesting enough. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend it. Because of the way the class is set up, its not necessary to do every reading or go to every class - the grading is simply via papers and each paper you can pick from a range of question topics. The content was important and interesting, though, and my section was really engaging and fun so I think you would get the most out f this class if you really put the effort in and do all the work. ",
            "\u00a0yes, Stanley was very interesting to listen to and our section discussions became very interesting debates ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was the most interesting course I've taken at Yale so far, especially for a student interested in the study of fascist ideologies (such as myself). ",
            "\u00a0YES! This is my favorite class that I've taken at Yale so far. Amazing. I learned so much! ",

            "\u00a0Yes i would recommend this course to another student regardless of previous interest ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course due to the interesting readings and really fruitful discussion sections, however be warned that the lectures are a bit disorganised, as are the assigned readings, which frequently change or are added to at the last minute. ",
            "\u00a0This was a course that I originally did not intend to take, but it ended up being my favorite course that I have taken at Yale. The class challenged many of my political, psychological, and philosophical assumptions on topics ranging from America's failure as a so-called democracy to the harms of hate speech. It also opened my eyes to the deep-rooted and sometimes still invisible inequalities that people of color, women, LGBTQ members, and other minority groups face. And as the course title suggests, I now have a completely different take on the mechanisms of propaganda and its pervasiveness in our everyday lives. Take this course - the lecture may move a bit slowly at times, but from my understanding Professor Stanley has greatly refined the reading selection, and everything we discuss is well worth your time. Also, try to get Joanna as your T.F. if you can because she is super thoughtful, helpful, and all-around amazing! ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend for all students: critical perspective is so important for understanding how social systems and oppression functions and how we might begin to solve genealogical and historical oppression in the world. "
