            "\u00a0The aspect of research for credit that taught me the most was were doing the write-ups and presentation. This was good practice in scientific communication, and although it was a little challenging, it was in that good way where you feel you are learning something. Of course, you do some lab work as well. ",

            "\u00a0The class is credit for research and has only strengths. The final paper is a bit stressful and due really early, so that could be better managed. ",
            "\u00a0I think the biggest issue with this course is that very little can be done in the lab with only 10 hours a week, especially if you run into any significant road blocks while working. That being said, I don't know if there is any easy solution to this since raising the bar to anything more than 10 hours a week would be outrageous considering how busy Yale undergrads already are.\r\nAlso, I think it would be a good idea for the course to implement a first draft for the final paper that way students are forced to start working on it a little earlier and can also get some feedback before it is due. Not realizing that it was supposed to be a 15-page professional-appearing paper, I started way too late on it. ",
            "\u00a0I worked wayyyyy too many hours beyond the required 10 ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Not a ton of course work, making it possible to focus on your research; flexible assignments\r\nWeakness: Sometimes the requirements (mostly of my PI/mentor) were unclear, so maybe one organizational meeting or some more communication from Dr. Garen would be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: You get to work in a real lab for a letter grade credit.\r\nWeaknesses: The 2 short required assignments were tedious but definitely manageable and helpful for summarizing your work. ",
            "\u00a0The level of external work: research proposal and lab report, was just right for me to have a concrete visualization of what I've done in lab while not being too much work. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strength of this course was my research supervisor and the lab in which I research. ",
            "\u00a0The course is good to pursue personal research with clear expectations. However, improvements could be made through PIs and mentors discussing with students their progress more openly so that they know what is expected of them on the lab-level. "

            "\u00a0Honestly, I would not recommend taking this course unless you have a fair amount of free time and are looking to continue on a project you've already made a head-start on. Giving up 10 hours a week in the Yale schedule can really suck away your life, but putting in 10 hours a week in the lab really doesn't get you very far. Therefore, you're giving up a LOT of time an opportunity for something that just can't be done efficiently during the school year. The course isn't really challenging just time consuming  which worsens that feeling that you're wasting your time. Maybe if you are a senior and more of less done with your course requirements, then taking this class wold be a good idea, but taking this a junior while so much else is going on has not been great.

            "\u00a0Yes! Get credit for your lab hours! ",
            "\u00a0Might as well take this, especially if youre already working in a lab. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student wishing to pursue a career in biology or genetics research as the knowledge gained through this course is invaluable. ",
            "\u00a0If you would like to pursue personal research and get credit, this is good. Be ready to write a rather large report at the end, though. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, you should do research for credit if you are interested in going into biochemistry/biophysics (or medical school). "
