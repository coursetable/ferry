            "\u00a0This course is the first I have taken at Yale that was made for a diplomat. Learning from a former Ambassador about turning points in American foreign policy could not better prepare for a career in Foreign Service. I feel that I am much better at analyzing events and moments from the U.S. perspective and applying that to the national interests of the country. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about the bureaucratic politics behind foreign policy decisions and the nitty gritty of the State department. ",
            "\u00a0Gained a base for understanding U.S. role in foreign politics as well as the vocabulary for talking about foreign relations. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about how American foreign policy is conducted at a practical level. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to evaluate policy through a practical not academic lens ",
            "\u00a0This course provided me a whole new way to think about US foreign policy. The selected readings are carefully chosen and very worthwhile, and the class discussion often proved quite engaging. But clearly, the greatest strength of this course is Professor Ford. He's whip smart, an exciting lecturer, and very good at facilitating class discussion. ",
            "\u00a0A comprehensive overview of American foreign policy in a very hands-on and interesting manner. Also a very important focus on historical context! ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge about the differnet schools in American foreign policy \r\nMistakes and lessons of military intervension\r\nStrategic thinking of American leadership\r\nThe divisions in American foreign policy establishment "

            "\u00a0Strengths: Robert Ford and the course layout.\r\nNo weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0It was great that the professor engaged students in discussions about policy decision making. The course could do with much less historical anecdotal books and more books on the policy decisions like near the end of the course when we discussed foreign policymaking mechanisms in the present. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Ford is lovely and so willing to talk and share his experience with students during his office hours. He made class really comfortable, especially for me as I went into the class as essentially the only non-Global major and was nervous about being behind in terms of relevant knowledge. I wish that the class had focused less on the books and more about the issues discussed in the books/how those issues translate to modern foreign affairs. It is difficult to get a good understanding of a foreign relations event based on one person's interpretation of its history. ",
            "\u00a0This was an excellent course. ",
            "\u00a0Presentations could be shortened, or abandoned all together. The most important part was material read not what students presented on as it was fairly irrelevant to subject matter ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is Professor Ford. His level of engagement with the class is remarkable, and he's clearly one of the sharpest foreign policy thinkers at Yale. I would say that main weakness of the course was the class presentations that consume a good deal of the latter half of the course. Though sometimes valuable, they too often felt cursory and simply took too much time away from Professor Ford and his more interesting facilitated conversations. ",
            "\u00a0No weaknesses! An amazing class. "

            "\u00a0YES! I would 100% recommend this course to other students. It is truly a word class experience learning from Ambassador Ford and interacting with your peers in a foreign policy setting that you cannot get in other classes at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course for someone who actually wants to learn more about foreign policy at Yale, this is one of those courses that you must take before you graduate. ",
            "\u00a0If you are really interested in U.S. foreign relations history, take it. I would recommend it for other global students as it is a nice class, and maybe even someone like me who wants to try a global course. Not extraordinary, but a good course with a great professor, and sometimes the latter is the more important component. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely.  Professor Ford is a fantastic, helpful teacher and I learned so much in this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, purely to be with Robert Ford ",
            "\u00a0Yes, take this class for Professor Ford and the terrific reading list. The course totally changed the way I think about US foreign policy. ",
