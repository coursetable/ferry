            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student. Moira has been the best professor I have ever had at Yale. She goes above and beyond to make sure the classroom learning environment is ripe and out of her way to bring us films and information hidden or obscured by the academy. I have found very little classes at Yale that focus on Latin America from a peoples perspective. Rather than a neocolonial worldview like other courses at Yale provide, this one engages with Latin American sincerely and in good faith. Take this class if you want to think differently and find a community like no other. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a more critical reading of institutions and modern systems that rule our life. This course also introduced me to the recent history of Latin America, critical works of cinema from the region, as well as neoliberalism as a concept. ",
            "\u00a0If you've taken Radical Cinemas, you'll learn what became of Third Cinema, and you'll think about its legacies and its possibilities for political organization in the present. ",
            "\u00a0This class taught me so much about how to analyze film and how important it is as a political tool/a reflection of the times... I learned so much about how to assess culture critically. ",
            "\u00a0This course TRANSFORMED my understanding/conception of films - and Latin American politics, memory, the left, neoliberalism, representations of police, indigeneity, the list goes on. Some of the films we watched were the best I'd ever seen, and these treasures, in combination with the absolute gem that is Moira Fradinger, demanded sustained engagement from the class and spurred us to think harder, to attend to each others' ideas, to find deeper layers of meaning and connection. I'd never encountered teaching and class participation at this level before (finally! a Yale professor with a real pedagogy!), which really made every class a delight. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a deeper understanding of the political and cultural struggles in Latin America as well as an understanding of the shift in the film industry. I developed a greater appreciation for documentaries and for films that break conventions of typical Hollywood films. ",
            "\u00a0- broader range of knowledge in international cinema\r\n- a greater insight in international culture\r\n- political history of Latin American countries ",
            "\u00a0I had never taken a film class, and I am so happy this was tbe first one I took. Professor Fradinger taught me about this new genre in the most personalized and deliberate way. I can now watch a film and describe the techniques that the filmaker is employing to get a certain point across. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about film analysis, Latin America, and the politics of filmmaking more broadly (which I think was the most interesting part). "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This was the first time that this class was being taught, so there was not much structure or goal in the first few weeks. However, it developed as the semester progressed and would be a very interesting class with great discussions if offered again. ",
            "\u00a0As with any new course, some modifications to the film syllabus will improve class discussion of overarching themes. Moira is aware of this and is open to feedback regarding future iterations of this course. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course could add more discussion on film aesthetic because it was mostly focused on the politics of the film. The films were mostly all super interesting and entertaining to watch. I think that the class presentation and pre-presentation discussions often went on way too long leaving little class time to actually discuss the film. While the class often goes beyond the time frame of listed it is unfair that student who cannot afford stay longer miss out of the interesting class discussions and most likely do not get the opportunity to participate, which could influence grading. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths\r\n- good sense of community in the class\r\n- teacher is very familiar with most students\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n- disorganized \r\n- teacher could at times be unapproachable and difficult to contact\r\n- unclear expectations ",
            "\u00a0This course is taight by one of Yales finest literary scholarsProfessor Fradinger will constantly fascinate you with her knowledge and her ability to explain difficult ideas. ",
            "\u00a0I wish we got a little more historical background for some of the films. I loved, though, the combination of fiction and documentary films, and for the most part thought they made sense in the order in which we watched them. And I loved learning about neoliberalism, etc, and discussing the films through that lens. It would've been cool to have some more theoretical readings to go alongside some of the films (I'm thinking specifically how gender/trans theory might've influenced how I saw XXY, etc). But overall I loved the class!! The community it built was definitely my favorite part; Moira is so so great at shaping the class environment such that everyone feels comfortable and excited to talk about the films. "

            "\u00a0Yes. If you are interested in discussion that has to anything to do with politics, institutions, gender, race, class. And if not, come for the community that forms. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely-- the community that develops in this course, the topics of discussion, and the pedagogical methodology are truly unique at Yale. The films are both at the center and merely a starting point for the issues discussed-- on world views, the ethics of filmmaking and documentaries, and the effects of globalization in art, both as subjects of reflection and as forces shaping its production. Unfortunately, there are no manifestos or political statements to accompany these films as they did in Radical Cinema--this, however, quickly becomes a subject of analysis and discussion. It is a necessary class in beginning to engage in cultural criticism in the present. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Its so much fun you watch incredible movies and become close with your classmates; the class facilitates intellectual excitement really well, and we often stayed late because we didnt want to stop talking about the movies. Im not a film major/someone who enjoys movies more than casually, but this class changed that for me. ",
            "\u00a0Unequivocally. I mean, I do, almost daily. Moira is one of the Yale Greats - it would be a great shame to graduate without having learned from her. This class offers a particularly potent analysis of contemporary political conditions and discourses in the Western hemisphere, with Moira urging us to think more critically about our own positioning and particularities within these contexts. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because of the interesting material. However I would warn them about the expectations of the course. ",
            "\u00a0This course surveys an eclectic, brilliant mix of contemporary Latin American films that, on the surface, seem to touch upon one topic (historical, cultural) or another, but Moira leads absolutely wonderful, stunning discussions that led us to draw broader political connections between film and film, and film and life. I learned SO much during this semester, and don't regret taking it at all. And you should take it too!! Moira really cares about her students and her pedagogical methods, and all of that really comes through. ",
            "\u00a0While I feel like I learned a lot about other cultures and the history of politics in Latin American countries, I'm not so sure I would recommend this course to another student. The professor could, at times, be very welcoming and understanding and at other times ridicule students and embarrass them. I didn't feel like the teacher made an effort to approach me about ways to improve, and I felt like my efforts to reach out to the professor with questions were met  with exasperation. ",
            "\u00a0Everyone who gets a chance should take a class with Moira. This was an amazing experience to have, and the community that exists around the courses is great. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely--it demands a lot of time (we must've watched 50+ movies over the course of the semester), but it's completely worth it for the conversations (for which students often voluntarily stay late into the night) and the community. Moira is absolutely wonderful--you'll never meet a professor who cares more about her students or her class. "
