            "\u00a0We studied the scantily-attested language of Old Persian in its entirety in a single semester and read nearly the entire corpus, consisting of royal Achaemenian inscriptions. We also discussed the history of the Achaemenian Empire and the place of Old Persian within the Indo-Iranian and Indo-European language families. "

            "\u00a0It was actually somewhat remarkable what we were able to accomplish in this course. We moved at a very fast pace with grammar and vocab acquisition and it was somewhat overwhelming at first, although as we moved along and became familiar with the formulae of the inscriptions it becomes less daunting. In the first half of the course, there were cumulative vocab quizzes every week and the amount of vocab assigned each week in the book was significant in many of the earlier chapters. Although this was an effective way to jump-start our learning of the language, many of the words on the vocab lists were obscure, occurring only once in the entire corpus, and would not end up being on the vocab quizzes. It would have been helpful to have an abbreviated vocab lists to study of frequently-occurring key words to prioritise for the vocab quizzes. Otherwise, this course was incredibly engaging and rewarding and I thought that it was structured well. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student, albeit one who enjoys studying languages and has had experience with ancient Indo-European languages in the past. You have to be willing to put in the work of memorising the cuneiform signs early on and keeping up with the vocab and grammar in order to get something out of this class. "
