The lectures were very clear, and the guest lectures were fun to listen to.

The class is made up of 3 midterms and 2 papers, all 20% each. Fairly manageable class. Would take it again if I could! ",

I had previously taken another class titled 'social psychology' at Yale and actually only the first few weeks overlapped but I learned a lot of new stuff. ",

I also think this class could benefit from a section but altogether I thought it was well taught and the theory was fairly clearly explained. ",
            "\u00a0The course is designed really well for the semester. The pace is really good and the workload is manageable: three midterms, two papers, and no final exam. The lectures and textbook compliment each other and the textbook is actually an engaging and interesting read. Exams could be a little bit fairer; there would be a few questions on each exam that would be oddly specific that you'd only remember by chance. ",
            "\u00a0The course was interesting because it was very applicable to life. However, I thought it was really disorganized. I didn't know when the papers would be due during shopping period, and if I had I would have chosen a different course to balance out my workload. Also, I like to do readings when I have time over the weekend, but that was difficult when the reading schedule was not prepared or updated. ",
            "\u00a0A weakness of this course were the lectures. They were unnecessary to attend, as the professor read straight from the slides and then posted them online. In order to succeed all you had to do was read the textbook. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: great lectures, great readings, great experiments \r\nweaknesses: tests were either easy or impossible and there was not way in between ",
            "\u00a0Good focus on academic literature. Can feel a bit slow in the middle of the course but starts and ends strong. ",
            "\u00a0Overall really good course. The lectures tended to get pretty repetitive at the end, which was annoying. Also, some of the content we had to read in the textbook was never addressed in class. I think it would have been beneficial to have lectures going along with the readings (ie conflict, violence etc.). This would also eliminate some of the redundancy. \r\n\r\nI also felt that the exams were WAY too specific. Some of the questions asked about a specific term/idea that was covered in about one sentence in the textbook. I also felt like the exams just required us to regurgitate information, not make connections/focus on bigger picture stuff. ",
            "\u00a0Strength was the textbook. So fascinating! Weakness was how dull the lecture was. ",
            "\u00a0The tests were so annoying and had questions that were based on individual pages of the textbook so I always felt as though I were being tested on my memorization skills and not my understanding of the material. Lecture could be dry sometimes ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: Tests did not always assess knowledge of the material in a way that makes it seem like they care about learning. Some test questions would be stupid (i.e. what was this one study from this one textbox in this one chapter in the book that didn't really matter for this purposes of this topic?). Tests need to have more reasonable questions that assess knowledge and understanding instead of memory for a specific thing. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures and the textbook readings were very interesting, however the exams seemed to be testing on whether or not we read the textbook or were there for lectures rather than if we had learned the important pieces from this course. For example, a question would ask \"Did the author of your textbook take a stance on issue X?\" rather than asking if we knew the important pieces or even the details of issue X. The content was very applicable though, and interesting to learn about. The textbook also was enjoyable and easy to read. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Clark did well to incorporate her own studies as well as use the students in the class to create new statistics as well as reinforce old statistics and experiments. One of the weaknesses, however, was the class's undemanding attendance or workload. That might seem hypocritical from a student who wouldn't mind doing nothing, but I think the fact that there were no sections, or that there were no worksheets made it really easy for students to slack or not do anything relating to class until the exams or papers came up. ",
            "\u00a0I like the clicker questions because it allowed us to see what our classmates thought. I think the paper instructions need to be clearer. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: it was pretty clear what was expected from essays and exams. The textbook is really good and actually pretty interesting to read. The content itself is very interesting (if you're someone who's interested in people and how they behave). \r\nWeaknesses: sometimes lectures felt disorganized as things that appeared in one lecture would pop up later again. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - very comprehensive, taught well, easy to understand!\r\nWeaknesses - the lectures can be a bit repetitive ",
            "\u00a0Its strength is how interesting the content is, but sometimes it feels like a lot of it is common sense. Otherwise, the course is pretty simple. The exams were very manageable, as were the papers. ",

            "\u00a0The course content is interesting, however the way it was taught undermined its potential. What was taught felt like basic common sense, and I felt that there were many ways the course could be improved if topics were delved into more deeply and perhaps philosophically. The way the professor described things also felt a bit dry sometimes. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Clark really knows what she is talking about, but she is extremely unengaging and it makes this class difficult to sit through. Also, the fact that the readings are emphasized so heavily on exams but are never discussed in class seemed really unfair. I did read the textbook, but the fact that concepts were never discussed was not fair, especially since I didn't understand them all. ",
            "\u00a0this course covered a lot of psychological studies relating to relationship studies. this is fine, but i felt that a lot of lecture turned into jumping from study to study without much analysis of why this is important. i feel that we learn so much about how correlation isn't causation, but a lot of the theories from psychological studies require us to make inferences that imply causation from correlation. a lot of this information was really useful, though, and will help me in my relationships. a lot of the time i didn't really see the purpose of the clickers ",
            "\u00a0I think the information is good to know, but it can seem a little repetitive and redundant. Sometimes the lectures can get a little monotonous, even though the content is interesting-- maybe some form of interactivity would help. ",
            "\u00a0The material was really interesting but lecture wasn't the most engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Very very interesting and relatable topic. Exams were very difficult, with questions that seems highly specific and random, many people seemed to struggle. Lectures were engaging and integrated student input with clickers. ",
            "\u00a0This course is interesting by the nature of the subject material, and I found that it was fairly fun and not over-taxing. However, I do feel like the lectures could have been a tad more engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Good balance of depth in lecture and breadth in the readings. Truly, the textbook was one of my favorite aspects of the course- modern, informative and somehow funny. I would say the biggest weakness was that the lectures tended to be somewhat repetitive. They also did not follow in an order that I found particularly useful- I think it would make more sense to start with attraction, move into initiation, maintenance and then dissolution. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were sometimes repetitive, but overall good, and the textbook was very interesting ",
            "\u00a0Professor Clark is a good lecturer and inputs enough information to keep the class interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are Margaret Clark, who is really nice. However, this class is not as easy as you would think; there is a lot of reading, 3 challenging tests, and 2 papers.\r\nWeaknesses are the grading on the papers, at least for me. My grader was pretty strict both times and kind of ruined my grade. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Interesting, applicable and relevant, manageable workload, textbook was very enjoyable, interesting, and easy to read, engaging clicker questions\r\nWeaknesses: pretty impersonal lecture. Maybe that's my fault as I didn't go to office hours ever. On the other hand, this was also a strength of the class as I was able to not feel obligated to put in a huge amount of work, but rather blend into the class and let the interesting information seep into my brain when I felt like absorbing it. ",
            "\u00a0The information itself was very interesting, but the lectures seemed a bit redundant and drawn out. Additionally, the exams were quite difficult compared to the difficulty-level of the lectures. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are not always engaging and filled with a lot of unnecessary information--when there is something interesting, it's glossed over too quickly! A lot more on the exams comes from the book than previously stated. However, the actual content of the class, both lectures and the textbooks, was so interesting. The class should be called \"Relationship Science\" instead. ",
            "\u00a0The technical difficulties an disorganisation of the power points distract a little from the content, but overall a very good class. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were very clear, and the guest lectures were fun to listen to. You learn about different studies and their findings, and apply the results to real life. The class is made up of 3 midterms and 2 papers, all 20% each. Clickers are used in class to answer questions relevant to the material. Fairly manageable class. Would take it again if I could! ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course would be the wonderful professor and TAs. They were very helpful and always ready to guide us in the right direction. The difficulty with the course came when studying for examinations, because I had trouble managing the large loads of information to memorize from both slides and the textbook. ",

            "\u00a0The strength of this course definitely stems from Professor Clark. She was passionate and extremely knowledgeable about her field. She was a great lecturer who was easy to listen to and effortless to follow along. I think she really made this course worthwhile and I definitely wouldn't have enjoyed the course as much as I did without her. A weakness of this course may be that we were not assigned TFs. This created a lack of consistency when it came to the grading of papers because I had separate TFs who graded my paper and I think just having the same TF grade the two different papers will be better for rubric consistency. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were the amount and quality of the assessments and the cons were the lack of information given as to what exactly would be covered on the tests. ",

            "\u00a0I found the content very interesting. Very immediately relevant to everyday life. The professor was clearly knowledgeable and the TAs were helpful.  The readings complemented lectures well. I did think that a lot of information was repeated from one lecture the next in a 'recap' that was too lengthy in my opinion, but perhaps going over the content many times helped solidify my understanding more than I'm assuming. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very straightforward: lectures and textbook readings. However, I felt like the course was unorganized. The syllabus was a bit unclear at times and the lectures did not present the material in the most effective way. There were a lot of technology problems. Although these problems are minor, they do act up and detract from the learning environment. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include easy to follow lectures. An area of improvement would be sometimes it is difficult to hear the lecturer and the technical difficulties that were encountered. ",
            "\u00a0The course overall is a very good survey course of the field. It's interesting, insightful, and left me very surprised. I felt the biggest issues in the course lay in the exams and the papers. The exams did not feel that they were evenly distributed in difficulty level, and there were often questions that were very unclear and needed clarification. The paper, while not too difficult, had very few guidelines of exactly what the professor and TFs were looking for, and it left many people floundering. ",

            "\u00a0This was a good course if you are interested in social psychology. The three exams were a little challenging, but the papers you get to choose what to write about. I thought that this required some general knowledge about psychology before you took the course, however. ",

            "\u00a0Loved the course! Lecturers were engaging, and the material itself is super interesting! ",
            "\u00a0The readings had almost nothing to do with the lectures, so it felt like I was learning two entirely separate curriculums. I also felt like the organization of topics throughout the semester was haphazardly put together. This was likely exacerbated by the fact that the syllabus wasn't released in full at the beginning of the semester and/or plans changed so it was hard to exactly know what larger ideas we were supposed to be learning. In the future, please release the syllabus with all the readings at the beginning of the semester so people can get an idea of what the course is like and how much reading there will be. I found it incredibly frustrating to not know how many chapters I would have to read for the next month until the test for the current unit was over. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - we read the whole textbook so I learned a lot of information from that, Margaret was the best, felt very relaxed and low-key, so much information relevant to everyone's daily lives\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - sometimes I felt that the lectures focused too much on research studies that were done.

Honestly a decent amount of work with the two papers on top of the exams, I credit D'ed and it was a bit of a pain. You also actually need to do the readings to be able to do well on the tests. Take it if you're interested in learning about this part of psychology, but know that you're going to have to work a little. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend this course regardless of whether you're a psych major or not. The material is interesting and if you choose a topic for the papers that you're actually interested in, doing the research can be enlightening and an interesting process. It's more work than I initially thought, but not by too much. If you do the readings and take reasonably good notes, it's easy to do well on the exams. I'd recommend starting out credit D, and if you do well on the first exam and paper, switch to a letter grade. ",
            "\u00a0I didn't actively dislike this course but I didn't particularly like it either. The work is pretty straightforward--two essays, three exams, and a small amount of reading--but the amount of large assignments makes it kind of stressful so it doesn't really feel like a low workload but it kind of is. Like, you don't have a ton of reading every week, but then you usually have a major assignment coming up in the middle of midterms and during the last week of classes, and during finals period, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I think this information is crucial for forming healthy relationships in life and provided invaluable information and knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to others as it was mainly a waste of time and mostly common sense. Instead I would just recommend that students read the textbook on their own time because it is very informative about your own personal relationships and can help a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Not a bad class, and is very interesting. However, Margaret Clark is soooo boring. Extremely nice professor but it is hard to listen to her for an hour and 15 minutes. Also a very sneaky hard class. If you don't go to lecture and listen the test will be difficult. Even then, the test was challenging. Only take it if you are majoring in psych. Im glad I Credit/D it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I thought this course was very interesting and I would recommend to any student wanting to take an interesting psychology class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes -- Clark is a wonderful lecturer and the lectures are (mostly) quite interesting; she also goes out of her way to make herself available for help with papers and exam study. Exams are very straightforward and you have a lot of options for your papers. ",
            "\u00a0This was a good credit/D fifth class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It was a really cool class and I felt like the content has enriched my life. Workload is also really low: readings (you only really need to do them for the exam), 2 five page papers that are basically just summarizing studies, and three non-cumulative exams. Be warned, though, the exams can be kind of tricky asking for super specific content that was barely covered in class/reading. ",
            "\u00a0If you are only reading the responses here to know how much work you'll have to do, or if you'll have to show up, take this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, just because a lot of the readings are applicable to every day life and your own relationships. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly, not really. Unless you're a psych major, I probably wouldn't take it ",
            "\u00a0Good class to credit-d, sometimes exams were a struggle because answers were so specific. 3 exams, 2 papers, no final or homework. ",
            "\u00a0Super chill class, not much work, definitely good 5th credit ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to a friend. However, I would warn him/her of some of the mistakes I made that put me behind in the beginning. At first, I thought this class would be one of my easier ones. I went to most of the lectures at first but didn't read the textbook. After the first exam, however, I found that reading the textbook would've been more helpful than going to class. After that point, I started going to class less and reading the textbook fully. In the end, going to class, paying attention, and reading the textbook (although cumbersome) is the best way to excel in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Take this as a social science credit. Professor Clark is very interesting! ",
            "\u00a0YES! I'm really interested in the subject material, so I really enjoyed this class. Take it if you think you'll be interested too. The class itself is in a \"gut\" in the sense that there's not a lot of day to day work. However, you NEED to study before the exams. The first midterm had an extremely low average because people probably didn't study. You need to review all the readings and lectures before the exams, because they do ask some very detailed questions from readings & lecture. However the good thing is that the exam is non-cumulative, and essays are pretty short (5 pages) and can be about pretty much whatever interests you. The grading on essays is pretty chill too. Professor Clark is super nice and a leading researcher in the field. She clearly has a deep understanding on psychology, which is amazing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you're interested in how maintaining relationships work! ",
            "\u00a0Take it! Even after breaking up with my BF, it was interesting enough to continue going to lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you're interested in the subject. Because the scope is really just what the course description says, if you find the psychology behind attraction and relationships uninteresting you might not enjoy it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are looking for a class that is not very engaging but will teach you about attraction and relationships. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting class, mostly things that are common sense backed up with studies ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to someone else; I did not feel that it was a good use of my time or that I learned as much about the content as I would like to. ",
            "\u00a0It is interesting material, but not conducive to learning nor is it especially engaging. Plus the fact that there are 3 exams and 2 essays was a lot on my plate. ",
            "\u00a0a very fair course. a lot of information covered is really useful to know in the contexts of your own relationships. that being said, if you aren't interested in the methodology of psychological experiments, this isn't the course for you. a lot of this course is jumping from experiment to survey to experiment and making inferences from findings. the book is actually really useful and interesting to read and is essential to read if you want to succeed in the exams, as it covers material that doens't collide with lecture. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in social psychology because intimate relationships are important and not studied that frequently. It also might be cool just to learn about even if you're not a psych student. If you're a clinical student though, or looking for something really challenging and engaging, I wouldn't recommend it. ",
            "\u00a0Would recommend, but probably as a credit/d course ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this class because it is fun and easy. It definitely won't stress you out, but you will learn some interesting things about attraction and relationships that can apply to your own life. ",
            "\u00a0I found this class to be interesting in how useful the knowledge is, whether or not it claims to be a self-help course. It was not, however, the most inspiring or surprising course I have taken. Good, easy psychology credit that will probably help you to sustain better relationships in the future. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It is fun and not too difficult. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to another student because it is very interesting and applicable to their lives. Professor Clark is also one of the most helpful Professors I have ever had the experience of learning from. ",
            "\u00a0I think everyone should take this course! ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! Interesting, content is relevant and helpful in our own personal lives. Not stressful. Good social studies credit if you need one ",
            "\u00a0Took this class credit/d and as I soon found out, it is not one of those classes where you can't study for the test and expect to pass. The first and third tests were extremely difficult and required that you read most of the outside readings. Clark's slideshows often contradict what she had said earlier, so it is sometimes hard to figure out which one will be tested on. Lecture is also pretty dry. ",
            "\u00a0I do but only if you're willing to do all of the reading and proactively communicate with your TA about your papers' feedback. Lecture alone will not suffice for the exams or for gaining a thorough understanding of the course's key takeaways, and besides, the is incredibly well written and fun to read! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The information is super interesting and relevant and everyone should take this class ",
            "\u00a0If you're going to take this class, take it for the content. It's not exactly a gut; the exams are challenging but definitely doable if you study. The papers are also good. ",
            "\u00a0Yes; I found the content very interesting ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course as an interesting elective or for those who struggle with their own relationships. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this to any student at Yale. Any student, whether freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior, can take this class. You don't have to be a psychology major either. This lecture is phenomenal! The class is made up of 3 midterms and 2 papers, all 20% each. You also use clickers in class to ask questions. Really fun! TAKE IT! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because it provides not only interesting information on relationships, but also a comprehensive understanding of social science. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting material but the course isnt super well taught. You dont need to go to class to do well on the exams so take that for what its worth. Perfect credit D but kind of a lot of work to take for a grade ",
            "\u00a0It's an okay class. If you're really interested in the subject matter then it is easier to engage with the material. I found the grading to be extremely subjective which was frustrating. But if you go to class and take decent notes, and skim the readings before the exam I was typically okay. Prof Clark was great making herself available to the whole class if they wished to meet about anything, I just wish I took advantage of that offer earlier in the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Great credit d class for non psych majors ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! The interpersonal knowledge  I have gained from this class has Been highly influential in the ways I interact with others. I really loved this course. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to any student who is interested in learning about relationship science and wanting to explore an exciting new field of research in psychology. The professor is really great and the topic of the course is extremely interesting. The coursework is acceptable and will definitely have you asking some interesting questions about relationships. Lucy was a great TF as well who was really helpful and open to answering questions. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It is not mind-blowing but it is interesting and provides some insight on human relations. Other times it's pretty much common sense. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I think this class is interesting, informative, and important. It gives a clear background on the history and current research in the relationship science Field. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, interesting material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - it was super interesting. ",
            "\u00a0The course was super interesting and a very relevant topic to daily life of the average Yale student. I think the lectures were a little boring and the professor tended to read directly off the slide, but I would definitely recommend it as a fifth credit for someone looking for a lighter load and an interesting coarse. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the class. Very practically relevant to your everyday life. The course title is a little misleading because 'relationships' doesn't exclusively mean romantic relationships in this context - we studied a whole range of types of relationships and there isn't a single person to whom the content would be irrelevant. This class could be a great credit D. Very few readings (fast to skim) and lecture slides are self-explanatory. That being said, I found the first midterm harder than expecting. It was fun being able to choose my own topics for the two short papers. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0I thought it would be a gut and an easy course, but it is not as easy as it seems. I guess the learning and testing styles were just different to what I was used to. ",
            "\u00a0YES ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend the class, but be warned, the exams aren't always clear. Make sure you meet with the TF about your paper so you know what they are looking for. ",
            "\u00a0This class is interesting, but not particularly engaging. I thought there would be more information on different types of relationships, but we mainly focused on heterosexual couples and their family dynamics. If you do all the readings, it's not difficult to do well on exams, but I don't know if it's worth it to take a boring class just for the ease of passing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only to a psychology major or someone really interested in this topic. I thought it required some background knowledge of psychology. ",
            "\u00a0Extremely interesting topic, but not thrilling lectures. A good course to take credit D because the tests are purely memory based of random facts. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! A great course with a basic courseload (3 exams, 2 short papers), with great lectures and easy to follow slides. ",
            "\u00a0Unless you're a psych major in need of an easy elective to fulfill the requirements, this class isn't worth taking. It's poorly organized, both over the whole semester and within lectures. Sitting through this kind of 75 minute lecture twice a week was painful, and I found I could get through the lectures on my own (they're posted on Canvas) in 30 minutes tops. Tests are a combination of both lectures and readings, but are pretty easy as long as you actually prepare for them. It felt like I was teaching myself most of the material because I never went to class but it's super easy to digest so I wasn't too concerned about missing lectures (clicker questions weren't mandatory, but I'm not sure if she'll change that). On the bright side, Professor Clark is sweet and you'll learn a lot of practical advice for how to go about your own relationships. Though, I don't think these pros are enough to justify taking the class if you don't have to. ",
            "\u00a0overall a good class and pretty gutty - sometimes professor clark was really unclear on what she'd want and grades for papers were suddenly lower than expected without much feedback... but nice structure: 3 exams 2 papers throughout the semester and no final ",
            "\u00a0I loved this course. I don't think I've ever learned more in a class. You really get to know EVERYTHING about how relationships and people within relationships work. All the information is extremely relevant to everyday life and can be applied. \r\n\r\nThe workload isn't bad. Homework for each week is reading two chapters from the textbook. There are 3 exams and 2 essays  the essays aren't graded to harshly and the exams aren't more difficult than other psyc courses. \r\n\r\nMargaret Clark is so sweet and super accommodating. You also get to learn about her studies and she's a relationship expert! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. This was an amazing course taught by a wonderful professor. "
