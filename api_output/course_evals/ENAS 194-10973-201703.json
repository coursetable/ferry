        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This class covers a lot of material, and you will always feel like you're learning something new. If you're an applied math or physical field, it will be amazing to learn the techniques needed to open up new understanding of physics and math to you. For example, it was pretty awesome to finally learn why springs and simple harmonic motion move in a sinusoidal fashion! So in that regard, no complaints whatsoever.\r\n\r\nHowever, I do not think the Learning Catalytics in this class helped. They counted for too much of the homework grade, and did not really test understanding. ",
            "\u00a0The major strength of this class was the organization: there was a natural flow between psets, learning catalytics, reading quizzes, and exams.  The weaknesses were just about everything else, unfortunately.  The premise of this class sounded great: if you READ each of the sections, COMPLETED (by yourself) the reading quizzes and psets, then you would DO WELL on exams.  Unfortunately, as one of the few people who took notes from the book for each section and completed each reading quiz by myself, I was disappointed with the time I put into this course.  Please don't take this class -- not in it's current version; it looks like it's set up to allow you to succeed, but that's not the case at all. ",
            "\u00a0Followed the organization of most other differential equations--a lot of methods for solving ordinary differential equations and (some) partial differential equations. Really enjoyed instructor approach to learning. Would have liked to learn more about partial differential equations, and maybe seen (not necessarily practiced!) some numerical methods. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures are almost useless: material covered in exams and problem sets is way beyond more difficult than lecture material. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Rolf was amazing, the \"prime the pump\" quizzes we had before class everyday were annoying, but also definitely helped with learning.\r\nThe learning catalytics was not very useful and more annoying than anything because of how finnicky it treated responses. ",
            "\u00a0Very passionate teacher, but a tad unorganized. It would be better if things were posted farther in advance ",
            "\u00a0It presents the material in a very straightforward manner and does not presuppose any knowledge of differential equations. (This can be a strength or weakness depending on the students knowledge coming into the course). It was also sort of a flipped classroom, which I found a bit irritating. I really like good lectures, and Jim Rolf is an excellent lecturer, but just going through example problems in class was incredibly boring. At a point, a good amount of people (including myself) stopped going to most lectures ",
            "\u00a0I really did not like the reading quizzes, but I see the benefit from them!\r\nThe in class problems were really helpful and Prof Rolf's teaching style really helps with learning the material! It is great to be able to practice the math in class rather than just listening to lecture the entire time. The visuals were also helpful.\r\n\r\nI also liked the student of the day and the music! ",
            "\u00a0The course was well organized and very digestible -- the pace was slow enough that I could understand concepts reasonably well after each lecture. The in-class examples, online team-question answering, and pre-lecture quizzes all worked well to prime and cement my learning. The only things that could have been better are fewer typos in reading quizzes, lecture handouts, and problem set questions that sometimes left me puzzled and frustrated for long periods of time. In addition, while the use of technology in the lecture was refreshing, I felt that Professor Rolf using the iPad to mark up the handouts on a live projection in class wasn't as effective as him writing on the board. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the reading quizzes as an *idea* were good, however they would have been much more effective as videos. I found it difficult to read and get a lot from the reading before going to class; something about the audio visual connection makes things easy to understand!! ",
            "\u00a0The course gave a very good overview of the various methods used to solve the common classes of differential equations. It was effective as I came out of the class understanding how and when to apply the various methods.\r\n\r\nThe pre-lecture reading quizzes were useful to give a context before jumping into the lecture, but the assigned readings could perhaps be made in a more digestible form than the textbook.\r\n\r\nNonetheless this is not a mathematics class, therefore there was little emphasis on theoretical derivation. ",
            "\u00a0This course offered good lectures that clearly outlined the essential ideas of diff. eq. topics. The readings before class were a helpful requirement for pinpointing what you didn't understand. The weaknesses in this course unfortunately made it difficult for people not of a very specific type to succeed. While lectures were thoughtful and helpful for simple topics, the psets were much more involved, and took a lot of time, which was really alright if you had classmates to work with and went to office hours. The exams however were much more conceptual than anything else we had seen, and much harder. We were not provided with a full equation sheet as would have been very helpful, only one with certain equations that were largely irrelevant. The exams were not well written, for example the final was 300 pts, and two questions with several parts made up nearly half the points. If you could not get the 1st part of these questions, it was impossible to move on because of the way in which the test was written, so even if you knew how to do later parts those points were completely lost. Overall I think time could have been better spent on later more challenging topics, and maybe for a class taught not through the math department but through the engineering school, there could have been a better understanding of the needs of most of the students. As an engineer I 100% believe in the importance of understanding the fundamentals of this math, and even some applications, but the exam emphasis on conceptual proofs and ideas that were barely discussed in the course did not seem helpful, relevant, or fair to the majority of students. ",
            "\u00a0the format kinda of sucks. I don't learn anything by discussing with neighbors. Some people might like the interactive study, but if you cannot adapt, your are pretty much on your own. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course was the way that it was taught. We had reading quizzes on the readings we would cover in lecture before each lecture. Though this was at first annoying, ultimately it was very helpful and by the time I got to class I felt like I knew what I didn't know. We had our notes typed out and printed for us at the beginning of almost every class, which really allowed us to focus on understanding what was taught rather than trying to jot down everything on the board. The homework was difficult but we had TFs and Prof. Rolf himself who could help us on it. I guess the weakness of this course as I saw it was that the tests relied on memorization rather than understanding. I felt like I understood most of the content but I hadn't memorized all the formulas. Perhaps this is my fault but I also think that it would have been a better test of knowledge to have given us the formulas and then given us harder questions. ",
            "\u00a0Syllabus has no information about exams and very little about grade distribution. The way the course is structured does not facilitate learning since its very confusing and hard fo follow. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course is taught fairly well. This year we Professor Jim Rolf, though I think it changes. There aren't that many reseources outside of class so the teaching is very important. I think the slightly backwards classroom approach served well for the majority of the semester and held students responsible for their learning. Class was pretty engaging and was one the few instances that I learned while in the classroom. Outside the classroom, resources are poor. The office hours consisted mostly of peer help which was good and uniting. However, it would have been nie to have a reliable TA who could clearly talk through ideas. Also, the test review sessions were horrible. ",
            "\u00a0The course was well organized. Every lecture felt like a logical step or progression off of the previously learned material. Sometimes it felt like we were moving too fast, but psets did a good job of reinforcing material. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely loved this course.  I found it to be very strong.  I loved the flipped classroom method because I felt like I was given an opportunity to really get a handle on the material before seeing it in class.  That way it was double reinforced and much easier to understand.  I found the lectures to be very interesting and useful and felt like although the workload was fairly large, it was all very necessary. ",
            "\u00a0I think the format of this course was done well, but it relied a little too heavily on the flipped format, assuming a little too much understanding during class and thus moving a little too fast at times. ",
            "\u00a0I loved Professor Rolf's passion and energy. I was a bit disappointed with number of engineering applications we found for what we were doing, however. A lot of the concepts felt like they were only touched upon from a pure math perspective. ",
            "\u00a0In class we did a lot of examples which were very helpful for the psets ",
            "\u00a0This course tries to cram way too much into one semester and as a result is the most overwhelming course I have ever taken at Yale. If this were split into two semesters of ordinary and partial differential equations and their applications, the concepts could be gone over with much more depth which would result in a stronger math background moving forward with engineering. I think it is very important for engineers to have a strong foundation in math which they will then apply to physics and other application based sciences. Math 120 and 194 are the only math classes I have taken at Yale and I am wishing my math foundation was stronger than it is. I do like that we go over applications of the equations and not just how to robotically solve them. ",
            "\u00a0The content is good and there are a lot of opportunities to learn but the workload is excessive. Also, lecture is not really lecture as we usually just went through a list of problems. ",
            "\u00a0The course was organized, well designed and well-structured and the instructor was well invested in teaching and helping students discover their weaknesses and address them. ",
            "\u00a0At first, the textbook was very difficult to understand. After some time getting aquatinted with it it became a major source of my learning. Similairly, it took me a bit of time to adjust to the professor's lecture method of giving us handouts, but once I settled into the rhythm I found the handouts to be very helpful. This course is pretty fast paced. \r\n\r\nI think that some of the pset questions were unnecessarily involved when it came to the algebra. This meant spending way too much time doing pre-calculus things as opposed to grappling with the subjects at hand. \r\n\r\nAs I was studying for the final and re-read the chapter on oscillations, I found it to be vastly more straightforward. I think that this chapter was not taught in as straight forward of a manner as it could have been. Going through it for the second time, I realized that all of the nuanced equations were simple consequences of the quadratic equation that was used to find the characteristic equation of the system. Perhaps that should be emphasized more the next time the course is taught. Instead of seeing it in that light the first time around, I though it was a totally different thing and thus didn't see the obvious continuity. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: the flipped classroom style was incredibly well-done here.  reading quizzes helped me understand the material.  Prof Rolf's classroom teaching style is straightforward and he is very welcoming to questions.  plus, he is an overall awesome professor who really cares about his students.  \r\n\r\nweaknesses: grading system was not very transparent - all along I had thought reading quiz grades were based on completion, only at the very end of the class did I learn they were based on score. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Rolf clearly cares a lot about the class and about his students, and tries to set up the best scenario for learning. This is especially through the pre-class reading quizzes, which I think would help in theory but the majority of students just guessed the answers or took them from other people, and some just didn't do them at all. I guess that's on them, though.\r\n\r\nI felt the material was too theory-heavy and did not include a lot of real-world examples, which would have been appreciated considering the course is technically an ENAS class. \r\n\r\nThe PSETS were also just WAY too difficult at some points, which also lead students to copy answers or half-ass the approach because they were simply beyond the scope of what we had learned. \r\n\r\nThe tests themselves were also pretty tough, and the grading was incredibly harsh. For example, if you get a question in part a wrong, you're screwed over for the entire question, all the way to part d in some cases. I remember one instance where I dropped a negative but did an entire problem correctly, and I ended up with the entire rest of the question wrong, with hardly any partial credit. I found this very frustrating and unfair. "

            "\u00a0Yes! If you're in a STEM field, this course is essential to everything! ",
            "\u00a0I cannot recommend this course in it's current form.  For an ENAS and **applied** physics course, the focus was too theoretical.  Additionally, Jim Rolf relies on a flipped classroom model, which is a disservice to his students.   Since there are no videos or extra materials, we read from the textbook to understand our reading quizzes (yes, quizzes is plural).  This was Rolf's first time teaching the course, so while I'm sure it'll improve with time, I'd stay away from this course until it consistently gets higher ratings. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Rolf was very helpful during the course and presented the material in a way that made it very manageable. Consistent practice with the methods was provided, which was crucial for learning. Not as much theoretical background was provided for the methods, but knowing how to use the methods is the most important takeaway from this class anyway. ",

As a junior Physics major, I really wish I had taken it during my sophomore year, as it would have been very helpful for a number of problems encountered in classical mechanics and introductory quantum mechanics (even though this course didn't quite make it to the wave equation). However, if you really like math, this course probably won't be for you. There is very little theory and few derivations. ",

Definitely find a good study group to compare problem sets with, as that was what made this class much more manageable for me. ",

Dr. Rolf is an engaging professor, and you will really enjoy his personality and enthusiasm in lecture. The psets were tough, and the exams will push your boundaries but were very fair. The class will start a lot easier, then pick up quickly after the first midterm. So keep that in mind!!! Overall a great course. Also glad I took it concurrently with linear algebra! I feel like that solidified my understanding. ",

The concepts start off alright but rapidly morph into complicated and largely unnecessary things only a small portion of students actually need. Rolf's lectures were good but I did not find he was entirely capable of understanding where struggling students with a weaker math background were coming from, and because of this even though he tried he often was not that helpful. The exams were WAY harder than the psets which were somewhat more difficult than the material covered in class. For a course offered through the engineering school, it was very conceptual and not so helpful in terms of applied topics. ",

Rolf, it's more like a Math class with a superficial explanation to some of the most important applications (eg vibrations) and class structure like Math 115 (reading quizzes + learning catalytics + 8hr pset). Did not like the structure at all, very few people actually engaged in class, no lecture notes ",
