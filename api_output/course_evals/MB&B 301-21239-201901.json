            "\u00a0Honestly, there were many times where this course began feeling more like a very intensive molecular biology course than biochemistry. The material covered is pretty much all material that is covered in the Intro Biology sequence, just in much much much more depth. This course was VERY memorization-heavy to the point where larger concepts were often lost or ignored. The topics covered were DNA and RNA chemistry, DNA replication, transcription, translation, and all of the other steps related to these processes in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Additionally, the last few weeks of classes there was a focus on cancer, immunobiology, and developmental biology, but for the amount of depth we were expected to get from these topics, very little time was spent on them. Karla and Christian both said throughout the course that the goal was for us to \"think like a scientist,\" and this was reflected on the exam content, however they never really taught us those skills.

            "\u00a0This course truly taught me how to think like a scientist. I know many science courses at Yale, and particularly biology courses, claim that they analyze experimental methods and challenge students to think like scientists. However, I have found that most dont. This course does. When I read a paper or look at data from an experiment, I challenge everything. Now, I dont believe anything thats put in front me, but rather use the data to come to a conclusion on my own and look for any missing controls or other information. The distinction between data and interpretation is also clearly illustrated in this fantastic course. ",

I know transcription, replication, translation, splicing, and so many other mechanisms by heart that I cannot stress how much depth there is to the class. You also learn about a lot of molecular biology and biochemistry laboratory techniques and how to interpret actual data, and not just regurgitate what protein does what. ",
            "\u00a0The class helps you learn how to analyze data from a host of biochemical techniques, and how to think about the data you have in the context of biological theories/knowledge. Obviously, you memorize a lot of information in the class, but the main skill that I appreciated taking from this was being able to analyze experiments. The content of the course is sort of like \"The Biology of the Central Dogma\" ",

            "\u00a0I've never taken a course that had such a broad scope while covering topics in such depth. We covered so much: DNA and RNA topology, phage genetics, immunology, virology/oncology, developmental biology, prokaryotic and eukaryotic replication, transcription and translation, various RNA biologies (snoRNAs, snRNAs, miRNAs, etc), RNA processing, experimental design, and basically every landmark discovery in molecular biology from the last decade or so.

It definitely improves the critical thinking skills needed to analyze data. Unfortunately, it also makes you memorize dozens of pathways and mechanisms that you will never see again for the rest of your life unless you are working on a research project involving one such pathway, at which point a day's worth of reviewing the literature would provide a much more complete understanding of the topic.

A lot of learning is done on the exams. ",

        ],
        [
            "\u00a0In all honesty, I did not enjoy this class. Like with most biology classes at Yale, there was a big emphasis on memorization, and not so much on understanding the material. Even when I put a lot of effort into the psets and studying for exams, I feel like I didn't get much out of it in terms of lasting knowledge. Especially given the number of TAs and professors involved in the course, I would have liked to get much more feedback on psets and exams than I received. Instead, the class felt as detached as a lecture with 200 people even though there were only ~40 people enrolled. ",
            "\u00a0The tests were so hard. I hope my grade is decent because I was definitely in the lower half. The lecturers were ok for the most part. I liked how both Christian and Karla tried to accommodate all students in reviews. Christian was a pretty good lecturer but often included way more information than we could go through in the time for the class, so we often rushed through the end slides and they would still show up on exams. Karla wasn't a great lecturer, she would often just read off the slide, and would give conflicting info. ",
            "\u00a0This course overall was very weak. Christian was a better lecturer than Karla, but neither were particularly organized or good at teaching. A major weakness was the poor communication. We never had any idea what material would actually end up on exams, resulting in a practice of mass memorization, yet still missing facts that had a massive impact on performance. For example, there was a lecture where we did not get to the last few slides, and Christian told us we would not be tested on the missed material. The following lecture, we again did not make it to the last few slides, but it was not made explicit that we would need to cover that information on our own, leaving us to believe that, like with the prior lecture, material not covered in class would not be tested. On the first midterm exam, there was a question worth 17% of the total score focused solely on the material at the very end of that second lecture. Following the first exam, many students submitted their tests for a regrade to contest points lost that they saw as being too picky or unfair. On the day that regrades were handed back, we were told \"for those of you who took a long time to write out lengthy regrade request, next time you should put that time and energy towards actually studying for the exam,\" even though we had been encouraged to submit regrades if we felt that the grading was unfair. This comment was quite frustrating, as we had ALL put in a ton of effort into studying only to be dismissed. Further, no regrades were given more than a point back, and it was not made clear where the points back were coming from, making this information completely unhelpful in preparing for future exams. \r\n\r\nFor the second midterm exam, there was a large question focused on designing a PCR primer. We had discussed PCR broadly in class but never gone through any of the specifics of creating a PCR primer, nor were we told to cover this, rendering this question extremely unfair for anyone who hadn't actually performed PCR. Classes were extremely memorization-heavy with excessive detail for every process we learned about, yet exams would be very experiment-heavy with countless gels to interpret and data to wade through to draw conclusions that were very loosely (or not at all) tied into what we had covered in class. For students with little to no biochemistry lab experience, the course was a nightmare. When students raised this concern we were told, \"you don't need to have had lab experience- you just need to think like a scientist,\" something the professors did not actually help foster in lecture. Additionally, grading in this class was ambiguous. Upper level STEM courses are stressful enough when you know where you stand in the class, but doing poorly on exam after exam and having no clue what that number will translate to as a grade is far more stressful. The syllabus said that in past years 30% of the class would get an A and 50% would get an A- or B+, but beyond that, we had no idea what grading would look like. Even worse, we were not told until the LAST WEEK of classes that the final exam would count for our entire grade in the class if it was higher than both midterms. While this is a great opportunity for redemption in a course, it should have been made known from the beginning so people could plan their study schedules accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe only material that even somewhat prepared us for exams were the problem sets, but even they were poor representations. One strength of this course was that slides were always printed for us for each lecture, which I greatly appreciated, as printing at Yale is expensive. Another strength was the in-class group problem given every lecture. As someone who has a hard time sitting through long lectures, it helped to break it up. ",
            "\u00a0I am not here to go on a giant unproductive rant or to vent, so I really hope that if the professors are reading these reviews, they read this carefully and take into consideration what I am saying. Everything I am saying here is in an attempt to be as constructive as possible. I am being critical but honest, and also suggesting concrete areas of improvement. So: pedagogically, this class was a mess, for three reasons:\r\n\r\n1) As a visual learner who relies on concise and compact lecture slides, the actual lectures were impossible to follow. The powerpoint slides were unreadable because the average slide probably had ~200 words on it and 3-4 confusing figures without much helpful commentary. Many of the slides were literally screenshots from textbook pages or random papers. And they contained so much confusing detail that on occasion, the professors seemed very confused by them too! I know it is an arduous and difficult thing to change, but in the future, I would hope that the professors try to remove the giant blocks of text throughout and replace them with concise 1-2 sentence interpretations of the actual figures. Also, I think it goes a long way to just have more slides and less stuff per slide, so that students are really focused on what's being discussed at any given moment in time rather than looking at a mini-textbook page. Finally, sometimes the figures are incredibly confusing because they have way too much going on in them. In these cases, I would hope that the professors would hand-draw and scan a simplification of the diagram with key elements and takeaways rather than just the entire picture from a paper. \r\n\r\n2) There simply are not enough resources for students to succeed if they aren't the type of student who \"gets\" something on the first time. I think that what can really help with this is *somehow* making sure that the TAs know what's going on in the class (the TAs are aggressively unhelpful, and often seem to know less biochemistry than the students), having a closely monitored Piazza forum for students to be able to ask questions 24/7, and video recording lectures. You won't need to worry about student attendance dropping with recorded lectures anyways, since you have the quizzes to keep tally of student attendance.\r\n\r\n3) In spite of the purported objective of the class, the content itself reflected constant digressions from the broader vision of the class and DETRACTED from the course objectives. I think that there need to be broad curriculum revisions both on the level of individual lectures and the broader arc of the class. Ideally in theory, the only content that should be taught in lecture is stuff you would hope we would take away from the class in a longer term fashion. Why we spend time on things like \"the sugar pucker\" or all of the different initiation/elongation factors or the crazy lambda phage details is beyond me. If spending time on these random minutiae somehow contribute to helping us think like a scientist, maybe keep them, but it is my opinion that they do not. As far as the broader arc of the class, I would also hope that this class reflects greater interest in the ways that biochemistry is a subdivision of chemistry and not merely a lofty name for molecular biology. What I feel is missing is the commitment to interrogating the nexus of biology and chemistry as two intertwined fields, rather than \"this is us biologists pretending to do chemistry, because technically, the ribosome is a big molecule too.\" It probably wouldn't have hurt to see a few chemical mechanisms (yes, with arrow pushing) rather than our 10,000th gel, and please get rid of the developmental biology lecture which is absolutely a non sequitur. \r\n\r\nAnyways, I think this class has immense potential, and hopefully it changes for the better soon! ",
            "\u00a0This class is HARD. It takes Biochem 1 to a whole new level, with a massive amount of information per lecture and competitive atmosphere. Although the professors and TAs are engaging and really want the students to understand the material, the competition between students is readily apparent. Although not completely organized in material, the class is well taught and encompasses more material than I ever thought I would know or understand about Biochem or molecular bio. ",
            "\u00a0There's just so much material, good lord, reducing the sheer amount of material would be nice. ",
            "\u00a0learned a lot, really engaged with the material \r\nprofs rushed through slides at times though, profs tried to squeeze in too much into one lecture that I left feeling overwhelmed, nevertheless consolidating material for final was very satisfying ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: in depth analysis of nucleic acids\r\nWeaknesses: poor organization (random topics left and right), poor lecturers in general (sometimes assumed that students had knowledge about topics that they didn't), grading was quite strict on exams, extremely competitive climate amongst students ",
            "\u00a0This course excels at making students do science - real science, where you interpret data and come to a conclusion, not just regurgitating facts. However, in order to do that, you need an extensive background of knowledge from the lectures, which are unfortunately not always very clear. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the depth\r\nWeaknesses: could probably remove the last three lectures and just spend more time on the first 21 ",
            "\u00a0At times, the lectures can seem to be a bit unorganized. As a result, I found it quite difficult to follow during lectures. This made the group problems nearly impossible for me to answer. However, when I went back and studied the notes more slowly, the information became clear and understandable. In addition, all the slides were printed for each student before class, and they were very text heavy which made studying much easier even if I didnt follow during the lecture. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course is that the material is interesting and the professors are very knowledgeable. \r\n\r\nThere were many weaknesses for this course. The material was presented in way too convoluted of a manner in order for students to actually understand what was going on. The Help Sessions were often not that helpful. The peer tutors were not that really creating an accepting learning environment from what I heard, and the tests were ridiculously detailed/hard. It is clear that the professors wanted this to be a \"difficult\" class, and then often meant convoluting topics into becoming much more difficult than they needed to be. The worst aspect of the class, however, was that the students were extremely competitive and fought with each other in front and behind the scenes. This was easily the class environment that I hated the most out of any class I've taken at Yale, and I was not the only student to feel so. I am not sure if the class can be fixed, but, here are some suggestions:\r\n-Stop testing with such ridiculous detail and difficulty that only students from elite school backgrounds can succeed.\r\n-Make review sessions/Help Sessions actually have content rather than just having student questions\r\n-Cut down every lecture by at least 15% (there was legitimately so much information that I was detrimental to learning any of the topics well in any degree)\r\n-Stop encouraging competition in the class\r\n-Get rid of the quizzes (I understand you want to have good attendance and make sure people are paying attention, but this was a waste of time and only a few students would understand)\r\n-Stop calling on the same 2-3 students to answer 90% of the questions (it makes everyone else in the class feel stupid and belittled)\r\n-Stop trying to make this the \"elite\" version of Molecular Biology (there's no need to make this harder than necessary and there's another class that learns literally the exact same thing with 50% of the mental health detriment)\r\n\r\nI had been told by many people that this was the \"best\" course of MB&B (and one of the best at Yale in general). After the torture of previous MB&B and Chemistry courses required for the major (particularly Orgo 2 and MB&B 300), I was really excited for the course, but I left very disappointed. (Also I would like to say that the professors always say how people talk badly about the course on the reviews and then get As and come apologize to them, but I would like to make it very clear that no matter my grade, a F or an A, this one of the worst academic experiences of my and my friend's lives and I wouldn't change a single thing I have said in this review). ",
            "\u00a0This class is great in that it presents the most essential biochemical research in regards to the central dogma. I was happy with the large amounts of material presented because I knew it was all important. That being said, I often felt like examinations and problem sets tested the minute details while not focusing on big themes. Like many students, I felt like I knew 95% of the material, but due to the nature of the questions and tests, was only getting 75% of the points. A recommendation would be to focus less on the little details and more on the big concepts. Instead of asking about the exact number of double stranded breaks induced in each cycle of eukaryotic replication, it might be more useful to focus on the big picture of DNA replication and repair. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength is the amount of material covered. The main weakness is also the amount of material covered, which is rather obnoxiously vast and impossible to cover in one class, which is why we left 5 to 10 min late every class. It is just impossible for anyone to remember this much content. Moreover, I think another major weakness is the fact that the class assumes you are already familiar with interpreting data from different molecular biology techniques that many of the students simply haven't had exposure to. I also think there is a great discrepancy between the teaching methodologies of Professor Neugebauer and Schlieker, which requires students to be constantly adapting to a new method of learning biochemistry every other lecture. Finally, and most importantly, the exams are *poorly written* and sometimes you get points off not because you didn't know the content or how to interpret the data, but rather because you couldn't understand the question because it was so ambiguous. For instance, in the final, every 15 minutes professors would say \"this is what I actually meant\" and I would have to go back and fix my answer to a 10-part question. ",
            "\u00a0Sections were rather unstructured. They were not mandatory which is nice, but also if you went, you kinda just asked questions and got help with the problem sets if you needed it. However, if sections were times to either discuss the papers/experiments we learned about in class like intro bio, or were times formally structured in terms of review, like organic chemistry, they would've been far more helpful. ",
            "\u00a0There are lots of attempts to get students engaged. But often, theyre not really working. For example, asking us what are the data? is not going to get us thinking  instead, it will confuse us because its too vague. I wish that there was just a little bit more guidance on these problems. Perhaps the questions could be phrased like what is unusual about these data? or what are the data saying with regards to RNA structure?. Also, the lecture quizzes dont really work because theyre really, really difficult and its always the same people who answer. I think the difficulty of these quizzes could be adjusted better. I know that Prof. Neugebauer tried to get a sense of this, but only at the end of the semester. This needs to be done throughout the semester instead. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest weakness of the course were the sections. Every week they just turned into problem set work sessions. I find it ridiculous that none of the TAs whose section I attended (or heard about) had anything prepared before section. When questions were asked during section, often times the TAs would just scroll through the lecture slides to try and glean the answer off of the slides. While I know that the graduate students are busy, I've never taken a class in which they were so unprepared to teach. ",
            "\u00a0This class should not be taught as is if the prerequisites remain the same. As someone who has taken the minimum level of biology prerequisites, I found the material well over my head and taught without a proper buildout up to the few students to whom it was new. Additionally, this course was more of a molecular biology course than a biochemistry course, and as a chemistry major, I would highly recommend against taking it as the material I was interested in and more prepared for was not taught. The class also highly favored those students who had previously performed chemistry research. To improve this class, either the amount of background info taught needs to increase or the material needs to be less detailed oriented, and there should be an enrichment section where everything is retaught slowly like there is for the intro bio sequence. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: professors, TAs, content. This is one of the most interesting courses I have taken at Yale. For the first time, I felt like an actual MB&B major and not just a chemistry major. The content was very cool; I learned so much about DNA and RNA that I never even knew existed, and I liked the focus on RNA biology and wide scope of applications covered at the end. Dr. Neugebauer and Dr. Schlieker were also fantastic. They are clearly experts in their field and have a lot of teaching experience, and I enjoyed learning from them a lot. The TAs were also very committed to helping us learn.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: course environment. This course is kind of infamous in the MB&B major for being difficult - and it was. This is by far the most difficult course I have taken at Yale (and for everyone that is reading this who just finished 300 - I got perfects on the exams in 300 and struggled to even score slightly above average in this course). The course is like 40 or so people, which is much smaller than 300, and its not a random group either: its mostly the geniuses from 300 and other competitive MB&B majors. Together, this creates a course environment that's a little tense and a little stressful. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Interesting material, quizzes were okayish at keeping student engagement, understanding the thought process behind experiments was emphasized.\r\nWeaknesses: The material was not organized in the best way for student understanding; also not taught very interestingly. The slides with heavy information in each of them were overwhelming. I think it might be better to try to reduce the information on the slides in order to focus on the narrative of the lecture. The slides kept the lecture from being streamlined. It was just a big chunk of information after another big chunk of information. ",
            "\u00a0This class was great at the start - it hits you in the face with complicated experiments and forces you to be a quick learner and jump from one mechanistic study to the next.  As the semester went on, it became far less conceptual and much more fact based - it devolved into a messy molecular biology class with tons of factors and pathways to memorize. Overall, I definitely learned a lot from this class and I'm glad I managed to get through it, but I wish there was less rote memorization required. Why do we need to spend a full class on prokaryotic translation and memorize all the translation factors, and then do the exact same thing for a full class on eukaryotic translation? Wouldn't it suffice to just add the unique facts about eukaryotic translation as an optional addendum to the prokaryotic translation class? Who in the world benefits from memorizing every translation factor anyways? I doubt that any one in the MBB 301 class is going to end up doing research on translation. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: not many. Weaknesses: many.\r\nFirst, this course covers way too much material and requires memorization of minute details that are so many, it is overwhelming to study for the exams. Often times the lectures are long and drawn out, focusing on confusing experiments and going over the details of every molecular interaction of the ribosome. The lecture slides also need major fixing. They often contain a surplus of information as well as figures that contradict the written information. There needs to be better scrutiny of the figures and assessment of whether all the information or figures are truly necessary. This course focused way too much on small details and not much on the bigger picture. If it were better organized to be focused on the larger concepts, that would be much much better. The material was just presented in lecture in such a way that it was really difficult to understand. The logic flow in the slides was just confusing. For example, the Holliday junctions, catalytic RNA, and lamda phage lectures were just unnecessarily convoluted. The figures were so confusing, and the textbook presented it in a much more logical and easy-to-understand way than the professors. Overall, I think a reevaluation of the information of this class is necessary. There is no need to have on all the slides every A-minor motif interaction or every protein involved in translation. The professors really need to go back over the slides and cut out what they don't think is necessary for the bigger picture. This would make the class so much more enjoyable and I believe the students would actually get more out of the class. Sometimes, less is more and I think the instructors need to understand that. One improvement the instructors could make would be to make a study guide for each lecture that includes all of the relevant important details they felt were necessary to memorize. The instructors should look to Thomas Pollard for Cell Biology or even MBB 300 instructors on what constitutes a good study guide, as this would be guaranteed to be well received by the students and make the class much better. Additionally, the course would also improve by having problem sets that if kept the same, would constitute more weight to the final grade. Many of the problem sets were just impossible to do unless going to section, and took hours to complete. Lastly, it was often expected that students would go and read the papers uploaded on Canvas. In fact, one question on the exam was presumed to be \"easy\" because it was straight from the paper. One thing the professors need to understand is that this class already requires so much time and work that asking to read the papers is often too much. Students also have other classes and by going over the lectures, reading the textbook, and doing the problem sets for this class, it already takes up so much time. Expecting the students to also read the papers is just too much. Lastly, one improvement I hope to see is that the instructors should run the exam by the TAs before giving it to the students. Often times the exams were just unnecessarily difficult or tested over topics that were covered in lecture for less than a couple of minutes (riboswitches, rifamycin, actinomycin). The TAs should evaluate whether the exam is too long or over material that wasn't emphasized. Since if the TAs can't even do well on the exams, why are the students expected to? And on a further note for the TAs, I hope better selection goes into picking the TAs. The TA review sessions were one of the most useless review sessions I've ever encountered during my Yale experience. It was clear the TAs were not regularly engaged with the material and often times had no idea what was going on. They were unenthusiastic and generally exuded an attitude of aloofness that was extremely frustrating to work with. They should be required to keep up with the material so they can better help the students. Also final does not need to be cumulative! ",
            "\u00a0This course covers a lot of information that is interesting, relevant, and creates space for understanding a lot of past scientific techniques. However, the course attempts to cover far too much material in far too much detail. The course could be improved by further cutting out information (almost every class ran over and involved a hurried scrambling in the past five minutes to run through slides). I also think TA help sessions were not helpful and could be improved by informing TAs more thoroughly about the material so that they can effectively answer questions and introducing some sort of structure into the help sessions, so that they're not just a study hall to do problem sets. Furthermore, I think key information that we are expected to truly learn and understand should be clearly emphasized. Because this class covers so much material, studying for it is nearly impossible when you don't know what's actually important. At times, some of the test questions were literally based off of one sentence on a singular slide that was in no way emphasized. Through emphasis on important topics in class, in help sessions, in office hours, and in review sessions, this could improve. ",
            "\u00a0I think this class covered a lot of material and we learned a lot but I think it would be better if we covered like 70% of the material we did and we would still have learned a lot. If we just had less material, it would have been more enjoyable and less stressful to study for. Also, if the TAs were a little more lenient about grading and not grading according to the exact wording of your answer, that would be great too. Also, if the TAs and the professors would work together on what was on the psets to coordinate them. ",
            "\u00a0Where do I even start? There are few to none strengths to this course  the TAs were nice and the optional sections were usually pretty helpful, but sometimes even they did not know what the professor was saying in class. In addition, the material is interesting. However, if the material isnt taught well, all this class is doing is crushing the scientific curiosity and excitement of its students. The professors, while well-meaning, do not teach the class well  the information isnt presented in an organized way, and sometimes, even inaccurately. \r\nWhile the professors advertise teaching experimental thinking and logic, the class  psets and exams  is impossible to follow without previously having encountered the concepts or having performed them in a lab. The psets were relatively impossible to do without help, and they became harder throughout the semester  you cant get through the course without working with other people, but the course is so full of premeds (these premeds are the ones who did well last semester in MB&B 300 and only want to take MB&B 301 for the prestige of the course instead of being genuinely interested in the course) who will not hesitate to be hypercompetitive; the professors even encourage this competitiveness with favoritism. The exams are graded very unfairly  people who wrote the same answers would get vastly different scores on the same question, even if it was the same TA grading the question. Also, if you didn't use the exact biological wording they wanted, you would not receive points. None of this was explained when we received our exams back, which made it hard to improve for the future.\r\nTo improve this course, I would recommend spending a lecture on lab techniques, how they're analyzed, why they're used, and possibly spending a help session going over this. Honestly, these sessions were most often spent going over what was talked about in class, and even the TAs sometimes had trouble understanding what happened in class. ",
            "\u00a0While the topics were interesting and I appreciated the attempt to teach \"scientific logic,\" I think the course was largely unsatisfying because of the organization of lectures and class logistics. Lectures were often difficult to follow because they threw out information that discussed \"what\" happens and \"what\" we \"should know\" but not really clearly how those mechanisms work or why they are important to know, and it took a while for me to figure out what was important and how it all fit together. This was especially disappointing in a biochemistry class, where I expected chemical reasoning to reveal the mechanisms that we have been learning about for years in past biology classes. In fact, I really didn't feel like chemistry was a big part of this course.\r\n\r\nAlso, often when we would walk through a historical experiment, I felt like it was explained out of order--key concepts necessary for understanding a mechanism or experiment were left out or explained too late, and then I had to go back and put the concepts in order for myself.\r\n\r\nI think the organization of this class was poor, especially compared to two similar classes. MCDB 200 (Molecular Biology) has an almost identical syllabus, almost the same content is taught, but I felt like I learned the material much better and was more engaged because the lectures were more focused. In that class, instead of trying to cram both experimentation and content into the lectures, we read and discussed primary articles in the mandatory section. This was a much better format for learning to understand molecular biology because we read the papers beforehand and then were able to discuss in a smaller group.\r\n\r\nMB&B 300 (Biochem 1) precedes this course, and it was a MUCH better experience. The professors seemed to put much more effort into the quality of the flow and clarity of their lectures and explanations, making learning expectations clear and discussing the big-picture patterns and connections as well as the small details. It was also great to have a Piazza page to ask questions throughout the course as we were working through the material on our own. Also LEHNINGER>VOIT! "

            "\u00a0You have to take this if you are an MBB major. Otherwise, don't take it. Not worth it. First semester biochemistry (MBB 300) is great, but second semester is the worst class I have taken so far at Yale. ",

For Chem major specifically, I would recommend this as an advanced elective if you are interested. It is nice to get some experience outside of the Chem department. ",

            "\u00a0you'll probably have to take it, you'll be better at science because of it, but balance things out: take a few easier classes with it to give it the time needed to do well, keep up with the material, this is NOT a class you can procrastinate for, study each lecture at a time, keep track of themes ... ",
            "\u00a0You probably are taking this course because it is required for MBB. If not an MBB major, take a long hard look at yourself and see if you are interested enough in nucleic acids to go through the rigors of this course. A lot of information was just included for the sake of inclusion. Lectures were rarely finished and you had to go learn material on your own. Quite a disappointing course overall and one that is discouraging many people who are considering MBB as a major. ",
            "\u00a0In hindsight, yes, absolutely. This course is extremely difficult and stressful, but it is equally rewarding. After taking this course, I went to my lab meeting (for the first time in a couple of months), and I found that I understood everything much better, and that primary literature was much easier to understand. I heard that some people thought the course was toxic, and Im sure its true in regard to some people - however, dont be afraid to reach out to new people for help! A lot of people in this class are extremely helpful, and I became much closer friends with them as a readily of this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to any student interested in improving their skills as a scientist or as a pre-Med. The way of thinking required to succeed in this course is cultivated very well by the professors and I dont believe there is any substitute for this course at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0As many of you reading this probably will have heard, MB&B 301 is the \"best\" class in the department, and the one that makes the MB&B \"worth it.\" After 300 and Orgo 2, I was really excited to be in a class that I had heard so many things about. I left the class so disappointed and considering dropping science as a career choice. I have never been in a classroom environment as hostile as this course. There is a large chunk of this class (no surprise really) that comes from extremely privileged high schools that know EVERYTHING coming in to the class and/or have the ability to drop classes/jobs/clubs/life responsibilities in order to devote every moment of their time to this course. Everyone is constantly bragging about their grades in the class, making comments to belittle the questions or opinions of others, and generally using other rhetorical tactics to belittle other students who they deem stupid. Most of the people are also pre-med, which is interesting to see such awful students also pretending to care about being a good human. At the review sessions and Help Sessions, students fight over getting the TA/Professors attention, interrupt each other, tell each other they are wrong/stupid, dominate the section, etc. I could go on and on, but you get the idea. By far the worst group of people in the class are the sophomore (boys) who took First-Year Orgo and think they are gods of chemistry and biochemistry (which is not true and also this class has 0 chemistry in it)\r\nThe class itself is also ridiculously hard for no reason. [Here's a fun fact no one seems to advertise: This class is LITERALLY just a  harder version of MCDB Molecular Biology - same syllabus, same topics, same test structure, same everything except for some reason this is the \"elite\" class because the professors decided it to be that way). The tests are crazy specific and no matter how much time you spend studying, there are people who know twice as much. You can try and try, but, unless you come from a privileged background, you will consistently feel defeated and like a failure in this class. I have never felt so poorly coming out of a class as I did this course, and it has made me consider dropping the MB&B major and STEM in general. The professors, although the mean well, simply don't teach the material well enough to warrant how difficult the tests and class is. The class is also graded harshly, but, when the same kids who always know everything are the only ones doing well, it feels like there's no point in you coming to class because you were never going to succeed in the first place. If you are POC, low-income, first-gen, a woman, etc., realize that you'll have to work twice as hard for likely half the success as your more privileged peers. \r\n\r\nWelcome to the best of MB&B! Do you regret the major or coming to Yale for biochem yet? ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I enjoyed this class. As an MCDB major, I took it as an elective and as a follow-up to Biochem I. As a class, it's pretty similar to Molecular Biology, so if you're an MCDB major, that might be a better choice. The class is very experiment focused, so be prepared to think like a scientist in this one. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to another student, but don't go in thinking about our GPA but about how much you are going to learn. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah, it was a pretty fascinating course and I learned a lot about genetics and various topics in biochemistry. The actual amount of \"chemistry\" you cover is quite little. I would say this is more molecular biology than biochemistry. I would love to see more actual chemistry applied in this course. ",
            "\u00a0To be honest, I was quite disappointed by MB&B 301. So many people who have taken this course before me have said that its the most difficult course they have ever taken, but also the most intellectually rewarding. I was both very nervous and excited for the course. Unfortunately, only the former proved to be true for me. I found MB&B 301 to be unnecessarily convoluted, complicated, and challenging. On p-sets and on exams, it wasnt always clear what they were expecting. I really hated it when they asked what are the data? and then proceeded to build the subsequent questions on top of that. Sure, the professors tried to engage us by asking a super difficult question every lecture. But it was always the same people answering and it really didnt feel like an atmosphere where I could answer freely. I raised my hand during lecture to answer those questions and to ask questions, but often I heard snickers or a wave of whispers right after (especially when I got the answer wrong or if the question was stupid). Not only that, but also I didnt really learn much from this class, especially when compared to MB&B 300. I learned how to memorize an encyclopedias worth of information and forget it the day after the exam. I learned nitpicky details about each biological molecule or process, but very little on the overarching themes and patterns. I truly think that this was the most disappointing STEM course Ive ever taken at Yale University. I really feel bad for saying it and I really wanted to like this course. But the truth has to come out. I really dont know why so many people have praised this course before. Please, do NOT take this course unless you are MB&B major. If you are an MB&B major, change your major now. Its not worth it. Escape to MCDB or give up STEM. I really dont understand why MB&B prides itself on great STEM education, because in reality it sucks. Especially if you are a FGLI/POC/LGBTQIA+ like me, you will have a bad time in this class and in this major. For the love of god, if you love yourself even a little bit, escape now. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to people who want to go to grad school in the biological science because it is a great foundation in not only information but in how to think about data. ",
            "\u00a0If you are a chemistry major, turn back now! It is shocking that this course counts as a chemistry elective, as it is much more of a molecular biology course. This class is so hard, badly taught, and the psets are grades in such a nit picky way. Even if you liked the first semester of biochem, I promise youll hate this one. ",
            "\u00a0Most people don't get to choose if they have to take this course, and even if you are one of the few who does, you should give it a lot of consideration. This is a difficult course, even if you excelled in 300. It goes fast, and it goes hard. The amount of content covered in every lecture is staggering, and you have to know it to a good degree of detail. Exams are not only content-focused but also conceptual, and you will spend a lot of time being tested on actual figures from published papers and trying to decipher the results yourself (for a grade). There is no way to survive in the course if you don't devote a significant amount of time each week to just review the content: one week's worth (2 lectures) would take me like 6 hours to review. Further, it's a much smaller course than 300 and you can tell that everyone is a genius. Being on a curve, this creates an environment that is a little competitive and a little stressful. That being said, this is the course that made me feel like an actual MB&B major. The content was super interesting, and I loved all of the topics that we covered. I would especially recommend it if you want to learn about RNA biology/ncRNAs. ",

            "\u00a0I think the skills you pickup in this class are very useful and many of the facts you learn are important to know. I just wish this class could be reformed to be more focused and less memorization heavy. ",
            "\u00a0Unless you are an MBB major, do not take this class! I'm not an MBB major and willingly took this class because I was interested in learning more biochemistry and I was thoroughly disappointed by the poor organization and support of this class. The lectures go into so much convoluted detail that is not necessary at all to appreciate the biological concept and mechanism. The TAs are unenthusiastic and super unhelpful. It required an insane amount of time for memorization of minute details and the problem sets take forever to do, with diminishing returns as they are worth almost nothing (grade-wise), but you'll still get points off by just not including a single word. If I could go back and not take this course, I would've except I kept convincing myself it would get better but it did not. ",
            "\u00a0No. ",
            "\u00a0If you are not an MB&B student, I would highly recommend not taking this course. It is really stressful, involves a ton of memorization, and isn't challenging in an intellectually-stimulating way but in an overwhelming workload way. ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend this course if you have to take it or if you want to credit/D the class. It's a lot of work and I was really stressed about it throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0No, do not take this course unless you are an MB&B major, in which case, reevaluate your life choices and choose MCDB or chemistry. ",
            "\u00a0I do not think this is the best course for someone interested either in Biochemistry or in Molecular Biology. If the former, MB&B 300 (Biochem 1) was a great experience in a well-organized class with engaged lecturers and clear expectations. If the latter, MCDB 200 (Molecular Biology) teaches the same content with slightly more clarity and better organization. If you are an MB&B major and have to take this course, I'd just advise you not to kill yourself over the details or the frustrations of \"gel-reading\" problems. Find the elements of the course that interest you and try to dig into understanding how and why stuff works, and don't let the frustrations of the course bring you down. "
