            "\u00a0Was not a very engaging course, and problem sets were unnecessarily hard (harder than the exams, even). ",

            "\u00a0One weakness of this course were the webassign problems. I found them very stressful due to the fact that the assignments were graded despite the fact that we were still learning the concept. Since there are already graded problem sets for the course, I think these problems would be more beneficial if they were less harshly graded so that students can focus more on learning the concepts rather than getting the correct answer to gain credit. The biggest problem with the program was that it didn't provide feedback as to how to solve the problem, so if the student is unable to solve the problem, not only will they lose credit, they won't know how to solve similar problems in the future and they will not learn anything from the problems.

            "\u00a0The Webassigns were quite difficult at times and covered material/ examples not covered in class. Perhaps students can learn more from the WebAssigns if students could access videos and other worked examples to supplement the questions. Or at least give the step by step process and answer to each question. "
