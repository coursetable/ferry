            "\u00a0Changed the way I look at built environments and, by extension, the world. ",
            "\u00a0I developed the ability to read across time and schools of thought to conceive of space in a multitude of ways. I was then able to juxtapose these different views in order to realize concepts common to space across its different modes of interpretation. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a fascinating introduction to the abstract concept of space. We learned about the history of space theory and used Yale's archival and art resources to contextualize the week's discussions and delve further into topics of our own interest. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The syllabus is extremely well crafted to show an evolution of aesthetic/architectural thought with regards to space. The readings built on each other such that when one would make reference to other thinkers, it was usually the case that we had already read them and knew exactly what the reference meant.\r\n\r\nThe last few weeks move from the purely aesthetic to topics like social space, globalization, etc. Those were less interesting to me, but I'm sure other students in the class would feel otherwise. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are Professor Buckleys expertise and the material intrinsically. Weaknesses are that theres not so much feedback interspersed throughout (but good office hours!). ",
            "\u00a0I loved the structure of the class-- everything from the readings to the reading responses to the chronology and thematic juxtapositions of every topic we discussed. I also loved the field trips to different parts of Yale to engage with the archives and buildings we have at our disposal, which added a new dimension to our discussions that we could engage with directly. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the depth and breadth of our in-class discussions, and the classes that were held at the YUAG, YCBA, and the Beinecke. The assignments and presentations were very fair, and I felt that the outside research we did for these really helped inform our discussions. I would have liked to have looked at the subject  from perspectives other than the western theories that were presented. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course are the readings and Professor Buckley's thoughtful leading of discussions. I found the material really interesting, and Professor Buckley pushed us deep into the themes and ideas in each movement of spatial theory. The only real weakness to the course was the lack of feedback for almost the entire semesteruntil I got my final paper back (the only main assignment besides presentations and weekly reading responses), I truly had no idea even what range my grade might be in. But overall, a really wonderful course, challenging and engaging and definitely worth the early wakeup. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: few students enrolled in class and that allowed for more engaging conversations, weekly readings responses allowed for reflection on readings \r\n\r\nWeakness: We may need more comments on the weekly responses "

            "\u00a0Absolutely. As I said, it informed the way I view my environment/context. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course! If you have any interest in architectural spaces or philosophical close-readings of space, this is the perfect course to take. The field trips to the Beinecke and the Yale Art Gallery were enlightening, and I learned so much throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in architecture and ideas of space. I think the course could have benefited from more voices and perspectives in the class ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Professor Buckley is so knowledgeable, passionate about the material, and an engaging leader of discussions. Even when class was quiet, he'd usually find a way to move the discussion out of uncomfortable silences with unexpected questions and interesting examples. The material is super interesting; though it occasionally got a little dry, this was the first class where I actually felt like I enjoyed most of the readings. The final paper assignment was really open ended, which was daunting, but turned out to be really rewardingProf. Buckley was supportive and really helpful in working out topics and structuring arguments. Overall, a really great course, definitely my favorite this semester! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the course provides an excellent overview on spatial concepts, which helps students to read soaces within a larger historical context "
