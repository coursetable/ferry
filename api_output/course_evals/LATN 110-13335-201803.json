            "\u00a0I learned a lot of grammar/vocab/Latin forms. I learned how to breakdown and work through a sentence in Latin. ",
            "\u00a0Taking this course, I developed my time-management skills and my language-learning skills; since the structure of this course is quite intensive, I quickly learned that I needed to prioritize certain content when studyingspecifically, translating sentences from Latin to Englishin order to perform well on the quizzes and tests. I was particularly surprised by how quickly I was able to retain the material, and part of this, I imagine, is due to the frequency with which class met, and the course's attendance policy. It was helpful entering this course having learned a few other languages in the past, as some of the grammatical terms and ideas we encountered were sometimes difficult to apply to the English language. ",
            "\u00a0A knowledge of syntax that I hadnt previously had, an understanding of the basic latin endings, tenses, vocabulary, and translating sentences. An insight into the complex language of Latin. ",
            "\u00a0Latin turned out to be a great way to exercise the brain in a different mode than reading-heavy classes. I'd say it helped me practice attention to detail, logical thinking/puzzle-solving, and helped me gain a better perspective on English (it's not as if I was ever taught English grammar, or had to really think about itI just grew up speaking it!). Oh, also the class was just fun. ",
            "\u00a0This was the most amount of work I have ever put into a class within a three month time span. However, I found all the work to be extremely rewarding! I gained an incredible amount of knowledge of not just the fundamentals of Latin, but in constructing complex subordinate sentences. This class has given me a greater perspective on the syntactic functions of cases I didn't even know existed before this class. ",
            "\u00a0This course is grammar intensive, as you spend the majority of class time learning the ins-and-outs of how to begin reading the Latin language. You also learn to begin reading \"real\" latin towards the end of the course, which is exciting after only 1 semester of study. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of vocabulary terms, as well as how to conjugate them to influence their role in the sentence. "

            "\u00a0I think Noreen was an awesome professor even though I struggled at times with the material. I think the biggest strength and weakness of this course is the amount of material we got through. It's great to have been given a foundation that covers so SO much...but I think a result of this is that because my foundation is so broad based, it lacks some depth. For example, I was reviewing declension endings for the final exam and was still not totally comfortable with those even though they're integral to everything. I found that because there was often times so much homework, I would do it with my book open just to get through it all which meant I didn't get the repetition I could have..if there had been less work I think I would've taken more time on fewer problems. ",
            "\u00a0As I alluded to previously, the time commitment required for this course, although considerable, was its greatest strength. I'm not sure I could imagine the course being taught any other way. That being said, however, the amount of content we covered in class, and how quickly it was covered, made this course sometimes unnecessarily difficult. We blew through some of the more difficult material and chapters which, because of their newness to the students, might have warranted more class time. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths is the teaching and explanation of the language, and the projects/presentations. A weakness/difficulty is the initial lack of translating sentences (this improved later in the semester), and the amount of work required for the course ",
            "\u00a0I was not a huge fan of the textbook, which seemed overloaded with so much detail it was difficult to pick out what was important. This was slightly exacerbated by the fact that the graduate student instructor had not taught the first-semester material previously, which did show at times. She made a good effort and I certainly appreciated her workbut in language teaching I don't think there's any real substitute for practice. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of this class was the small number of students in the class. There really was nowhere to hide in this class, so if you hadn't done the work the night before, it was pretty obvious. This pushed me and many other kids in the class to make certain that all work was done for class. Moreover, because of the small class size, it gave everyone numerous opportunities to participate in each and every class, which was one of the biggest factors that helped me pick up the rules of Latin. One thing I would have liked in this class would be review sheets for quizzes. We got them for tests, and while we had many sentences that we could do to study for each quiz, I personally would have been not as stress for each quiz if I had something to look at that gave me a structured format of what we learned during the week. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course is that it meets every day, and forces you to keep up with the material in order to not fall behind. The weekly Monday quizzes are helpful for ensuring that you learn the vocab and grammar by the end of the week. A weakness is that at times the workload can seem extra than needed, as there is A LOT of repetition of sometimes simple grammar rules. ",
            "\u00a0It is very high paced, we learned a lot quickly, just difficult to keep up in conjunction with other courses. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student who wanted a crash course in latin and was willing to work for it. At a certain point, I wasn't sure for what purpose I was taking the course (unrelated to the course itself but because of my own professional/academic goals shifting) and that made it more challenging to motivate to do the work. ",
            "\u00a0If I were to recommend this course to another student, I would add a caveat: this class requires an incredible amount of energy and time commitment. To be honest, I am not certain I would have taken this course if I had not needed the language for my scholarship. However, this is not necessarily a fault of the instructors or the layout of the course: as I said before, I can't imagine this course being taught any other way. ",
            "\u00a0For someone who is a keen linguist or enjoys a challenge, yes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I got a lot out of the course and really appreciated that it was (1) not a spoken language (which I'm personally terrible at) and (2) work in a different mode than a lot of my other coursework, so I would look forward to Latin as a \"break\" (still a productive and challenging one) from everything else and an opportunity to change the pace from just mountains of reading. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. The work, while a lot at first, becomes extremely rewarding as you begin to pick up the language. And your intense work ethic in this class carries over to other classes, making you a more diligent student overall. And midterms/finals don't constitute half your grade, so you have many opportunities to improve your grade if you don't like how you did on a particular test. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I would strongly recommend this course if you have a strong interest in learning the Latin language. I had no prior latin experience before starting, and I never felt behind as you start from the very basics. However, if you do choose to enroll be prepared to spend 2-3 hours a night with the material! ",
            "\u00a0Its a great place to start a new language for the requirement. "
