            "\u00a0I learned a lot about photography; different methods of photography, composition, how to use a film camera, how to develop film and make prints. I learned about the intentions and thoughts behind photographs and how to view art as a methods to convey a certain message and then how to effectively convey your message. ",
            "\u00a0I was able to get a formal education in working in the Darkroom - from shooting film to developing, printing, and enlarging. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal. The tangible skills: how to develop film, create prints, take photos regularly. I felt as if I developed an eye for what is \"photographable,\" and that I began to see the world differently after focusing on the art of black and white photography. I gained a familiarity with some of the major film B&W (and some color) film photography influences, and began developing the language to communicate more clearly my reactions to photos (not to mention, a greater sensitivity to photos themselves.) As a non-art major, though, the course also provided a new space to consider my own artistic taste, creative ability, and relationship to art and influences around me (though at times the difficulty of learning photography basics impaired my full ability to explore.) And the class--the time spent with classmates, and classmates themselves --unfolded into a remarkably collaborative and constructive learning experience, one that I'm hard pressed to compare to any other I've encountered at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Such a good class, there is some work obviously but perfect for a second semester senior. Ted is funny ",
            "\u00a0Advanced darkroom printing techniques,  the ability to more productively discuss and analyze both my own and other's photography. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about photography and the darkroom process! ",
            "\u00a0I learned the basics of film photography: shooting, developing and printing. I also learned more advanced and nuanced aspects of photography through Teds feedback and crits. ",
            "\u00a0After taking this course, I learned to use a film camera, develop and print from black and white film. ",
            "\u00a0I went into this class with some experience with portraits, and used photography as a tool to capture moments and make people look good. This class showed me that photography can be used as a medium for artistic expression, and while my final critique consisted of mainly portraits, I approached them in a different way than before. ",
            "\u00a0You learn the fundamentals of B&W photography and printing, namely how to develop film, printing, and operating an analog camera. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The financial factor was a bit of a burden; it was really helpful to have a class box of paper (until it got ruined and that was on us). It was expensive to buy so much film and paper on top of the price of the camera. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are the instructors, the class environment, and the flexibility of what you can pursue with your photography. My one qualm with the course was how long it took at the beginning of the semester to get everyone to the point where they could photograph. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this course. ",
            "\u00a0My only critique is that I wish the darkroom had more hours- open earlier and on Saturdays. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: printing in black and white from film and negatives is a very interactive process, but also very therapeutic and relaxing, and it's really interesting to see your photos magically appear on the paper!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: too little time in the semester to make all the prints you want before you lose access to the darkroom forever ",
            "\u00a0This course has a lot of strengths -- Ted is great and provided us with tons of freedom to photograph whatever we wanted. We had access to a nice dark room and there were plenty of resources for learning how to use it. Though sometimes I wished this class had more structure. I really enjoyed the classes we spent studying the history of photography, but they were few and far between, and we spent most of our time together in the dark room. I really enjoyed the development and printing process, but I think these skills will be difficult to utilize in the real work. "

            "\u00a0YES take this course if you have any interest in photography. You'll learn a lot about taking photographs and famous photographers, plus it's incredibly satisfying to be in the dark room and make prints. That being said, take this class when you have an easy workload. It's really only worth it if you can fully engage in the class. You should anticipate like 5 hours outside of class a week to be spent in the darkroom. It's amazing, but only take it if you have the time; recognize that this class is very time intensive. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely. Go for it! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. The course is interesting, provides new perspectives on photography and its place in the world, and the process of developing and printing one's own work is incredibly satisfying. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this class. Ted is great. I really really like the process of making prints in the darkroom and in general learning about and practicing the art of analogue film photography. A good mix of looking at photographers' work and actually doing work in the darkroom. The crit process was really useful and interesting. Overall, would highly recommend. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Ted is an amazing professor! He's really chill and easy to talk to if you have any questions or concerns about photography. This class is a wonderful opportunity to see the hands on part of photography, and though it is more time consuming than digital photography, seeing your prints come out nicely is really satisfying. Would recommend to anyone interested in photography! ",
            "\u00a0I would totally recommend this class. I had been photographing for a long time, and this class definitely changed my relationship with photography. I haven't taken the other intro digital photography class at Yale, but I assume I would have learned similar things there as well. The film development process was interesting and challenging, but could often be frustrating and is extremely expensive. I think a benefit of the intro digital class over this film class is that the skills of editing in Photoshop and using inkjet printing are much more extendable outside of Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Hell yeah. Take this class if you get in. Ted is the man, and this class IS the class to get you into photography. It'll be a lot of work in the beginning, but once you get used to printing and developing, it's not so bad. "
