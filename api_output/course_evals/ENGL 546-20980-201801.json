            "\u00a0This course was a nice exploration of Chaucer's early poetry and of selected portions of the Canterbury Tales. I learned a lot about the period, from relevant social history to important aspects of the intellectual atmosphere, and about Chaucer's developing sense of authorship. One insight I think Professor Minnis drove home was simply how inexhaustible many of Chaucer's poems truly are, even those that are quite brief, those that are quite odd, and those that, at first blush, seem relatively straightforward. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely was re-familiarized with a lot of core Middle English texts through this course. I also learned about avoiding particular traps in the field that lie in wait, especially in Chaucer studies. It really a very valuable experience. ",
            "\u00a0I learned quite a bit about the early works of Chaucer, which I had never read before, namely \"The Book of the Duchess,\" \"The House of Fame\" and \"The Legend of Good Women.\" I also learned about sources for Chaucer's tales and his inspirations, especially Machaut and Boccaccio. I feel that I benefited intellectually from all of the class discussions about the various works of Chaucer. Furthermore, my comprehension of Middle English improved thanks to the regular, lengthy readings. ",
            "\u00a0This was a great introductory course for Chaucer, and it was a productive course for thinking about some of the major themes, questions, and issues that are at play in Chaucer's works and time period. ",
            "\u00a0I hadn't had much of an opportunity before this to study Chaucer, so this class was very helpful to me as an introduction to Chaucer's work and to his literary and cultural contexts. I'm not a medievalist, but I genuinely feel this knowledge will still be of great use to me moving forward, and will help broaden the historical/literary frame through which I read works written in my period of specialization. "

        [
            "\u00a0The course offered a comprehensive survey of many core works of Chaucer, including the Canterbury Tales, The House of Fame, the Book of the Duchess, and the Legend of Good Women. It was thus very informative and offered a good level of core understanding to these important works. My only complaint is that we didn't have time for more texts! ",
            "\u00a0The main strength of this course lay in its broad survey of the Chaucerian canon. While certain texts were omitted, such as \"Troilus and Criseyde,\" the course engaged with most of Chaucer's major poetic works and did so in depth, spending significant amounts of class time in discussion of each text. I think that the course progressed at a reasonable pace with an attainable workload. The presentations given at the beginning of each class were both a good exercise for the students presenting and a valuable introduction to the texts for the rest of the class, particularly for those unfamiliar with the works in question. Overall, the course seemed to be well designed while also remaining flexible. The class could possibly be improved by including small group discussions or perhaps group presentations, if only to mix up the standard format of the large group discussion. Greater discussion of the historical context of Chaucer's writings may also be beneficial. ",
            "\u00a0One of the strengths of the course was having student presentations each week -- it was great to hear in an in-depth way some of the ideas and questions that other students were bringing to the table for each work, and it added a lot of diversity and richness. ",
            "\u00a0In general, I enjoyed this class a lot: it was both a wide-ranging introduction to some of the chief concerns of medieval English literature and a focused study of Chaucer's political and literary philosophies. I also appreciated Professor Minnis's efforts to keep the reading load reasonable, though I think it would be completely fine if he decided to make the reading load heavier the next time he teaches the course. I would have been open to reading more of the Canterbury Tales or perhaps some more secondary sources. My only real suggestion for improvement would be to have a fixed syllabus for the class, where each week's assignments would be set forth from the start. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I certainly would, if the student were interested in Chaucer.  My only caveat would be that Professor Minnis does not assign very much secondary material, for better or worse. This can be quite freeing, since it allows students to pick and choose what's useful and bring in their own discoveries when pertinent. It also means, however, that students do not always get a sense of the arc of Chaucer studies, nor do they necessarily get an immediately palpable sense of how conversations going on in the broader field might bear on the weekly readings. ",
            "\u00a0This course is an excellent introduction to Middle English literature and to Chaucer studies in particular. Its environment is inclusive and laid back, and its syllabus is reasonable and easy to work with. I absolutely recommend. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student, particularly one interested in Middle English literature or the history of English literature in general. Anyone specializing in English literature or medieval poetry in general must have at least some familiarity with Chaucer's oeuvre, for which this course provides a thorough introduction. It would also be useful to anyone studying the history of the English language. ",
            "\u00a0This is definitely a solid class to take if you're interested in Chaucer -- Professor Minnis is extremely knowledgeable, and the readings are lively. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I'd definitely recommend this course to another student. It seemed like the course was able to challenge and engage both the medievalists in the class and those who weren't as familiar with the material. "
