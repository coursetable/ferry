            "\u00a0A really great walkthrough of a PR campaign. Step by step it's difficult but at the end you have a very useful demonstration of a comms campaign. Tony's career and insights are invaluable. ",
            "\u00a0I took this class at the same time that I was taking Behavioral Economics at SOM -- and I think that was a great pairing, since it helped me put into practice the concepts and ideas I was learning there in a communications context. I liked learning how to write in a way that is going to be very useful in the real-world -- and how to arrange it to make the case internally for particular strategies. ",
            "\u00a0Very helpful overview of strategic communication for environmental issues! ",

            "\u00a0Any 3 hour class is going to feel repetitive, but I felt that the structure (lecture, workshopping, feedback) could have had greater variety, with perhaps a real time editing exercise or reaction to a piece or writing or video. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Even though it felt like a lot at the time to have a brief due every week, it really helped to build the campaign book throughout the course and allowed the book to come together easily at the end. \r\nHow to improve: I think it would have been useful to require 1-on-1s with either Tony or Franz to ensure that we were getting individualized feedback -- even though we discussed it during class, it sometimes felt like certain projects got more attention than others. ",
            "\u00a0Did not enjoy the readings, and think it might be interesting to explore the concepts through more in-depth case studies. ",

            "\u00a0This is a class on Tony's work, and Tony is very interesting and engaging and I learned a lot from his stories.  The applied campaign book was more just for completion, then actually worthwhile in my opinion. The campaign book was disappointing because I wanted to give a good product to the organization I was working for. ",
