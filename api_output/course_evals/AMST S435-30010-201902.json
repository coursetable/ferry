            "\u00a0In taking this class, I gained the ability to analyze institutions through the lens of an anthropologist. I am now able to discern fact from fiction and understand just how America's institutions operate and work in a way to create and maintain inequality within the country. It was a transformative class, one that lays the foundations for thinking critically and then allows you to use your newly acquired skills to research and discuss the issues that are most important to you. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about ethnographic research and op-ed writing. "

            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are definitely the discussions that we were able to have over the session. The ability to hear differing perspectives and different insights into some of the most pressing issues concerning marginalized groups of people, really allows you to think more ritically and further your understanding of the world around you. ",
            "\u00a0There was a lot of reading, all of which was very informative. I do think the class could have had more structure and less free discussion timeperhaps more activities in class. "

            "\u00a0This is definitely a course I would recommend. In my time at Yale, this has been the best course I have taken. I thoroughly enjoyed each and every one of the readings, the class discussions, everything. Professor Dudley is incredible in her depth of knowledge on issues concerning and relating to inequality. Not only does this class challenge you to use institutional analysis to get to the crux of what causes inequality, it allows you to do so while exploring topics of interest that you care about, that you're passionate about. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I'd recommend this course to another student who is interested in a very comprehensive and detailed understanding of American inequality. "
