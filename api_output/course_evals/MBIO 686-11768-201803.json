            "\u00a0None. This class was not helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Great knowledge gained, great course ",
            "\u00a0I developed a broad understanding of bacterial biology, including secretion systems, structure, metabolism, competition, and pathogenesis. Given my background is largely in viruses, this class acted as a great baseline as I move forward in the micro department. "

            "\u00a0We were initially told this class was to be helpful to all microbiology students, no matter what our focus is (bacteria, virus, parasite, etc), and would help us develop  a solid background. The majority of the lectures/journal clubs were spent on very specific bacterial topics that are only useful if you are actually studying that organism or system. Very few lectures gave background information or focused on the big picture. We received feedback on our journal club summaries a total of ONE time, so I cannot say this class was helpful in improving my efficiency in reading or evaluating papers. I feel like I was tricked into taking this class. I wish I had never taken it. \r\n\r\nCommunication with students needs to be improved. We rarely had papers before Tuesday, and often had to reach out to instructors to get them early. Additionally, we got the midterm late. We were also told we would get two weeks for the final, but didn't get the final until 5 days before the end of the semester. It often felt like our time was not respected. ",
            "\u00a0Would have been good to have a centralized method to get papers on a specific day/ time, but overall great material, great lectures, really appreciate the effort put in by all instructors ",
            "\u00a0The timing of assignments and reading was awful. The papers were handed out on Tuesday, the summary was due on Wednesday, then we had to discuss the paper on Thursday. Forty eight hours is not enough time for this process. Having the papers a week in advance would be much more reasonable for the students, and it would also allow the students to be more engaged in the papers. There is only so much a student can do in 48 hours to get a full understanding of the paper. Because of the severe lack of time, I was not able to dive into the papers fully, and that lowered my engagement with the paper and the course. The timing was by far the most frustrating thing about this course. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the timing, there was also a severe lack of feedback on assignments. There were only one or two times that we received feedback on our summaries, and only twice that we even received a response to the email that contained our summaries. Additionally, the feedback on the midterm was minimal. Some professors did not even provide an answer sheet for the midterm, let alone individual feedback. There were only eight students in the class, so it seems reasonable for a professor to give brief feedback every week and on the exams. Feedback would help the students improve their paper-reading and writing skills, as well as orienting the students to what was expected of them in the course. The lack of feedback left me feeling like I was guessing for a whole semester. \r\n\r\nThe timing and feedback issues could be solved by having more organization and communication by and between the instructors. A meeting at the beginning of the semester to discuss expectations on feedback and to collect papers before the semester starts may solve both issues. If getting everyone together is difficult, then having two meetings, one in August and one in November near the midterm, would serve the same purpose. "

            "\u00a0No. As I mentioned above, the class was not helpful and we did not receive feedback. Additionally, although we were told we would have the papers early, we were often scrambling to contact lecturers to have the papers on Tuesday, making Tuesday and Wednesday rushed in trying to get the papers read, summaries written, and prepare for journal club.  For any student that is interested in viruses or parasites, this class is a waste of time. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, learned many things about bacterial pathogenesis! ",
            "\u00a0I would provide a strong warning to another student interested in the course. While the material is very interesting and I did learn a lot, the lack of organization and feedback on the part of the instructors was extremely frustrating. I would recommend the course based on material, but I would not recommend it as a class. "
