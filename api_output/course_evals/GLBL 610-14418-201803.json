            "\u00a0This course gave me so much knowledge about the US military and intelligence community that I did not have before.  Additionally, I think the opportunity for Law and Jackson students to interact was an enriching learning experience for all of us. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about Iranian history and Iranian-U.S. relations, worked with a team to develop a report and had the opportunity to brief the client's leadership. "

            "\u00a0Kevin as an instructor - and the wide array of guest speakers and engagement with the client - was the strength of this course. ",
            "\u00a0The class was a lot of work (time consuming, rather) but it was fascinating. Improvement: I'd like to have gotten feedback on our midterm. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - great group of students, great instructor, great speaker\r\nWeaknesses - recommend building mid-term project into a requirement of the final project, recommend setting up a timeline for draft deliverable to be due as part of the syllabus, recommend writing into the syllabus the amount of work the project would take toward the end of the semester and individual research outside of class that would be required.  \r\nI highly recommend more information is given on the speakers each weak before they come so we can best prepared questions that are catered toward that individual's specialty. ",
            "\u00a0The format of the class was great; I feel like we really got to know the speakers and had the opportunity to ask them whatever I wanted.  The dinners were key.  Had the course not included the dinners, I would not have gotten to know the speakers at anywhere near the same depth.  This was extremely useful both academically and professionally.  Two main improvements come to mind: first, the course readings didn't feel like they directly related to the weekly lectures, and we would have benefitted more had the speakers submitted a list of readings for us for each week.  The big-picture foundational books could have been read over the summer.  Second, the time spent on the final deliverable felt crunched.  Stopping the speakers a week or two earlier would have helped us spend more time on the deliverable. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing class with incredible students and instructor. Perhaps more focus on the deliverable about a month before we actually switched gears from speaker focus to deliverable focus. "
