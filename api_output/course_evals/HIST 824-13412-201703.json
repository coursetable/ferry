            "\u00a0HIST 824 provided an excellent history of the linking of global markets between the 15th and 19th centuries, with an explicit turn toward Latin America's role in the rise of early capitalism worldwide. The level of thought and engagement with these themes was extremely high throughout. It was an absolute pleasure to take Professor Echeverri's course, as it was by far my favorite class of the semester and influenced my thought more deeply and radically than any other course this term.\r\n\r\nThe class struck a very instructive balance for global historians and Latin Americanists alike, as it toggled between structural processes in political economy and the ways local actors (slaves, creole elites, planters, European merchants, etc.) abetted or contested the forms of exploitation so integral to capitalism's formation. The class also offered a very deep treatment of capitalist and dependency theory (Marx, Wallerstein, Gunder-Frank) and advanced critical engagement with ways of writing economic history. \r\n\r\nMarcela's fantastic reading list and challenging discussion were highlights of the course  each week, the assigned texts (paired in the way that they were) elicited generative historiographical comparisons that Proessor Echeverri seamlessly wove within the context of the course themes and movement of the class towards an increasingly complex and comprehensive study of global capitalism from Spanish and Latin American vantage points. She is one of the most incisive professors I've been lucky enough to be taught by at Yale, and her ability to structure the course syllabus to bring out these points of generative comparison between texts  written about different countries or about similar processes in different time periods (such as the abolition of slavery in the British Caribbean and the abolition of mita labor in Peru and Bolivia)  makes her a truly gifted professor. Her class is one of those that I wish I could take a second time to be able to re-capture the thought-provoking questions and analyses Professor Echeverri raised and elicited from the class as a whole. ",
            "\u00a0This was course with a very wide scope. It gave me a very thorough understanding of the historiographical debates and developments of the early modern world economy. ",
            "\u00a0I hadn't heard Latin America mentioned as a signficant figure in the global economy, or in the development of capitalism, before this class. The only context in which I learned about Latin America's place in the economy was in conversations about poverty or underdevelopment. This class changed that for me as we read texts that go against that narrative, highlighting the instrumental role that Latin America played since the 1500's in making today's globalized economy what it is. Basically I have a whole new understanding of Latin America's place in the world. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: excellent, carefully-selected, and well-structured reading list; extremely perceptive questions from Professor Echeverri that shaped an exciting, comprehensive, and challenging class discussion. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: We could have discussed insights from the book review of Emma Rothschild's \"Economic Sentiments\" more extensively, as it was not totally clear to me how that assignment fit within the broader narrative of the course. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is its breadth and material covered. Marcela is an excellent seminar leader and I found the weekly exercise of writing responses very useful. \r\n\r\nMy concerns would be regarding the paper. While I found the exercise to be very useful, it was difficult to do it justice while also prepping and writing for class. Perhaps, the responses and readings for the final sessions could be kept lighter. ",
            "\u00a0The instructor is extremely knowledgeable and poses interesting and challenging questions to students during seminars that help us engage with the material in novel ways. However the structure of the course, with heavy reading until the very end but an expectation of a lengthy final paper due shortly after classes end, does not allow for much time to complete the major assignment.

            "\u00a0I would most definitely recommend this course to another student, especially for students of economic history, Latin America, and History majors on the whole. Professor Echeverri is a tremendously gifted professor and thinker, and anyone at Yale would be lucky to study with her. I came away from every class feeling challenged and inspired; her course on Latin American histories of global capitalism consumed more of my thought than any other class this term. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This is a very useful course for students interested in Latin America but perhaps even more for those interested in global history, history of dependency, slavery and capitalism. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course, but I would highly recommend taking it alongside less demanding courses because there is a HEAVY reading load, and since the seminar is so small and the conversation so drawn out, it really pays off to do as much reading as you can. Also the writing assignments (just reflections on the reading) really helped me stay on top of things but I wish I had had more time to work on them. "
