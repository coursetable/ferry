            "\u00a0I learned about various aspects and types of cancer, especially the mechanisms of how some cancers work and how the treatment works. For example, we talked about retinoblastomas, oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, immunotherapy, metastases, and more. I developed problem solving skills and how to think critically about science. Between this class and reading the Emperor of All Maladies, I think my insight into cancer in general has changed to be more open-minded. I now know more about science and cancer, and I think the class has developed me as a person. We also learned about how to write a grant proposal and how to read science papers. The exposure I got from this class to biology and thinking about cancer was so in depth and amazing. ",

            "\u00a0Amazing class, I wish the midterms were shorter. ",
            "\u00a0great course ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is Dean Chang and his passion not just for the subject, but for his students. He gives great lectures on super interesting topics, encourages us to ask questions, and makes every effort to get to know us outside of class. He is a truly amazing professor and person, and this class is not only really, really cool for its subject matter, but overall a wonderful experience. ",
            "\u00a0PSETS were a bit long, overall loved the course ",
            "\u00a0There are multiple strengths to this course. I think the greatest strength is the professor, Dean Chang, who is so engaging. He makes the lectures so interesting and fascinating to learn about the concepts. He makes the class interactive, and my classmates have bonded so much over the class. He is really patient and encouraging when you ask questions, and he is generous in providing you help and advice. Another strength was the rigor of the course and how it was set up so you would learn various skills. Each week, we had to read a landmark paper and complete a challenging pset. I think reading the papers and doing the pset really pushed me to think more about science, biology, and cancer and to problem solve. It allowed me to apply information and discuss with classmates how to solve certain problems. The papers are all extremely interesting. Furthermore, you learn to be more active and think more critically whether it is by asking more questions or going on the trip to NYC with the class. You learn so much about cancer, and you gain an increased appreciation for science. The only weakness is sometimes we asked so many questions that the end of the lecture was kind of rushed, and some of the pset questions can be a bit more clear. ",
            "\u00a0The teacher is very invested in his students, and constantly asked for feedback to improve his course. He was also very effective at answering questions and fostering a positive seminar environment. ",
            "\u00a0This will be one of the best classes you take at Yale. Small class size and the most engaging professor - what more could you want? ",
            "\u00a0Long psets that arent the clearest ",
            "\u00a0Incredibly detailed and engaging lectures. Dean Chang is an inspiring professor. Definitely take this class if you are at all interested in Biology. The only weakness I could think of is that in a couple lectures, he allowed students to ask so many questions in class that we were not able to get through all the material that day. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes the class went very fast but I think I was underprepared in my biology background so it might have just been me. ",
            "\u00a0I think the strength of this course lay in that it was a graduate school like paper discussion seminar, making it very engaging for someone interested in biology. Additionally, the emphasis placed on scientific research skills, culminating in a research proposal, prepared us very well for the future research. ",
            "\u00a0There were many strengths of this course. Covering a wide variety of topics meant a broad understanding of various aspects of cancer, ranging from the hallmarks of cancer to methods we have for fighting cancer. The course was also structured such that we read a lot of scientific papers, which helped increase both my skills in reading these papers and my knowledge of the current topics in cancer research. The grant proposal as an assignment helped me learn how to write a grant proposal, using concepts that were learned in class. \r\n\r\nThere weren't any weaknesses to this course, other than possibly that we didn't have the time to go more in-depth in the cancer topics, and it may have been difficult for students who didn't have experience reading scientific papers to get through the papers Dr. Chang assigned. ",
            "\u00a0Topics in Cancer Biology was a great course. It was well organized for learning and Professor Chang made sure to incorporate the classes' feedback into developing his curriculum throughout the semester. Cancer is a huge topic that could not be possibly covered in a semester but this course gave us a very good tidbit of each topic introduced. For example, we could be studying telomeres and their relation to cancer one week and then be studying metastasis (how cancer spreads) the next. Each topic was introduced clearly and we spent just the right amount of time on each one. Overall, this course was superb and the only suggestion would be to add an overview session of all the topics we have done at the end of the semester because everything can get messy with the amount of material we cover.

            "\u00a0Absolutely! This course has been the most amazing class I have taken here at Yale. And the professor is incredible! Just be prepared to work hard, and you will be immersed in an incredible environment! ",
            "\u00a0100% recommend if you are a STEM student interested in learning biology, and you need a writing credit. This is not an easy class at all, and definitely feels like a difficult science class rather than a writing class. Do NOT take this class if you do not have a good background in biology, you will be very confused. Also the field trip to NYC was very fun. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the lectures are very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0This class literally changed my life. It convinced me that cancer research was what I wanted to do for my career; it was an incredibly fascinating and fulfilling class from start to finish, and Dean Chang is a great professor and mentor to have. Absolutely, 100% take this class! It's unlike any other first-year seminar at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0100% ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely yes!!!!! This was the best course I have taken so far at Yale. If you are on the waitlist, just email Dean Chang immediately. I learned so much about cancer, and this course really helped stimulate excitement for science and biology. I loved learning about all the mechanisms and structural biology behind cancer and learning about the complexity of cancer. Also, some of the material learned, such as immunotherapy, is very current and relevant. Sometimes after lectures, I would get chills and cannot stop thinking about a certain treatment we discussed or the way cancer behaves. I was so challenged, and I was able to grow so much. Even the way he structures his class to make it interactive, such as with the Game of Thrones groups, made our class so close, and I was able to make so many friends. Dean Chang is also accessible and takes us out to food all the time, and he also took us on a tour of the Cushing Center. I cannot emphasize how great this class was in general, and this course will continue to influence my future. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course because I developed skills that have been positive in other aspects of my academic career, especially for premed students. ",
            "\u00a0I would! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely!! Truly a lovely, intellectually challenging class. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely incredible course. The best decision I made Freshman year was to take this. If you are at all even a little interested in Biology you should strongly consider taking this course. Before this course I wasn't sure if I was interested in pursuing one of the biology majors. Taking this course inspired me to pursue one of the biology majors. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially if they are considering a degree in science because it helps envision what exactly that would look like. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely would, as long as the student is interested in science/medicine. I learned a lot and found every class to be interesting and engaging. I also appreciated that a lot of what we learned in class was directly applicable to things I hope to do in the future (such as writing a research proposal). ",
            "\u00a0I would 100% recommend this course. Not only is the material fascinating, but Dean Chang is an amazing teacher in both presenting and forming relationships with his students. ",
            "\u00a0I was a student who came into this class with an interest in biology and wanted to explore the world of cancer more. However, I knew that I wasn't going to be going to med school or majoring in MCDB. Even though I knew less about the research methods in biology and all the assays, I can confidently say that I got just as much out of this class.\r\n\r\nIf you have a genuine interest in biology and don't want to sit through the biology sequence, this is a perfect class for you. Cancer is a niche field, however, the topics and research methods discussed in the class apply outside of cancer. ",
            "\u00a0If you want a very rewarding but challenging course, this is the one for you. Even those with little bio knowledge were able to keep up as long as they put in the work. "
