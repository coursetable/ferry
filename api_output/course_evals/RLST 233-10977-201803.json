            "\u00a0This class provided a great overview of the intersection between poetry and faith, engaging written literary work with spirituality and religion in a way I hadn't thought about before. I learned about the various approaches to religious poetry, the ways in which faith and religion are different but also interact, and read some fine poetry and essays by seminal thinkers in the field. ",
            "\u00a0I read so many beautiful, moving poems; learned a lot about my relationship to God and faith and felt like I developed a new framework for analysing poems, which was as much about the poem/ form/ language as it was about my emotional and spiritual reactions to the words/ poems themselves. ",
            "\u00a0This class helped get me more accustomed to reading, memorizing, and thinking about poetry critically and appreciatively. It gave me an introduction to some phenomenal poets (Joy Harjo, W.S. Merwin, Emily Dickinson, Osip Mandelstam, etc. etc.) that I had not known before. I enjoyed discussing different students' views of faith and spirituality and how that was expressed or inspired by art-making and language. I feel more equipped to discuss with an expanded vocabulary my own concepts of of profound experiences and art itself, with a wider range of ideas about how art is made, divinity is felt or illuminated, and how language works to generate powerful yet transmutable feelings and impressions. ",
            "\u00a0The experience of reading poetry was reframed for me as something auditory, and as an experience primarily rather than a process of understanding. This class was quite significant for me in doing this, as well as connecting poetry to big ideas in faith. ",
            "\u00a0For the first time I learned how to read poetry and evaluate it based on it's aesthetic qualities (the images it uses and the way it sounds). I'm used to taking a poem apart and analyzing bit by bit, but this class was different in that everything was linked to a larger discussion of spirituality or faith. We looked at poems through a number of lenses (poetry and the world, alternative forms of faith, poetry and pain) in order to paint a more wholistic picture of faith. In doing so, I developed a vocabulary to talk about my personal relationship to spirituality and faith. \r\n\r\nI also learned about the importance of recitation and oftentimes the comfort that comes along with having something memorized and constant in your brain. ",
            "\u00a0This course was enormously helpful in clarifying my views (or rather, the nature of my own uncertainty) about faith; Prof. Wiman was patient, insightful, and so generous with his time that the work felt more like careful self-discovery than anything else. I also gained a knowledge of 20th-Century poetry that I hadn't been able to in any of my other classes. The simultaneous breadth and depth of this class was a breath of fresh air. ",
            "\u00a0Practice at reading poetry deliberately; exposure to some well chosen, truly brilliant poetry; broadened language for speaking about faith. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The course was challenging but was filled with excellent discussions, opportunities for reflection through weekly journals, enjoyable reading and an approach that fused personal and academic approaches to poetry in the context of faith. We didn't receive a ton of guidance on the final paper which would have been helpful, but overall it was a wonderful seminar and a privilege to be taught by Professor Wiman. ",
            "\u00a0Very good poetry selection, engaging classroom discussion that was led well by the professor. I thought the weekly journal was effective at focusing one's attention before class. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this class. The course packet includes such an amazing collection of poems from so many different poets (it crosses eras/ religions/ etc.) and I never felt so moved/ connected to any reading list before. Professor Wiman selects them every year and really knows the poets and poetry so well. I don't know a way in which the class could be improved. I loved the emphasis on class discussion and unpacking poetry together -- it made the class great. ",
            "\u00a0An interesting approach to thinking about the relationship between poetry and faith -- sometimes I wished discussions had more structure, but enjoyed the course nonetheless! ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strength of this course is the course packet - a collection of poems that we pore through and use to guide our class discussions, and which I think all of my class-mates with keep for further use. Prof. Wiman is also fantastic, in his illuminating comments and many tales about the poets and their lives, careers, and stories. The only possible weakness of this course is that the class as a whole becomes less engaged towards the end of the semester, leading to occasionally repetitive discussions and ideas, and less close reading of the poems (at least in my case! guilty.) ",
            "\u00a0This course is totally fantastic. Engaging, gripping, and thoughtful. You will read and discuss incredible poetry with an incredible poet, thinking deeply about faith. I had spent a very large amount of time thinking about faith before this class and yet I found my understanding of my own faith and the ideas of faith challenged and expanded every week in this class. The visit from Tracy K. Smith was a real highlight as well.\r\nMy only suggestion for this course would be the inclusion of a bit more justice-focused discussion as it relates to poetry and faith, since I felt that was occasionally lacking. We read a remarkably diverse range of poets and poetry, but I felt that sometimes we could engage with their diversity in a more substantial way. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Wiman was excellent at easing us into discussions but letting us take the wheel when it came to charting the course of the discussion. I also really enjoyed the carefully curated readings and the overall structure of the class. ",
            "\u00a0The only thing that *might* improve the course would be to add in some more prose with the poetry readings, but honestly I am not sure that would really add to it. ",
            "\u00a0If I had to name one weakness, I wish we could have received a little more feedback on our journal entries than we did; I was glad that we discussed them in class, but sometimes I felt that that was the only space in which we could really give our ideas a proper hearing and open them to discussion. The strengths of this course so far outweigh that weakness, however, that it feels almost silly to mention it; a wonderful professor, the journal itself (which was a great opportunity to put my thoughts on paper every week), and a weekly discussion that went more to the heart of my experiences as a human being than most of the classes I've taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Perhaps more regular feedback on the reading responses would be good? Also, Prof Wiman is awesome so it'd be great to have more opportunities to meet with him in person. "

            "\u00a0This class is not specifically for English majors, but with the level of poetic analysis and volume of writing required, applicants to the seminar should be confident engaging with poetry and writing extensively for journal entries and essays. There is also a bit of poetry memorization and recitation required! If you are looking for a rigorous and rewarding seminar, this is your bet. This is a difficult class to merely get by in, because everyone is incredibly participatory and engaged with the poetry and discussions surrounding it, so only take it if you're willing to commit to an immersive classroom experience! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. A wonderful experience. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to a student with any interest in poetry / religion and faith. Excellent reading and a professor who is knowledgable and good at creating interesting discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The class was amazing -- you get to read incredible poems you may never come across otherwise (so many translated poems and poets I had never heard of). The class is chosen really specifically so there are so many students with so many different interests/ angles/ attachments to the material. And you get to enter this space where people talk about faith in this special kind of earnest way, which I had never encountered before. It was a really special experience. The class was really about reading great poems and having great discussions about them. ",
            "\u00a0YES! Absolutely take this course. If you are at all interested in poetry, big ideas, explaining powerful personal experiences, or ideas about faith and religion in general, you will take away great meaning from these poems and discussions. It is great fun to read the poems as homework, share them with other people, and let them marinate before class. I loved the variety of the art we encountered, and the differences in how some did or did not affect me, and the prose that Prof. Wiman introduced to accompany the poems. It was a great experience, and a wonderful time spent every Thursday afternoon. YES TAKE IT. ",
            "\u00a0If you are curious about faith at all, and care about poetry, there literally could not be a better class. You will leave the class having read, discussed, and recited life-changing poems. The reviews for this class every year are raving, and they are spot on. The weekly journal entries are thought provoking, the final paper was a very meaningful writing experience, the recitations were honestly pretty fun (even though I hadn't recited poetry before), and the reading and discussion never failed to deliver beauty and profundity. Also, my fellow classmates were some of the most thoughtful people I have ever taken a class with, and I learned so much from them. ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely take this course. You'll improve your writing ability and analytical skills, but there's also something to be said about the very nature of the reading and writing you do in this class. The weekly journals and final paper are, in part criticism, but they are also deeply personal. In a way, it's hard to separate who you are from discussions about faith that so deeply define (or don't) define you. I would say that I learned as much about myself as I did about the formal analysis of poems in this class. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend Poetry & Faith to anyone considering it, whether their major relates to English, religious studies, or not at all. ",
            "\u00a0This was one of my favorite courses at Yale. The readings are all wonderful, and the way you read for this class is very enjoyable. That said, you definitely get out of this class what you bring to it, so if you're not devoted to giving to the class, you won't get much from it. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, especially if you're looking to clarify your sense of what you believe in. Prof. Wiman is a brilliant and sympathetic sounding board, and has the ability to intuitively sense the meaning of what you're saying better than you might be able to. The final assignment takes a lot of introspection, but if you put in the effort it's more than worth it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! The poems, and some prose, in the course can really affect the way you view the world if you let them. Class discussions range from very engaged and thoughtful (one we had on joy, for example) to just solid. Prof Wiman is also incredibly attentive and insightful during discussions, and has real insight into many of these poems. Class may not change your faith, but might provide you with new language to question and probe your own faith. ",
