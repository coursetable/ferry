            "\u00a0I learned about how to extend economic concepts until they become frameworks, and about how to build preferences towards a theory about an economy with overlapping generations. ",

            "\u00a0I developed a much deeper understanding of how economies are modeled mathematically, and improved my quantitative reasoning abilities. ",

            "\u00a0I think it's an interesting course, and the material is worth knowing. However, there's not many resources and ways to get help. If you don't have a strong math background, you're kind a screwed. ",
            "\u00a0The course is highly organized and provides many resources for you to learn the material. The professor is a legend in the field. ",
            "\u00a0I feel that Professor Bewley is a little quiet, and that the lecture itself could have used more engagement from students. However, he was very organized, and the material was organized in a very effective sequential way. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Material should be interesting for Econ/Math majors, and models (though they are an oversimplification of reality) offer some profound insights and help to build Economic intuition \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Professor is not an especially interesting lecturer, and the Problem sets are mostly computational and algebraic, there's no need to reach a deeper understanding of the material.

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend the course to anyone seriously considering graduate study in Economics. ",
            "\u00a0The workload is very reasonable (average workload of 4.3 hours per week, shortest problem set took 1.0 hours, longest took 6.0 hours). The material is also not particularly difficult and the pace is reasonable. That said, the professor is not a particularly engaging lecturer and can be hard to hear, so make sure to attend section and learn the material by yourself. If you're not Econ & Math major, don't take the course. If you are, it's a reasonable course to take, though there may be alternatives that might be better. ",
            "\u00a0Well Bewley is retiring so I'm not sure what this course is going to look like in the future. I'd recommend taking it, but be willing to put in the work. And make sure that the resources are in place to help you. I feel like I might have done better if I had more people to study with, more office hours, etc. ",
            "\u00a0It is definitely a very interesting course covering some very foundational material. People interested in gaining a deeper understanding of mathematical economics will definitely enjoy it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it to any other economics and mathematics major. You must take this class if you intend to study this material in grad school. ",
            "\u00a0This is Bewley's last year teaching, and I think the material has the potential to be very interesting. Look out for who is teaching it next to determine whether you should take it or not. It's not as difficult as I expected, and it counts as a major requirement for Econ Math (though not mandatory anymore). "
