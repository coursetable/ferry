Even though the material he presented was mostly standard, he managed to provoke interest and point out issues he lacked the time to discuss. \r\n\r\nWhile I think it was apparent that the instructor does not genuinely enjoy teaching first--year courses, his class was the best I have taken this semester --- by far. He was available for questions that went beyond the material he covered in class. ",

She is boring and necessarily harsh, therefore unsurprisingly considered to be the worst TA in the first-year courses by most of the class. ",
