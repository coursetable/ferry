            "\u00a0Thinking critically about the Middle East and misconceptions that the West has often endorsed ",
            "\u00a0This class was incredibly informative and gave a broad overview of modern Middle Eastern history. The syllabus was organized constructively and my takeaway knowledge was immense. Further, I became confident in generating reader responses and analyzing secondary documents. ",
            "\u00a0A deeper insight into major historical events and themes at play in modern middle eastern history. ",
            "\u00a0This course provides a compelling broad overview to the history of the modern middle east, as well as how the concept of \"modernity\" itself can be applied to the Middle East. The course spends quite a bit of time at the beginning on the Ottomans and Qajar Iran, before moving into more recent events. You will read a lot of fascinating historical work on the Middle East. ",
            "\u00a0Critical analysis of history - insights into conceptions of the historical development of the Middle East ",
            "\u00a0Great course for developing critical analysis and writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the last 200 or so years of Middle Eastern history and how to think critically about the region and the Western involvement in it. ",
            "\u00a0A good intro to modern middle east history; having no historical background I found this class engaging and informative and learned a lot "

            "\u00a0The course content is really good. I would have preferred to spend fewer weeks on Ottoman Empire Middle East and more on recent history, but that may be a personal preference. \r\nAlso, the 4 response papers were significant work throughout the year but only were worth a total of 25%. I think these should have constituted more than half the grade, considering they were more than half the workload. Apart from that I think its a great class! ",
            "\u00a0This course was a lot of work, but the subject material was so engaging, it was certainly worth the effort. The readings were a great strength, and the lectures became progressively better. However, I believe that by placing less emphasis on the Ottoman Empire and the Qajar Regime, we could have focused on more recent history, as I feel those earlier topics may have received inequitable attention. Further, the lectures being open to questions meant that the class could devolve and move away from what were very well thought out presentations. ",
            "\u00a0Very strong overall! Lectures could be slightly more organized, and discussion questions could be touched upon more in lecture. Also, it would have been great if response papers had been due after rather than before section. ",
            "\u00a0This course provides an effective survey of the subjects it purports that it will and also provides a broad framework as to how we should consider \"modernity\" at all in the Middle Eastern context. I thought that the readings for each week were well-curated and interesting and that the assignments were appropriate for analyzing and comprehending the material. I also thought that the weekly discussion questions were thought-provoking and helped to effectively frame the material each week. At times I felt that the lectures could've been more critical and/or dynamic--it often felt like we were just running through key figures and events with little analysis in between. I would've liked to get more of an understanding of scholarly debates on the topics we discussed, rather than just the objective run-down of what happened. We discussed these issues in section a bit more but I wish they were worked into the lectures as well. I also think the course spent a bit too much time on the Ottoman Empire and Qajar Iran at the beginning, leading us to skim over some other interesting areas of discussion like the Iran/Iraq War. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of reading, very very hard grading that detracted from the engagement in the course ",
            "\u00a0I loved the lectures and really enjoyed the discussions both in lecture and in section. While at times the course jumped from topic to topic rather than following the history of one country, I felt like I learned a lot with the course. One suggestion would be to ensure that more of the readings can be implemented into the response papers. I sometimes felt like I was reading material that was irrelevant to the discussion question for the week. ",
            "\u00a0Section materials and readings were good. I found the short essays to be a good way to engage with the material on a deeper level as well. The lectures were sometimes a bit disorganized but overall still interesting and the powerpoints were useful in jogging my memory while studying for the final. "

            "\u00a0This a really interesting class that covers a lot of Middle Eastern history, which I never covered fully in my high school history classes. Its a manageable amount of reading to actually do all of each week and the 4 required responses take some thought but arent too demanding. I thought it was also a great option for a smaller lecture where you actually talk to the Professor. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This class was engaging and eye-opening in so many ways. Plus, the instructor and TF made sure to work in modern issues, making the course a productive lesson in history and destigmatization of an area often at the crux of national attention. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Great professor and tf. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you're looking to get a broad overview, but I wouldn't consider this a deep dive into any one subject. You can get more out of the class if you do the readings, because that's where the critical analysis emerges, but if you're just trying to get by on only going to lecture I don't think you will be particularly stimulated. The course is well-structured though and definitely does a good job of guiding you to the most interesting ways to analyze the topics at hand. Professor Banko presents a critical lens through which to view the very concept of \"modernity.\" ",
            "\u00a0I would advise students to be cautious in selecting this course ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course because I learned quite a bit about the Middle East and have a stronger grasp on how to understand a complex region such as the Middle East when approaching future studies. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone looking for a decent intro course. Having little background, it was clear that there were other students in the class that had much more knowledge in middle eastern history but the course was still comfortable and engaging with room for all perspectives and backgrounds.
