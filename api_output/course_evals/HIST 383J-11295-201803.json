            "\u00a0I learned so much about the medical implications of the slave trade and the medical industries it supported. I also learned so much about how and why enslaved peoples were conceptualized by the medical industry. I learned so much about how to synthesize historical sources and I really found and ownership of and passion for history. ",
            "\u00a0History of the slave trade, medicines used on the slave ship, apothecaries and British involvement in the trade, common illnesses on the ship, treatments and limitations to treatments in the 18th century, African medicine and treatments, slave ship surgeons, the way in which medicine was used in pro-and-anti-slavery arguments, how to write a history research paper. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to analyze very ancient historical documents. ",
            "\u00a0I honed my primary source reading skills and was able to challenge myself to speak my ideas in class. The readings also gave me a chance to think about topics that I do not usually get to think about, and it was a very valuable experience. ",
            "\u00a0Taking this class was one of my best decisions at Yale. Because of how Professor Roberts structured it, I was able to perfect my critical thinking and writing skills. She was so helpful in giving me feedback on my papers and she encouraged us to express our thoughts and learn from one another. ",
            "\u00a0A deep knowledge of transatlantic slavery medicines and treatments. What it means to be a slavery historian and the modern implications of this history. ",
            "\u00a0This course was extremely helpful in changing the course of my studies at Yale: it was honestly one of the most influential that I have ever taken. The readings covered Europe's involvement in the slave trade, medicinal skills and traditions of African slaves, and just a wide variety of topics that I did not know were traditionally associated with the slave trade. It offers such an in-depth look through the readings, even though the readings can be challenging at times. It brings to light a history that is often neglected and that's just extremely important. It is also important as we see these injustices reflected in medicine today, and wow, is that shocking to see. ",
            "\u00a0This class really pushed me a lot, which I'm grateful for. I feel like I've become a better writer and developed better reading habits, which help in discussion. It's also made me think about how to study/ research a history which is so fundamentally painful to explore. I had to come to terms with a lot of difficult realities in a way I haven't in other history courses here, even ones on the slave trade. ",
            "\u00a0This course was an excellent exercise in historiography and the generation of knowledge where there was none before. I learned to dig into archival records and synthesize that information and gaps in that information alongside secondary sources, allowing for the creation of narratives and stories that were otherwise voiceless. This class also offered extensive immersion into the history of early modern science and medicine, the translatlantic slave trade, and the interactions between these two historical entities. Through this class, I discovered the roots of iatrophobia within African American communities, racial bias within biomedicine and medical education, and the imprint of slavery on the medical institutions and forms of knowledge that are privileged and heralded in the United States today. ",
            "\u00a0Throughout the course, I developed a greater understanding of the inner workings of the slave trade, especially as it related to the medical treatment of slaves. This course did not focus solely on the medical aspects of the slave trade, which I enjoyed. The beginning of the class entailed an overview of the history/implications of the trade, which was a great way to set the stage for use to dive deeper into specifics later on in the semester. ",
            "\u00a0By taking this course, I gained much theoretical and historical understanding to the slave trade, 17th and 18th century West African and European medicine and philosophies on healing, and conducting respectful but imaginative historiography that speculates on how medicine and health were practiced during and influenced by slavery. Through discussion, we learned to narrate and develop ideas about the flexible nature of science and public health. We gained insight on the legacies of the slave trade medicine, and how they manifest in modern health inequities and lapses in education. In terms of writing, I was introduced to new archives of primary sources from the slave trade era -- including ship logs, surgeon journals, and doctor correspondences-- and how to excavate meaning from these sometimes disjointed resources (due to the limitations of the archive) to more critically evaluate these sources using historical context and theoretical frameworks. ",
            "\u00a0This course has been one of my favorite courses at Yale. Not only was the teaching incredible, but I was able to learn about and discuss themes that were never properly addressed during my education before this class. ",

            "\u00a0It was an amazing course. The instructor to student engagement was incredibly high, the material was interesting, the discussion was amazing, and I learned so much. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: content, grading system, Dr. Roberts. This course was great! The content was fantastic. We covered everything from the British apothecary to the surgeon on the ship to the medicine and treatments stolen from African and much more. The reading load was not intense and many of the readings were carefully selected and actually fun and informative to read. The class only meets once per week and the workload was manageable (weekly reading response, one 4 page primary source analysis, one 12 page research paper, and 2 in-class presentations) and a lot of great feedback was given on each assignment. Dr. Roberts herself is an amazing angel who is so knowledgeable and wants her students to succeed. ",
            "\u00a0This course was amazing and Prof. Roberts is great. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Roberts is amazing! She absolutely cares about the students and the topic of medicine and race in the slave trade. Her knowledge on the subject is astounding, and she is so eloquent and graceful in her speaking and teaching. Her class provides a welcoming environment to discuss difficult topics, which I always appreciated. ",
            "\u00a0The course is perfect! ",
            "\u00a0This class is riveting subject matter and Professor Roberts just makes it even better. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: great class size, great professor, great variety of majors, interesting readings, great variety of readings, you can keep yourself accountable for your participation, everyone does a class opener and everyone does an amazing job with those and those add so much to the class content \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes we run out of time/don't keep track of time which is a good and bad thing, because the class is amazing ",
            "\u00a0This class had some really great readings, and cast a wide net over aspects of both medicine and the slave trade. One of the strengths was that we really got to contextualize the main points we were studying ourselves, rather than just having the professor tell us what we should think on the subject. That said, I wish we had slightly clearer instructions on what was expected for class presentations! ",
            "\u00a0The class was honestly perfect, so I do not have many words of criticism. It could perhaps be fun to include exercises in archival exploration a bit earlier in the course, perhaps including a visit to the Beinecke or appointments with librarians earlier in the semester. ",
            "\u00a0At this risk of sounding dramatic, I don't think there's any way that this class could be improved. The material is important, rich, and captivating. The professor is the absolute best that Yale has to offer. And the conversations are always engaging and fun. I think that the fact that this is a seminar-style course is one of its biggest strengths. Although it unfortunately makes it so that fewer students can take the class, the small number of students makes for a more intimate setting and allows for more flexibility in the classroom. ",
            "\u00a0This course is extremely well-taught, well-structured, and inspiring to people of all disciplines. One of the key strengths of this course and Professor Roberts are their ability to highlight and derive even greater scholarly richness through the diversity of the students present. We had students from History, Economics, History of Medicine, Biology, and more, who were fascinated by health and planned to engage with it (some more directly than others) from policy, historical,  clinical, research, and nonprofit perspectives. Professor Roberts' encouragement of this interdisciplinary approach helped guide us to an understanding that I think she wanted us to reach --  namely, that our different paths in education needed to be joined together - history to clinical research - in order to better understand the history and politics of medicine needed to provide quality healthcare today. The course includes an engaging array of readings - with secondary works that approach the history of medicine in the slave trade from multiple angles including gender and sexuality studies, anthropology, and biological history -- and joins them to primary sources that help us make exciting and interesting intellectual connections. Finally, Professor Roberts and her manner of engaging and inspiring her students is spectacular and the most memorable part of this course. She provides individualized feedback on our project and writing and helps connect each student's interests to the immediate realities and themes explored in our coursework. Her emphasis on creativity to approach history, such as through the use of class-openers to allow each student to show the class a new lens through which to approach the content, made this class feel dynamic and made historical research feel full of possibility. Finally, Professor Roberts graciously extended invitations to various talks, conferences, and working groups (HHH) to our class on themes relevant to public health, medicine, and their relationship to race and indigeneity -- a wonderful opportunity to connect with her, other scholars, and practicing medical and public health students that we may ordinarily not hear about. For example, Professor Roberts organized a couple students from the Medical School and the Masters Public Health program to speak to us about their experiences in higher education in health, and how they view the importance of the history of medicine and race in their studies. This was a really wonderful supplement to the class, and often not spoken about.\r\n\r\nIf I had to say one weakness, I'd say that a slightly smaller class size might be helpful (because a longer class time is not possible). I think Professor Roberts allowed for about 3-4 more students to join the class this year because everyone was so excited about the class. However, I think I would have preferred a slightly more intimate seminar setting that would allow me to hear from all students in the class and allowed only one class-opener per class session. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: everything about Prof. Roberts, connections to present-day/to issues outside the scope of the class, class openings, interesting readings\r\nImprovements: maybe more readings--there was sometimes not enough to talk about based off the readings alone "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Absolutely, I think this course should be mandatory for anyone who is pre-med or thinking about pursuing history because it teaches so much that isn't talked about. ",
            "\u00a0YES!! Take this course!! I took this as a STEM major/premed who had not taken a single HSHM, AFAM, or HIST course prior to this course. I think that Dr. Roberts does an amazing job of making this course accessible to students like myself, who are naturally drawn to the medical nature of the course. Speaking of which, the content of the course is fantastic and I think everyone aspiring to go to medical school should take this course. We talked about so much: the training of surgeons, the British apothecary, doctors on the slave ship, medical and chemical supply companies, the illnesses of the ship, treatments and their limitations, African medicine, and so much more. Dr. Roberts picks really great readings (which are not too long or too heavy) and leads a great discussion. The course is also pretty light (2 papers, a 4 page and a 12 page and weekly reading responses, meets once a week). Overall I had a great time and felt that the course was very accessible to someone like me. ",
            "\u00a0I would however I would warn them that it is not a gut and you are challenged to become a better writer. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This is one of my favorite classes at Yale by far. Professor Roberts is so caring and passionate, and it really shows in her teaching. The readings are thought provoking, and they discuss matters that are often forgotten but so important and valuable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely. Each class section began with an opening session presented by one of the students. We had a schedule and knew what readings we were going to discuss before each class. I just really valued how Prof. Roberts allowed everyone to express their thoughts. She guided each discussion with such care and attention and made sure each of us got a chance to speak. I also believe that she deeply cared about our ability to engage with the content and that showed in how she evaluated our papers. Thank you so much Prof. Roberts! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to every student at Yale. This is my favorite class I have ever taken. This course has inspired me to apply to grad school. Professor Roberts made this material accessible and interesting for everyone. This course changed my life and I am so happy to have taken it. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this class to anyone that is interesting in learning about something that is truly not talked about enough; Professor Roberts is so kind, passionate, and enthusiastic about teaching what she teaches, and the readings are amazing, and cover a wide range of topics. It changed the course of my Yale career (in the sense that I changed my major because of this class), and so yes, of course, I highly recommend this. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would, this class changed how I think about our modern medicine, medical education, and historical education. I've tried to get all of my suite mates to take it, and I would definitely recommend this course if you're pre-med! The class isn't just about the past, it informs  how people of color today are mistreated in medical communities. ",
            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY. Everyone who has ever had contact with the United States healthcare system or who ever has plans to go into a health-related profession should take this course or Dr. Roberts's lecture course Sickness and Health in African American History. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. Whether your major is AFAM, HSHM, biology, or any other, everyone who walks into this class will walk out with something that they can take and apply in their day to day lives. Although the title \"Medicine and the Slave Trade\" might appeal to certain students interested in either of those subjects, it truly is a class for all. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student. As a pre-health student who felt that science was a little too rigid or elitist to fully reflect my own personal stakes or interest in race, class, and gender, this course gave me a thoughtful lens with which to re-approach health. I've possessed many doubts about joining the healthcare field, and thought this history seminar could possibly help me make the decision to shift toward the the humanities. Interestingly, this seminar has done something different and better. It's made me a more adventurous but skilled writer and historical researcher, and taught me so much about the importance of the slave trade to how medicine functions today and the evolution of medical thought. But at the same time, it's taught me how history and medicine can and must meld together in my potentially future career.  Before this class, these two intellectual interests felt disparate. This course helped pull them together. ",
            "\u00a0YES! Dr. Roberts is incredible and the material is very rich and altogether uncharted, so you really get to become apart of the work of analyzing the archive. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! I experienced huge intellectual as well as personal growth. "
