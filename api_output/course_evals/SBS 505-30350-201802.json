I wish the readings were discussed more in class for students who don't have background in social sciences/social and behavioral health. some readings were difficult to interact with and some context from class would've been beneficial for me. the learning environment was excellent and dr ransom did a great job including a variety of perspectives on each topic and ensuring nobody felt left out (sometimes to fault of not finishing some in class material).

I would have preferred more structured feedback during class discussion and more structured learning outcomes - this was improved upon in the second half of the course after initial feedback was given.\r\nImprovement could be made with timeliness of feedback, it would have been beneficial to receive midterm assignment grading prior to completing the final assignment. ",

I wish the instructor had been more organized with how the material was presented and presented a framework in its entirety before encouraging students to discuss. I often felt that I was asked to discuss concepts I didn't fully understand. ",

The pre-reading- I tried to read all the material initially but it just became too overwhelming and time consuming, I feel it would be better to pick one or two key readings to focus on, and draw from that material in the lectures. One week there was over 100 pages of pre-reading and combined with my other courses there was just no way I as realistically going to get through it, so I gave up. It seems like a missed opportunity as I am genuinely interested in the subject. I feel like it's not fair to ask us to do course work, then give us no feedback during the course. If it is a 'formative' assessment ie aiding in our learning, we need feedback to be able to develop our knowledge and arguments for the subsequent assessments. ",

            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this class. The topics discussed were interesting and really opened my eyes to the disparities in healthcare between minority groups. It has further strengthened my resolve to help all those in my community and bring healthcare equity to all. My favorite part of the class was the group exercises where we were paired with our classmates to solve issues in public health. It was very helpful to see these issues through the eyes of those with different backgrounds and to work together towards a common goal. ",

Sometimes found it difficult to ascertain what exactly I was meant to be taking home from lectures in a concrete fashion - I feel like I developed a broad understanding of the course content generally but not quite an in depth understanding. ",

Since we didn't have the slides before it made it a little tough to take notes in context of discussion points from class. He was very good at including everyone's thoughts and opinions however this made class go very slowly in the beginning weeks. ",

He's very eager to teach and is very knowledgable. I think he can improve class discussions by guiding the conversation and bringing it back when it starts to go off topic. ",

            "\u00a0Dr. Ransome was clearly very passionate about this subject but I felt that his delivery wasn't as organized as it could have been. I think an easier approach would be to introduce a concept, fully flesh it out, and then point out exceptions (rather than exploring all possible ways in which a concept can apply without clearly defining it).

Also, these concepts are v difficult so instead of saying \"it depends\" and uploading 1000's of articles on canvas, maybe use a basic textbook or classic examples (like Camera Jone's TED talk) to teach. Really appreciated 2nd 1/2 of class when Yusuf utilized videos and improved slides quite a bit. Think that after working out roadbumps will be a v good prof. ",
            "\u00a0Very kind and approachable and has a nice lecturing style. It was good to hear about his work with HIV as examples for some of the concepts.\r\n\r\nIf could bring a bit more structure to the course I think that would help, but I understand it was his first time lecturing for this course.\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed the course but I found it a bit vague and unstructured compared to other courses I have taken in the past.

            "\u00a0Dr. Ransome was excellent.  His Socratic method of teaching in hind sight makes more sense, than when you are going through it.  He is highly knowledgeable and relatable as a teacher.  Considering that the format of this course was new, and that this was Dr. Ransome's first time teaching this course, he should be complemented for pulling it all together in such an effective manner.

However, lack of formal structure of the course contents makes this task challenging! He does provide loads of reading materials though, some of which are not possible to finish reading in time! ",

            "\u00a0Unfortunately, I could tell this was Professor Ransome's first course and believe he has great room for improvement. Sometimes, he delays answering questions in class and did not always explain concepts in a way I could understand. It also would have been helpful to receive feedback for our midterm prior to completing the final exam. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: truly incorporated student feedback to improve upon the course\r\n- admirably tackled large SBS topics instead of shying away from them\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: heavily focused on his personal HIV research to the exclusion of many other available research on other health-related topics\r\n- lack of timely return of midterm, resulting in no available grades prior to the end of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0The instructor was very knowledgeable in his field and very enthusiastic. It was a pleasure to learn from him as someone who is actively studying the topics he was teaching. ",
            "\u00a0Yusuf was fantastic.  He will be an asset to the university.  He is knowledgeable, knows how to elicit quality class discussions, and does a great job steering group conversations so we meet our peers better and learn about different perspectives to solving problems ",
            "\u00a0I thoroughly enjoyed attending Professor Ransome's lectures. He made a lot of effort to ensure that the course content was interesting and relevant. He openly admitted that this was his first time teaching this class and was very receptive to feedback and tried to change things for the second half of term to make things better. Class discussions were very interesting, I feel he could maybe be slightly better at giving feedback to answers during them though. I appreciate his efforts to make the learning environment feel very comfortable for everyone - which it definitely was - but often he would take several answers at once and we would get feedback that we were all correct. This sometimes added a little bit to the ambiguity of not being concrete on what I felt I needed to know from the course but also may just be reflective of the nature of the field. His research is strongly HIV orientated and whilst this was very interesting and I genuinely enjoyed hearing about his experiences in both London and the US, I would have appreciated a little bit less of a focus on HIV related and more general content. Group exercises were also engaging if sometimes a little unclear in the early stages, and often we didn't have as much time as I would have liked. Not necessarily Professor Ransome's fault, just a feature of our limited time. Overall, a great learning experience on what was pretty much new content to me - thanks Professor! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Knows his own research.\r\nWeaknesses: Poor organization of the material. Slides did not make sense. Did not manage classroom well. Answered \"it depends\" or \"yes, those are all good answers\" to everything, to the point it was a joke amongst students. Also came across as defensive when students asked questions pushing for a clear answer. \r\nOpportunities for improvement: Structure course material and associated slides better. Have clear takeaways for each section. Give greater context before asking students to work in smaller groups on a vaguely defined problem. Integrate the readings into the classroom discussion. "
