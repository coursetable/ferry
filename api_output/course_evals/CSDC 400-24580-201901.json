            "\u00a0Overview of history of the performing arts in the US ",
            "\u00a0I gained extensive knowledge of theatrical business history, law, and practice. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a ton of practical information about copyright law, legal customs of theatre, and the precedent-defining cases that define them. Since the academic intent of the course was so ultra-specific, I'm walking away armed with useful knowledge on a pretty granular level, which is awesome and rare in a Yale course. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the history of mostly copyright law relating to plays in the United States. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about copyright, contract, and employment law surroundingthe theater. I learned about theater history and the way that various structures within the theater came to be. ",
            "\u00a0This seminar gave a thorough overview of the American theater's messy business history.  Important texts formed the foundation of this knowledge, which was furthered by Prof. Salter's insight during class. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how the US Theater Industry, particularly Broadway, works, and I mean \"works\" in every possible sense of the word. From performance copyright law and co-authorship disputes to the concept of the royalty pool and unions and associations that represent all the players, both on and offstage, including the tracking of historical events and trends that led up to each of these things in the first place, this course really had it all and I learned a ridiculous amount. So many of the things I had taken for granted about the state of theater in the US, I can now very clearly describe what sort of legal and business events and climate influenced the industry into that direction. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the legal and business histories that inform the current business and legal models of the American Performing arts. I learned about specific cases that made headlines (or ones that didn't): cases that should make us think about how our legal frameworks are broken and/or in need of revising. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how to read legal documents and what to look for in legal situations regarding the theater. "

            "\u00a0Too much reading for us to engage with it all. But the readings were interesting. ",
            "\u00a0This is the best class I have ever taken in my entire life. I only wish I could keep taking it.  Some weeks reading was a lot, but they were pretty much always all relevant ",
            "\u00a0Strengths We read some interesting secondary sources about performance. A niche an interesting topic. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses sometimes the reading was dry and lengthy, discussion could also be dry and felt long as it was a once a week seminar. I wish we discussed more basic law terminology at the beginning so that the papers were a bit more understandable. ",
            "\u00a0This course was really well designed. The readings were always interesting and relevant, and they told a coherent story over the course of the semester. There is nothing I would change. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Salter!  An amazing and passionate teacher who pushed us to engage with the material and connect it to our own experiences; readings were solid and always informative; reading responses at our own pace was also a nice touch.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Four reading responses felt like a little too much work given the length of the readings, but nothing unreasonable; discussions sometimes veered off topic, and Prof. Salter wouldin the interest of honoring students' experiencesallow this for a while, which sometimes grew frustrating. ",
            "\u00a0A major strength was the 4 reading response assignments due throughout the semester. They were designed specifically to help us collect our thoughts about the readings and look at them with a critical eye in preparation for discussion. Professor Salter read each one before class began and was able to invite students to take part in the discussion when he saw it was headed toward one of the topics that student had written about in their reading response. As a student who has a little bit of discussion anxiety, having 2-3+ pages of organized thoughts prepared for some of the discussions this semester and having Professor Salter invite me to specifically define, describe, and/or explain a term, court case, or historical event that he knew I wrote my response about did wonders for me in terms of feeling confident enough to speak up in class. I imagine it would be the same for other students with a similar level of discussion anxiety. The readings themselves and the final project are also major strengths in my opinion. Each and every reading was so rich with information and each week, professor Salter would send a kind of briefing e-mail on the upcoming class' readings, contextualizing each of them with his own commentary and pointing out places where the readings from one week had bearing or relevance to the readings from another. I can honestly say I was excited to dive into the readings for this course week after week, and having the final paper as an opportunity to contribute to the scholarly discourse that had stimulated me all semester long was amazing.\r\n\r\nFor me, the only weakness of this class was that it only met once a week. I'd have loved to spend multiple days in my week in shorter discussion sections, and I expect splitting the class time between the week would make it easier to manage the reading load. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Brent is a fantastic professor. He has so many resources and he makes them available to his students. The readings are relevant and the class itself is very relaxed and fun. We got to talk to actual lawyers and figures in the field who gave is rare insights into the business.\r\nWeaknesses: There was 15o+ pages of reading every week. It was near impossible to get everything done in time. Class discussions roamed a little bit and weren't focused a lot of the time. ",
            "\u00a0There were many very interesting readings, but honestly too many readings. It was very difficult to get to everything and we only ended up discussing a few at most each week. "

        [
            "\u00a0With a re-thinking of the amount of reading and ways to engage with it, the class would be very fun. ",
            "\u00a0If you have any interest in show business, arts administration/management, entertainment law, or just love stories of old broadway Ihighly recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0Any student interested in theatre in literally any capacity should take this class. It's like the medicine you know you need to take, and you sort of dread taking it, then you take it and you feel SO much better and you wonder why you were ever scared of it in the first place. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in copyright law especially in regards to performing arts, I would recommend. If youre not incredibly interested in copyright law, I would not recommend. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. The course was well designed, Professor Salter was extremely helpful and led engaging discussions during class, and I learned a lot. ",
            "\u00a0If you're considering a career in performing arts or entertainment business/law of any kind, YOU MUST TAKE THIS COURSE.  The material is essential and the discussions are memorable.  I sure hope Salter returns to Yale at some point to teach it againit should be a required part of the THST major in my opinion. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Especially to anyone in the Theater Studies major looking for classes to fill the gaps in that department's curriculum. I think the class is especially beneficial to students like myself who didn't discover their passion for theater until like high school and loved in a place nowhere near the Theater hub that is Broadway. I know many of my peers were already quite familiar with some of the histories we learned about in the class in part  due to where they lived and how long they'd been into theater, so for me, this class presented the perfect opportunity for me to \"catch up\" to their knowledge about the US Theater world, so to speak ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! If you are at all interested in American performing arts, you should definitely take this class. Brent is a fantastic and incredibly knowledgeable professor, and he provides a great overview of the legal and business histories. It is one of the only practical courses for people interested in going into the business. ",
            "\u00a0If you are considering a career in the entertainment industry at all, YOU MUST TAKE THIS COURSE!! It was extremely insightful and Brent is so helpful. "
