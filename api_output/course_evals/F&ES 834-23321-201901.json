There are weekly problem sets which align well with the material covered in the class and take a very reasonable amount of time.  There was also a perfect mix of learning economic concepts and having class discussions about policy implications.  \r\nThe class should definitely be placed in a larger room next year, because it was a very tight squeeze.  I also found that there was not enough time given for the midterm.\r\nOverall, great class! ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated the focus on real world problems but felt we focused too much specifically on Kotchen's previous work (e.g. an entire lecture on the Maine water issue). ",
            "\u00a0I was initially intimidated by the readings, but the lectures and office hours helped to break down the course material such that it was simple enough for all levels. I appreciate that Matt and Ethan made themselves available beyond the usual sessions so that we could ask any questions we had about the material. I did not interact much with the other TA, Zihan, but he provided timely feedback on our problem sets. \r\n\r\nI would have liked to learn more about how various economic models are constructed so that I would be able to contribute to such modeling in internships or further research. We got a brief overview. I think there should also be options for further reading and discussion beyond the material we canvassed in class so that we have a greater depth of understanding. ",
            "\u00a0Class discussions were very interesting and facilitated learning, however, I believe course material, eg lecture slides can be made more comprehensive to facilitate learning outside of the classroom. Sometimes the pace of the class is very fast to keep up with and not having very comprehensive slides doesn't help with catching up. This is a class that should definitely be recorded. ",
            "\u00a0Matt Kotchen is an engaging and approachable professor. His occasional jokes help lighten the mood on what can be a relatively dry topic on economic theory. Professor Kotchen has also done a good job in bringing in relevant case studies to analyze using the economic tools discussed in class. ",
            "\u00a0The course is a little fast paced and it would be helpful to have it video recorded so that the students could have access to these videos for going back to review concepts later. ",
            "\u00a0A weakness is that class does not necessarily align well with problem sets and exams as far as mathematical applications. While I understand we are meant to work through problems on our own and apply concepts beyond what is taught in class, it would still be helpful to have more related material taught in class. ",
            "\u00a0This was a very interesting, fun course to take. Professor Kotchen especially brought a lot of energy to the class and is clearly very happy to share his knowledge with students. I appreciated his flexible teaching style so that we could move things quickly that the class understood immediately, or we could slow things down if needed. I also greatly appreciate that Professor Kotchen asked students what we were interested in learning and incorporated our suggestions into the class.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I think could be improved is integrating more of the graphs into the slides. I understand that many are complex and it is better to draw them out while explaining each step to the class, but I missed one class because I was sick and so completely lost out on an entire chunk of knowledge for a section. I am not a Forestry student and so didn't know anyone in the class, thus didn't have anyone to ask for notes for the day I missed. This, perhaps, is a problem that affects few students, but I think including even a couple of basic graphs in the slides could be very useful for review before tests, too. ",
            "\u00a0Overall I liked how the class is structured in terms of how concepts are introduced and how the problem sets are designed. Some of the topics towards the end of the class (e.g. strong vs weak sustainability and genuine savings) seemed more abstract and harder to grasp than other topics in the class, and we went through them quite quickly. It might be helpful to make those concepts more concrete and to bring in more examples to make sure that students understand what they're all about. Also, I pretty much only interacted with Ethan as far as the TAs went, and he was an excellent instructor and extremely patient with questions. ",

            "\u00a0More mathematical formulation would be better but at the same time it only focuses on the concepts which is important. Takes a long time to explain the same basic concepts which would be an opportunity to go deeper or more technical ",
            "\u00a0I think given the amount of time problem sets, they should be given more weight in final grading. That said I thought they were great for having us take the tools discussed and utilize them to gain familiarity. ",
            "\u00a0The material is interesting and well delivered by Professor Kotchen. Ethan is an amazing TA. ",
            "\u00a0I felt that this course gave a good refresher on basic econ as well as an intro to some of the main ideas and problems that environmental economists work on. To me this felt like a well-designed and thought-out course that did what it set out to do. \r\n\r\nMy only criticisms relate to the problem sets. The way that some of the questions were worded made it very hard to figure out how to answer them, at least at first when I was figuring out what the TAs were looking for. Towards the end I also felt like the grading had become a little inconsistent. \r\n\r\nHowever, I really appreciated how available the TAs made themselves in office hours and how patient they were with the students. I also liked that Prof. Kotchen encourages group work on the problem sets, since I felt like I learned a lot more by discussing the concepts with others versus just trying to think it through alone. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course tries to cover too much material in one semester which gives students which limits students ability to have a comprehensive engagement with the materials. I also think that the evaluation structure adopted focuses more on problem sets than actual learning. I would recommend that in future, a different model eg give problem questions to students and let them research and report back through presentations or written papers. ",
            "\u00a0Matt's teaching style is my favorite I've encountered at FES thus far. He really cares so much that his students are inspired by and invested in the process of learning, and considers all questions as a learning opportunity for the rest of the class. Class was fun almost all days. ",
            "\u00a0Matt was an engaged professor and the TAs were great, so I got a lot out of lectures. The level of conversation for a Monday morning econ class was impressive. Could've benefited from a professor-led policy assignment of sorts (something meatier than a problem set) at the end of the class. Instead, we covered a couple random topics. ",

            "\u00a0The assignments were both a strength and a weakness in that they helped solidify the material we learned in class but were sometimes frustrating and hard to figure out without going to office hours. I think the lectures were good- and I appreciate that Professor Kotchen encouraged us to participate in discussion and debate. I do think the material was occasionally very theoretical and I most appreciated when the material was tied to real-world examples. ",
