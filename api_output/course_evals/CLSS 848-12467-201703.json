            "\u00a0I have learned a great deal about the social, political, and religious context of ancient Greek festivals. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me a deeper knowledge of archaeology, classics, and the role of Ancient Greek festivals in the cultural and social dynamics of the time. The readings each week as well as the opportunities for presentations to the class were excellent opportunities to engage with the material in depth. Finally, the trip to Greece was an essential part of the course, leading to a fundamental shift in my understanding of these festivals in their original context. ",
            "\u00a0A great first look into ancient Greek religion. My first real introduction to art history, and I became familiarized with a lot of the scholarly debates that are ongoing about the nature of festivals, material culture etc. But nothing compares to the amazing ten days in Greece; I learned so much beyond what the course promised, into many different aspects of festivals, Greek landscape, and even personally/spiritually. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to consider Ancient Greek religion in a festival context and developed more interdisciplinary approaches to the study of ancient Greece. "

            "\u00a0This should course should not be open to ISM students unless it is going to present the material in such a way that non-classics/ancient history/ancient art people can engage fully. There was such an unfortunate dynamic in the class as it was clear for whom the class was truly being taught. There were many discussions amongst all of the ISM students throughout the semester and it was clear that all felt out of place to varying degrees. Several of them even believed that they were only in the class so that the ISM would fund the trip. Since people were accepted to the class who had ever studied anything related to the content of the course, more accessible articles needed to be assigned for them and class discussions shouldn't assume so much prior knowledge. There were people in the course who hadn't even heard of the Greek gods being discussed, let alone the minute details of history, language, and culture that were constantly assumed to be common knowledge. It is absolutely fine if this course is only meant for students with the proper prior background, but that needs to be made clear from the beginning. ",
            "\u00a0No weaknesses to speak of. The breadth of the reading is pretty astonishing, and the course covers it all very well. The trip to Greece at the end brought everything together. ",
            "\u00a0This course was exceedingly well-organized and thought out. The thematic reading for each week led to a productive discussion during class time. Although there was clearly an advantage for students of classics/history of art, nevertheless it was fascinating to be privy to a variety of opinions during these discussions. One potential way the course could be improve in the future is by maintaining a greater cohesion/consistency among the students taking it, so that the discussions could potentially be more specialized and background knowledge could be assumed. ",
            "\u00a0There was a good balance in the secondary readings, between literary analysis, general historical information, and treatment of material evidence. Really appreciated getting to read scholars like Nagy and Johnston. At times I was bogged down by the readings which tended towards more obscure topics and almost contrarian quibbles (I'm thinking Scullion), and was longing for more primary texts. I especially enjoyed presenting on site; the highlight of the course was researching, preparing, and learning from peers through presentations and Q&A's. There may have been too much emphasis on professionalism and presenting at a conference--especially since more than half of the class were non-experts coming from diverse personal and academic backgrounds--but the final presentations left me with a lot to think about nonetheless. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting subject matter, incorporation of different disciplines in the student base\r\nWeaknesses: course was catered mostly to students in the Classics dept., so those of us who do not specialize in Ancient Greece or Rome were discouraged from incorporating our own fields of study. I learned a lot but do wish the class had been as interdisciplinary as initially promised. "

            "\u00a0No, I would not. The professors are brilliant but the pedagogical techniques employed leave much to be desired. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely recommend this course for students from all backgrounds. Profs Laferriere and Lamont selected a diverse group of students for the program, which enriched our discussion in class (and in Greece). The reading is comprehensive and covers a lot of ground, but the instructors were always available to answer any questions. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to any aspiring classicist or classical archaeologist. Its unique approach to Ancient Greek Festivals led to insights and further understanding. ",
            "\u00a0Sheer amount of information about so many different festivals can be daunting at times, but leaves you with an excellent foundation. The course gives you fluency with individual festivals, and even the ability to question the validity of some of the arguments that are being put forth in the scholarly community about the festivals. I wonder if the ISM can support another trip like this, but it's worth taking in any case. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Notwithstanding some disappointment at how little it focused on interdisciplinary dialogue, the professors were invested and the travel portion of the seminar was worth more than any amount of scholarship or textbook we read. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if the student is interested in Classics. "
