However, the meat of this class is about comparing the art to myth, plays, and historical accounts-- by combining primary and secondary sources we were able to identify scenes portrayed on ceramics, find sculptures directly discussed in ancient texts, and figure out how plays relate to depictions of gods. All of these skills came together naturally through a combination of short readings, visits in sections to the Yale University Art Gallery, and detailed lectures full of interesting stories, images, and anecdotes.

I feel like there could have been a bit more information on how to analyze the visual aspects of an artifact, especially since the final paper was on that aspect - the lectures and sections mostly related to the myths themselves, and the history of Greece - there wasn't as much about some of things that I was marked down on in my first paper (the shine of the paint, the method of creating the piece, the use of colors, etc.) and I felt a bit unprepared to go into the final paper.

The only thing I didn't like was how I got squeezed out of a writing credit section, after Professor Gaifman reassured us that any and all students seeking a WR credit would get the opportunity to do so. But, the issue seemed like it was out of her control, so I don't fault her for this.\r\n\r\nOther than this one little, nitpicky thing, the course was solid. ",

These in addition to my limited mythological background helped me understand more of the implications of the myths, which I think is very important.\r\n\r\nSome weaknesses are the range of material covered, because there is a lot to cover it is difficult to spend time in one area. So we would pick and choose which topics would be the ones we dived deeply in, but I felt that the ideas we passed over were just skipped. Additionally being a WR credit, there was not a lot of writing support and feedback related to craft, it still seemed very historical argument based grading and feedback-wise. ",

For the WR sections I could've used a little more writing support since with the exception of approving the final paper's thesis we were left mostly on our own to come up with papers. Maybe peer review session or TFs reading a paragraph or two would've been helpful. It would also be helpful to have a little more information on slides, because it's sometimes hard to tell what's important or what the main idea is. I would've also liked to learn a few more myths to go along with the artwork we looked at. I would also want my final essay back, just so that my final grade isn't as much of a mystery and so I can use those comments to improve future work. Overall I enjoyed the course though and it was definitely interesting. ",

Professor Gaifman was also a really good lecturer and she ensured that lectures were interesting and instructive, allowing us to look at artworks from a different perspective for us to look at the artwork through different lenses and gain different conclusions from them. The course was weaker in the organization, there were too many assignments but not enough feedback for us to improve on our work between assignments. Sometimes the grading of the course seems arbitrary, where essays are not graded in the most fair and standardized manner due to the large size of the class. ",

Although it is a lot of material, you know exactly what they will be looking for and how to exam will be structured. Very low pressure environment. There is a fair amount of time between each of the 3 writing assignments and ample time given on the midterm and final. Weaknesses: Was a bit rough having both a final paper and an exam in conjunction with my other exams. ",

            "\u00a0I loved the content of the course, and Professor Gaifman was very engaging!\r\n\r\nThe main weaknesses came as a result of the class being so large. I heard that there was some disparity between TFs in terms of grading styles, something that is very difficult to overcome when there are so many students to grade for. It was also in the YUAG auditorium, so there were no desks and note-taking/test-taking was a bit of an inconvenience. That is all! ",
            "\u00a0Not enough interaction between teaching fellows and students for writing sections. Expectations for writing were not clear and same for exams. My TA didn't even explain why I got points off on the midterm, there were just arbitrary point values lost, though she did say that she took off points for not completing a requirement of our that wasn't even mentioned in lecture or section, which is unfair. There are much better lectures and writing classes out there. ",
            "\u00a0This course has no weaknesses, and is likely the best course I have ever taken at Yale. I say that as a science major.\r\n\r\nThe writing assignments, while short, built my descriptive skills and helped lower my dependence on adverbs. I received personal feedback from my TFs after every assignment, and each helped me synthesize information more effectively in the next.\r\n\r\nMy TF, Soffia, was incredible, and is probably the best TF I have ever had. She was very knowledgeable about Greek myth, and knew everything about the paintings and sculptures discussed. She made every discussion section worth walking from Science Hill to the YUAG worth it-- one particular example includes when we studied the symposium, she made us recline on our desks similar to how Greeks would have done. She provided us with information for the finals (such as a scanned glossary for a book recommended for the course but with most copies checked out from a library), she made sure each of us felt prepared for our papers, and she fought to have each of us improve, providing specific suggestions and incentives for doing so.\r\n\r\nProfessor Gaifman was also kind and wonderful-- I showed up to every lecture, which helped me a great deal on the final. The lectures went into great detail about the slides (which were available online), and she helped encourage comprehension. She peppered her lectures with jokes and stories, and made it easier to understand complicated texts such as the Iliad and Odyssey. She fought tooth and nail to increase the number of WR sections available to students, and I truly think she meant it. She sometimes did focus a bit too long on one topic, and the lecture would spill into the next, but she managed to transition effortlessly regardless.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion for improvement comes to the administration-- give this course the WR sections and TFs it deserves-- it is the most popular WR course at Yale and still had to turn some people away. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great class! A great writing credit! The lectures are super interesting and the only assignments are the three essays and two exams. Instructions and guidance on writing and what to expect on exams were very clear. ",
            "\u00a0The course provided a great survey of Greek art. Professor Gaifmann was really engaging and I attended nearly all lecture. Sometimes the material presented would be a little repetitive but overall this wasn't an issue. Also, the powerpoints posted to canvas were very unnecessarily long but that wasn't much of a hurdle. Would absolutely take another course taught by Professor Gaifmann in the future. ",
            "\u00a0It could be improved by having slightly more organized lectures that followed a single train of thought. Lectures felt a little jumbled and seemed to jump back and forth from topic to topic and sometimes it was hard to see how they all related. However it was a super interesting class and I enjoyed the subject matter as a whole. ",
            "\u00a0Loved lecture and how it was taught. It was super engaging hearing about the myths and how they were reflected in art. ",
            "\u00a0I think the lectures could be more succinct and the section sign up should be done online to avoid the chaos that occurred when tons of students tried to manually sign up after lecture. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were great in this course! Professor Gaifman is a really dynamic professor, and she always makes the lectures fun and interesting. A weakness of this course is the TF's and the way the assignments are graded. I consistently felt that my assignments were graded overly harshly, even though I put more effort into this class than any of my other courses. For an \"introductory\" art history course, it definitely DISCOURAGED me from taking any other classes in the department for that reason. ",
            "\u00a0A strength was Professor Gaifman - her enthusiasm and passion for the topic were very clear, and she always made the day's subject relevant to our everyday lives. Something that can be improved upon was the selection process for section. It was held in class at the end, and was pretty chaotic - I wasn't even sure if the section I initially singed up for fit in my schedule; I just wanted to get my name on a list. I think that signing up for section electronically would be better, especially given the volume of the class. ",
            "\u00a0I liked that sections were held in the YUAG sometimes -- it was fun to see examples of art up close. In terms of weaknesses, I felt that the readings weren't completely necessary for doing well in the class, so it was pretty tempting to skip them. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: enthusiasm of the professor, ability to pop over to the YUAG and talk about ancient pottery in front of some real-life examples, exciting essay topics, clear expectations for essays & exams, discussion of relevancy of Greek mythology to the modern world.\r\n\r\nweakness: this class would be cooler as a smaller lecture since Prof. Gaifman is great and it's hard to get to know her in a lecture of 150+ ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were very interesting and closely followed the reading, which was great if you fell behind. Sometimes, sections met in the Gallery, and that was cool. We were given explicit instructions on how to study for the midterm and final exams, so it was not stressful to prepare for them. No noteworthy weaknesses, an excellent writing class. ",
            "\u00a0The powerpoints could be more intuitive, especially when viewing them outside of the lecture. They were hard to follow. Sections could have been more writing focused and a day going over how to analyze art would have been helpful. ",
            "\u00a0So great!!! ",
            "\u00a0This course was a lot of fun and well designed in general. I loved having sections in the art gallery, and I think it would have been better to have almost all of them there! ",

            "\u00a0I loved that we utilized the YUAG for section, it made material much more engaging. The readings were really good and I wish we used some of them more in class. Overall, I thought the structure of lecture could have been improved, often we would spend 3/4 of the class covering what was meant to be covered last lecture then during the last 15 minutes we would get to the information about which the lecture was titled. It could have been organized more clearly in terms of theme, but the content was excellent. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures and content were very interesting to learn and the class wasn't too much work! However, the lecture slides were not very organized or helpful so you have to go to lecture. ",

Grading is very subjective, and my TA was not able to explain why she took off the points that she did on my midterm exam. It is clear that some TAs grade much more harshly than others, but the professor does not seem to account for that in calculating grades. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were engaging, but I wish we had spent more sections in the art gallery, especially because I felt like the sections were often repetitive of what was talked about in lecture. ",

            "\u00a0Its a good course. It can be very difficult, however, to tell what the expectations are for what you should do on exams. Making that more clear from the getgo would make the course seem more cohesive and less unnecessarily stressful. ",

With that said, the lecture slides themselves were not very useful for studying. Most of the information needed for the exams were mentioned orally in class, so taking notes were very important. Perhaps that could be stressed a little more in the beginning of the semester.\r\nOne concerning thing I have noticed is that grading seemed to differ quite a lot depending on the TA. Some of my friends consistently got As and some got Bs, despite our similar contents on the midterms. Some TAs were really strict in grading the midterms and papers, and I think sometimes they were pretty unreasonable (such as docking points off for not identifying which book of the Iliad/Odyssey that a mythological episode is from). I think there could be a better standardization of grading. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were fascinating, and the readings were always very informative and short considering how much they contained. The discussion section was useful for helping us analyze literature and art ourselves in a guided fashion, and having section in the art gallery itself was a lot of fun. ",

The only annoying thing was that there was no WiFi in the auditorium and the slides were not posted on Canvas until after lecture so it was hard to record the images Professor Gaifman was talking about. I also wish there were more writing sections or that the registration process was shorter and better organized. By the time I found out I had not gotten into a writing section, Reading period was almost over. ",

She and the team of TAs did so much work at the beginning of the course securing more sections for the class so that more people could take it as a writing credit, which I know a lot of people appreciated.  I loved lectures because we were always learning about something interesting.  Some of the reading seems extraneous and not really necessary, but some are truly fascinating and are different from the myths that we might have been used to reading.  Personally, I really liked that the writing sections and non-writing sections had different requirements because I had to write one less paper.  Another great thing was how often we had section in the art gallery; I always need more excuses to hang out in there.  For the final paper we had a lot of freedom in choosing our topic, so we could really delve deeper into something we were interested in.  One weakness was the review session for the final exam; I am not sure if there was one for the midterm, but this one was terrible.  It was not well organized and the only helpful information we got was the format of the exam and how much time to spend on each thing, which I did not end up sticking to because it was dumb.  The TA who led it seemed like she did not know what she was doing.  At one point, she told us not to ask her specific questions because she might not know the answer... ",

The lectures are absolutely fascinating, but you can skip if you're overwhelmed or don't have time, and will still do fine in the class - the lectures are posted, and the information is very easily accessible. I did the non-WR credit option, so the writing was limited, and pretty easy, and the midterm/final were not terrible either! The best part of this class is the absolutely fascinating material!

            "\u00a0Yes. Take this class. \r\n\r\nPrior to this past semester, I thought guts at Yale were like unicorns; I entered freshman year hoping they existed, as my mom constantly promised me through high school. These beautiful, effortless creatures dominated both my conscious thought, and my subconscious; on the nights before difficult STEM exams, I would dream of these storied creatures, hoping one day to not spend my Wednesday night in Starr and instead sending it on the dance floor at Woads, or perhaps at a Leisurely soiree in the basement of a Lynwood street house. After going through four semesters of disappointment, still failing to identify a true, thoroughbred unicorn gut, I was ready to call of my search. \r\n\r\nI started to suspect I found a unicorn a few weeks into the semester. After being berated with hour after hour of bland STEM equations and economic jargon from my classes earlier in the day, I was easily soothed into a deeply relaxed state by Professor Gaifman as she spoke of athletic demigods, beautiful goddesses, and generally incredible tales. No one forced me to memorize an equation. No one forced me to participate in lecture. No one asked me to do a proof, or remember that log(1+r) approximates to log(r). \r\n\r\nMy eureka moment of the true guttiness of this class came after the Professor Gaifman sent us the study guide for the midterm. A list of around 20 terms and 8 photos of works of art was included. The test was a regurgitation, asking us to simply re-write four of these terms and identify two of these photos. No critical thinking was involved. I did not have to make decisions or problem solve--I spewed out the information and got nearly 100%. The final was similarly easy. \r\n\r\nEach of the three papers required us to look at a work of greek art, usually a big wine mixing cup, and literally just describe what it looked like. These papers were similar to teaching a child new vocabulary. While I don't yet have a child of my own, I've seen parents point their children excitedly to an airplane flying by, exclaiming \"Aiiiirrrplaaaane,\" and maybe if the child were especially advanced, saying, \"see the wings,\" and even, \"what big engines it has!\" Of number of mythological figures visible on the first work of art, I could only identify two of them. No worries! Just say, \"this blob is person shaped. This person has dark skin--it's a man. This man is naked. This man is so ripped--like the most ripped. This man probably a god because he's tall.\" That earned a solid A. For the last two papers, you just do this for two works instead of one, and compare these descriptions. \r\n\r\nTaking this class is like sipping the drink of your choice on the beach of a tropical island as a beautiful human fans you with the stiffest of palm fronds, overlooking clear waters and light onshore breezes. Upon finishing the final exam, I made my last beautiful realization; I learned a lot about Greek Myth and its depictions in Ancient Greek Art. Now I can casually drop a reference at a cocktail party, if I'm ever lucky enough to be invited to one, reminding everyone that I, by the way, did attend Yale University. I can look at a statue or a painting, and say, \"Hey! That's Zeus. Or maybe Poseidon. Or Athena. Definitely a Greek God though!\" The uselessness of this information is unparalleled, but the ease with which Professor Gaifman led us to learn this information is similarly astounding. Please, take this class. Oh, and it's a writing credit. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Very interesting material and not very taxing whatsoever in terms of the workload. You will learn with no real stress hanging over your head. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the class was amazing! I honestly took it as a fifth class because it seemed manageable and I was right. The material is very fascinating, especially because I have always found Greek mythology interesting. The workload was low, so a lot of people skipped lecture because it wasn't super necessary to do well in the class. I think this is a class where you get what you put into it -- if you're just looking for an easy class you could probably get an A in this class and learn nothing. If you really engage with the material though, you'll probably feel much more comfortable with art history / art analysis by the end of the class. ",

The material is engaging and presented in a way so that learning integrates fun. ",

Despite its large size, every lecture felt like a 12-person seminar-- while we were not called on individually, she encouraged us and let us answer as a class, and helped grow our confidence in the process. She LOVES Greek art and myth it really shows-- the passion she has for the subject is unbelievably high. \r\n\r\nFor a class that takes most of its students from people who read Percy Jackson as kids, it was great watching our casual knowledge and interest blossom when exposed to more advanced material like parts of the Iliad or the Bacchae. I felt like my passable knowledge in Greek myth and art is now highly developed, and I feel like I could confidently go into a museum and give a summary on most Greek works I came across.\r\n\r\nIt combines historical events with myth, and gave context to buildings such as the Parthenon in the process. Sections delve into topics that may appear on essays or texts, but they do so in an enjoyable manner-- one such example included going to the Yale Art Gallery (as half of our sections did) and describing a sculpture of Aphrodite to our peers, who would then draw what we talked about-- that helped improve our descriptions a great deal.\r\n\r\nEvery second of this class was a joy. It was held in a room without WiFi, but it remains the only course at Yale where I did not feel bored enough to check my phone-- I was interested the whole way through. \r\n\r\nIf you have ANY interest in writing, art, myth, or Greek history, take this class. You will not regret it. ",

I almost changed my major to art history or classics even though Im a junior! Shes amazing and its so great that we learn from art at the YUAG. Take this class as a WR or HU credit for sure! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, take this course. It is fun and you get to learn a lot about Greek mythology. ",
            "\u00a0Yes this course is great for an intro art course or if someone wants to expand their knowledge of the ancient Greek gods and goddesses. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially if interested in exploring Classics and Art History ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend for an interesting writing credit! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. You learn a lot about Hreek mythology and develop the ability to write well about Ancient Greek art. However, the exams are very memorization-heavy and the grading on exams is unfair and arbitrary, so dont take the class if you really care about getting an A. ",
            "\u00a0Greek mythology is still so important in our world today, so I think developing a strong backing in it is really interesting and relevant. A lot of people have a basic knowledge of Greek myth, but it was really interesting to be able to go deeper and learn the actual stories and the places and art that are related to them. The expectations of the class are also very clear and reasonable, which makes the class lower-stress, and I actually enjoyed writing the final paper! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially anyone interested in Greek art and culture. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the material is very interesting and fun to learn. ",
            "\u00a0yes, great for a writing credit if your not a big fan of writing/humanities and lectures and reading were entertaining ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Take this course! Just fun things to learn! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you like greek mythology, you owe it to yourself to take this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes it was a very interesting course ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any students interested in Greek Mythology. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but with the writing credit. It was overall pretty interesting, especially pairing artistic representations with textual myths. Many visits to YUAG, yet the lectures are sometimes hard to get through. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely! This was a great and fun course and is perfect even for someone with no prior experience with art history or Greek mythology ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Interesting material and fun professor ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0I thought that this course would be a gut, because everybody told me so. Its not a gut  but it isnt exactly too much work either. Expect to do just as much as in any other class, and its not too bad for a writing credit. The challenging part isnt really writing papers, but the exams. There is so much information to learn, and you have to write down literally everything that is mentioned in lecture in addition to everything mentioned in the readings. Get one detail slightly wrong or forget to include a detail, and you will get your score deducted. With that said, the material covered is really interesting and important to learn in order to understand western culture. Take it if you are interested in ancient culture and how it forms the foundation of western culture today. Just know that this class is a lot more art history than myth. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student, as it was one of my favorites here at Yale. The course material itself is already interesting, but everything from the lectures to the sections to the additional readings really help bring it to life. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Loved it ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but definitely be aware that your experience can vary depending on your TF. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Ton of fun and prof is a g. Really good mix of interesting myth/history and art. Get to go to the yuag for some sections ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I have such a greater appreciation for Greek myth now and how it is manifested not just in art, but in literature and film ",
            "\u00a0Yes it is a great writing credit with really interesting and fun material. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to someone who is interested in art history but might not be an art history major. The myths and figures we discuss in class are very familiar in popular culture which makes the class' subject relevant and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, and I have to several friends. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Greek Art and Mythology is wonderful, interesting, beautiful, engaging, complex, and quintessential to the formation of modern society and modern norms. This class should be required. ",
            "\u00a0100% recommend ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in Greek/Roman art, I would recommend if you need a writing credit. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. You can get a lot out of the course if you put in the effort (doing all the readings and going to lecture). ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! The content was interesting and enjoyable. Probably the best WR credit option at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if they're interested in Greek Art and mythology. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Interesting subject matter and relatively low workload. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this course if you were a Percy Jackson kid or just love Greek Mythology. It gives you an accurate picture of the complexities of Greek religion and how their beliefs were reflected in their art. ",
            "\u00a0It was an interesting class which wasn't extremely difficult ",
            "\u00a0If you need a writing credit or really like greek art. ",
            "\u00a0yes! It was very engaging and a fun course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you already have a baseline knowledge of Greek mythology, your mind won't be blown, which is to say there is a lot of basic focus on who the gods are/their powers. Still, I found it extremely interesting to learn about all the different art forms and versions of myth that contributed to Greek culture ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to someone who does not have a solid background in art history. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course if you are at all interested in Greek mythology or art history.  It is a lot of fun.  If you are not majoring in art history and do not need the writing credit, take it Credit/D.  I actually really enjoyed researching and writing my final paper, and had a bunch of friends in the class and always enjoyed lectures.  Having section in the art gallery half of the time or more is a huge plus. ",
            "\u00a0Only if they take it for writing credit ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the course is very engaging and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is interesting and fun. ",
            "\u00a0YES! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student interested in an introduction into the humanities. "
