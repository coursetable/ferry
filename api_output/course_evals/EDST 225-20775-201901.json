            "\u00a0Learned about child development and policy. It was a good foundation for recognizing problems in our early childhood education system, supporting accessibility and access to care. ",
            "\u00a0I learned all about what childcare currently looks like in the U.S. It was very up to date and very informational. The professors both know a ton of information and it was cool getting to learn so much. ",
            "\u00a0I developed further knowledge about the childcare system. ",
            "\u00a0This course changed the way I thought not only about child care, but about American education in general. Child care is one of the most important yet one of the least prioritized systems in our country, and this class handles the tricky topic thoughtfully and critically. ",
            "\u00a0I developed discussion, a knowledge of the child care system on a national level, and so much new insight to the problems at hand currently in our country. ",
            "\u00a0This class examines the child care infrastructure in the U.S, and the policy that supports it. My entire concept of child care has changed - everyone (especially those who want children or who care about children) needs to take this class! ",
            "\u00a0I learned extensively about the current child care system in the United States, including all of its faults, but also the incredibly hard-working staff who work tirelessly to help children. We also learned about the policy side of child care, and all of the politics behind it. It was a very new lens through which to learn about child care and service. Also, we learned about the distinction between child care and early childhood education, and why that distinction matters. "

            "\u00a0This is a great class. Janna and Jessica are obviously so knowledgeable about the subject and I think they struck a great balance of talking to us (so that we could get insights from them) and talking with us. The class was well designed and the readings were manageable. The assignments were fun to do and enhanced my engagement with the material. I really appreciated that they used one class period for us to meet with them one on one about final papers in lieu of a formal class section. ",
            "\u00a0I really like the set up. Each week a few students would present the week and ask us questions related to the topic/papers. I thought it was really cool to hear everyone's views of the papers we were reading and also valuable to hear questions people have which really add to the discussions. The professors do a good job of supporting this format. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are definitely the professors! They are practitioners and bring a real world lens to work. think the course could be improved through a case studies approach. It would have been helpful to look at what states are doing and discuss the policies throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0So strong. I loved the seminar discussion with both Janna and Jessica. They were both so inviting and I felt like I could participate without feeling judged despite my lack of knowledge in the area. So educational and great. ",
            "\u00a0I truly cannot think of any weaknesses - the assignments were well-timed and productive, the reading was excellent, and the class discussions were phenomenal. "

            "\u00a0YES!! ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student. I think the topics covered here are integral to social change. Graduating Yale without exploring education policy would have been a mistake. ",
            "\u00a0YES! Take this class! This is an incredibly important topic that quite honestly I'd never thought much about before, but taking this class has been a very eye-opening experience for me. Janna and Jessica are some of the most kind and intelligent professors I've ever had - the class rarely felt like it was 2 hours long. Workload was manageable and the readings were enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you are interested in childcare, the current system, all the policies and such that are working towards better, more accessible and affordable childcare, for sure take this class!!! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Jessica and Janna are not only extremely knowledgeable and thoughtful about the subject, but they are also caring and kind humans and it's a joy to be in class with them (and they bring snacks to every class!) ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. Everyone needs a chance to meet Janna and Jessica and to understand the child care area on a greater level. ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely! Anyone who has an interest in children or childcare should absolutely take this class. The subject is literally undiscussed anywhere else at Yale, and it is so important in so many people's lives. Truly one of the most interesting, insightful, and practical classes I have taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! The class materials were engaging and interesting, the professors were incredibly kind and warm, and the classroom environment was fun overall. Also, the workload was not much, so it was not a stressful course to be in. "
