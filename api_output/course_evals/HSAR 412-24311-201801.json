            "\u00a0This course was a really eye-opening experience in Mesoamerican and pre-Colombian art! Ancient America is often forgotten about and rarely discussed, and I was really excited to have the opportunity to learn more about it in the classroom while having the opportunity to interact with some of these rare objects from the YUAG collections. Without this seminar, I probably would not have been exposed to any of the cultures or history of the ancient Americas at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0In this class, we worked through different materials each week that Ancient American cultures used in their artworks. We also went to the YUAG to study objects hands-on and to look at the gallery space. This class will teach you how to examine objects for facture and process. The readings will expose you to the critical literature on the materials. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about how different materials are used and the significance of these materials to Ancient American art. I learned about differences in viewpoints between the ancient Americans and our society today and how to stay aware of this on an ongoing basis. I also gained a much better understanding of Wikipedia. ",
            "\u00a0Having never taken an Art History course that focused specifically on materials and varying concepts of aesthetics and value, I learned a lot from this more focused approach. I did not know much about the region or time period of concern going in, but the course was very accessible and I think I would now be more comfortable taking other courses on art I am not as familiar with. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my writing of formal analyses and expanded my ideas on the materiality of art. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the use of materials in art of the Ancient Americas and the political, economic, and religious significance of certain materials. I gained a greater appreciation for indigenous art and gained insight into how materials can connect cultures across geographic space and through time. I also gained a greater appreciation for Wikipedia articles and learned how to write about art for a public audience. "

            "\u00a0I really loved the interactive part of the course, such as how we were expected to handle and interact with objects at close detail, and how we took a trip to New York to hear from a leader in the field (Joanne Pillsbury). Professor Mundy is a great expert in ancient American art, and I think she did a good job of picking topics and readings to introduce true novices to the field, while leaving plenty of room for exploration. I also liked the weekly in-class writing assignments, as they motivated me to read assigned readings more carefully (!) and were a good springboard for discussion. ",
            "\u00a0It was great to be able to use the collections at the YUAG for a hands-on, collections-based experience. The readings were mostly very interesting and the discussion in seminar was always dynamic. I love that the work was evenly spread throughout the semester, instead of clustered at midterm and finals. ",
            "\u00a0A main strength of this course was the opportunity to look at many objects in person. I also liked the way it was arranged with one material per class. The readings were interesting and well-chosen. Another particular strength is that the quantity of reading was manageable, which allowed us to genuinely read them. The reading responses at the beginning of class were more helpful than I had expected, both because the questions themselves were a good way to process the readings and because it made us all actually study the readings and therefore gave us better class discussions.\r\n\r\nI can't think of any particular weaknesses, though it would have been nice for everyone to show each other their final projects, perhaps in the form of a short class presentation. ",
            "\u00a0I think the manageable doses of weekly reading and the in-class reading responses really facilitated discussion and made doing the work for the class a more pleasant and rewarding experience. Some of the readings did feel a bit too technical in terms of manufacturing techniques, but overall all the readings were very interesting. I also liked the varying formats of assignments in terms of the papers, project and final exam so that the work never felt too repetitive, but I think that there could have been more structured initial preparation for writing object labels or the final exam Wikipedia page. Nevertheless, Prof. Mundy's feedback throughout the process was very helpful. Additionally, I loved having frequent visits to the gallery as well as the flint workshop and focusing on a different material each week. ",
            "\u00a0Going to the YUAG is an excellent way of engaging with the materials, but we could have spent more time discussing the readings in greater detail. ",
            "\u00a0The course was fantastic! I thought it was really well organized, with a focus on a different material each week, and balanced extremely well student-based discussion and hands-on experiences in the YUAG. The workload of the course was really fair and not too much work but allowed students to really appreciate and think deeply about the readings each week and how they connect to readings from previous weeks. The writing assignments were challenging and diverse, allowing us to write both formal analyses and pieces for public audiences. I really enjoyed the writing assignments and thought they were productive by allowing us to explore individual pieces and materials on a smaller scale (through formal analyses) but also, in a way, perform a public service and write about art of the Ancient Americas on a broader level (through editing Wikipedia articles on relevant topics).

            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to another student! I think it is very important to learn about culture and history from all over the world, and this class was a fantastic introductory course into the way that ancient American peoples thought about and interacted with their environment. It was really intriguing to see the way that they thought about \"essences\" and vitality, especially as someone who was raised in Western thought and culture. I also thought it was a great way to take advantage of the YUAG collections, which are so close to campus. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would really recommend this class. It is an extremely interesting topic and Prof. Mundy is an excellent professor!\r\n\r\nOne thing I would mention to any prospective student is that the course is very structured and tightly organized, e.g. with in-class reading responses and a very specifically drawn-out final project. It was very different from the freewheeling, flexible seminars that I am more used to. I grew in to her approach and think that she did an excellent job being clear about her expectations and formulating everything to give maximum educational value, but check with yourself to make sure that you are not someone who will balk at this course style. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course! I did not know much about art of the Ancient Americas, but the readings are very accessible and the course has a structured approach with a focus on materials. The different kinds of assignments also keep things interesting throughout the semester and the workload is VERY manageable. Prof. Mundy is also a wonderful, dedicated professor and great to get to know! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course! Regardless of your background in art history, you should definitely take this class, whether it's your first art history class or your tenth, it will provide extremely valuable insight into art of the Ancient Americas, with a focus on materials. It's extremely well structured, and Professor Mundy really cares about students and is so passionate about the subject. If anything, just take a course that Professor Mundy teaches! "
