            "\u00a0I learned how to compare sister languages, ways of reconstructing proto-languages, and ways to describe the different forms of language change. ",
            "\u00a0This course strengthened my understanding of historical linguistics, including an introductory overview of phonology/phonetics, sound change, semantic change, regular and irregular types of change, genetic relationships between languages, language reconstruction, and sociolinguistics. I also learned what linguistic papers look like and how to write one. This course was a good survey of what the field of historical linguistics is like, what different methods are used, and how linguistics has changed over the past few centuries. ",
            "\u00a0Really learned a lot about linguistics methods and strategies as well as different theories. Very good and in-depth course and works at the right pace. ",
            "\u00a0This class covered different areas of historical linguistics and the types of phenomena that are most commonly observed in these areas. ",
            "\u00a0Basics of historical linguistics, but also a little bit of intro linguistics from other subfields. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the basics of historical linguistics on a large breadth of topics. Historical linguistics often seems to lend itself to a more mathematical or systematic approach to language, which I hope to explore more in the future. For example, many questions in historical linguistics can be answered through examination of large amounts of data. Thus, computational methods can help in this type of inquiry. I had not been exposed to this type of linguistics before so this aspect was eye-opening. ",
            "\u00a0I gained all the knowledge in the curriculum, which is to say that I learned quite a bit about historical linguistics. My ability to analyze change in a language became much greater, and I feel like I now have a sense of direction to tackle large issues in the subject. ",
            "\u00a0I actually learned a lot about historical linguistics taking this course. Phonologically, morphologically, syntactically, you name it. The homework also felt very practical and it really made you feel like you were genuinely doing linguistic analysis and research, even if it is just at an introductory level. "

            "\u00a0This course is very interesting and useful to anyone interested in diachronic linguistics.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, it is not curved and it is a lecture even though it is small, which makes it slightly less engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: If you are at all interested in the material, Historical Linguistics is a really fascinating course. You are exposed to a good breadth of historical linguistic theory, and the weekly psets are a good way to apply what is covered in lectures. The workload for the class is very managable, consisting of weekly psets (although there are some weeks without them), a few readings, and a single term paper at the end of the semester on a topic of your choice relating to the course material. The psets are a good length; generally 2 to 3 questions with multiple parts, asking you to identify the changes present from a data set, reconstruct words/phonologies, etc. Some of the psets include a short (~1 page) writing component, and it's possible to do each pset in a day (I took anywhere between 6 to 8 hours to fully complete each one, so not a lot of time over all). The term paper is a fair bit of work if you've never written a research paper before, although you'll have ample time to come up with a topic, write and outline and a draft, and do the actual research and writing if you budget your time well. The instructor came prepared with handouts each for each lecture and put them online as well, so it's very easy to review for the two quizzes. Manker also put review topics for each quiz online for us to study, so the expectations were very clear as to what would be covered on each. The homework grading can be a little harsh, but if the whole class does poorly, the instructor will adjust the grades. Section attendance is optional for this course, so you only need to go if you want to cover the material a little bit more. The textbook for the class is basically optional, as the lecture handouts cover everything you need to know. There's no final exam, so you don't have to worry too much about the class during reading period/finals, just the term paper if you haven't finished (or started) by then.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The only major gripe I had was that psets are assigned on Thursday and due the next class, on Tuesday, which made it somewhat difficult to go to office hours unless you started the pset the day it was assigned. The lectures are not enrapturing, but not dull either, and Manker did a good job of throwing in jokes to keep us attentive. ",
            "\u00a0Course was well structured and paced well. Problem sets were challenging, but enough so that you really learned the material when doing them and were even kinda fun. Lectures would get a bit tiring, though, but were still interesting. ",
            "\u00a0This course could sometimes be interesting but was otherwise very dry. While examples were given of the phenomena we studied occurring in real languages, I often wished it was clearer what the importance of studying these phenomena was in the greater context of historical linguistics. I also think the discussion component was kind of a letdown. I wished we had spent more time on discussions as a class, rather than just in small groups. ",
            "\u00a0The class was very interesting in terms of material, however it was so early in the morning that it made it difficult to learn. More drafts and feed back on our final papers with opportunity to discuss it with our professor. ",
            "\u00a0The topic matter of the course is fascinating, but the course itself was disorganized, boring, and non-interactive. Although this is an intro level course, it did not feel like one. Mainly because you should have previous linguistic background to succeed in this course. In addition, the grading by the TF was absolutely unreasonable and unfair. The strength is that the material is very interesting. This class only had 11 people in it, so the professor and TF should have tried to make the class more engaging and seminar like. ",
            "\u00a0The course was good at catering to the level of experience of students in the course. A wide breadth of topics was covered, which was helpful at giving a general sense of the field of historical linguistics. However, I wish the topics could have been covered in more depth or at a more challenging level. ",
            "\u00a0For some people, I imagine that Prof. Manker's strategy of giving us all of his lecture notes in handout form wouldn't be the most effective way to learn. We had very thorough notes when it was time to do homework, but tests could be hard without a careful look over all of the handouts. On the other hand, I think the workload was about the right amount, though it would have been nice if it were a little bit spread out. The homeworks were interesting, challenging but manageable. They took more time than perhaps the instructors thought they would, at least for me, but I really do feel as though they supported the learning. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course! If you are interested in historical linguistics, thinking about the linguistics major, or just want a fun and low stress class to take, this course is for you! I was expecting there to be more writing in the course, given that it was designated as a writing credit, but it was only the term paper at the very end of class and maybe one or two single page responses as a part of the psets. This class was very fun, and the workload was easy to stay on top of. The expectations are quite clear, which was also nice. I also took this class without taking the Intro to Linguistics course (LING 110), although I did have prior exposure to most of the topics covered in the course, so that may have made it an easier class. If you are thinking of taking this course without LING 110, maybe just learn what the International Phonetic Alphabet is and glance at some of the topics covered in the class, although the first few lectures cover all the background material you will really need. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely would recommend to anyone, even with no background or intention to major in linguistics. Very insightful course and gets you thinking about language in ways you never thought possible. ",
            "\u00a0I don't think I would recommend this - at least not at 9am. The course material is not very engaging, and half of the class was struggling to stay awake in every meeting. I think it might have been less confusing if the student had taken LING110 before (but that's not officially listed as a prereq.) ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in linguistics, this is an interesting course that will give you basic information needed to start in the path towards a linguistics major. If you are a non-major, take something that is more of a survey like LING 110. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely not. Do not waste your time with this course. It is very fascinating material, but the course is not thought provoking or engaging, and the linguistics covered in this course is better learned on your own time, to be honest. Barely used the textbook. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student who might be interested in historical linguistics or linguistics in general, but I might be inclined to recommend introduction to linguistics (LING 110) rather than this course for a better sense of the field as a whole, and for a more fun experience in class. I fear the content of the course might be a bit dry for those who have never experienced any linguistics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I feel like I learned an incredible amount. A lot of the time it can feel like an easy class (we don't go too in-depth discussing the readings, for example) but then you get hit with a homework and it takes a weekend. So you do have to allow time for the course occasionally to keep up. ",
            "\u00a0If you are thinking about majoring in Linguistics, take it. Very engaging, you will not be disappointed. Otherwise, you might want to check out LING 110 as this class feels a little more advanced (I took both simultaneously). "
