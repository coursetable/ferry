            "\u00a0I found the course helpful in many ways. However, I also feel like it could be improved in number of ways. \r\n\r\nHelpful\r\n - I think it was super helpful to have someone guide me through all the things that need to be done in order to conduct an experiment (e.g. what kind of data I need and how to get it, write a proposal,  IRB things etc. ) \r\n- The in-class exercise in reading quickly through some research papers and identify what they were about was helpful\r\n- It's nice to have to define what exactly you are looking for in your research and have an idea about what the outcome will be\r\n\r\nNeither very helpful nor un-helpful\r\n- having everyone give a summary and an update on their project every week. This took up a lot of time and even though it is fun to know what everyone is working on, I think once-a-week update from everyone is a bit too much. It's nice if you are getting feedback on your own thing, but I'm not sure I got much out of listening to everyone else that often. \r\n\r\nCould be done better\r\n- I still find it a bit unclear how students are/were being evaluated. At the start of the semester, it was noted that everyone would be sort of on the same track until after submitting the IRB proposal, after which things might go more quickly for some people and more slowly for others. Still, there were weekly assignments that were marked for 1 point (I actually don't know how much that is out of the whole evaluation thing) and it was not possible to submit things late. This means that even though it was acknowledge in class that not everyone might be at the same place in their experiment, student were still expected to be at the same place when it came to assignments. Maybe this didn't matter so much, but it was very confusing. \r\n\r\n- Some feedback in class came at a strange time. At a certain point, everyone had to decide on how many participants they needed for their experiment and submit that as an assignment. Two weeks later I saw a student getting a comment in class, during presentation, about the number of participants they meant to have. It was noted that this was not a good number. I feel this issue should have come up earlier since we were all supposed to have handed in our participants-plan two weeks earlier. There were other instances like this. \r\n\r\n- Instead of listening to everyone summarize their projects every week, I would have liked to do more practical things in class. One thing that comes to mind is  how to organizing data (especially if you are working with many files such as pictures or recordings). I think it would be good to help student adopt good practices in naming files and keeping track of which file is which condition etc. Also, when uploading things to an online platform such as Qualtrics it is important to name your questions and keep track of which questions are which conditions. This will definitely make everything easier once results are downloaded. Personally, I didn't have a problem with these things, but I can see how easily this can cause problems for someone who has not done anything like this in the past. Not taking care of how you organize data etc. in the beginning can become very time consuming later on, I think this should be prevented if possible. Just going through the process of making an experiment takes up a lot of time. ",
            "\u00a0I didn't expect this course to be so heavily project-based when I enrolled. However, I think this was a nice setup, because all members of the class got to see what problems other students were having, and what possible solutions there were. At times these questions immediately became relevant in my own experiment in the weeks following, and at other times they didn't, but it was nice to see how this process looks for different projects, different people, different circumstances, etc. \r\nThat being said, the weekly updates were sometimes redundant enough that the other students in the class \"checked out\" and didn't seem to find the discussion terribly interesting. I wonder if a setup where updates were shorter and there was a portion of class where we discussed a reading, or learned about different types of experiment setups or something, would help with this.

            "\u00a0It depends. If you have something particular in mind that you want to get out of this course, then yes, it is super helpful. If you don't have anything particular in mind, then this will be a stressful and possibly chaotic experience. "
