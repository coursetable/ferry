            "\u00a0I came in to the eighteenth century course knowing very little about the literature of the period, almost everything that I did know was historical and cultural. As such, I was immensely satisfied with any and all knowledge that I was able to acquire. Almost every topic we covered was a new to me. The combination of unique literary content and pedagogical approaches by the wonderful array of scholars who taught the course has given me much to ponder. I was genuinely surprised by how much I loved the literature of the era, it was often bizarre and much more \"modern\" than I would have previously expected. There were a few particular genres that fascinated me, most notably the masonic texts and travelogues; although this content is generally outside of my research interests, the course has provided me with new perspectives on literature and applications of theory to unique literary genres and historical moments.

            "\u00a0Strengths - The variety of scholars of the eighteenth century, each of whom presented unique approaches to the literature, history, and culture of this moment in Russia's history.\r\n-Engagement with a wide variety of texts and genres; I also appreciated that we incorporated more than just canonical authors, I felt that we delved into some very interesting, and very odd literary productions.\r\n-Examining more than literary texts (fine art, masonic rituals) in order to have a more coherent understanding of the contemporary cultural climate\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - It would have been helpful to have had a more coherent chronology that we could have applied to the texts with which we engaged, at times it was difficult to trace lineages and quickly establish continuity between works and composers "

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to any student interested in Russian literature, history, and culture, as well as to any student interested in the eighteenth-century more generally. "
