            "\u00a0Learned nonfiction narrative techniques, how to use constraints to one's writing advantage, how to portion time to writing, how to devote concentrated and long periods of time to writing, the benefits of disconnecting from the internet to pursue creative endeavors, and experimentation with form and structure. Writing about place and about one's own position in place was also a useful skill, especially for travel and travel related writing. Also learned about pitching stories to publications and how to pursue a career in writing. ",
            "\u00a0I not only learned how to become a better writer in the craft sense but also how to read like an editor. We were encouraged to read each others papers and give feedback, not only on spelling and grammar but also on co tenet, flow, structure, rhythm. Further more it dispelled the myth that you need a burst of inspiration to write. You can do just as well by really working and crafting a piece. Truly a lovely experience. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to notice. To pay attention. To take in my surroundings fully and be able to communicate evoked thoughts on paper. I have never been a strong writeror a writer at all, actually. I didn't think I could improve and I looked at essay writing as something that would be difficult. But being in a foreign environment, surrounded by brilliant classmates and under the guidance of such a passionate professor, showed me the creative side of my mind. We wrote every day. We bounced interpretations of texts off each other in seminars. We learned how to capture a \"sense of place\" and write about it, telling the story that every city, every street, and every person has and wants to tell. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to be a more effective storyteller, how to be more deliberate with word choice and narrative structure. I learned how to tell stories that feel true about places Ive only just gotten to know. ",
            "\u00a0Through writing every day, I feel that my writing became much stronger all around. My voice, word choice, and storytelling skills all improved through thorough edits, discussions, and reading for craft. The writing partner program also greatly strengthened my editorial skills and the way I give feedback. This course made me confident in my choice to be an English major. ",
            "\u00a0One of the most important things I learned during this course was not to fear writing. I often get paralysed by the pen and the sheer volume of work we had to turn in meant that I could no longer afford to stare at a blank page for days and give up on the whole exercise. I couldn't claim I was too busy or distract myself with the internet--I just had to write, and what came up surprised and excited me. I've never workshopped a piece before and the terror of someone not only reading my work but also giving feedback turned out not to be such a terror at all; in fact, it felt wonderful to share pieces I was proud of and have others affirm that. Reading the work of my peers helped me learn how to edit my own pieces better and I also appreciated how beautiful their writing was. I also really really enjoyed the course packet and the variety of travel writing we had to read--almost every essay struck me in some way and I'm so excited to have found certain writers whose style I love and who I plan to read a lot more of. ",
            "\u00a0My writing skills improved immensely. I learned how to notice things in my environment, how to form experiences into essays and stories, and how to write these stories in a way that feels true to the experience. I gained a whole new perspective on writing and art and how they can be integrated into my own life. ",
            "\u00a0Over the past month, I grew as a thinker and a writer. Admittedly, I didn't become a perfect writer. That's impossible, anyways! But, my editorial instincts improved dramatically. I see my writing, my peers' writing, and writing out in the world, with a whole new eye. More than any other Yale class, this course has given me the tools to edit (and I mean thoughtfully edit) my own writing regardless of where I am starting. I am a better editor, which makes me a stronger writer. Personally, the past month has given me the opportunity to look at the places of my past with a new lens. I am coming out of Auvillar with a whole new conception of my personal geography. This month gave me time to breathe and think about where I'm from, where I've been, and where I want to go. For this, I'm especially grateful. ",
            "\u00a0S247 taught me the value of storytelling and how to tell good stories. The greatest skills i came away from this program with were the crafting of voice and editing my own work as well as others' writing. ",
            "\u00a0I stepped out of my comfort level as a writer. I learned that writing demands an excess of work. I also learned to let go of a lot of the attachment I may feel to certain sentences. Good writing comes from being highly critical of oneself. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: immersion, writing skill improvement, intensity, writing-prompts\r\nWeaknesses: weekend trip assignments could be made a little more focused (especially for the later trips, since by then, students should ideally be able to go around searching for inspiration without being too directly prompted) ",
            "\u00a0I think the strength was the level of closeness to the students and instructors which really helps facilitate some amazing self exploration through writing. I think the one thing was that the weekend trips could be a bit overwhelming in combination with continued classes. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: one-month internet ban, remote (and incredibly beautiful) village, weekend excursions, Pilgrimage Walk, seminars, the course readings, daily essays, all students living together in a French \"gite\"\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none that come to mind (sorry) ",
            "\u00a0One strength is how immersed in Auvillar the course requires you to be. The lack of access to wifi and our continual engagement with the community forced me to be more present. In turn, I was able to reap more creative fruits. Another strength was the writing partner program. I had never received such a volume of feedback on my work before, and the extra pairs of eyes challenged me in ways I could have never anticipated. I also believe the hectic pace helped me evade potential creative ruts and exemplified to me that I can do this, I can produce so much work and not fixated on whether theyre good enough. One weakness lies in certain texts chosen for the syllabus. Seminar discussions made clear to me the impact Top of the World and the piece on Liberia could have, and I believe future students should have ample warning/context. I support the idea of cordoning off more controversial texts and placing them into a separate section, specifying that they are not model essays. I also believe future years schedules should always include a serious discussion on the homogeneity of Auvillar. ",
            "\u00a0Prof Kinder did an incredible job giving feedback and staying organized on such a fast timeline. Weekly conferences improved my writing a lot, and she provided prompts that I was always excited to write about. Seminars were always passionate and I enjoyed doing the readings. Being disconnected from the internet was a major plus of this course, as it allowed me to truly focus on my writing, as well as form connections with other students that will extend well beyond the trip. Some readings in the syllabus seemed dated in the way they talk about foreign countries, and I think the syllabus could be updated, regardless of who is currently in the travel writing canon. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Kinder was the best writing professor Ive ever had. The course was extremely well run and gave us exposure to great essays, while really pushing us to draw on our own experiences and write. The writing partner system was one of the best parts and the no internet policy was very effective in making the whole group bond. We got to see a lot of France as well and think really critically about our place as travelers.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the course readings could have been updated because their authors views conveyed prejudice towards place and people. ",
            "\u00a0This course has been operating under a similar structure since its founding (i.e. micro-essay to macro-essay ratio, seminar schedule, readings, weekend trips, Auvillar, apprenticeships) for a reason. I heard there have been adjustments here and there, butmore or lessI think S247 Travel Writing is perfectly structured. I could imagine my time without Prof. Kinder, Irina, and Tom all lending a helping hand. My one suggestion might be to increase engagement with the Workbook. We used it in seminar from time-to-time, but as I read through it in the final week (which, I know I should've done earlier) I noticed so many gems/amazing quotations. While I wish there was a little more explicit instruction to interact with the workbook, I equally enjoyed having it around as a reliable source of inspiration. This is a small qualm for a course that I thought was wonderful. ",
            "\u00a0The writing component of the course was as serious as the students wanted it to be, which was great. I thought the syllabus, though well organized, did not include enough marginalized voices. In the end, many students felt deprived of a holistic lens into place-based writing. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0If you like writing or feel like you would enjoy challenging your boundaries, this is absolutely the course to take! The place and experiences are beautiful, of course, but nothing beats the skills you learn from being able to grind out piece after piece in a focused, no-internet setting. The entire teaching team is amazing and you will learn a lot, and they take the changing views on 'travel-writing-canon' very seriously, so if the readings interest you in that way, you should absolutely go for it. Also, the course is lots of fun and you'll make lots of friends along the way. I'd say this is as close to a transformative summer course experience as you can get at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you are remotely interested in writing or learning to write please take this course! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to every student and it is difficult to put into words how amazing this experience was. I was skeptical at first: one month without phone/internet, in a tiny village in the middle of nowhere in France, and a writing workload that was stressful for a STEM major like me. But over the span of the four weeks, I was able to disconnect from all the noise and outside distraction, and truly connect with my environment, my studies, and my classmatesmy newest, closest friends. \"Unforgettable\" is the word that comes to my mind when I think of Auvillar. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to improve their writing. Because their writing will inevitably improve by so much. The unique living culture of the gite also adds to the dynamic learning experience. Auvillar, the Camino, Bordeaux and Albi are also amazing backdrops. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, regardless of their major. Choosing to use my ISA grant on this trip was one of  my best decisions at Yale. Many students on this trip were even STEM majors, and still found it to be an incredibly enriching academic experience. I believe the opportunity to disconnect and write is one that would not be very feasible outside of a program like this or beyond college. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone interested in writing! The internet blackout, the isolation, the writing environment in the gite, the wonderful wonderful course instructors...I really can't imagine a better intensive experience in writing. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Anyone who is interested in creative writing and is willing to throw themselves into the pursuit of it should absolutely take this course. ",
            "\u00a0Of course, I would recommend this course! The chance to get away from the world, to write every day, to live in Auvillar, and make great friends. I went into the month expecting to enjoy my time. I didn't expect to make personal revelations about my childhood neighborhood, laugh as much as I did, have fascinating intellectual conversations about place, and just enjoy my classmates as much as I did. If you open yourself up, this month can be (and was for me) fantastic. I couldn't recommend this course more highly. It was the best summer I've had in a long time. Plus, now I have two extra credits! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend S247 to another student. It is an incredible opportunity to focus solely on writing outside of the regular school year. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This course changed the way I view myself and the way I view the world. You do not have to be an English major to take this class. Everyone can benefit from writing about life and place. "
