            "\u00a0I learned about the applications and mathematics behind many different kinds of reactors, such as batch, semi-batch, CSTR, PBR, PFR, MCR, and more. We also learned about enzyme catalysis, bioreactors, and of course, rate laws. ",
            "\u00a0General overview of reactor design and kinetics, with some asides into catalysis, electronic microfabrication, polymers and bioreactors. ",
            "\u00a0A basic overview of the relevant chemical engineering kinetics equations and reactors we may encounter moving forward. ",
            "\u00a0Learned the basics of reaction engineering including kinetics and setting up and solving mass balance equations and design equations for various batch and flow reactors. ",
            "\u00a0In depth knowledge of chemical kinetics, reactor types, and reactor design ",
            "\u00a0more in depth version of the kinetics unit from high school chemistry or gen chem. learned about various chemical reactors and how they are used in industry (e.g. membrane reactors, microelectronic fabrication, bioreactors, etc.). The class felt more like a math class than pure chemistry, but I actually enjoyed that ",
            "\u00a0I learned how many of the important chemicals we use today are made and the general processes used. "

            "\u00a0Professor Zhong has the course very well organized. What is expected of you is clear, and learning is well-facilitated between the textbook, problems, and lecture notes. ",
            "\u00a0A pretty relaxed course with clear requirements and predictable workflow. Sometimes parts of problem sets did not really align with what was covered in class. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Zhong is the highlight of this course, the material itself if pretty dry but he is a great guy and good teacher who tries to make the material relevant and interesting. He does a great job at the end of the course in making connections to current research and techniques used in industry without getting too hung up on little details therein. The one improvement is that the problem sets should be more directly related to what we're covering in class. ",
            "\u00a0It is one the best classes I have taken at Yale. Very well taught, hard yet if you work hard you do well. The professor is not trying to fail you. I put it in the work, and did well! Definitely appreciated Professor Zhong! Such a kind person and incredibly smart professor. ",
            "\u00a0It's nice that you're able to see and work on the problem sets way ahead of time. The topics on the midterms and final are also clearly explained and expanded by the professor. Overall it was a very calm learning environment. I think one weakness would be assigning infrequent problem sets. Maybe its just me but I felt that if we had 7-9 problem sets instead of 6, we would have been exposed to more questions and would have had more study material for exams. ",
            "\u00a0Really great course. I think Professor Zhong does a great job of teaching it. He is able to keep the class low stress while still allowing us to learn a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Fun content if you like chemistry, biweekly psets are great\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The textbook is very bad ",
            "\u00a0Teaching was great, Prof. Zhong is approachable and clear. He posted lecture notes online, provided good explanations and derivations of formulas in class, always started class with review from last lecture, and his exams were extremely fair, as he told us the material that was going to be on it. ",
            "\u00a0This class is amazing! I would not change anything about it. Prof. Zhong is so friendly, stylish, and great at explaining new topics. He spoke in a way that it was easy to understand the importance of certain topics, too. "

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, even if they are not in the major, although most likely you are taking this for chemical engineering. It is both one of the easiest courses in the major if you put in the work, and also one of the most interesting. Zhong is great. ",
            "\u00a0You're only taking it if you're CHEME I think, as with all of our courses, so I always laugh a bit at this question. But unlike certain other courses in the major, yes, I would. Also, if you're CHEME and are an underclassman I'd recommend taking it earlier rather than later. Zhong teaches it at a straightforward simple/intro level and having taken this class, say, before PChem 1 and some of my Engineering Electives would have made these subsequent classes easier. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Great course and learned a lot ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you enjoy chemistry and doing math this will be a great class ",
            "\u00a0As an applied math major, I'd recommend the class to you if you have any interest in chemistry and want a nice breadth requirement. Not sure if the class is required for ChemE, but would definitely recommend still, as it sounded much better than other classes my classmates were taking like Transport and Pchem ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I learned so much about how chemicals are made, and I think it will change how I see these systems in the world around me. "
