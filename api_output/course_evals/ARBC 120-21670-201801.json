            "\u00a0We covered chapters 6-13 of Al Kitaab, and I learned a sizable chunk of vocabulary in both MSA and Shaami dialect. I also learned a wide array of grammatical points, including past and future tense, case endings (some), sentence construction, and verb forms. I was able to practice speaking conversationally on many topics, some of which were far outside the range of our vocabulary, and I measurably improved in writing, listening, and reading. ",
            "\u00a0I continued to learn vocabulary and grammar continuing from arabic 110. ",
            "\u00a0Basic conversational skills, beginner vocabulary ",
            "\u00a0In this class, I learned how to read, write, speak, and listen to Arabic at a high level for an elementary class. We learned MSA and shaami dialect, which was great to learn how to understand more formal and informal Arabic. The vocabulary is somewhat unorthodox but that's more of a consequence of the textbook used not a choice by the Arabic program. Altogether, you establish a very strong foundation in Arabic in this class. ",
            "\u00a0I learned basic grammar skills in the Arabic language as well as conversational skills. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to better my Arabic skills. The class tool my speaking and reading levels to a new level and bettered my writing a lot! "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Ustadha Elham's teaching is an incredible strength of the course. She made sure that we all had to speak during class, each day was engaging, and I learned so much from her intentional, immersive method of teaching. I appreciated that she expected us to learn both MSA and Shaami and wish that the curriculum could allow for more Shaami. The final speaking project was certainly a highlight of the course. ",
            "\u00a0This class was incredible, you really learn the basics of arabic grammar but then build off of that to be able to form more complex sentences and thoughts. The vocabulary from Al-Kitaanb wasn't always useful but the focus on learning some phrases in dialect was great, especially if that is the goal of the student. ",
            "\u00a0There were a lot of strengths. The course was taught in a way so as to facilitate learning and students were encouraged to engage in conversation regarding different grammatical rules and skills as well as discuss the multiple cultural aspects of the Arabic world. ",
            "\u00a0The course does a great job in enforcing the skill already learned and building off of them to ensure that students do not forget. "

        [
            "\u00a0Yes, specifically Ustadha Elham's section of it, if you want to be challenged to expand your comfort zone in speaking Arabic and you want to become more familiar with Shaami. The course is hard, the workload is extensive, but nothing is graded unfairly, and the benefit of so many assignments is that none disproportionately impact your grade. Definitely don't take the course if you have little interest in actually learning Arabic and/or are just trying to get your language requirement out of the way, but if you put in the work, you get a lot out of the course. ",
            "\u00a0I would. This course improved my knowledge of both formal and informal Arabic, and I developed key skills for reading, writing, and speaking Arabic. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0If you are dedicated to learning Arabic, then absolutely. You must be very very willing to do the work, which may be great at times, to learn and succeed. The class environment is fun and everyone is collaborative in trying to do well. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! It is wonderful to see how much tangible progress you can make in such a short time. It is also a beautiful language. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to learn Arabic intensively, then this is the class for you. It is extraordinary how much you will learn in such a short amount of time. However, you will need to put in a lot of effort. It is all worth it in the long run but there will be some frustration along the way. I, nonetheless, highly recommend this course to another student. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course specifically for any student who wishes to study the Arabic language because the professor is outstanding and truly cares about ensuring the students' comfort and security with developing their lingual skills. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The course and instructor are great and students are guaranteed to better their Arabic reading, writing, and listening skills. Plus students receive exposure to culture, which I think is significant to learning a language! "
