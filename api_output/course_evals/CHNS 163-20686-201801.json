            "\u00a0CHNS163 was not particularly different from its first half, 162, as it uses the same book and is also taught by Professor Su Wei. The only difference is that the lesson topics are more advanced, and deal with greater social/economic/political issues that China faces. I mostly took CHNS163 to retain my Chinese knowledge, because if I didn't continue, I would probably forget really easily. ",
            "\u00a0(extradite) ",
            "\u00a0I grew my Chinese vocabulary exponentially. I also learned a great deal about Chinese politics, history, and culture; specifically political problems that the nation is currently dealing with, as well as the underlying historical complexities that led to them. I feel as though I am now well-equipped to engage in Chinese political discussions and understand a lot of why China is the way it is today. ",

            "\u00a0The class was based on interactive answers from students, presentations, discussions, and so on. It made absorbing the material much easier, and class was never boring. The schedule was also set from the beginning of the semester, so we always new what to expect and there were never any surprises. The workload was fair and manageable and Su Lao Shi made the class something I looked forward to every week. ",
            "\u00a0No real clear weaknesses; high workload and structure is excellent for vastly improving one's Chinese. "

            "\u00a0I would say that if you are confident in your Chinese, need just 162 to fulfill some kind of requirement, you don't really need to take 163. Professor Su Wei is wonderful, but a lot of the main things he teaches in 162 are just repeated in 163, and so it may be redundant. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I loved Su laoshi as a teacher--such a kind human being :) who definitely makes time and answers questions when you have them. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I absolutely would. Students often say, take the class if you can, just for the Su Lao Shi experience, and I 100% agree. I learned so much, my Chinese improved more than it has in years, and it also is a fair and not-overwhelming class, once you get the hang of it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Excellent course material that is relevant to today's world and would be beneficial to anyone wanting to work in/with China in the future. Also, the instructor has excellent stories and is passionate about teaching. "
