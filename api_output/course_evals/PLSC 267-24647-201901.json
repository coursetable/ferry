            "\u00a0By the end of the course, I think I learned more than I thought I was learning while I was actually in the process of taking the course. You gain a surprisingly nuanced example of the impact of money on our political system in a lot of ways that you don't initially think of. I think most surprising to me was the conclusion that it after studying the topic for a semester, it is fairly difficult to discern the negative impact of money on many parts of our political system that is so often demonized by everyone. ",
            "\u00a0In this course, you talk about the role money plays in the American political system. You discuss the revolving door, campaign finance reform, campaign contributions, and lobbying. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the extent to which lobbying, campaign finance, the revolving door, and regulatory capture impact federal policymaking in the United States. I also gained a better understanding of whether this impact is normatively good for American democracy. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a much deeper understanding of how money functions in the political system and learned to challenge catchphrases about too much money in politics coming from media and politicians. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the policy making process, lobbying, dodd frank, campaign finance, and the way politicians are elected. ",
            "\u00a0We learned about regulatory capture, campaign donations, lobbying, and the revolving door, and how the various aspects of money in politics impact the legislative system. We discuss both descriptive and normative questions about the role money plays and the role it should play in government. ",
            "\u00a0This class challenged my prior assumptions about the role of money in politics. I learned a lot about the nuances of how money actually affects politics and decision-making, which was fascinating. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a focused, intensive seminar that dived deep into one topic. I gained skills in reading, understanding, and critiquing academic papers that attempt to study and evaluate a very tricky subject. Though I heard a great many perspectives on money in politics, I am not measurably more certain about what we should do about money in politics, so this is not a course for students looking for definitive answers. "

            "\u00a0Probably the biggest weakness of the course was that seminar sometimes felt like just a step-by-step walkthrough of the readings, and the discussion of how they came together at the end. This I guess helped if you didn't do the readings, which many including myself didn't all the time, but could be very dry regardless. I think it would have helped a lot if we had guiding questions and ideas on the syllabus for that week's readings before we did them so we didn't go in cold to readings and topics - topic that I wasn't totally sure of what they were until I actually got through decent chunks of the readings. The biggest strength of this course was easily the feedback given on writing assignments - I've never received such thoughtful feedback on assignments in my life. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course are that Professor Libgober is really knowledgable and cares about the students. The readings were engaging and the assignments were unique and interesting, but the class conversations were sometimes dry. ",
            "\u00a0This course had one of the most balanced reading lists of any class I have taken at Yale. I felt like Professor Libgober assigned articles that presented myriad perspectives regarding contest issues in political science. I also thought that Professor Libgober did a great job forcing me and my classmates to think critically about the role of data in social science research. We spent significant portions of class discussion asking whether various papers' data sources were convincing. Every other political science class could benefit from this approach. I cannot think of any weaknesses of the course. ",
            "\u00a0The strength was the sheer diversity of intellectual thought and readings we covered. The weakness was, I think, the amount of reading assigned each week and the lack of diversity between dry political science papers and other types of material. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: readings are pertinent and interesting, professor forces us to make our own thoughts and interpret texts, assignments are useful in that they force us to act in the role of a real policy maker etc. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Maybe a 5 minute break in the middle of class? The brain power to discuss these texts can get intense. ",
            "\u00a0The course was for the most part engaging. Prof. Libgober was pretty chill and let the class direct the conversation for the most part. However, class mostly ended up revolving around a close reading of the assigned papers for that week, rarely going more into depth than that. Additionally, the single-paper structure of the class ended up meaning that the readings for the second half of the course weren't really important to the class beyond intrinsic educational value (which is, of course, important, but ended up meaning that a lot of people didn't do the readings). It is also important to note that the grading gets much harsher along the way of the course, meaning it's difficult to figure out how your final paper is coming along until it's too late. However, on the plus side, the wide variety of potential topics for a final paper was really nice and gave each student the chance to write about something they were genuinely passionate about. ",
            "\u00a0Each week's topic was different and relevant. Professor Libgober is incredibly knowledgable and did a great job encouraging debate. He is a great professor and I enjoyed being in class with him. \r\n\r\nWe spent the entirety of class each week discussing the readings. I wish we had spent perhaps the first 1/2 or 3/4 discussing the readings, and then moved to a debate or discussion of larger themes. I also think we could have included more newspaper articles or other non-academic sources in the readings. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The syllabus. All of the works we read were absolutely stellar, and even though I wasn't super well-versed in the statistics side of things, Prof. Libgober made it all really accessible when we talked about stuff in class.\r\nWeaknesses: There weren't any glaring weaknesses per se. I would just recommend maybe using that 10 second rule some professors use where they count to 10 after asking a question just to let students gather their thoughts and have more people raise their hands/participate in class. ",
            "\u00a0As a strength, the small size of this course made it a good first seminar to take - I felt like I could challenge the ideas of my peers (and professor), and also hear my own ideas critiqued in real time. Professor Libgober does not let his own perspective dominate the class, and there is always room to come to multiple different conclusions about a specific topic. Furthermore, the lack of regular written assignments allows students to focus on doing readings and working on the final project. However, the quantity of academic articles throughout the semester began to feel somewhat tedious at some point, and I would have appreciated some weeks where we discussed book excerpts, news articles, or other materials other than academic articles.

            "\u00a0Its not a course that's going to change your life or define your Yale career, and there are some aspects that are fairly boring but its a pretty decent course where you'll learn something and you won't go wrong by taking it. Workload is pretty low, grading is easy. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The work was very manageable and the information was interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class to any student interested in the role of money in American politics. This seminar exposes you to the most pressing debates in the field and forces you to become a more critical thinker. ",
            "\u00a0Good class. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. For anyone interested in practical politics and a career in political consulting, its very valuable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes for someone looking to understand the role of money in politics this is a perfect class! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student in search of a fifth class who is okay not getting a ton of guidance on their final paper. This class is really what you make of it -- the classes don't do a ton to improve understanding of the readings, since it's mainly a deeper exploration of the readings themselves anyway, without much outside analysis or learning. ",
            "\u00a0This class focuses on analyzing academic journal articles. If you are interested in methods of researching money in politics, take this class. Be prepared to spend all of each class diving deep into the readings. \r\n\r\nThat being said, if you are interested in going into politics, I would recommend this class. I found it very relevant and the discussions interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The syllabus is great, the professor is really approachable, and-- the real kicker-- your classmates will be a great source of knowledge. I think anyone who takes this class self-selects in a pretty specific way (some people in our class were aspiring politicians, some started their own PACs, and others were finance yalies) which led to a really diverse class with different perspectives that really enriched the experience. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student looking for a good first seminar to take, or who is interested in the specific subject matter of money in politics. The content of the class is not mind-blowing, but the methodical way we examine and critique academic articles is a good way to build skills in social science research. Overall, you'll get out of this class what you put into it -- it's absolutely possible to pass this class with less than 3 hours of work per week (averaged out over the semester), but I would recommend putting some real effort into it, especially on the final project.
