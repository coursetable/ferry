I have the skills now to use statistical methods and approaches to analyzing data and results, and also conducting experiments that I wouldn't have been able to do prior to the class. This has opened my brain to new avenues of thinking and it has been inspiring. I've developed new insights by way of the analysis methods and only hope that I get to continue using these skills and this knowledge to sharpen the insights I can derive from future projects. ",

This however did not build gradually over the course, and rather came crashing into my mind near the end of the term as I approached the final project. I felt a bit like the exercises in the earlier part of the course were not as contextualized as those in the end, so my expectations were not met in the beginning, but were met as the course blossomed.

The videos before class allowed me to learn at my own pace, the pre-class quizzes identified holes in my understanding, and class time itself allowed for very hands-on learning. I was able to ask questions about specific points and learn from my peer's questions as well. The hands-on time in class working through problems helped solidify concepts. ",

I found myself constantly spending more time than I would've liked being confused about the material while watching the recorded lectures, which I could have easily averted by being in a class setting where I could simply ask and clarify my understanding. This is not a knock on the course however, as it was well put together generally. The one recommendation I have is to synch up the video slides with those that are provided in the course materials. This was not always the case and made it difficult at times to follow along with the appropriate lesson or slide deck. ",

            "\u00a0Mostly strengths. This class was very well taught. I enjoyed the flipped section - I found the pre-class quiz helpful, and I liked analyzing datasets with direct professor and TF feedback. The overall class structure was logical, and we covered a lot of material in good depth. The notes are helpful, although summary slides for different concepts (consolidating key formulas and concepts) would be helpful - especially because I will use the notes for statistics work that I do going forward. The exams and homework were very good, and the feedback was excellent. ",

            "\u00a0I loved the flipped version of the class, because it allowed access to Jonathan while using minitab in class for practice problems. This really increased my understanding of the software and allowed me to focus on the statistics not figuring out the functions of the program. "

Flipped stats is the most effective way to learn the topic and sets you up for success in all other courses. You can learn at your own pace, and Professor Reuning-Scherer is oustanding. ",
