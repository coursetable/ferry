            "\u00a0Immigration Ethics with Professor Diego von Vacano was probably the most rewarding class I had in my Yale education. As a committed immigrant right's activist and scholar, I was sure that I knew where I stood in the debate. However, Professor von Vacano was able to fruitfully make me challenge my not-fully-refined understanding of immigration politics and ethics and strengthen my opinionfor the benefit of my own activism and scholarship. Everyone who feels like they will commit a portion of their lives to immigration should take the course. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about immigration philosophy in this class. I learned how some classic philosophers can be applied to immigration issues (this approach is so unique!) and learned about specific immigration political philosophers. I was introduced to a lot of new literature. Theres no other class like this at Yale! We needed it! ",
            "\u00a0This course provided me with a lot of philosophy knowledge around the topic of immigration. It has given me material to use during debates and it provided me with different lenses that have helped me better understand why people think the way they do. ",
            "\u00a0The class provided very good insight into contemporary empirical debates surrounding immigration. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0We were always behind schedule. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were the instructor and the material. The weakness was probably the volume of material because it was hard to finish it all in a semsester. I wish we went a little more in depth with just half the readings, for instance. We also should have only had one presentation required per semester. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course includes the material on the syllabus and the conversations/debates. It could be improved by maybe having less reading material so people can focus less on finishing it all and more in trying ti understand the nuances of the arguments of what we do read. ",
            "\u00a0Though the readings were good, there was way too much of it. Everything else was fantastic--the professor, the essay prompts. The debates were a fantastic element of the class.  However, it wasn't philosophic enough, though that probably just speaks to the difference between ethics and morality. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Of course. If this seminar is again taught by Professor von Vacano, I highly recommend Yale students to enroll. Professor von Vacano challenges the conceptions and opinions you held about immigration before the class and invites you to incorporate competing perspectives and values into your support (or opposition) to immigration. He is a supportive instructor and very interesting scholar. I am sad to know that he may not stay at Yale and know that there is no other faculty that can fill the gap he temporarily filled and will now leave. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It was an outstanding class and I learned a lot about not only immigration policy but also the intersection between ethics and politics more generally. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class to another student who is interested in philosophy and immigration. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student. The professor was fantastic, the content was interesting, and the classroom style was engaging. ",
            "\u00a0One of the most intellectually challenging classes I have taken at Yale, would absolutely recommend to another student. Professor von Vacano pushed the boundaries by challenging us to rethink our ideas and brought me into political philosophy in a way I didn't know I could become interested in it. I learned so much that helped me to understand the theoretical background of why immigration policies exist, which is so important to me. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would if you get the chance! It is a very relevant topic and this class helps you understand the progression of immigration-related thinking. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, for students interested in immigration policy. "
