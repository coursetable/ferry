            "\u00a0I developed knowledge on intersectional feminist and queer theories. I learned a lot about the historical social positioning of women and queer people; the tactics used to keep them from full citizenship; and various strategies employed by women and queer people to survive, construct identities, and build a life either within or outside of mainstream society. I learned how to think critically about pathways to liberation and visions of how liberation will look in the future. ",
            "\u00a0I feel like I didnt gain nearly enough from this course as it was not designed as the introductory class it was tagged as, and I didnt already have the skills for an upper level study of feminist and queer theory yet. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a bunch about fem and queer theory- it was my first foray into these fields so I learned a ton. ",

Partially adjusted with moving some readings to the recommended section.\r\n\r\nHow could it be improved: First on second classes as a lecture style of feminist/queer history to ensure that students will have a simulat baseline to work from. ",

            "\u00a0I did participate during class discussions, but possibly speaking up more. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course was how intersectional it was and how it asked its students to think critically about race, class, and disabilities, etc., as well as gender and sexuality. The roundtable discussion was always interesting, as there were various perspectives, experiences, and ideas that were heard every class. \r\n\r\nIt seemed that there was too many pieces of required reading, even though Dr. Savci cut down on the original amount required. The discussion hardly ever got passed 3 readings for each session, but it was difficult to know which 3 pieces would be discussed. This either meant having to prioritize a certain number of readings not knowing which ones were going to be most important for class, or it meant putting other classes to the side in order to get through the entirety of the readings. ",
            "\u00a0The readings were interesting but often very difficult for a first time reader and in conjunction with the number of other chapters and articles assigned, it usually wasnt possible to fully engage with everything. I also dont think we really benefitted at all from having every session being student lead. Especially considering that many of the students were not WGSS students and that we all seemed to be struggling with the material, I believe we could have learned more with stronger instruction from the professor. ",
            "\u00a0The course was not designed for beginners, which I wasn't aware of before I took it. I think it was really good in terms of discussion but it wasn't super structured and I was rarely certain what the professor wanted us to walk away with. ",

There was an initial expectation that students would be familiar with some literature in the field, which was not the case for all of the class and made the course heavier. Make sure that you have time available to dedicate to the heavy load of reading. It may be necessary to do a reading a couple of times, because the theory can be very dense. ",
