            "\u00a0I got a real good understanding of how to conceptualize and write a scientific paper. ",
            "\u00a0I learned quite a bit from this course. A large part of the course focused how to write an argument based on how readers interpret information.\r\nFor example:\r\n1. How to construct a linear narrative.\r\n2. Topic position ....... Stress position.\r\n3. subject-verb position.\r\n\r\n This is something that was very new to me. ",
            "\u00a0This course definitely helped me think about my writing in a more concrete way. I definitely believe my writing improved. It was also a lot of fun to hear what other people in the department were working on and interested in. ",
            "\u00a0General writing techniques and strategies for grant/paper writing and submitting ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to be a better writer; how to structure papers; how to write more clearly. ",
            "\u00a0This course improved my skills to write scientific papers and proposals and I am also much more aware of possible mistakes I might make in writing. The principles of writing are also very helpful for organizing my writing at the very beginning and when I am editing my writing. ",
            "\u00a0Writing skills are very important for graduate students. In this class I have learned how to write a scientific paper from introduction to conclusion and abstract with clarity and flow of ideas to communicate clearly your findings. ",
            "\u00a0Effective writing - structure, flow, words and verbs. Helped a lot write better scientific, professional manuscripts. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how to structure scientific writing at all levels of organization ",
            "\u00a0I learned techniques for writing, which were extremely helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to properly formulate my ideas! Very useful. "

            "\u00a0Strength: Clarity and precision; knowledgeable instructor.\r\nWeakness: vague/missing instructions on Canvas about assignments, expectations, deadlines and opportunities. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths \r\n1. Group discussion sessions where students critique each other's drafts\r\n2. Writing assignments and instructors feedback.\r\n3. A clear design of the course\r\n4. 5 mins presentations were great\r\n\r\nWeakness\r\n1. The class timing could be a bit early like 5-7 pm.\r\n2. Include an assignment on figure making. ",
            "\u00a0I think the only weakness of this course was that at times I felt like I could've just read the book we were assigned for the course, and didn't actually need to be in class to discuss it. However, I did appreciate the dialogue, and think the course would benefit from slightly more structure and activities. Also, the time slot was not ideal. ",
            "\u00a0This course forced me to get a lot of much needed writing down on paper. The early readings about common pitfalls in scientific writing were particularly helpful but I would have preferred a shift to focus on our writing instead of engaging with the text so much. ",
            "\u00a0The freedom to write on our own topics of interest was very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I really like that the course involves a lot of practice. Although the workload was relatively high, I was quite grateful that I took this class and it kept challenge me to do better. The in-class discussion on the reading materials and peer-review is definitely helpful.\r\nI think the course might be better if it covers a little bit more on the difference in writing among different fields. For example, I guess there is some difference between writing a theoretical study and an applied study, and a mathematical modeling and a field study. I sometimes feel that some rules we discussed in the class were hard to apply to the specific studies I work on. Also, I would love to see more good examples and maybe spend some time analyzing them as I think this is a good way to learn. But overall I am very happy about this class. ",
            "\u00a0I think this class should focus on scientific writing for advanced students with data and walk them through the process. This will allow those students to present their work step-by-step and give them time to achieve an important milestone by the end of the semester. I am advocating against combining proposal writing and scientific paper writing in one class because students do not have the same level. Furthermore, there is no much time for students to review their work and receive feedbacks from their peers. It will be great if students could read their peers' work and provide written comments within a week or so. ",
            "\u00a0*Strengths\r\n1) Great textbook\r\n2) Dr. Staver's helpful, thoroughly constructed feedback\r\n3) Interactions with other students\r\n4) Great writing examples (grant proposal, manuscripts, etc.)\r\n\r\n*Weakness\r\n1) Class meetings could have been more efficient if students discuss in small groups, instead of having one student leading the discussion. ",
            "\u00a0I think the biggest strength is that over the duration of the course you produce a grant proposal and research paper. These were meaningful and useful products for me and the course helped guide me through them\r\n\r\nI think for some of the reading discussions breaking into small groups (rather than all one large group and working on the board) could have helped us engage with the content more. But I also liked the big group work identifying the main points, so maybe a mixture of both ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the readings and the group work aspect of the course. ",
            "\u00a0The instructions were very unclear for our assignments, but we were graded very harshly. There were also some aspects that changed, I'd recommend setting clear expectations and sticking to them to avoid confusion. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course, depending on the writing standards of the student. I think most science PhD students in EEB and F&ES could benefit from this class. If a student has proven skill-sets regarding writing scientific papers, this class can be overlooked. This class is more relevant for 4th and 5th year students, or students who is already analyzing data and thinking about writing. If you are in your first or second year, and are worried more about designing your research, rather than writing, think of taking later. ",
            "\u00a0I would strongly recommend another student (especially a non-native graduate student) to take this course. This course offers students an opportunity to learn how to synthesize complex ideas and effectively present them in written form of communication. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend. MY writing definitely improved, and I really valued the interactions I had with my peers in the class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course because I think it forces students to write, which we usually avoid at all costs. I also think that this course will get much better with more iterations. I would've liked ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This course helped me become a better writer. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to students who want to stay in academia, both graduate students and undergraduate students. Writing is a very important skill, especially in scientific research, but is a little under-valued in the education process, so this is a great opportunity to learn more about writing and get a lot of practice. That being said, I think if one already have something in mind to write the course will be most useful. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it.  Writing anything is good practice, in any case. ",
            "\u00a0I will recommend taking this class, especially if you are working on a manuscript. ",
            "\u00a0Recommended to the 2nd-year PhD students. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! I feel like this class should be required of all graduate students in our department, because of how important good writing communication is ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, it was a great way to obtain feedback for writing assignments. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend to another student if the expectations were made more clear! This was the first time teaching this course and there were many students so I'm sure that made it difficult, I bet the next time you teach this it will be much more clear. I still learned a lot so thank you. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to other students. "
