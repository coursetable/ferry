            "\u00a0This course gave me a substantial review of biochemistry and biophysics concepts that I learned in high school, but also taught me new concepts about research methods and biotechnology/genomics. I also learned about reading complicated scientific papers. ",
            "\u00a0The course gave a good overview of many of the underlying principles of biochemistry and biophysics that would be necessary to understand more complicated biological concepts. It also was a good exposure to reading journal articles, something that will also be necessary for a scientific career. Overall, the course is a pretty basic introduction to both college classes and also to biology. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: great lectures and presentations, homework really made me understand concepts\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: nothing notable except didnt receive feedback on what I missed on psets or quizzes ",
            "\u00a0The strength is definitely in the assistance provided-- Professor Koelle was eager (maybe even too eager) to ask for questions and we were walked through early assignments. In addition, the course is formatted to be forgiving-- every group of grades (besides the final) has one dropped score. While I did not use them, there were optional enrichment sections for underprepared students. Finally, my TF Asti Jackson was wonderful and kept sections incredibly interesting and engaging. In terms of weakness, it is hard to make a 90 minute lecture interesting when 200 plus people are in the room, and I often felt myself not paying attention. In addition, while they say at the beginning of the year that the class is not curved, it appears to be slightly curved-- percentiles are not standard and my grade may be impacted. Finally, we were never let out early-- we always had to stay in class until 12:50 sharp, regardless of whether or not lecture was finished. As someone who had a class at 1:00, getting out early would have been helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Lecture was impossible to sit through and pay attention the whole time. I would almost rather have three 50 minute classes. It was very difficult to be there mentally for an hour and fifteen minutes of biology being thrown at you, especially when its just slides and the professor explaining slides, it is fast and just too much to want to pay attention the whole time. ",
            "\u00a0sometimes it's difficult to get to class on time for the weekly quizzes - maybe move them to the end of clasS? ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include the understandable way in which Professor Koelle explains things and the \"Professor Challenges the Class\" mini-discussions in class that are a nice time to actually think about the material and take a break from simply listening to the lecture. Taking student questions at the end of class is also helpful. Weekly discussion sections outside of class are nice, short, and flexible in terms of time and help give you a thorough and clear explanation of difficult topics from previous lectures. Didn't do enrichment sessions but they sounded like they gave students extra opportunities to learn more.\r\nWeaknesses include the class size (about 200). Maybe split it into sections based on students' familiarity with biology? About 2/3 of the class was a helpful review of AP biology but I feel I didn't get enough new information. Trying to incorporate old info with new info made the class move too quickly. ",
            "\u00a0There are a lot of resources to help students succeed in this course. The amount of material and work can be overwhelming at times, though. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of the course include the discussion sections and the opportunity to ask questions. Weaknesses include the sometimes complicated homework assignments. ",
            "\u00a0One of the weaknesses of this course is that the lectures are 75 minutes long, which is quite a long time to focus on one subject. The discussion sections were also not very helpful. One of the strengths was that all of the lowest grades for any type of assignment (homework, quiz, etc) are dropped, so stress is minimized. I also thought that Dr. Koelle was a good lecturer and explained concepts very well. I liked that he would ask the class to come up with explanations for phenomena in his \"professor challenges the class\" slides as these really helped my understanding of the subject. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the concept of the weekly quizzes, which helped to force me to understand the material. Yet, I thought the grading was slightly unfair, as sometimes there would be points deducted without feedback. Additionally, if you missed stating a specific word, but explained the concept correctly, you did not get full credit. The same is true for the homework assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Koelle did a good job offering a variety of support for students despite the large class size. Concepts and expectations for the class were clear from the lecture slides. The material itself is also intrinsically interesting, and I enjoyed starting to learn it. ",
            "\u00a0For an introductory course, this was very well structured, perhaps overly so; it takes some getting used tobeing coddled in a Yale course. ",
            "\u00a0I think that Professor Park should teach the class. The one lecture that I really followed, understood, and learned from was the lecture she gave. I had no trouble paying attention and stayed focused throughout the lecture. When Professor Koelle taught, I had some trouble staying focused and I knew I could get all the material off of the slides anyways. Professor Koelle is a good teacher but I much preferred the style of Professor Park and the enthusiasm with which she approached the class. ",
            "\u00a0The strength in this course were it's offered enrichment sessions which I found very helpful, along with the additional resources on the canvas files tab. The weekly quizzes also forced me to reinforce all the knowledge I learned very week so that come the final, I was already prepared to a degree and only needed a little reviewing. The lecture slides were also amazing and gave you all you needed to know. ",
            "\u00a0I believe the quizzes ever week were extremely stressful & gave me a lot of anxiety, but were very helpful for learning purposes. There were many lectures that I was not tuned into and not paying attention, but because of the quizzes I had to stay up to date with the material. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: well organized lecture slides and study guides, thought provoking homework and quiz questions, annotated research papers to start habit of reading scientific research and discussing about them\r\nI did not see any weakness. ",
            "\u00a0Pretty simple and straightforward course, not much that needs to be changed ",
            "\u00a0It is a very well-taught class. I liked how the classes incorporated memorization as well as application questions. The use of scientific papers to provide real examples of learned concepts was very interesting.\r\nThe only thing I would say is that feedback on grades were sometimes very vague or not there at all, so I was sometimes left confused as to what I got wrong. This was fixed by going to office hours and emailing my TA. ",
            "\u00a0Liked the weekly quizzes and homeworks, they forced you to keep up. Also liked the curve.  Wished questions could be asked throughout class and not all at the very end. Also wished there were more prof challenges the class activities/activities in general during lecture. ",
            "\u00a0The class was extremely interesting! There was always help available and I really recommend the extra enrichment sessions. "

            "\u00a0Yes because it teaches fundamental biological concepts applicable to many different fields ",
            "\u00a0I would not, but it is required for the major. Just get it over with, it won't be the worst class of your life. It's just a prerequisite you have to get through. If you are interested in biochemistry, I could see you getting more use out of it. ",
            "\u00a0I mean you don't have a choice do you. lol ",
            "\u00a0take if you are a bio major or premed! obviously! because it is a requirement! ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take if you haven't had AP Biology. If you had taken AP Bio, take the placement test (hard to place out, but even if you don't you will still learn new interesting material). If you like biology but aren't in a bio major, try some of the no-prerequisite E&EB courses. ",
            "\u00a0I don't think I would unless you have a genuine interest in biology. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course only if you plan on majoring in STEM and the intro bio sequence is a prerequisite. I think it is too intensive to take as a filler course. Also, if you just have an interest in biology, but don't plan on majoring in it, this class probably isn't for you, since 99% of the people in the class are prospective STEM majors and this class is geared towards preparing one for the biology majors. ",
            "\u00a0I think that most people are taking this course because it's a prerequisite, but I would say that this course is going to be a lot more fun if you actually enjoy learning about biology. There are lots of cool concepts and things to be learned in this course that are often missed because people just want to \"get through it.\" I would recommend taking this course and approaching it with a mindset that you are taking the course because you actually want to learn it. ",
            "\u00a0Most students take this course as it is a major prerequisite for a lot of majors and pre-med, but it definitely wasn't that bad. I enjoyed the material, but there isn't really any reason to take this course unless you plan to use it as a prereq. There are many more interesting and enjoyable classes to take at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course can offer a lot. I only took it as a pre req but ended up enjoying it for its own sake. Even without a strong basis in biology I was able to have a good experience. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, unless youve taken AP Biology or the equivalent and arent planning to pursue biology further. ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend it if you needed to take it as a pre rec. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, great class, fantastic professors, especially Professor Park! You will not only complete a requisite for many higher level courses, but you will be taught to apply what you have read from the textbook which keeps things interesting and cements your knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed taking this course, after having no prior studies in biology, and would recommend it if you are considering a STEM major. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, specially if they don't have any Biology experience. For people who have already learned Biophysics and Biochemistry, it may be boring to learn again. But, for people who didn't, it is very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Necessary for pre-med, not too difficult of a science credit otherwise ",
            "\u00a0If you are premed, or a  biology major of any sorts, yes. ",
            "\u00a0yes, I think there are so many resources if you don't have a strong background in biology. I struggled for a bit, but TA's and classmates proved to be very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the instructors clearly want you to learn rather than stress about your grade. Also, the material is interesting and clearly presented. ",
