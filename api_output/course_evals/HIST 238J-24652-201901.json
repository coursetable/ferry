Professor Mazzotta was great at encouraging our thoughts and helping guide our analysis.  The reading pace was slow which was really nice, though we could have gone a bit faster and had more structure to our discussions.  But overall, the class was great. ",

The workload is very light and it's enjoyable and interesting to chat with Professor Mazzotta.  As long as you are engaged, you will learn and get something out of it. ",
