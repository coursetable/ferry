            "\u00a0Understanding of the frameworks used to understand phonological patterns.  Rules based phonology and optimality theory are both covered in pretty good depth as well as a lot of the more common patterns found in languages like vowel harmony, stress patterns and tone patterns and how these can fit into our existing frameworks. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the basics of two theories used in modern phonology-- SPE and OT. I gained experience thinking about various phonological phenomena and how to explain them using these theories. I learned how to look at a set of data, determine the relevant patterns occurring, and constructing an analysis and explanation of the phenomena, as a real linguist does. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the basics of how phonology is theorized to work through two systems--rules and optimality theory. Along the way, I learned about common phonological processes, and I think I developed skills of analysis.\r\n\r\n I also learned quite a bit about time management. ",
            "\u00a0This course sends you deep into the world of phonology. It is not for the faint of heart. You do some seriously hardcore phonological analysis, and sometimes you feel out of your depth, but most of the time you are well-prepared, assuming you pay attention in class. You learn rule-based phonology as well as Optimality Theory. There is also an end of term paper, which is a good opportunity to write your first academic paper in linguistics if you havent before, though it may be easier if youve taken other linguistics classes first. You do not need Phonetics I before you take this class, even though it says it is a prerequisite. "

            "\u00a0The class moved at a pretty quick pace through all the major topics of phonology.  The homework were good for getting practice applying the techniques, and the readings were interesting and relevant. ",
            "\u00a0The course started off quite straightforward but kind of spiraled out of control the last few weeks of the course. We could have spent a bit more time covering the later material of the course, or had it presented in a more organized and structured way. Also, if the syllabus were updated regularly to keep up with changes in our schedule that would have helped lessen confusion on which readings and assignments were due when. The course was helpful in that it covered pretty important and basic information about how to do phonology. The homework assignments were also challenging and helped solidify our grasp of the content and improve our actual phonological analysis skills. ",
            "\u00a0STRENGTHS: Dustin is a very dedicated and available professor who clearly cares about his students. The textbook(s) were also good. \r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES: It didn't always feel like we were building on knowledge throughout the course--it felt like each of the things we learned were interesting, but at the end they didn't seem to tie together in a cohesive whole other than the notation we used to write them. It would have been nice to maybe have a \"phonological toolkit\" we were adding to throughout the semester to tie everything together. ",
            "\u00a0I felt like too much was squeezed into the semester. The last few problem sets covered topics which were more conceptually difficult, though we didnt have as much time to cover them. The pace otherwise was good, but strenuous. ",
            "\u00a0The course gave a good introduction to phonology and helped us to learn major frameworks of phonological analysis.\r\n\r\nThere could have been more support for student learning; a teaching assistant would have been helpful. "

            "\u00a0This was my favorite class I took this semester.  As someone who is not a linguistics major, I thought the material was just really interesting whether or not you're ever going to use it again.  I think the class was taught well, and as long as you don't care about grades, Dustin is a great teacher for the class (he gives out pretty generous grades and definitely evaluates your understanding of a topic pretty accurately, he just doesn't give them out very quickly). ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course only if you are strongly interested in linguistics and phonology. Otherwise, the course might be too challenging and not interesting enough for the amount of work that you have to put in. ",
            "\u00a0If you're a wayward soul looking for a glimpse into the human language faculty and/or a social science credit: First, I commend you. Sound processing is fascinating and you'll learn a lot about it in a phonetics/phonology course, as well as a lot about how the mind is modeled. Def shop it. \r\n\r\nIf you're a linguistics major: It doesn't really matter what I say, does it? ",
            "\u00a0This course was frustrating to take at times, but I am glad I took it. Dont take it unless youre a linguistics major, or prospective. The grading process was opaque, which was really annoying. The readings could be really interesting, but often it felt like they werent relevant enough in lecture. If you want to learn about phonology, it will make you learn about phonology. If not, why would you ever take this  class? Also, its a prereq for ling majors. Just know that you have to take it seriously, though this may depend on the professor. ",
            "\u00a0This class is mandatory for linguistics majors, but also I spent a lot of time dreading it and it ended up being pretty fun! Not necessarily a great class for a linguistics dilettante but if youre serious about the field, this is a strong option. "
