            "\u00a0Had no legal background, got an overview of some energy regulation. ",
            "\u00a0I learned nothing from this class. There was no course material other than the professor telling stories that were not related to the regulation of energy extraction. The only time I learned anything from this class was when I was doing research for my paper. "

            "\u00a0I felt like the class fell below my expectations. The first half of the course was usually devoted to general energy concepts that I have learned before with the second half a discussion on these concepts with many tangents. I was hoping to gain substantial knowledge on complex energy laws but I feel that it was not taught in an organized fashion. ",
            "\u00a0did not align with expectations. The class was a broad overview of energy policy, rather than specifically talking about the regulation of energy, which is what the class is advertised to cover. For example, I know what LNG is and how it is shipped, but I still have no clue what the United States' regulation of LNG is ",
            "\u00a0About par ",
            "\u00a0The course met my expectations as a survey in energy law. I particularly enjoyed how the discussions we had were high level and about the real implications of the law. ",
            "\u00a0More philosophical and theoretical that I thought going into the class. ",
            "\u00a0I was disappointed with the course.  I felt like lectures were often scattered, and disorganized. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a complete disappointment, and I believe the University should seriously consider reevaluating this course or dropping it. The course was titled \"Regulation of Energy Extraction.\" From this title, I expected to learn about the laws and regulations surrounding coal, oil, and gas extraction. Instead, none of the lectures even remotely touched upon regulation surrounding these, but instead the professor would tell stories about the environmental impacts of different energy forms. Most of the students in the class are energy students and are very familiar with the general environmental impacts of energy forms already, and as a result this class was a complete waste of time. We spent an entire three classes discussing renewable energy technologies which has absolutely nothing to do with the regulation of energy extraction. "

            "\u00a0Better organization for educating students on law issues. The current format of going long dialogues with some policy relevance did not present a coherent lesson that students could learn. I also think some things that the professor presented as facts were false. ",
            "\u00a0The instructor did a good job making the course accessible for non-law students--I really appreciated that. I think the instructor could allow students a little more space for discussion in class. It often felt like a lecture. ",
            "\u00a0More guidance on paper expectations. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: 1) The set up of the class (i.e., dedicating a class period or 2 to each energy industry)\r\n2) The diversity in readings in terms of both perspectives and type of publication\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: 1) I think this course could have benefitted from more discussion - the diverse perspectives in the room due to students from many different graduate schools taking the course would have made for very interesting and insightful discussions. \r\n2) Check the links to your readings.  It is incredibly frustrating when you are trying to do the readings for the course and links are broken.\r\n3) Update the readings.  A lot of the news articles were 5+ years old.  There are more recent, similar sources. ",
            "\u00a0The professor would occasionally start good discussions requiring students to think critically about how to solve energy-related problems. However, these were typically not related to what the course should have been about. "

            "\u00a0I don't recommend it. Other classes give a better overview of energy policy if that's what you're looking to get from this class. ",
