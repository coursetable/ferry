A few things that stick out that I am constantly reminded of is how soap works, and why things get burnt. I think this class helped me realize I like chemistry a lot more than I thought I would, but I wish more of chemistry was like this class and less theoretical stuff. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths of this course is that all slides are posted and are good sources to study from and do the homework from which were very helpful. Weaknesses of the class might be lecture interaction. It is a typical lecture with the professor talking for the duration of the class. ",

It's more like a less intense gen chem disguised as a fun cooking class. Also, the lectures can be very dry and the criteria for grading not that clear. I wish the criteria for our final paper had been clearer and less vague. However, the material itself is pretty interesting, especially if you get a good ta like I did. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Yan needs to be more organized. The power points she uploads are pretty helpful but she often overlays the slides with tons of picture so that you can't see the information. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: made chemistry more interesting for those not naturally drawn to it\r\nWeaknesses: lecture slides had questions but not the answers to the questions so that it was difficult to catch up if you missed a class, or to use the slides as study material ",
            "\u00a0The course was pretty engaging since we learned about different cooking techniques that would use chemical reactions. People would present different recipes that had chemical reactions and it was pretty cool since we learned a new recipe. ",

            "\u00a0The basics of chemistry weren't broken down enough.\r\nThe connections to food weren't very strong.\r\nThe final unit on cooking, thermal dynamics, and kinetics made lots of sense in connection to food and cooking. ",
            "\u00a0The exams were mostly fair for the level of the class. However, the homeworks usually involved more googling than actual things we had learned in class. Class structure was a little hectic and it was hard to study because of the lack of textbook/ really clear lecture slides. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: the course materials are well organized and are highly relevant to the exams. \r\nWeaknesses: I have the feeling that I learned A LOT of useful things in the first half of the course, but then for the second half of the semester it was basically middle school chemistry. I wish the course is more balanced and consistent in terms of the quantity as well as quality. ",
            "\u00a0I wish we talked more about food and less about chemistry. Previous iterations of the course had live cooking demonstrations, which I'm sure would have helped students pay more attention in class. As it were, I still have no idea why I would take certain steps in a recipe--what kind of flavor an onion adds to a soup, for instance, or why we would use honey and not sugar in a recipe. The lesson on the Maillard reaction was particularly helpful, and more lessons like that would make the course more enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0Lecture slides were not disorganized but their layout was rather messy which made it hard to understand if you missed even a single lecture. I think the strengths of this class are in its content and structure. I like how the class opened with a personal question, asking us about our favorite receipe and how that was a continued project throughout the semester. ",

            "\u00a0The course covers a fair amount of material related to chemistry and cooking, but it's not always the best-suited for student learning. I appreciated having three tests throughout the semester rather than having just a midterm and a final, but the teaching of the processes and principles of chemistry was often done too quickly or too slowly. ",

            "\u00a0i think this class was interesting, but not at ALL designed for people with little exposure/academic interest in exploring in-depth chemistry. i found the course material to be frustratingly detailed (i.e. too focused on chemistry, with not enough focus on cooking/its broader application) which would detract from my excitement to engage with problem sets and exams. i would have appreciated much more of a warning as to how detailed the material would become, since i would have likely re-evaluated my willingness to take this class as a 5th credit during a busy semester. that said, prof. yan was very kind and patient with us, though i do think some of the exam questions has very little to do with what we spent time focusing on in lecture. \r\n\r\nfor the same reason, i think 9am is too early of a start timemany of my friends chose not to take the course/dropped out because they found it too demanding, especially given that they did not pursue chemistry in any other academic form in their yale experience. ",
            "\u00a0The topics addressed made sense, however the chemistry knowledge was much deeper than I was anticipating for a non-STEM student class. To address the topics that we covered it seemed as though there was a lot more knowledge needed than we could cover, so it kind of got annoying to hear Professor Yan keep saying \"oh you don't know how to do this.\"\r\nAlso, the fact that a lot of the class was listening to other presentations about the final project was really boring. It seemed like a waste of at least 10 minutes each class. ",
            "\u00a0The TA Zachary Taitz is amazing and Professor Yan is very approachable. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the curriculum for this course is very well constructed and put together. The organization of the material and the coursework assigned really helps compartmentalize all the information which aids in retention of the curriculum. \r\nHowever, I felt as though at times in the coursework we were given problems to solve that relied on information that we would have had to acquire outside of the purview of material covered by the course. Additionally, I don't feel as though there was enough structure to ensure that students were held accountable for keeping up and learning the material that was taught in class. Also, at some point after we had reached the halfway mark in the course, the curriculum began to include material that seemed just a little bit too advanced for an introductory course in Chemistry. This was a view that was also held by some of my fellow classmates as well as a few of my peers that were taking higher level chemistry courses. ",

There was n't much food involved with the class itself, but you will gain a good understanding for the scientific concepts and the class isn't that hard. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you are looking for a gut science course geared towards non-STEM majors, this course is highly recommended! It was a bit disorganized at times, but if you can memorize material, there should be no problems on the exams. ",

            "\u00a0I would only if they are prepared to engage with the material. This isn't a gut, and the tests would be brutal if you didn't study. But if you put in the effort, you'll be fine. I also think this class would be easy for someone who had taken AP Chem, but I never did, so most of the material was new to me. The vague instructions and grading criteria were frustrating at first, but I liked the structure of the class. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, especially if they had limited background in chemistry. I think it gets students interested in a subject they had little ties to because it makes chemistry more relatable. I never really thought of those reactions/ processes as chemistry before I took this class, and it makes me happy to be able to show off this knowledge to my friends or family in mundane situations. I think this class also taught me how to learn through large lectures, because there was limited interaction with the professor, I learned a lot through my TA, Zachary Taitz, who was very good at helping us memorize amino acid and peptide bond structures.

            "\u00a0As a non-STEM major, I appreciated that the course was focused on teaching the basics of chemistry and even included a paper as the final project rather than a test, but I also found the material sometimes difficult to comprehend because the pace of the course would move slowly for a while and then, all of a sudden, become very fast-paced.
