            "\u00a0This class taught me so much about trauma theory, English vs english languages, cultural imperialism, systematic racism and sexism, how to discuss tough topics, and how to dismantle or at least add to the canon inundated by old white men. ",
            "\u00a0Deeper understanding of recurring themes in postcolonial texts. improved writing skills ",
            "\u00a0In the classroom, I learned how to read literature not just for its face content but through a post-colonial lens/perspective. All the literature we read was colonial or post-colonial, set in non-western settings (with the exception of colonial Ireland) by non-western authors, which was a type of literature I'd never read before. We discussed biases, frameworks/lenses, generational trauma, \"economies\" of gender and sex and race, institutions. At office hours with Professor Newell, I feel like I learned how to write a new and more advanced kind of essay by discussing past and future essays and my strengths/weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0A survey of post-colonial literature. The reading list was very good. I also got a lot of great work at writing since we wrote four papers for this class. ",
            "\u00a0In ENGL 128, I learned about what it means to write about the politics of language, bodies, and voices. I became better at discussing large arcs of text, not just close-reading passages as I had done in most prior English courses. ",
            "\u00a0This was really one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. I learned to approach literature in a way different from any other Yale English classes I've taken--how to think about the legacies of colonialism, oppression, and silencing on novels written in English. I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone, whether they are interested in literary scholarship or simply want to discover new way to approach difficult political and social issues in our world. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how I can better structure my evidence and arguments in order to fully delve into the topics I wish to discuss. "

            "\u00a0THIS CLASS IS THE BEST CLASS I'VE EVER TAKEN!! I had lost faith in why I came to Yale because all the STEM and large lecture classes were not even as good as my high school classes, but Steph's ENGL 128 class made me regain my faith in my decision to choose Yale. This class ONLY HAS STRENGTHS, the biggest of which is STEPH NEWELL herself. She works SO incredibly hard and has SUCH a brilliant mind, sharing her intelligence and hard work in her incredibly insightful, thought-provoking questions to lead our class discussion. She cares SO much about the students, respecting our discussion points and engaging with our conversations. Outside of class, she even takes time out of her busy life (which includes CONSTANTLY doing new research and writing new books) to attend our acapella shows and art exhibitions. ",
            "\u00a0A major strength is Steph -- she's so energetic and fantastic and truly cares about her students (and is obviously beyond brilliant). I think the course structure could've benefitted from a little more historical context. We got a decent amount for certain books but others I felt I was walking in a bit blind. It might also be interesting to read some reception history of the works. ",
            "\u00a0Steph is AMAZING -- class discussions were so fun, and she is truly one of the sweetest, most committed profs at Yale. She gave me more helpful feedback on my papers than any other English professor I've had so far..! Take advantage of office hours, engage properly with the course, and you'll get a lot from it. ",
            "\u00a0Because we go through a book a week, it feels like we don't get to focus on each work as long as it deservesthe flip side is that we get to discuss a large body of literature. With Professor Newell's class, I'm not sure how well my essay-writing would have improved if I didn't go to office hours, since we didn't really discuss writing techniques in class (class time was devoted to reading/discussion). Newell had a really nice brainstorming session during the last week for students to workshop their final essay ideas, which was very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a typical read-a-book-and-discuss-it type class. We wrote a handful of papers each focusing on a different thing. The only thing that might make this course even better than it already is if it had reading responses. In my experience in other classes having to write these forced people to prepare a little more for discussion. We had some days in class where the discussion was a little underwhelming because people clearly hadn't prepared. ",
            "\u00a0I can't think of any weaknesses--perhaps a more streamlined syllabus (as in ordering the texts so that they build upon one another?). That being said, I think everything we read was incredible, and under the guidance of Steph we had some unparalleled discussions. ",
            "\u00a0The course covers works from a huge range of times and places. This can be somewhat disorienting, but for an intro course I think that's kind of expected. ",
            "\u00a0I really loved the structure. "

            "\u00a0Yes! It's a great way to fill the English core requirement by reading things you might not otherwise get to read in the department. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! take it with steph and you'll love it ",
            "\u00a0100 percent. If not for the content of the course (which was fantastic), then for Steph. She's the most caring person I've encountered at Yale, and she helped me grow as a student and a person. I am quite a shy person, so I'm not always prone to speaking up in class, and Steph noticed this very quickly, addressing it and asking how to help me out with it. As someone who has been incredibly intimidated by nearly everything and everyone at this institution, this really stood out to me, and I'm infinitely thankful for her reaching out. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class but ONLY if you're willing to dedicate yourself to finishing the reading each week (which is a new novel every week). Otherwise, you don't get anything out of the reading or the discussion nor can you contribute anything. It's a high workload, but if you're willing to put in the effort it's a very rewarding class. Professor Newell is fantastic, really kind and passionate about the topic, a great facilitator of discussion and makes sure we have a say in what we want to discuss as well. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to a student of any major. The class was engaging and the reading was really really enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student. As far as core requirements go, this course is extremely useful. For the first time in my life I have been challenged to question English as a colonizer and as an English major I think that's extremely important. It's important to know the legacy and power language yields and the politics (and oftentimes cruelty) that go along with it. This course is an excellent building block for other classes I've taken within the department, and I'm kicking myself for not taking it earlier in my yale career. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend ENGL 128 to any student, especially if it is taught by Steph. Steph is a phenomenal professor who cares so much about her pedagogy  for evidence, just take a look at the pages of notes that she brings into any class meeting. We discuss some really wonderful and thought-provoking texts, but what really brings it together is a thoughtful group of students led by a discerning and skilled discussion leader. As far as introductory English courses go, you can't do much better than ENGL 128 with Steph Newell. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. It changed how I think about my place in the world. "
