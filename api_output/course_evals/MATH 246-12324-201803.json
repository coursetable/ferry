Sometimes it was helpful, most times it was not, and that's because we would skip a lot of steps in class and when you do the homework you have to actually know and understand what the steps in between were. There's a difference between the computation being too tedious to write on the board so you skip some steps, and just skipping things because you think they are simple when for the average student they are not.

            "\u00a0This class was actually a lot better than I was expecting. Professor Hoskins is extremely friendly and is always willing to take questions / hold office hours / respond to email. Midterm was very fair. Problem sets were very useful for the most part (except for some proof based questions that seemed to be outside of the scope of the course). The only thing I didn't like was the extensive focus on solving ODEs analytically and ODE theory: I felt that it would've been extremely useful to have a larger component of the course dedicated to solving ODEs numerically. Course also moves really fast - it would have been nice to cover a bit more before the midterm so the second half didn't feel as rushed. ",
            "\u00a0while the earlier material was very clear and relatively easy to follow, towards the second half of the semester it was at times difficult to keep track of what we were learning and why. sometimes i forgot the point was solving differential equations but i guess i remembered in the end! ",
            "\u00a0In class lectures were well structured and problem sets provided good practice. Sometimes the problems sets had vague questions or opaque ideas they'd hint at that had to be clarified by follow up emails. Generally, I thought the exams were fair and the problem sets were good and relevant to the material presented in lecture. ",
            "\u00a0It felt like the homework assignments were poorly structured for learning which made the class frustrating. A lot of the time, the homework would bring concepts that were mentioned only briefly or would be taught after they were due. I think some people might have enjoyed how the class spent time on \"proofs\" but it ended up being pretty confusing for me because I didn't have the basis to understand the math we need to prove things like existence and uniqueness. (i.e Banach) ",
            "\u00a0This course was astonishingly poorly taught and require unnecessary amounts of memorization. It was disorganized and problem sets frequently required content that was not covered for weeks afterwards. ",
            "\u00a0This class covers an overwhelming amount of material in too short a time. It felt like I had to jog to keep up every lecture, and didn't fully understand anything until it showed up on a problem set, or until I was studying for an exam. Also this class is based on a lot of memorization which makes what should be pretty straightforward mathematical concepts, much more difficult. I don't think there needed to be so much connection between differential equations and physics, and I think if that material was taken out, we would have time to slow down and fully go through concepts and examples so that the most important thing from class wasn't consistently discussed in the last five minutes only. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: You learn what an ODE is and how to solve a lot of them. Weaknesses: A lot of the time you don't get the theoretical concepts of the ODEs explained to you, it's more of a here is the equation now here's the guess now solve it type of scenario. ",
            "\u00a0The lecture was unclear and very difficult to follow. Homework assignments were often somewhat inscrutable. Exams were far more difficult than the practice tests and sometimes didn't have much to do with material covered in class/ homework. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course could be a lot more interesting if it was taught more holistically. The problems that can be solved with diff eqs are cool, but most of the time we were bogged down in very unclear examples. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of the course are that the material is super super interesting and quite applicable to real life. Weaknesses are that I think the course as it stands suffers from an identity crisis in that it seems to be confused between whether or not it wants to be a proof based class or an purely applications based class. What could be done to address this is to simply have a higher numbered differential equations course that is targeted towards folks who are more interested in the proof side of things, though it is understandable that the department might find staffing for courses to be an issue. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I liked Hoskins. I thought he was fair, entertaining, and clearly cared about his teaching. \r\nWeaknesses: sometimes lectures were a little disorganized/ hard to follow. ",
            "\u00a0Theorem were not always proved, a lot of proof-by-example. The problem sets were do-able and interesting. The Midterm exam was rushed for time, but there was sufficient time for the Final. Good practice problems were provided. ",
            "\u00a0Pretty boring material. Not necessarily difficult or stimulating, but the teaching makes it hard to learn. Only take it if you need it. ",
            "\u00a0I wish this course was more organized. Sometimes we would have questions on our problem sets that weren't covered in class, or would be covered in the next week, which was frustrating. Also, sometimes when we asked questions, he would just explain it the same way again, but slower, and that didn't help a lot of people in the class. ",
            "\u00a0The course has many weaknesses in my opinion. The material is dry and memorization-based, and the lectures were disorganized and confusing. Professor Hoskins is often nice but he did not make the class clear or engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Hoskins is an absolute expert at differential equations, and is a nice person who is very receptive to student questions. Although a grader graded the homeworks, the professor graded the exams and did so very very quickly both times, which is much appreciated.  \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Professor Hoskins has a tremendously hard time communicating all that knowledge he has about differential equations to a class of students who have never learned differential equations before. The lectures went extremely fast, were super abstract, very hard to follow, and bounced from random tangent to random tangent without addressing the main points of the material that we needed to know. Professor Hoskins has a knack for taking a very simple concept and explaining it in such a complicated way that nobody will have any idea what is going on. The only reason I went to lecture was so that I would know what to study from the textbook, and then I would go home and learn it. The textbook (Boyce + DiPrima) is very good and very clear, so I would highly recommend using it for the class. The professor wrote all the problem sets himself, and occasionally they didn't even have to do with differential equations: they just shared concepts with something else we had been talking about. When the problems did involve differential equations (which, to be fair, was most of the time), they would often involve concepts that were taught after the homework was assigned, and right before it was due. So there was little opportunity to do the homework after learning the material. Luckily, you had to learn the material from the textbook rather than from class anyway, so you might as well do the homework before the concepts were taught. There were also never any solutions posted for the homeworks. Other than the professor's office hours, which were just as confusing as the class, there were zero support resources available. No TAs, no ULAs, no peer tutors: nothing. Finally, the midterm was incredibly time-crunched (median was an 82), and the final (though not time-crunched) was way more challenging than anything we had done on the homework - despite the fact that the professor had written all the homeworks himself. And the practice provided for both was not indicative of their nature or difficulty.  \r\n\r\nSuggestions for improvement: first and foremost, please slow down a TON during class, and focus on teaching the actual material in the book before going into \"fun\" concepts. Also, many (most) of us have not taken physics since high school, so turning concepts into \"diffeq for physics\" just made things even more confusing. Much more organization in the lectures would help. Out of the three elements homework, class lecture, and exams, the homework was the only piece that was fairly straightforward. It would be really great if the lecture and exams could be more like the homework - and also have the homework assigned only after all the relevant material has been taught. Please post solutions to the homework problems, and make help resources available like TAs, ULAs, or peer tutors. ",
            "\u00a01. Please provide reading in the syllabus. Class is sometimes helpful, but sometimes it's just such a blur that you just have no clue what's happening and having readings would be super helpful. To be real with you, sometimes you are so lost that you don't even know exactly what topic you are discussing so you don't even know what to look for in the boos. So yes, having suggested readings in the syllabus would be great.\r\n2. On a similar note, it would be great if the online syllabus was kept up to date since people can sometimes miss the first class of shopping period (cause it is shopping period) and therefore not get paper syllabuses, or because paper ones get lost (and we could just go green and save paper - just use electronic syllabuses). ",
            "\u00a0There was no TA or peer tutors but the problem sets werent too bad so that was fine in the end. Strength was the problem sets  they were interesting and covered the material well. Weakness was sometimes the lectures were just Professor Hoskins going over an in depth proof that sometimes passed over our heads and wasnt always exactly relevant to what we needed to know to solve diff eqs. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength is just its applicability. As much as the course may be tough or dry at times, it will help so much for a lot of stem majors. As for weaknessses, I think that some sections may be covered a bit too quickly, specifically the series bit, Also, sometimes the theory was a bit hard to understand because the explanations were too technical, using concepts that most people in the class had not seen yet. ",
            "\u00a0The course is extremely fast-paced with almost a chapter being covered in each lecture. Often-times material has to be sped through in order to get through everything. The material covered has to be cut down. There also need to be TA's and additional office hours or study hall for this class. ",
            "\u00a0Like all lecture math courses at Yale, it moves through material very quickly and doesn't leave much time for understanding while copying the material down. Fewer topics could be covered with more time spent on each topic to understand them more fully. Both generalized conceptual equations and examples should be given for each type of problem. Additionally, having a TF and peer tutor would be very helpful. It was nice that the class wasn't too large. ",
            "\u00a0This course was well organized and content was planned out well. However, lectures were almost always very confusing and hard to follow; our understanding of the content depended almost entirely on how much effort we put into learning the content outside of lecture. "

            "\u00a0This ended up being one of my favorite classes this term - if you're looking for a fairly interesting math class where you actually learn something useful, I would highly recommend ODEs. Professor Hoskins made the class especially good - he was always extremely engaged with the class and clearly cared a lot about our intellectual growth and success in the course. ",

            "\u00a0Probably required by whatever major you are, but generally a pretty interesting class. Kind of like a Calc 4. Professor Hoskins is pretty good but can get sidetracked by trying to explain things in terms of higher level math.  Doing lots of practice with numerical examples is key to success in the class. ",

This class goes way too quickly to understand everything they want you to know about diff eqs, but once you learn the principles, it's possible to see why it's so important. ",
            "\u00a0Not the worst math class I've taken at Yale, but not the best either. If you like math and don't want to do something like real analysis or discrete or abstract algebra, then this class could be good for you. ",
            "\u00a0No, not with Professor Hoskins. This is honestly the worst math lecture I have ever attended. Unless you need it for your major, you're better off taking differential equations in the ENAS department or just teaching it to yourself. ",
            "\u00a0Probably not. It was not particularly satisfying or interesting. The subject matter is essential for a lot of physics and math, but it is frustratingly not clear and involves a lot of guesswork ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would! I think that a lot of the material is super applicable to various fields (particularly physics) and really goes a long way towards building intuition towards applications of linear algebra and vector calculus to different problems in mathematics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I learned a lot and had to work without the course being too stressful. I thought grading, assignments, and exams were all very fair and relevant to material covered in class. Easier than some classes in the math major, but Professor Hoskins also expected his students to work and understand the material. He was also funny and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's a very interesting subject and Jeremy teaches it well. I learned a lot and feel much more skilled as a mathematician now that I have learned how to solve differential equations. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, solid introduction to solving ODEs. This skill is applicable to many disciplines. Of course, computers can do this now, but knowing how to solve gives a better foundation for someone looking to work with ODEs. ",
            "\u00a0No. I mean, take it because you have to for your major; but in its current form, this class is badly structured. The classes are too theory and proof centric and the homework and exams require you to apply that without actually seeing any illustrative examples in class. Yes, you can self-study all that from the textbook (thank god it's actually good) but that's not the point of coming to Yale.\r\n\r\nJeremy is a decent prof, but I wish the class was more about applying concepts and the physical and intuitive significance of what we were learning. The excessive theory focus made the class too abstract, and the classic moment during lecture was the prof. asking, \"Any questions?\" and everyone just had a blank look on their face because we just didn't understand anything well enough to ask something. ",
            "\u00a0Somewhat  I think ODEs are incredibly useful, but you definitely have to put in the work and learn some of it on your own. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend it to anyone who does not absolutely have to take it. It's a struggle to get through and not at all engaging, both because of the material and because of the professor. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely NOT recommend this course to another student, although most people only take this because they have to. If you do take the course, make sure to get the Boyce and DiPrima textbook, since that is how you will learn the material. The two primary reasons I do not recommend the course:  \r\n\r\n1. Although I feel bad criticizing someone who is a genuinely nice guy, a clear expert in the field, and is trying his best, Professor Hoskins just cannot teach effectively. You will get less out of going to lecture than spending 75 minutes reading the textbook, which is actually great at explaining the concepts. But you will still have to go to lecture, which will stress you out and confuse you, and then take very challenging exams on material you did not learn in class. \r\n\r\n2. There is not much reason to learn how to solve differential equations by hand anymore. Wolfram Alpha can do all of this for you, and it can even show you the step-by-step solution in many instances. The professor himself pointed out, quite accurately, that this class is just about learning which tool to whack a specific equation with, and the core material is just not that interesting, regardless of how it is taught. Most of math is beautiful and should be done by humans. Leave diffeq to the machines. ",
            "\u00a0Overall I would still recommend this class. It's honestly interesting to learn how to solve ODEs. ",
            "\u00a0Its valuable material to learn and at the end of the day I learned a ton about diff eqs and how to approach and solve them, I just wish Professor Hoskins tailored his lectures to be a bit more focused on how to solve problems instead of proofs of methods that were sometimes less relevant. ",
            "\u00a0The course may be a bit dry at times, but the methods that we learned are very helpful in physics and engineering. Unless you are totally fine with a semester of methods without explanation, I would recommend this class because it includes at least some theory, which makes it more engaging. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course because it is very important for many fields. ",
            "\u00a0I would not. I think you could get roughly the same experience on your own by learning the content from a book or website. I found the lectures to be mostly unhelpful other than in introducing what content was important for exams and future use in math and related fields. "
