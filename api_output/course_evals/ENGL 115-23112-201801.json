            "\u00a0I learned to close read complex novels and text (from the esoteric Nightwood to the \"trashy\" Battle Royale). I learned how to discuss these texts in broader conversations of modernism, modernity, post-modernism, and post-modernity, among others. Beyond actual material, I learned how to take pride in my writing--that literature and English as a convention is not something to be intrinsically understood on first reading, but is a never-ending process towards improving ourselves. ",
            "\u00a0Through taking this course, I gained insight into the big ideas of genre, regarding books as classic, modernism, and whether objective quality exists in writing. Through discussion and essay assignments this course sharpened my reading and writing skills, esp. close reading and formulating claims about a work. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about what defines genres and ways of engaging in literary criticism as well as how to more effectively structure an argument ",
            "\u00a0I increased my writing knowledge in regards to style and structure. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I would say I greatly increased my skills as a writer, by studying not only the technical side of prose but also the aesthetic of academic writing. Also learned how to integrate outside sources smoothly into an essay, discuss texts in manners beyond simply close-reading, and generally appreciate academic writing more. ",
            "\u00a0The course covered interesting literary and social questions and discussion was always engaging. In the essays, Seo Hee gave suggestions about style and brevity that helped me find ways to make my sentences efficiently communicative. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think critically about literary works. ",
            "\u00a0Greatly improved writing knowledge. Understanding of how to formulate an arguable claim, craft smooth transitions, and structure an academic essay. This course also provided a breadth of unusual literature for critical consideration, prompting lively and engaging conversation. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: The leader of this section, Seo Hee Im, was masterful in her ability to direct conversation, encourage higher modes of thought, and improve our writing. The course readings and film screenings were simply fantastic, and I genuinely looked forward to coming to this course. My one criticism lies in the accessibility of the many outside sources we read--they were often esoteric and as such difficult to fully explore. Overall, ENGL 115 was so strong because the professor did such an incredible job of organizing this course. I say this without reservation: I am confident that another professor teaching the same subject could not have done this class and this material justice. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are its small size and level of engagement between teacher and student. With only 9 students, we had lovely discussions and every essay assignment received feedback on drafts. The weakness is that because the majority of the class is a student-led discussion, it sometimes lacks organization, though I would be hard-pressed to find ways to improve the course. ",
            "\u00a0The books and discussions were incredibly interesting, and the paper prompts helped me become better at close reading. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course was very well structured and I would add more films and maybe adjust some of the readings. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: assignments well timed-out, feedback incredibly useful, peer review of work helpful, got to read wonderful books, loved final project where we get to choose our own text, great integration of other forms of media with books (Lynch, Ringu)\r\nCons: some texts inaccessible (Nightwood and to lesser extent, ATMOM)\r\nAs we discussed at the last class, would love to see music integrated somehow! ",
            "\u00a0The course is very well designed and I enjoyed it a lot. It might be nice to spend a little more time on sentence structure early on in the semester so students can try to improve their writing within the guidelines given. ",
            "\u00a0I think Seo Hee is very good at guiding the class discussions so we hit certain themes within each novel that we read/ movie that we watched. The assignments are very open ended so while it allows you to be creative it is a little difficult to gauge what is acceptable. Some of the novels we read are also too confusing and it might be a good idea to switch them out with other books. ",
            "\u00a0This was an excellent introductory writing course. Because it is a 115 rather than 114 course, my expectation was that it would provide solid foundational writing advice but with less time spent on specific convention and more on big picture solutions. This is exactly what the class did, focusing on how to write holistically good essays with grammar and syntax rules included but not as the sole emphasis. The novels we read and films we watched all seemed like they deserved a place on the syllabus, even if and specifically because they were not universally liked. It was a joy to be in class, Seo Hee facilitated excellent discussions and made sure everyone felt welcome to speak up about their specific area of interest. "

        [
            "\u00a0Yes--if Seo Hee is teaching the course. I cannot speak for other instructors, but under her tutelage, I truly grew as a writer. ",
            "\u00a0Id recommend this course to any student who enjoys reading outside the ordinary syllabus. This was a course where I looked forward to the reading (almost) every time, and actually had a lot of fun picking my own book to read for the final assignment. Luckily I had a great group of kids and a great teacher and this class became the highlight of my week. I dont know what the course will look like in the future, but if it resembles the class I had this year, id highly recommend it. ",
            "\u00a0This is ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It was lively and interactive, and I learned the most in this class over this last semester. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would. Helps solidify skills as an English writer, even if you're already well-versed in academic writing. I've been writing college-level essays for a while, and yet I was still able to grow as a result of this class. Seo Hee is a great teacher and it was a joy to have her as my instructor. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. You get to read good books and learn from a good professor. ",
            "\u00a0The material covered in this course is interesting, but it definitely takes some time and effort to understand. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to any other student, English major or otherwise. Our section focused on Cult Classics, which provided an excellent and endless source of controversial material to discuss and write about. If you ever have the chance to take a course taught by Seo Hee Im, do it; she gives incredibly clear and helpful feedback, facilitates interesting discussions, and is an all around joy to talk to. "
