            "\u00a0The Senior Colloquium was a challenge because each political science major had their own area of expertise. It's hard to combine those doing quantitative and qualitative political science and expect them all to give each other meaningful and helpful feedback. ",
            "\u00a0I liked how it was an independent study with an optional peer review section led by Prof Fang from PLSC 490. I think the 490/491 sequence is fine but should be supplemented by a junior year colloquium for students interested in applying a specific research methodology. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- Got to meet with amazing political science students who were doing very cool work and studying fascinating topics\r\n- Got to improve my own ability to work on long-term projects and collect, analyze data, pooling different skills I had gained from different classes\r\n- Enjoyed meeting with my advisor\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Wish the second half of the year had formal meeting times, would have kept me more on top of my game "

            "\u00a0Depends on your academic/professional priorities, other commitments during senior year, and capacity for long-term independent work. A thesis is a valuable form of learning, but so are senior seminars. Choose the senior requirement that best suits your interests and capabilities. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah, it was a lot of work but I think it was very fulfilling to write my own year-long senior thesis. (Also a great thing to bring up during job interviews/on my resume) ",
            "\u00a0Definitely write an independent senior essay! It was a lot of work (as much work as I made it, really) and Im so glad I did it "
