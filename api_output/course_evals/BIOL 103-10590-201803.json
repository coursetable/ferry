I think sometimes, the quiz questions were asked very differently from how the material was presented, which could be a bit confusing--that could be fixed if we talked a little more about what about the material to focus on (i.e. in what way we should think about applying the concepts). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the topic itself is very engaging and interesting. The one weakness will have to be the time given for the quizzes and final. Each question on the quiz requires thorough thinking and analysis and the time given just isn't enough to do that. ",

It's a small detail but I felt it made a huge difference in how manageable or unmanageable the course was. I also felt like certain complicated concepts like pattern formation and transgenics were not fully and clearly explained in either section or lecture (only finally in enrichment), and that in some cases, this was because it was unclear which details we needed to know.

            "\u00a0The course felt like BIOL 101 in that it was well organized. The quizzes made sure that we knew what to expect on the final, and all deadlines were clear for the homework assignments. I did feel that sometimes more complicated concepts (like epistasis) were rushed, and some quiz questions were difficult solely because the wording was weird or purposefully tricky, but the time crunch meant there was no time to ask someone for clarification. I also started out enjoying the homework assignment (even though it took me a couple weeks and therefore lots of re-writing to chose a gene and process to write about), and then slowly started to dislike it when I was made to realize that what had seemed like an open-ended exploratory assignment was not. ",

I often did not receive clear feedback for deductions on assignments.\r\n\r\nThe quizzes were poorly worded and misleading. They were tailored to very specific aspects of biology. Often answers expected knowledge that was not covered in lecture (based on my own experience and the experiences of many of my peers. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course is that the material is interesting and engaging, especially when we discuss real-world applications and what kinds of diseases or conditions can occur through errors in development and genetics.\r\nA weakness is that the course does not provide sufficient help in terms of teaching students to read and discuss scientific papers, and in terms of supplying practice questions for what I would consider \"trickier\" questions in this specific biology module. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: generally well-taught, good diversity of material\r\nWeaknesses: scientific paper is a good idea, but should be more specific or narrow in focus ",

            "\u00a0This course is a good overview of the principles of genetics as well as development, but it tends to lack the basic information necessary to clarify big questions. For example, many of the developmental processes that were taught were animal-specific, but sometimes this wasn't completely clear during the lecture. This course also seemed to have discrepancies between the material taught and the quiz questions, which made it tricky for students to do well even after studying the material given. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Irish taught well & Professor Lin is a great course coordinator who helps ensure the modules all run smoothly. Piazza was a really great tool for asking questions and beginning discussions. However, the weekly quizzes were usually a time crunch so they were harder than expected, and the final was definitely a time crunch for me. I think that if we had practice questions, that would have helped a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Strength - learning interesting biology. Weakness - it is too specific. I wish I learned more about the broader scope of biology rather than random signaling pathways. The quizzes were designed to be tricky, not helpful ",
            "\u00a0Professor Irish is a good instructor, and her decision to ground genetics in the context of developmental biology made the course material engaging, refreshing, and interesting with each lecture. She also emphasized experimental techniques and predicting phenotypes from experiments, which I had never been trained to do before in a class setting, and absolutely adored. For example, given information X and Y, we had to predict what would happen if Y was knocked out, or what would happen if X were ectopically expressed in a Y mutant. This kind of thinking is valuable to any budding scientist, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. In terms of weaknesses, the homework sounds cool --- writing a research proposal to study a gene! --- but it's so open-ended to the point of a vague nature that most students spent 6-8 hours a week writing the new section of the proposal because there were so many dead ends and false paths to be encountered. I think the homework could be better structured in the beginning (more guidance?) such that it does not disproportionately bog down a student's homework workload. ",
            "\u00a0I found the distinction between memorizing and understanding the broader concepts of examples arbritrary and quite unclear. A clearer delineation of facts to memorize and examples to generally understand would improve the course experience for Bio 103ers. I found the quizzes to be quite stressful and time rushed. While discussion section journal club provided an interesting application of the topics in class, the expectations for the homework assignments varied substantially for each TF. \r\nHowever, overall I enjoyed Prof Irishs teaching style.

            "\u00a0The weaknesses of this course include a lot of assignments, that may take 18 hours a week, and do not have any relationship to the course being taught. Also, the lectures are very fast-paced and assume you have a strong background in genetics. The quizzes are not related to the lecture material as much as Biol 101-102, so the only way to do well on the quizzes is to know the tricks and be able to think very fast. But unfortunately, no sample questions or homework questions are given. ",
            "\u00a0I like the organization of the course and the lectures were done in an order that made sense. The only thing is that some of the topics we covered seemed very specific to certain processes and we had to memorize specific aspects of them (such as knowing whether bicoid is concentrated posteriorly or anteriorly) which didnt seem entirely useful especially for a course that is suppposed to be an introductory course.

I found that there were many times during lectures that I would stop paying attention or lose focus because the material wasn't really presented in an engaging way. I also wish we had practice questions for the final exam; instead, we were just expected to review the quizzes to get a sense of the format of the questions, but I think it would have been very helpful to have a practice exam at our disposal so we could truly get a feeling for the styles of questions on the exam and how long it would be, instead of just winging it when we got to the exam. \r\n\r\nI liked how our homework assignments were all parts of a grant proposal, with the final assignment culminating into a mini grant proposal, because I think that for any student interested in scientific research, being able to write a grant proposal is an essential skill to have. While the assignments were very condensed versions of what a grant proposal would actually entail, I think that it was good exposure to the general parts that go into a grant proposal. I also liked how we had weekly quizzes because it made me stay on top of the material and get a good sense of the parts that I struggled with more than others, so I could better study for the final exam and learn from the mistakes I made in certain aspects of the material.

Truly, the homeworks for this class are the most poorly designed homeworks i have ever experienced at yale. The guidelines are somehow too narrow and too broad. Most people do alright on the hws but the greif stress and overall nightmare that these homeworks bring on are horrific. ",

Prof. Lin is also great! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The homework assignments were a little too vague and sometimes it felt like not all expectations were laid out. Lecture was sometimes confusing and I wish that the study guides did more to go over the content of each lecture. My biggest issue with the class was the often vague wording on the quizzes. Sometimes I felt like I lost points just because interpreted poorly worded questions incorrectly. Lastly, I think the final is weighted way too heavily (equivalent to all quizzes combined??) ",

There would be things that we would just quickly go over and I didn't fully understand them but felt nervous raising my hand in front of everyone to ask for clarification. I wish that we went over topics from class more in section instead of reading new papers. ",

            "\u00a0The class was generally decently organized and I learned the material well. However, the research proposal project was a huge time drain and not particularly useful in any way, and I feel that we would have been better served by homework assignments which reinforced lecture material. ",
            "\u00a0This course offers an a solid introduction to genetics and development. It is fairly comprehensive, and the content is generally interesting. Weaknesses of this course are the organization of the lectures, which often feel like they jump across multiple topics without clear reasons for why they are being covered in the same lecture. In addition, the course homework is essentially one assignment spread out over five weeks--this has both the advantage of helping you learn something new but also can take an inordinately large amount of time. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses is that the lectures, homework assignments, and discussion sections all felt very disconnected and it felt like I was taking three separate courses instead of one. I would've liked practice questions before quizzes to get an idea of what the quizzes would be like (since the homework did not deal with the lecture material at all) ",

We brush over concepts that end up being the core of an exam and spend way too much time on topics that are never tested. The main concepts need to be emphasized.

Emphasize the most important topics that can be used to make us think more like scientists. the exams and quizzes were worded so poorly that you could never know what answer the instructor wanted.

NOT ENOUGH TIME ON THE QUIZZES. PLEASE, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. WRITE SHORTER QUIZZES, OR ALLOT 20-25 MINUTES PER QUIZ. 15 MINUTES FOR THOSE THINGS WAS NOT FAIR TO STUDENTS WHO CAN'T WRITE QUICKLY AND DID NOT GIVE ADEQUATE TIME FOR STUDENTS TO DEMONSTRATE THEIR KNOWLEDGE! Some students need a few more minutes to get to the right answer than other students... they should have the opportunity to demonstrate their capabilities in a fair environment. \r\n\r\nThe other thing is -- I appreciate the fact that this class has a lot of \"getting students to see what real science looks like\" -type of elements to it. But a balance must be struck between giving students adequate time during discussion section to get the help/review they need and introducing new (and even more confusing) content. The discussion sections are structured like \"journal clubs,\" which is cool in some ways, but there were weeks where I was so lost on the content and really just would have appreciated a \"recitation/review-style\" section with some additional practice problems similar to what we see on quizzes.

This was reinforced by section and the homework assignments. Also, while the weekly quizzes were annoying at the time, they definitely helped reinforce the concepts and made studying for the final much easier. \r\n\r\nI thought that this course was often weak in terms of organization and clarity of lectures.

Another weakness is that we flew through the material so quickly during lecture that questions remained unanswered and explanations remained unclear. Furthermore, we were given inadequate time to complete the quizzes and final exam: many of my classmates and I did not even finish, even though we knew the material. ",

I think doing one less question, or five more minutes would be more fair. Overall, I found the subject matter interesting, and this was my favorite so far of the intro biology sequence ",

Per usual, the history behind most of the discoveries made was centered around White men and neglected to center the viewpoints of people of color. For example, the epigenetics lecture would have been a perfect place to discuss environmental trauma due to racism and sexism, but not much was said. ",

For such a student, being walked through the different resources available (e.g. PubMed) and the process of writing a proposal would be very helpful.

I could explain each idea superficially, but I would not be able to answer most in-depth questions about the course material. I also strongly disliked the fact that we received no practice questions for the exams and quizzes--I personally think it would have been good practice material for me to better understand the lecture material. Plus the homework (which in previous classes was used to reinforce lecture concepts) was instead dedicated to teaching students about writing a scientific proposal, so outside of individual studying for assessments, students received little opportunity to practice their understanding of this type of biology.

I really enjoyed the thinking and research required to design a worthwhile experiment; however, the expectations from my TA were higher than what I could reach given the tools I was given.  It seemed like my TA expected me to understand and use biological techniques I had never used of in my proposal.  No matter what I did with the resources available to me, it never was enough for my TA.  The requirement for sources was 2-3 for just the introduction section.  I had 8 sources to support my various claims, but somehow my TA told me that I should do even broader research.  This was absurd not only considering that the expectation was about 3 sources but also considering that the page limit was 1 page.  This pattern of high expectations not matching what was presented on the direction with a small page limit considering what was expected continues throughout the writing process.  I think it depends largely on your TA, but my gosh this class is the reason I got sick the first few weeks of school. ",

I did think it focused too much on model organisms. I really wanted to learn and visualize human development and was disappointed to learn mostly about fruit flies and mice (even though they undergo the same development and it's easier to use model organisms). ",
            "\u00a0Some points in lecture were tough to follow, this could be circumvented by a higher pace to pack in more background information for the question being investigated, jargon, etc. Clarifying the details essentially.

That being said, Professor Irish does a great job teaching the material and it's overall a decent course, particularly as an intro for someone with minimal background in biology and research. For such a student, being walked through the different resources available (e.g. PubMed) and the process of writing a proposal would be very helpful. Unfortunately, this also means that a lot of the work is a bit tedious for those who already have experience writing research proposals or who already have a fair amount of background in biology. All in all, if you have to take this course, taking it with Professor Irish is the way to go. ",
            "\u00a0Not unless you need it. ",
            "\u00a0Only if you need the course for a major or other requirement. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely not. Do not take this course unless you have to  it is taught badly, has no resources, and does not try to facilitate student learning. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you would like to be challenged and want to learn more about research methods in biology. ",
            "\u00a0For a requirement, or if you have a particular interest in developmental biology. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it, but only to people interested in animal development. I think it is too model organism oriented to be widely enjoyed by anyone interested to learn about embryo and fetus development. ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend this class to someone who needs it for their major or pre-professional track. It's not a bad class by any means, but I don't think this class would be enjoyable unless you have a specific interest in biology. "
