            "\u00a0I gained a greater facility with German language structures, speaking, and writing. In addition, I learned about various topic in German culture that are relevant for basic communication in German. ",
            "\u00a0I got L2 credit which is required for graduation so....also I do feel like my German improved. ",
            "\u00a0Got a better sense of the language. ",
            "\u00a0I learned foundational German grammar and vocabulary. ",
            "\u00a0I strengthened my command of German, and particularly expanded my understanding of cases in German grammar. ",
            "\u00a0I have lernt more vocabs and my grammar is more solid now. "

        [
            "\u00a0The class was excellent overall. The only suggestion I have is as follows: to improve the class I would devote a little more time to review so students have more repeated contact over time with, say, adjective formation or sentence structure. For instance, while working on material from Chapter 12 (sentence structure for weil, damit, um...zu) we could spend maybe 15-20 minutes one class to review some of the more basic elements we learned about sentence structure in Chapter 7. The way the book and curriculum scaffolds often makes so some elements are not repeated enough. ",
            "\u00a0Thorsten is a gem. The amount of material we are expected to learn is too high for the amount of time we are given. The speed at which we go through each chapter just result in a bunch of material learned half-assedly and quickly forgotten. Also the final project is a terrible assignment. No group project should count for 25% of your grade, that's just absolutely unfair because people are the worst and are more than willing to coast and let someone else do the work. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Great, engaging instructor.\r\nWeakness: Some of the activities seemed pointless (eg. Brochure making) ",
            "\u00a0This course was great! I think that its dependance on group work can either be very helpful or very detrimental depending on the group you are in. If there was a way to make group work a consistently good experience this course could be improved. However, I think the structure otherwise is really good. ",
            "\u00a0I don't really like the textbook we are using. This E-book is not very user friendly. We can't work directly on it. Too much homework and tests for sure and having speaking test with a real person is much preferred. "

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class. ",
            "\u00a0Listening and speaking a language daily is important for learning it and this would be a good opportunity to. ",
            "\u00a0Yes-- if you want to improve your german skills, take this class. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the course, and would recommend it to anyone interested in continuing their study of German. ",
            "\u00a0No. The workload is simply much greater than all other courses . it caused me far too much stress. "
