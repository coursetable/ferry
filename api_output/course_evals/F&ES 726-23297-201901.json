            "\u00a0A good review of high school physics and geography to introduce the science behind satellite images and remote sensing.\r\nSolid understanding of how satellite imaging works, its uses and limitations.\r\nAnd of course, hands-on experience using ENVI software to analyze images and create maps. ",
            "\u00a0I gained skills in remote sensing both conceptually and practically. It was really helpful learning the foundations of remote sensing, such as the properties of light/radiation and how it interacts with various objects on Earth, early on in the course, and then later applying that knowledge in labs and in an independent project on a topic of our choice. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to understand the basic concepts of remote sensing and became an expert of it. I also learned to applied remote sensing techniques and became an expert in most of the topics. Not only can I confidently understand other research done by remote sensing but I can also apply the knowledge I have to work on my own projects. ",
            "\u00a0knowledge of ENVI software; how satellites work and how satellite images are taken and shared; methods for analyzing satellite imagery and many applications for using data from satellite imagery ",
            "\u00a0Solidified my understanding of the physics and chemical underpinnings of how RS technology works, why certain natural phenomena appear as they do in satellite images.\r\nUnderstanding how resampling works and how to critically select one's resampling method to fit their \r\nHigher spatial resolution imagery is NOT always the best for all science applications! Learning the drawbacks of the Planet dataset was really insightful and will prove very helpful to my future work. "

            "\u00a0They exceeded my expectations. I got to learn the different tools for different purposes. ",
            "\u00a0The knowledge about the foundations of remote sensing (properties of light, how objects reflect light, how satellites orbit objects, how data is stored, etc) exceeded my expectations and is really practical. It also filled in knowledge gaps from geospatial courses I'd taken in the past. ",
            "\u00a0They are so much better than my expectations. I went to the classroom with very little idea about remote sensing. The course surprised me more and more every day because I gradually realized that there are so many things that remote sensing can do. It can be used for the analysis of climate, ocean, forest, urbanization, etc. I am so glad that I took the class. ",
            "\u00a0Very well ",
            "\u00a0I expected to learn my way around ENVI, and I did! \r\nWe learned many methods for pre-processing or correcting one's data, but I wish I came away with a better grasp of WHEN (in what use cases) it's best to use particular corrections. "

            "\u00a0Strength : All Faculties and TFs are really supportive. The course itself is also very well structured. \r\nWeakness : Two problem sets should be updated for the furture class. Some errors were found. ",
            "\u00a0I can't think of too many weaknesses, maybe except that sometimes the language in the homework sets is ambiguous. The questions could have been worded more clearly, and the layout of the problem sets could also be improved (font, line spacing) to make it more readable on a computer screen. ",
            "\u00a0The course gives a strong background into the science behind remote sensing and gives a good overview into various remote sensing topics. The labs are a weakness and could be improved. Labs could be more engaging, and give more explanation to why students are selecting the different options on each toolbox window. The format of the written documents lays out step by step instructions without a clear understanding of reasoning behind each process. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is its balance between teaching theory/foundational knowledge and arming students with the skills to apply the knowledge in practice. Both are important, and learning to use remote sensing tools wouldn't be as powerful without the foundations.\r\n\r\nHowever, the weakness of this course is the labs... I did not learn the ENVI software as effectively through the point-and-click nature of the labs. It might be more helpful to have manuals that contain information on how to use tools and adjust settings--and what these settings mean--but I think I would have learned how to use remote sensing tools more thoroughly and felt confident using them independently if I had been able to answer the questions in the lab on my own. I think trial and error and exploring independently are useful for learning tools and softwares. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that every student has a chance to practice a lot before their final projects. They can learn a lot of the techniques that can be used for their project. Having TAs in the lab is very helpful for us to solve our problems directly. Not to mention how wonderful the professors are. \r\n\r\n\r\nI wish we had more reading regarding the concepts and application. There weren't a lot of reading materials that can guide us for the application part, besides the lab protocol and Google. ",
            "\u00a0As someone who learns by doing, labs were really helpful in applying what we discussed in class; I appreciated learning about the physics of satellites and imagery along with just learning about the software and analytical methods; Karen Seto's lecture was super interesting; Natalie Schultz - she was an amazing resource to have in the lab and so helpful for explaining concepts, answering all kinds of questions, and providing advice! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: This was one of the most well-organized classes I've taken at Yale so far. Having all deadlines and calendar events clearly laid out at the beginning of the semester made is SO easy for me to stay on track, plan my workload in advance, and understand the \"arc\" of where the class was going and what lectures would build upon other ones. I really appreciated knowing what \"the plan\" of the course was!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:  I understand that there are many RS instruments out there and this class cannot cover them all in depth, so some must be relegated to a brief introductory \"showcase.\" However, I think the showcases have significant room for improvement, especially in making them more memorable or relevant to students. I think some students would \"tune out\" of the lectures when showcases began because they did not seem relevant to the other lessons we were learning. I would love to see more of the showcase satellites/data sources integrated into our regular lectures or lab assignments, giving students to really look at and explore the data that comes from these sensors.

I want to appreciate supports from Natalie, Research Scientist of YCEO. With her support I was improved y understanding of ENVI and Remote Sensing. ",
