            "\u00a0Amazing course! I learned more in this class than most other classes at YSPH. It was practical, and very hands-on so I actually got to apply the concepts I was learning. I don't have many criticisms or suggestions, other than that it was very awkward to have a portion of the final project that was an individual grade --- this made the group work process uncomfortable and created tension over who could write the \"good\" findings up and who was left cleaning up the random other pieces, without as much of a cohesive flow for their findings section.\r\n\r\nAlso, having transcripts + codes due the Sunday of spring break was crazy b/c the time was so busy....maybe think about how to re-structure that so it does not fall at such a busy time.\r\n\r\nGuest speakers were often not very helpful, except for Leslie Curry's lecture on mixed methods, that was great! ",
            "\u00a0This was a great course, one of my favorites over my two years at YSPH. \r\n\r\nStrengths- learning & applying skills; creating a final product that you are proud of; relevance of lectures to class activities; Focus group & mixed methods guest lectures were fantastic\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- some of the readings were a bit dry, would have liked to read more examples of qualitative work at home and then get the theory/methods from the lecture (with readings to reference); for some projects it is difficult to have the participant observation be relevant; digital story telling guest lecture was disappointing ",
            "\u00a0It was overall an excellent course. Certainly one of the best I've taken in two years at YSPH. It's unfortunate that this class is one of the only opportunities to engage in active learning around qualitative research methods at the public health school. We need more qualitative research courses like this one! ",
            "\u00a0Best class I've taken at YSPH by far. \r\n\r\nStrengths: Practical public health application, learn tangible skills, Danya is the best professor you'll ever have. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It takes a lot of work. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this class because despite the heavy workload, I found that it was quite manageable and each step was important for conducting good qualitative research. I think the course could be improved by more evenly distributing the workload throughout the semester. There were times when my group wouldn't need any outside time while other weeks required a substantial effort on all of out behalves. ",
            "\u00a0Qualitative Research Methods\r\nStrengths:\r\n- hands on experience with qualitative research methods\r\n- very iterative-- constant feedback\r\n- Danya is great\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- a lot of work? but totally worth it ",
            "\u00a0This course is great! It is really well taught. Best of all I felt like every assignment was for a purpose, there was no busy work which I appreciated. ",
            "\u00a0I would say that everything about the class was great (please keep the twice weekly schedule! it helped pace the curriculum and gave us all adequate time to work on our projects), but also due to the time limitations we weren't able to talk about other methodologies or techniques beyond grounded theory and semi-structured interviews. ",
            "\u00a0Fantastic course - should be an example to all YSPH faculty. Clear and insightful instruction, worthwhile and interesting assignments. Best class Ive taken here thus far. ",
            "\u00a0Favorite class at YSPH. Learned so much, and all assignments are important and come together at the end. ",
            "\u00a0This course is great. The strength is the instructor who is both knowledgeable and thoughtful. Not so much of a weakness, but this course is more demanding, but I think I was able to feel like I learned something because I did a lot in this course. ",
            "\u00a0The course flowed very nicely - the assignments were relevant and we were guided step by step in designing a mini qualitative project. I learned a ton and thought it was well organized. Danya did an incredible job structuring the course! ",
            "\u00a0This is a fantastic course that I have found to be directly applicable to my research. The course is structured to follow the course of a qualitative research project and is paced well. I appreciated the thoughtful feedback that the instructor provided and how the assignments match up with real-life qualitative research tasks. I also appreciated the opportunity to develop something through the course project that can ultimately be useful beyond the scope of the class.\r\n\r\nThe main weakness of this course is that it is the only course offered at YSPH that focuses on qualitative research practice. As such, it tries to fit too much content into the scope of the course, some pieces of which feel shoehorned in. While I appreciated that we got to learn about these other methods, there should really be two or three additional courses on qualitative research, each of which can focus on a different method, such as in-depth interviews, focus groups, or observation and ethnography. This would allow each course to be more streamlined and better meet the needs of students. ",
            "\u00a0Overall the course was very helpful in providing a foundational knowledge of qualitative research methods. It is a term often thrown around without much understanding of how to do the actual methods and the theoretical information that underpins it. I think the major strength of the course is that we completed a qualitative project during the course of the semester - the methods would not be properly understood any other way. A weakness of the course in general was that it felt a bit rushed at the end of the semester; I wish there was more time devoted to writing and also of mixed methods research (though I understand that that was not the focus of the course). ",
            "\u00a0Take this course!! This course was such an effective use of time and will teach you step-by-step the necessary skills to conduct qualitative research. The main project is conducting interviews and qualitative analysis, with a group, on a topic of your choice. Each week you learn a set of skills and then practice applying them with that week's assignment(s). ",
            "\u00a0I love Danya Keene. Very knowledgeable, practical class. I'm taking skills I learned in this class and applying it to my summer research. It taught me how to think, and how public opinion can definitely shape public health. Great instructor, would highly recommend to anyone at YSPH. ",
            "\u00a0A wonderful and informative course. I not only learned a new skill, qualitative research and methods, but also learned a lot of the theory around this research method, both its pro's and con's. I can't think of any weakness or area for improvement. Dr. Keene has well-honed this class into a great experience for students. ",
            "\u00a0This is a must take class at YSPH. The methodologies and frameworks provided in the class help create a solid foundation for future qualitative work. Danya is an amazing professor (and human) and is able to create a dynamic classroom setting. I would 100% recommend this class to everyone, especially those who are very quantitative focused. As a future public health practitioner it should be mandatory to understand qualitative methodologies. ",

I would take any course taught by Dr. Keene as I feel like I learned so much under her guidance and instruction! ",

She is VERY approachable and asking questions is not difficult. It seems that she really treats her students like colleagues and that is not always my experience of professors here. I think she might improve her teaching style by perhaps taking it a bit slower at times - I know there is a lot to cover in the course and that is why we needed to go faster at times but sometimes it did feel a bit rushed.

Everything you learn is incredibly practical. Yes, it's more work than most YSPH classes, but it's kind of fun work to design and then do your own research project, so I didn't mind doing it at all. If you work with a group you like then the work is enjoyable & you can make new friends. Honestly, I looked forward to going to this class each week, which is shocking for me. More people should know how to do effective qualitative research and I enjoyed it immensely. ",

I was taking the class as I worked on my qualitative thesis, and this class saved me! It would have been a great class to take during my 1st year in the program. The skills you learn are tangible and you have the opportunity to apply them in a very interesting project. The workload was very reasonable, and I felt very supported by Danya and the TF for the course. I have overall not been particularly impressed by YSPH courses, but Danya's class is a positive deviant! Going to each class felt worthwhile and important, as I felt that I was learning skills that I could apply in my project and in my thesis. Danya also genuinely cares about her students and is wonderful! ",
