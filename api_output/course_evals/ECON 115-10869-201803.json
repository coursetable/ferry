I'd literally open the solutions in the next window and correct my answers myself because she took so long to go over them. \r\nImprovements: Grading on the homework was a bit maddening. How can you only get 3, 4, or a 5 points out of 5? If you miss a single part of one small question you immediately get knocked down 20%, which is ridiculous. The homework was extremely short (less than two hours a week), but I would've appreciated it being a bit longer in order to give you more chances to practice the material. It also seems very subjective, because there are no intermediate grades between a 4 and a 5. It's mildly infuriating. ",

I went to the vast majority of lectures, and I felt that the professors moved too quickly and did not spend adequate time explaining each concept. It was difficult to write down anything that made sense before the professor would go to the next slide. However, I will say that section was generally very helpful for learning material. My teaching fellow always went appropriately in-depth on every concept. There is definitely a support network in place for this class through the teaching fellows, a multitude of office hours, and peer tutoring resources. I think that the course would be greatly improved if lectures spent more time fully explaining each concept, instead of leaving that to the teaching fellows in section.

The weaknesses though often prevented me from enjoying the strengths. The change of professor was not conducive to learning whatsoever, because the two professors had different teaching styles and gave very different types of exams. Prof. Oster gave exams that were not at all similar to previous years, and all the TFs would warn us that it would not be useful to review them. But that left us very little to review- -- her psets were very short (3-4 questions typically), and the lecture slides were useless to review, because they were entirely illegible. The technology in the lecture hall often times did not work, and the professors' writing on the tablet appeared like scribbles. Some lectures were disorganized, unclear, and rushed, but since it is such a big class, students are just left confused.

However, this weakness I believe is largely made up for by the availability of sections in which students are able to ask questions and clarify the parts of lectures they did not quite understand.\r\nI think the non-compulsory sections were a strength as they allowed students who required additional support to attend, and those who felt confident with the material in a given week to use the time otherwise. However, I felt the sections relied too heavily on simply solving problems for the sake of getting them correct - I would probably have attended sections more often if we had been able to use them as a forum to discuss theories deeper, including their limitations, empirical evidence to support or refute them, and the links between economic theory in both the academic and real worlds.\r\nThe most significant weakness I felt this course suffered from was the manner of assessment. I often felt that the questions in both problem sets and exams were vague at best and outright ambiguous at worst, such that students were unclear what exactly was expected from them in their response. This was reflected in the reports of several students I have spoken to who often told me that they either felt that they knew the vast majority, if not all, of the material, but felt that their ability was misrepresented by the exams because they hadn't understood the specific demands of the questions; and other students who did well on the exams but seemed surprised that they had achieved that outcome because during the exam they had felt very unsure about their answers. I think that greater clarity on how questions are created and graded would have helped students to more successfully apply the knowledge they had gained to the questions on the exams. ",

I would say Professor Oster's lectures were too quick, and I wish we were given the lecture slides in advance to have a chance to properly preview the content. It would make showing up to lecture much more appealing, as we would better absorb the content instead of letting us be hit with it and barely be able to recover anything from it. As someone without any economics experience taking this course, this is my biggest complaint. ",

I think there was at times a disparity in the information/resources one could access depending on which TA you were interacting with. There were problem sets where the solution keys were incorrect, as well, which led to some confusion. Overall I think most of the weaknesses came from it being such a large lecture course, and were mostly logistical. ",

The only things that would've improved lecture are if they had posted the slides before hand so that we could follow along as the professor was lecturing, and if they had found a way to write reliably and a little more legibly on the board.\r\n\r\nSection was actually good for the most part as well. I think the section needed to be an hour long though, as we always ran over time. It was really helpful to see problems worked out though. ",

Slides are flipped through unbelievably fast and with little explanation. Additionally, the TFs are genuinely aweful. I don't know what this department is doing staffing the most popular course in Yale with some of the worst supporting faculty I have ever seen. Most are far from articulate in section while the others are far from able to provide ample explanation of the course material being presented. The grading system is completely nonsense; one of the TFs graded unreasonably harsh throughout the year, particularly on the first exam where tons of students lost points on definitions of all things - so particular. The material was great but I learned all on own. It's frankly disappointing how poor a class like intro micro is taught at a school like Yale. ",

It could be improved if the class structure were more organized. ",

This gave a false sense of understanding to students when really they were unprepared. Also, the writing of notes by the instructor was horrible and most slides were not even legible. This made it impossible to review notes from the lecture and made studying very difficult. ",

Lecture could be slightly dull and the lecturer often went too fast for me to fully grasp concepts, this would be understandable if we had been pressed for time but the lecture often finished 15 minutes before it was meant to. \r\nIt was sometimes hard to link what was being taught in class to homework questions and exam questions.

One major weakness of the course is that during the lecture, it sometimes is very hard for students to keep up since the professor goes very fast, and it's hard to read the words on the lecture slides and to pay attention to what the professor is saying at the same time. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this class were definitely the excess upon excess of practice material from the previous years of exams that helped immensely in prepping for tests. That, as well as all the study sessions provided by the TF's definitely ensured success if success was desired. The weaknesses came much more from the top. The slides with Goldberg were constantly shutting down and causing distractions, and the slides with Oster were genuinely illegible. ",

It really makes you think about how to allocate your resources efficiently and just look at situations under a new lens. It's definitely a tough course in terms exams and problem sets but fairly easy in terms of intuition. It raises awareness to a lot of things we typically ignore in our everyday lives. ",

If you're one of those kids that's just chilling thinking this course would be a nice opportunity to try out economics at Yale, be careful. I came in thinking this course would be a breeze but ended up investing most my time in doing well. The class is full of students with insane econ backgrounds, some who placed in Micro theory but chose to take intro micro instead. The teaching is not where it needs to be: you will genuinely not learn unless you read the textbooks. The TFs are far from helpful, so you're really on your own. The material is great, don't get me wrong. This semester's professor, Ms. Oster, was well-intentioned, but it was just not easy. Building economic intuition in this class is like being a fish out of water - you're scrambling the entire semester. Be sure this is what you want to do before you do it. ",

The teachers have time to answer your questions but not to help you figure out what they are. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but if you havent taken economics previously (like in high school), be ready for quite a bit of work to understand the material.! ",

            "\u00a0I wouldn't, unless you are going to be an econ major.  Other than that I think it would be a waste of a credit and a lot of your time.  It just isn't very interesting in my opinion. ",
            "\u00a0Yes because it will give you a good intro to economics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend the class. Econ has a bad rap, but a lot of concepts from the class are relevant to subjects other than finance, like climate protection, social policy, and nonprofit strategy. I think that students can benefit from having a basic understanding of things like taxes, cost-benefit analysis, etc., since it offers us a different perspective on how society works. The quality of the lectures really depended on the professor. My suggestion to anyone taking this class is to really try to do as much independent practice as you can. While going to office hours and review sessions will serve you well in getting the right answers, you should try problems on your own first. Most questions on the P-sets and exams are fair. Some pose more of an intellectual challenge/conceptual application of the material, and these questions are mainly for the curve (which is pretty competitive, since everyone is actually trying to do well). Absolutely no need to spend money on the textbook for this class. ",

I really wish the course would be more accommodating and more helpful in terms of acting as an introductory course. I had no prior background in this course and it was rather difficult for me to grasp all of the concepts presented. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend Micro 115. While it isn't a breeze, it teaches all the fundamentals of Microeconomics that are useful to all students, not just Econ majors. I used most of the things I learned in 115 for understanding concepts in multiple other classes. Overall, the course allowed me to get a better understanding of economics and how I can apply that to the real world. While the lecture isn't very entertaining or engaging, the material is worth the time investment and the things I have learned have proven to be useful outside of class. ",

It's definitely a good way to meet a lot of first-years and study together in the first term, but unless future economics classes are desired, I probably wouldn't recommend it. Much of what I learned was completely unrelated to economics, which I guess is a good thing long term but I probably could've gotten it much better out of other classes where I also learned. ",
