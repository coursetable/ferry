            "\u00a0We discussed the fundamental group, homology, cohomology through Poincare duality. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about algebraic topology and some homological algebra to go with it. The material is very interesting and deep. I greatly developed my topological and algebraic understanding. ",
            "\u00a0I gained the practical ability to use and manipulate homology and cohomology to solve problems. I also gained some insight on covering spaces. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend taking this class before delving into the higher graduate courses offered at Yale. The ideas of Algebraic Topology stand hand-in-hand with Algebraic Geometry in producing the modern language for mathematics. ",
            "\u00a0Many algebraic topology knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the construction and applications of the fundamental group, covering spaces, homology and cohomology of topological spaces through this course. Classical theorems in topology such as the Brouwer Fixed point theorem, Borsuk-Ulum theorem and the invariance of dimension are all proved using homology theory. \r\nI also learned many ways to calculate these homotopy invariants. I learned CW complex structures, the Van Kampen theorem and covering space actions to compute the fundamental group, simplicial, cellular homology to  find homology groups, long exact sequences to compute homology and relative homology and Mayer-Vietoris sequences for computing both homology and cohomology groups. I also learned the Universal Coefficient theorem for Cohomology, which relates cohomology with general coefficients with homology and the ext functor. \r\nWhat is more, I gradually realized that deformation retracts are convenient simplifying tools for the computation of these homotopy invariants. \r\nIn addition, the cohomology ring of a space, which is realized by the cup product structure, provides further ways to distinguish between seemingly homotopy equivalent spaces.

            "\u00a0The lecture was hard to follow sometimes, particularly the homological algebra. Probably most people already know about the snake lemma (for example), and I find that it is easier to read a proof like that in the book. ",
            "\u00a0The course covers a lot of material, and barely has time to cover it thoroughly. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The interesting subject material. The problem sets were good. Not an excessive amount of work.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes it felt like the professor was reading from the textbook, which is of course something we would have to do later anyway. I think the biggest issue with the lecture style would be that when presenting proofs, there wasn't as much signposting up front as I would have found useful. I.e., while the proofs were correct, they didn't impart as much intuition as I could have used. I often found myself searching for intuition in Hatcher and my own scratch work later. It wasn't until I found that that I was able to comprehend the proofs and remember the statements of the theorems. \r\n\r\nAlso decidedly a weakness of this course was the graded. The grader seemed to be severely lacking background in category theory and homological algebra. While I can understand not knowing what a groupoid is, it seems like a problem when studying homology for the grader not to understand what one means when one says that an exact sequence of complexes splits. (I.e., the grader misunderstood it as saying that the exact sequences in each degree split, rather than their being a map of complexes splitting the exact sequence of complexes.) So I guess my suggestion would be to ensure the grader has a strong understanding of homological algebra at least. Preferably some category theory as well. ",
            "\u00a0I think that my main complaint about this course is that we did not have weekly homework, which made it hard to follow the lectures. I think that it would have been better to get 3-5 questions per week (3 easy, 2 hard), than to get 4-8 questions every 2/3 weeks. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course:\r\n1. Our instructor is prepares carefully for each lecture and provides insights into the concepts taught during the lectures.\r\n2. Our instructor is very willing to provide additional guidance during office hours, which are set conveniently right after each lecture. \r\n3. Homework problems correspond clearly with the materials covered in the lectures and test our understanding. \r\n4. The homework problems are assigned regularly. This provides consistent opportunities for me to practice solving problems directly related to our course.\r\n5. Our instructor mentions interesting topological notions related to our course which are not covered by the syllabus during lectures. This broadens my horizon of topology in general. "

            "\u00a0The good thing is that the textbook is fantastic, although it needs to be read very carefully to understand all the examples. ",
            "\u00a0This course covers very interesting and engaging material. If you are interested in advanced math and are up for it, then I recommend this course as the material is so cool! However, it is one of the most conceptually challenging courses I have taken at Yale, so be prepared. I recommend that you take it after 380, or take them concurrently. The exact quality of the course will depend a lot on who is teaching it, but even if you have a lackluster professor, you'll be able to learn a lot just from the textbook. Either way, expect to put in a lot of time outside of class studying and trying to understand the material. This is a course where you really will need to do the work yourself of learning the material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It's essential and quite interesting material. Hatcher is a good book. ",
            "\u00a0An engaging but difficult course. Make sure to reread the textbook and do extra practice problems throughout the semester to keep up, as it is easy to fall behind. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course. The material is incredibly interesting and useful. The problem sets aren't terribly long, and are fun to do. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very important for those who are interested in modern topology tools. It is very hard though. ",
            "\u00a0This course is definitely worthwhile to take for math majors. The material covered is important for the understanding of modern topology as a whole and illustrates many advantages of introducing algebraic invariants to the realm of topology through many interesting and tangible examples.\r\nIn addition, our instructor is conscientious and passionate in teaching topology. The expertise and passion of our instructor in topology will prove to be very helpful and enlightening in the course of learning the material. "
