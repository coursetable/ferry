            "\u00a0My independent study with Professor Mirakhor was deeply enriching. I learned how to put a range of texts--fiction, theory, critical reviews, documentaries, etc.--in conversation with one another in order to produce new insights. Professor Mirakhor encouraged me to drive a lot of our discussions, which enabled me to practice valuable organizational and critical thinking skills. Not only do I feel more capable of speaking with greater clarity and intentionality, but my writing feels more precise than ever. ",

            "\u00a0This course really has no weaknesses. Its strength lies in its multifaceted syllabus, including documentaries, interviews, literary reviews, short stories, theory, as well as novels. This course is a testament to the ways in which critical engagement is a practice that extends beyond the work and research commonly associated with academia. In other words, theory and traditional scholarship are not the only pieces that are worth critical engagement. I felt as though there was a lot at stake in the work we pursued in the course, it was meaningful in a way that many other courses I have taken have not been. "
