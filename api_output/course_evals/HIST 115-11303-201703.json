            "\u00a0Definitely writing about history--my TF was a pretty tough grader but that pushed me to try harder with the papers. It's a very particular thing to write about a historical event/document/piece and grapple with its contradictions and complexities. ",
            "\u00a0Gained solid knowledge and understanding about the development of Colonial America and how it led to the American Revolution. Really delved into a wide array of subjects that took place in this time period. ",
            "\u00a0This class set out to develop one skill: primary source analysis. While I did learn some things about a period of history with which I was generally unfamiliar, the course focused around primary source texts, both in terms of the class reading and in terms of the papers (Paper 1 = Secondary Source, Paper 2 = Primary Source Analysis from the Yale Archives, Paper 3 = Art Analysis from the YUAG). The clarity and speed of my writing certainly improved, as was shown by the take-home final, in which we were required to write two 4-5 page essays in 24 hours, a rather useful exercise all told. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a ton of history, improved my writing, and gained valuable experience using artifacts and manuscripts. ",
            "\u00a0I feel like I learned a great deal about the history of my country, which helped me understand its origins as well as the historical antecedents for a lot of modern-day issues. I very rarely deeply retain the information I learn in college classes, but this one was a shining exception to the rule. ",
            "\u00a0A fantastic survey of early American history. ",
            "\u00a0Learned how to analyze a primary source document in older English and this course gave me insight to more Native American history ",
            "\u00a0I gained a new understanding of the colonial period in American history. More specifically, I learned more about the indigenous American perspective. The multifaceted syllabus gave me insight into the Native American, African, and European perspectives on the colonial period. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a holistic view of the colonial period through the vantage points of many different actors during the era. I also learned how to approach different topics and arguments in papers. ",
            "\u00a0More critical understandings of Puritanism and English culture, specifically male honor culture that will be valuable to understanding the U.S. patriarchy and misogyny. Although I knew about many of the events that were reviewed in the class Professor Tannenbaum approached them from a different, more critical lens, than of that taken by AP U.S. history courses. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: enthusiastic professor and TF. Well structured lectures and assignments. I really enjoyed some of the readings and the field trips to the Archives and Amnuscripts and then to the University Art Gallery were great supplements to the class. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think personally that the colonial era is a pretty dry era myself, so I think I found it boring because it's not what I get jazzed about in American history. I thought there was too much reading every week, usually one or two research essays and then some primary documents, which definitely added up. I think there was also a vibe that a lot of the students weren't paying attention either. I would recommend a smaller class set up (maybe a seminar room, even though its a lecture--it's a small lecture) and not allowing computers. It was really easy to zone out and get distracted, but I think if everyone was writing their notes instead of typing them, people would be more focused. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Tannenbaum is a good lecturer and we had quite a few interesting field trips and opportunities to closely examine primary sources. I think if possible, more opportunity to learn how to do proper analysis on primary sources would be interesting and helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course derive from its laid-back nature. Lecture is not too fast-paced or essential, and the reading was relatively  light, but rather good. However, due to this, a student might find him/herself focusing less on the class, which I suppose is its downside -- that it doesn't lend itself to enough engagement to be considereda \"classic\" or particularly useful class. ",
            "\u00a0Great lectures, helpful sections, fun field trips. Only thing that could make it better would be more/longer lectures! ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were definitely the primary sources Prof. Tannenbaum had for us, both in the course readings as well as in our archival visits. I do feel as though her teaching style is a bit erratic, however. ",
            "\u00a0Visual aids, fantastic field trips, and lectures! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are that the class focuses on Native American history and the papers were interesting research topics. A weakness was the amount of readings each week, there were many ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: wide variety of essay types (liked going to the Art Gallery and looking through the archives at the library) ",
            "\u00a0The feedback from the TA and one on one help was not as helpful as I would have liked. ",
            "\u00a0Great focus on the experiences of non-whites in colonial America (i.e. African slaves and native americans) ",
            "\u00a0The course takes a very \"liberal\" approach to early U.S. history, often patting itself on the back for mentioning Native peoples at all while not actually centering them in class lectures and discussions. First, there are no secondary sources reflecting on this time period written by Native writers. Primary sources are not enough. Allow students to learn from Native peoples as their instructed to learn from non-Native peoples (Ned Blackhawk's book Violence Over the Land could be worked well into the syllabus). Secondly, there is no continuity shown for the Native peoples mentioned in the course. The Mohegan, Pequot, Mohawk, etc. nations all exist in the 21st century. A very short remark on their continued resistance against the U.S. and survival would've prevented students from believing all Native people died off. One way to accomplish this is to also talk about Native peoples in the present tense (Haudenosaunee still empower women politically DESPITE colonial impositions of male leaders). Third, it is not explained well that ALL Native nations had different times and locations of contact. Thus, the history of contact and ensuing conflict is incredibly different for each nation and did not occur at the same time. I suggest focusing only on the nations that are in sources and events because a 5 minute sweeping examination of all Native people in North America is generalizing and leaves people with many misconceptions. On that note, Native peoples are all very different- something that was said during the course but not actually shown in lecture (i.e. there was not ONE native world but many). \r\nAll this being said the professor did a good job talking about individual Native peoples at this time period and gave much more information than most non-Native authored U.S. history text books give. ",
            "\u00a0I would suggest adding more works by Native American historians or first hand accounts of Native Americans that would provide insight into their side of the situation much more effectively. Though some works were included as readings, there was not enough for a well-rounded telling of Native American history. Also, a deeper emphasis on the distinction between tribes would be an interesting point to make as it seemed that other students would categorize Indigenous peoples as a whole and not as people of different cultures and ways.

            "\u00a0I would recommend it as the Early America requirement for the AMST major. It's a tidy little class--you'll get a good background in the beginnings of life in North America and can trace slavery from the 1600s to its legacy now in the US. There are a lot of readings, so you kind of have to figure out how to balance all of that. I liked the three paper topics (a document in one of our books, a primary document from Manuscripts and Archives, and a piece of art from the Art Gallery). ",
            "\u00a0As an American Studies major, it fulfilled my early Americas requirement and I feel like I learned things as well. I would recommend it to anyone who needs to fulfill this requirement and/or is just interested in learning about this period. ",
            "\u00a0As long as the student has realistic expectations, sure. This is not the Colonial History class of Edmund Morgan, but provides a solid introduction to a generally unfamiliar period. The work-load and reading are light (three 5-page papers and a 24-hour take home final + 2-3 hours of reading  per week), and it is easy to do well, especially if one has past experience with history classes. At the same time, lectures don't always seem connected, and get tedious at time, so I would recommend shopping it to see if you can bear it. A nice fifth class. ",
            "\u00a0Great way to solidify and explore a part of American history often skimmed over in high school. Very enjoyable lectures and interesting readings. Very enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0I would, even if they aren't a history major. I feel like it has equipped me to talk intelligently about a great variety of historical topics, and I rarely emerge from a class feeling that way. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely. ",
            "\u00a0Yes if they like American history. The professor was great ",
            "\u00a0No ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think if you want to learn about the foundation of America....take this class. It's important to understand the events that lead to the revolution. ",
            "\u00a0I would if they thought they were good history writers. ",
            "\u00a0Yes but I would have to explain the reasons why this course is also not effective. Would also probably not recommend a Native student to take it because they would just be frustrated. "
