            "\u00a0I learned so much from this class. I learned about the history of policing, the history of people of color in urban areas, and the history of racialized systems of oppression. This class taught me to interrogate history, apply new settler-colonial and radical frameworks to urban America, and understand the politics of space and geography. I became a better writer, reader, historian, and thinker. ",
            "\u00a0Thinking historically, seeing trends in policies over time, the transformation of the urban police officer into a case manager, and an overall better understanding of the origins of our modern criminal justice debate. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the history of policing, race, and cities in the U.S. Specifically, I learned about the ways in which African American historians have thought about policing, challenging preconceived notions I had about this course and its material. Furthermore, I gained insight on how to use primary source material to write a long and challenging final paper. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the history of policing and crime statistics in the United States. I also gained a better understanding of how historical policies and attitudes shaped modern conceptions of race and criminality ",
            "\u00a0So Viet actually told us, at the end of the course, what he wanted us to take away from it, and I've been thinking how close I feel that I got to each of his objectives. I think I've grown and learned a lot. The assignments we had plus Viet's feedback made me more attentive to the core tenets of historical analysis; I gained a strong foundation for understanding ideas of criminality and their evolution, and the role of the criminal justice system in our world today; and I also got a better foundation for exploring ideas of justice that relate to policing, crime, the justice system, etc. The reading notes also definitely forced me to think about how to synthesize information well. ",
            "\u00a0I got better at looking at and contextualizing primary sources (since we looked at 2-3 at the beginning of every class). ",
            "\u00a0Each course begins with reading primary sources and a short discussion about what it means in context. It's a fun exercise and good practice for historians. Professor Trinh also picks very interesting clips from newspapers/reports/oral histories, etc. This class also helped me read essays/books as a historian. This was the first class I've taken at Yale where we discussed historians making very different historical arguments about similar topics which was also super interesting and new to parse through. ",
            "\u00a0the course title is pretty self explanatory. I learned more about becoming a better historical writer and what to look for when reading a piece. ",
            "\u00a0Policing is a crazy system that can be examined through multiple lenses including settler colonialism. Geography, time, and place are super important in history. This course made me utilize Yale's extensive library system. ",
            "\u00a0skills: really transformative practice in reading primary sources\r\nknowledge: policing and us urban history in LA NYC and lots of other cities and towns since 1890\r\ninsights: construction of criminality, always looking for changes over time ",
            "\u00a0- How to assess a primary document, starting with basic, initial gatherings which then lead to complex analysis and extrapolations.\r\n- How to better maneuver through the archives and narrow down a research question.\r\n- How to better connect different authors' theories and viewpoints, in order to better form my own. \r\n- How to better manage a heavy reading load, while taking away main points. This was accomplished through discussion and the reading notes. \r\n- Improved my experience in writing research papers. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me a comprehensive understanding of the development and execution of policing in the United States and helped improve my historical writing abilities a great deal. After taking this class I have a much better idea of the essential elements of a historical essay and I feel that I was equipped with skills that will help me beyond the specific subject matter of this course. This class also provided me with the historical context necessary to understand many problems that we can see playing out today. ",
            "\u00a0One of my favorite classes Ive taken at Yale. Taught me about how to think like a historian when approaching papers, readings, oral histories, primary sources, etc. in a way I never thought about before. The class also really drilled in the importance of time and place when doing research and thats definitely influenced how I approach research papers for all of my classes from now on. ",
            "\u00a0This class allows you to think critically about how mass incarceration was created, as well as more broadly about justice. Class discussions were always very active and this is a tribute to both the class content, and Viet. Really amazing class. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The strengths of this class are very engaging readings, helpful activities like oral histories and archival work, and a wonderful instructor. I have no ways to improve it. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a tremendous experience. The only weakness was that we couldn't have longer discussions, as there was so much to talk about in the books but so little class time. ",
            "\u00a0This course is strong because it assigned readings that were very interesting, but also easy to read. Every week, the reading load was manageable and I always left feeling like I learned something new. On the other hand, this course could improve if we had started every seminar with goals. I like feeling like I got what I needed to get out of every class by establishing and achieving goals continuously. ",
            "\u00a0All around fantastic course. One of the best I've taken at Yale so far. ",
            "\u00a0I think Viet did a good job of making a syllabus with a meaningful arc in terms of the readings we did, and one that was just super interesting overall. I appreciated having a research report due around mid-course, because it really did make sure that I was thinking about research and going to the archives early (especially helpful if you have other research papers to write, which I ended up having for another history seminar). We also did this thing at the beginning of every class where we analyzed a primary source together, which was an interesting and innovative learning experience -- super helpful for history majors who definitely need to be able to analyze primary sources, and still helpful for another humanities majors who might find them useful. I do wish we had spent more time on the \"justice\" portion of the course, such as discussing restorative justice or prison abolition. That said, I also feel more equipped to explore those ideas now after this class. ",
            "\u00a0For me, it was sometimes hard to figure out how the readings would be discussed in class. I would sometimes not do the shorter reading because I ran out of time, and half the time that worked out okay. On days when I did do the shorter readings, we sometimes didn't cover them at all. Other than that, I thought the course was very well organized and taught me a lot! ",
            "\u00a0The assignments were interesting and fair and the readings were great! Sometimes discussions feel a little tangential and not always planned out, so I wasn't always sure what was important and what wasn't. ",
            "\u00a0strength is that the prof cares a TON and he's a super chill guy meaning that it's easy to feel comfortable participating in the class and he's here to help. also tho, you need to like work hard and put in your all because he wants you to learn and put in work. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength is time spent analyzing primary sources, both at the start of class and for the final research papers. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: powerful assigned readings, good history writing, great energy from viet and everyone in the class! no reading responses was a relief, made the heavy reading load less stressful (as in, there was no pressure to try to polish a response, and everyone could bring their questions and ideas to class)\r\nanother strength was the primary source \"bellringer\" type exercises at the beginning of class! those were lit!\r\nweaknesses: structure of discussion could be improved to be more student driven, like having 10-15 minutes for people to talk in groups since everyone was so engaged, also sometimes felt like we were shouting into the center, or at our instructor to write stuff on the board. it was a format i'd never had before, and i loved it the visual aspect, but i really wanted more student to student discussions especially with this amazing class ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- Brilliant designed syllabus that allows students to think deeper about policing and the inequality within the system at large. \r\n- Well selected group of students from different backgrounds, that all contribute great insight. \r\n- Visual compliments to the readings. \r\n\r\nWeakness:\r\n- Everyone does not contribute as much, so someone's stance can go unknown for most of the semester. Viet should try a bit more to push other students who may be shy, without pushing them too far out of their comfort zone. I understand that some clarity may be gained through office hours and other means, but it would be great to have a grasp on each student's take on different materials. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very well organized with a clear thematic progression and distinct information that could still all be tied together in pursuit of broader arguments. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: very understanding of whats going on in students lives, primary source exercise at the beginning of each class, guest speakers, the order and purpose of each reading was well thought out, the beinecke session\r\n\r\nweaknesses: group conversation was a little hard to follow sometimes because it would move rapidly and get on tangents here and there (inevitable but still) ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus was good as it was structured in a way that allowed the development of ideas (as in things added up onto each other) "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I would completely recommend this course to another student. Understanding policing and urban history is so important, and Viet does a wonderful job of weaving different topics into a nuanced curriculum. The readings and discussions are really interesting, and I was challenged to be a better historian and student. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. If you are interested in the criminal justice system, this course does a great job at getting you to think about it differently and more deeply. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Not only is the course material incredibly engaging, but Viet is an amazing instructor. He takes the time to explain concepts and challenges you to think critically about the material and your preconceived notions. The readings are also incredibly engaging and easy to follow. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. One of the best taught and most important courses I've taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely for anyone who can handle a pretty serious reading load and is willing to learn/knows how to think historically. It's an awesome course. Viet is great, the other people in the course were great, the readings were amazing and facilitated my learning, etc. etc. etc. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Viet is clearly very passionate and knowledgeable about policing and urban history, and I would strongly recommend taking his class in the future. ",
            "\u00a0YES YES YES! This is a fantastic course about a super important topic. If you are at all interested in urban studies or criminal justice than this course is a must-take. Viet is a super engaging professor who is clearly invested in each of his students. The assignments are very reasonable (there are only four) and you end up with lots of good new analysis skills as a historian. ",
            "\u00a0yeah but keep in mind it's a 2 hour sem so can get kinda long. ",
            "\u00a0This class is pretty challenging and hard to keep up with at times. However, if you are willing to put in the work you can get so much out of this class. Would recommend. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. It's really important to be able to read and do history well, which was the main goal/outcome of this course. But I believe that going deep into the history of policing and racism in US urban centers can transform what most people accept to be \"inevitable\" or about crime, safety, and what justice and accountability can actually look like. Also, if you care about space, race, or as viet says \"what happened and when\" in any context, this course would be great. ",
            "\u00a0Certainly. From those who have little experience with studying race, policing, and justice, to those who have much experience, this course will offer great insight and a different lens through which to view history and current events. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course because it exposed me to a lot of new perspectives on a subject that I thought I was already pretty familiar with. It also gave me tools that are essential to understanding some of the most pressing problems of today. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I think the group of people taking the class definitely helped, but it was a fascinating class to take. From the areas we focused on to the voices that were highlighted to the myriad of ways we saw the issue of policing and surveillance in urban spaces, everyone interested in cities, police, and/or the justice system should take this class. Viet is also a really great professor. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely recommend if you are very passionate about justice and critically examining the criminal justice system  but also if you dont know much about it. 100% take it. Viet is amazing "
