            "\u00a0Overall, this course provided me with a solid understanding of the relevant literature to the nascent field of political epidemiology and it gave me the methodological skills necessary to understand and contribute to such work, ultimately culminating in the final project. More specifically, I became familiar with the theoretical basis of relevant methodological techniques, gained competency in applying those methods through data analysis in R, read published papers that demonstrated applications of the techniques in political epidemiology, and completed a final project through which I was able to demonstrate an ability to apply a particular technique to a real research question. In terms of methodologies, we began with counterfactuals, causal inference, and randomized controlled trials, and then we spent a couple weeks on a number of different methods for analyzing different types of natural experiments, before focusing on modeling techniques for the second half of the semester (see the syllabus for more details). The problem sets were useful reinforcements of the concepts that we learned in lecture and through the readings, and they provided an opportunity to develop technical skills in R or refine skills you may already have. Overall I would say that the greatest insight I gained from the course was a greater understanding of how to critically evaluate published research in political epidemiology and to define, design, and conduct a study to address how a particular policy might impact a specific health outcome.

            "\u00a0While I was lucky to not experience this problem since I've taken a stats course that was heavily in R, many students new to R expressed frustration getting off the ground in that regard. Perhaps more can be done to address the initial gap there. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were that Prof. Gonsalves is an engaging professor and always willing to accept student feedback.\r\nWeaknesses were that this was the first year that the class was taught, so there are some kinks that needed to be ironed out. I thought it was a little silly that we did the readings, wrote reading responses about them, and then simply went through the readings in class - whether it be through discussion or through the lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Overall I believe that the course is very promising in premise and concept, and that its main weaknesses were only associated with it being the first year that it was taught. Personally I found the readings very interesting (although there is a scarcity of literature in political epidemiology so some of the readings weren't actually perfect representations of the methodologies we were studying) and I thought that the weekly reading responses were flexible enough to allow  me to guide my own learning to some extent while demanding enough (1-2 pages single spaced) to ensure that we were putting some serious thought into them. The problem sets were overall well structured to ensure that students developed the technical R skills necessary to actually implement said methodologies in the future, although there were some confusing aspects of them that will hopefully be ironed out for the second year. I would say that while no R-experience is needed for this course, the problem sets would be pretty difficult for students who have never seen R before, but they are still totally doable especially if you plan ahead (I'd never used R before taking this course, but I had friends who helped me when I had technical questions). One aspect of the course that improved as the semester went along but that could be improved further in the future was the use of class time to encourage active student participation. Lectures for the first couple of weeks only repeated the content for the reading, so for diligent students who did they're homework the extent of the overlap was a bit frustrating. That said, after a couple weeks the instructors recognized this and allocated the last part of each class to having groups of students do close readings on different parts of the papers, which was a nice change of pace that encouraged more active student engagement and learning. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses- the papers assigned were usually poor quality, there was no instruction on how to work R and we had 6 problem set assignments in R (unbelievably frustrating), there were far more assignments than there needed to be\r\n\r\nOverall the course was a mess. "

            "\u00a0Yes, if you're interested in doing a final project on a political policy's effect on a health outcome. The final project was the bulk of the class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to other students who are especially interested in the concept of political epidemiology and who like approaching these questions from a quantitative, methods-focused perspective or who have prior experience in probability, statistics, and/or R. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely not. \r\n\r\nThere is far too much work. You have to teach yourself how to code complicated models in R. The whole thing needs a lot more polishing before it's a workable course. "
