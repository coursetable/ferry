            "\u00a0Knowledge of the different ways science and religion has been defined, and by which its many aspects have interacted with each others across historical periods around the world. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to question a lot of the things I have been taught about science and religion. I also learned to think more critically about the works that I read for class, and to keep in mind the biases, circumstances and backgrounds of the authors who choose to propose particular arguments. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the power structures involved in declaring something to be science or religion, especially in non-Western/imperial contexts. I began to be able to keep track of threads of intellectual development moving from place to place over time and to see how those threads were met in different places. ",
            "\u00a0I gained such a valuable perspective of the way scientific and historical perspectives work together on a spectrum to help form the ways in which we view the world around us. I also better understood the importance of defining terms and thinking epistemologically. Learning about various science and religious traditions was incredibly interesting and applicable as well. ",
            "\u00a0I became a better readers and was forced to go outside my academic comfort zone. ",
            "\u00a0I gained insight into a more nuanced relation between science and religion historically and in the present. ",
            "\u00a0Comprehensive understanding of historical theme of changing relationship between science and religion from Middle Ages to modern day in western world and abroad. Greatly improved historical analysis skills, strong introduction to historiographical analysis, final research paper improved archival research skills and writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0This class looked at different interactions between science and religion across time and space. Every week was a new context and provided interesting material to create a greater understanding of the two concepts. ",
            "\u00a0Besides obviously the material, I learned how to think from a historical perspective. This was a good introduction to historical writing even though that is not its primary purpose. "

            "\u00a0Curriculum was good, engaging, and surprising. ",
            "\u00a0This course, with the help of Professor Dal Prete and Kelsey, facilitated some amazing discussions. That said, I think the readings could have been a little more specialized. It would have been great to see some more primary sources, or some secondary sources that were more concise. It's probably hard to find such readings given the huge span of the course, but I think it would be great to see some more varied voices! ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Ivano Dal Prete and Kelsey Champagne (the TA) made a really excellent teaching team. Ivano always wanted to be sure that students were really really engaging with the arguments of the readings and Kelsey was good at bringing in some extra historical tidbits that made all the readings fit together better. They are also both fun and helpful!\r\nWeakness: There were definitely some weeks with 100+ pages of dense reading that few people did in coming to class. Being slightly more judicious with the readings (or adding a \"for historical context\" short piece instead of reading most of a book just to get that) might promote better class discussions. ",
            "\u00a0This course did a wonderful job in covering interactions between scientific and religious concepts all throughout history, even into the present day and into the future. I cannot think of any weaknesses. I think the amount of think pieces, the due dates of which were chosen by the students, was perfect. ",
            "\u00a0The readings were a lot for it to be a weekly basis. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include the great class discussions, weaknesses include the interest of the readings. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting course material, discussions were well facilitated by Professor Dal Prete or student presenters, reasonable reading load, professor and TF constantly available for feedback.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: readings jumped around a lot in both time and geographical region so difficult to find political/social historical grounding for analysis, class sometimes felt disjointed, readings were sometimes extremely specific (little background reading assigned to contextualize primary readings) ",
            "\u00a0This course is very broad so it can feel like you aren't really delving into any subject specifically. The student presentations were interesting, but I wished the professor lead more discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Some of the readings were pretty dense. I think more readings but less pages per reading would be better. It would also be nice to get a preview or review of the readings from the professor each week "

            "\u00a0Yes! The course offers up a historical perspective on the science/religion interaction in ways that are nuanced and surprising! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. It challenged a lot of my preconceived notions about science and religion. More importantly, it taught me critical thinking skills. ",
            "\u00a0Take any class with Ivano Dal Prete. He's a fun dude and an excited, engaged professor. You'll learn to question your opinions of both science and religion, and that's pretty cool. Also! There's not that much work at all. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would highly recommend this course to any student looking to better understand how history fuses various cultural traditions and ways of knowing into the various ways we understand the world. I think this course has also been invaluable to way I approach writing about history, as well as the ways I evaluate the validity of sources. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I'd recommend this to students looking for a seminar with high student engagement. If you do not know much about science and religion other than the conflict thesis, than I'd recommend you to take this to get a real understanding of their interaction. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this class to another student interested in religious studies, history of science, or more generally, intellectual history. Subject matter was a bit niche for my taste, but readings are generally well-assigned, Professor Dal Prete is quite knowledgeable, and discussions are well-run and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's not overwhelming and its interesting. The more you give to the course, the more it will give back to you. Do the readings, they are usually pretty good! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would caution you should be interested in the material however. "
