            "\u00a0I gained a much fuller understanding of the art history scene in America in the 1900s. We discussed movements, the way artists influenced and responded to each other, as well as trends across times and mediums. Each lecture and the discussion of each painting was thoughtfully put together and really interesting. ",

            "\u00a0This course teaches you about the progression of modernism in American art from 1900-1980s, while honing in on Social Realism, The Harlem Renaissance, The Great Depression, Cold War Culture, and Racism and Activism in America. Other key themes include gender, race, identity, mobility, and hybridity. All media of art are covered from photography to abstract expressionism, muralism to performance art. \r\nTaking this course helps place artists inside these traditions or realise how artists break traditions/respond to the historical events at the time. An implicit question at work in this course is how art can foster social activism, and the pieces studied in this course certainly push to challenge mainstream narratives. ",

            "\u00a0Such an interesting intersectional approach to the history of modern art. Social and political issues weren't ignored but woven into the fabric of discussion about these pieces. Art does not stand in a vacuum, and this course was much more than a museum exhibition. ",
            "\u00a0Could benefit from spending additional time on artists of color and expanding the art historical canon generally a good course with good readings and material though ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is Professor Raab's wonderful lectures. I absolutely loved them. They cover so much ground and are so insightful. Another strength is that because this class is about American modernism, the YUAG has so much that we can use in section. I think the biggest weakness is that the assignments are held to very high standards such to the point that it can be alienating for nonmajors, which was disappointing. ",
            "\u00a0Teaching and readings were superb - loved covering the portions of American art that often get overlooked. Really enjoyed how Professor Raab tied in social and historical conditions to all of the art we looked at. Wish that we could have covered the art of the 80s and 90s a bit more, but obviously the semester has limited time. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was well organized and engaging. the material was straightforward and the tests were fair. ",

            "\u00a0I loved this course! No suggestions. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I think Professor Raab is an amazing lecturer and made the lectures very engaging. Furthermore, I enjoyed the sections at the YUAG. The class has an organized structure and the TAs were very helpful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lots of older members of the New Haven community audited the course, leading to some distractions and quite a few snoring senior citizens next to me. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is with Prof. Raab who is knowledgeable, warm, and resourceful. She constantly connects material with current issues and includes contemporary work that addresses problems of gender, violence, and racism. The lectures were well structured, the work well curated, and it was a treat to have sections at the YUAG. Being able to see work discussed in class is unparalleled. \r\n\r\nImprovements:\r\n\r\n1. The readings. Some were well-rehearsed in lecture, while with others, it was unclear as to why they were included, as section never discussed them, nor did they come up much in class. Some were quite technical, and some more useful than others. Maybe a better way to implement all the readings would be best? Or a small assignment that works with the readings themselves? Or more attention to which readings are used.\r\n\r\n2. The assignments. Expectations for the written work could be laid out clearly with proper examples of what art history papers should look like. \r\n\r\n3. Section. Generally a wonderful experience, but sometimes comments were not conducive to learning. It might be conducive to provide examples of visual analysis in the beginning that's unique to art, in a way that discourages inane comments. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: pace, material is super interesting, professor is INCREDIBLY eloquent\r\nWeaknesses: maybe too much of a survey class? Could have been more balanced in workload. I think it would have been helpful if the professor took questions and comments during class, but then again, theres so much content to cover that i dont know if this would be feasible. ",
            "\u00a0Because the timeline of the course is so long, its hard to get a distinct feel for what \"modernism\" or \"modernity\" even is. That being said, Professor Raab does an excellent job of tying together artistic movements, while still making each feel important contributions to the American artistic tradition. ",
            "\u00a0This course yas great lectures and sections are taught in YUAG Wwbich is very helpful and fun.  The downside of this course is the fact that we are given feedback with no opportunity to improve. The teachers were very critical of our writing. ",
            "\u00a0A great survey of 20th century modern American art. I used to find abstract art really pretentious and obscure, but after learning about it in lecture and through the readings I've come to appreciate it a lot more. This class covers everything from photography to painting to sculpture, so it's definitely a survey. You figure out what you're really interested in when you write the papers though. Overall, it's a great class for anyone interested in modern art. Definitely relevant for today. Section in the YUAG is great. ",
            "\u00a0Great content and interesting and well structured lectures. The sections added little to the material studied in class. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing lectures by Professor Raab. It was a unique opportunity to have section in the YUAG every week and actually see works by the artists we discussed in lecture. ",
            "\u00a0I think both Prof. Raab and the TFs were exceptionally knowledgeable and well prepared. Grading was tough but fair, which I respect. I would have liked more specific feedback on my first paper than (in essence) \"close but no cigar.\" Admittedly, I should've gone to office hours to ask my TF in person. ",
            "\u00a0This course focuses on a very specific area of art history, specifically American art from 1900 to 1980, and allowed me to better understand a large part of American political and cultural history. Unfortunately, however, the course mentioned very few works by women and nonwhite artists and so the course could have included more works by these people. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures are well structured and Professor Raab is fascinating to listen to. The readings could have been better incorporated into the class material. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were all great. I loved section and feel like I learned a lot from my TF and my peers. One weakness is that I felt like section was a little rushed and we did not have that much time to discuss each work of art. ",
            "\u00a0I LOVED the lectures for this course. Professor Raab's lectures demonstrate extensive research and brilliant analysis. Her manner of describing art is always engaging and surprising; I felt myself wanting to write down almost every word she said. The vividness of her descriptions inspired me to hone my own art analysis skills. She is FANTASTIC and ENGAGING. The readings, too, were excellent if you took the time to read them on schedule. Rather than assigning a generic textbook, Professor Raab assigned in-depth articles about specific artists and works. My least favorite part of this class was section because I felt like there were too many pieces to discuss and we rushed through. It was not ideal for students who like some time to collect their thoughts and reflect before speaking. I also felt that the instructions for the final paper should have been clearer. ",
            "\u00a0So many strengths - Professor Raab's lecture style is incredible. Section was always organized and engaging. Can't think of a single weakness. ",

            "\u00a0An inspiring overview of modernism in America. It will challenge your notions of what art is and why artists are inspired to create in the first place. These questions are posed during one of the most exciting periods in human history, 1900-1980 in the United States. There's an inexhaustible amount to explore. ",
            "\u00a0Good overview of American Modernism if you're unfamiliar with the historical processes that guided its development in the United States. Professor Raab is a great lecturer and section is generally interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, with one caveat. It's a wonderful lecture. I learned so much and totally loved every minute of the lecture. Professor Raab is absolutely amazing, and you get to see extraordinary art in section each week. And though the course covers mainstream American modernist art, it also covers a lot of artists who were marginalized and might not always make it into the canon. My one caveat I would definitely recommend this as a Cr/D to a non art history major, because I absolutely loved the course but found the high standards on the assignments and lack of clear feedback to be stressful. The readings were also very theoretical and I sometimes felt behind. I did not Cr/D and felt very stressed anytime an assignment rolled around, but I still loved the course. Also, a 14 page paper AND a final was a lot more than I anticipated it would be. ",
            "\u00a0Strongly recommend this course! One of the best art history classes I've taken at Yale--you learn not only about art in America, but also the historical and social conditions that produced it. Professor Raab is so eloquent and an incredible lecturer--time flies in her class. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! I LOVED this course and love Professor Raab. She frisky changed my opinion on modern art and kept me thoroughly engaged in the material with her passion for the works of art. Take it !!!! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this course!! It is so interesting and well designed. Professor Raab is incredible and you will leave wanting to take more courses with her. Section in the gallery is super interesting and the Yale resources make this class even better. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this class! Would definitely recommend it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to a student with some background in History of Art. As a first-year student who had never taken an art history class, I found myself needing to catch up with basic terms. I would recommend people take Intro to History of Art first, or taking this class credit/D/fail if it is your first ever art history class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely. This is one course you come away with not only learning concrete things but thinking about problems in society today and how artists both in the past and present try to address those issues. The course is very inclusive of a wide array of issues, and the lectures are all interesting. Going to the YUAG once a week is a real treat, and the professor is knowledgeable and passionate. One word of advice is that workload is quite high for an introductory art class, and whom you have for a TA makes all the difference. ",
            "\u00a0YES - to a student who likes art or doesnt. If you do not do much art history, get ready to memorize twice a semester. If you do, youre totally fine. Course is so interesting! Well structured! Prof is a dream! Intersectional! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but that student has to either have experience in art history, or be prepared to ask \"silly\" questions to catch up, because a lot of jargon is taken for granted in this course. ",
            "\u00a0If youre interested in modern art, learning more about art in America, or learning to write a different way, I think this class is great. ",
            "\u00a0HSAR 211 is a fantastic course that provides students with an opportunity to engage with often less heralded art of the 20th Century. As the course title states, this is a class dedicated to American art. The lectures are interesting and entertaining, sections in the YUAG are a great time, and Professor Raab is phenomenal. ",
            "\u00a0Take it if you're interested in modern American art or if you've ever felt like you should spend more time in the YUAG (you should!). The workload is manageable and the lectures are always interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course! Professor Raab is amazing; she described this course as the modern art course she wishes was offered when she was in college, and I think it perfectly achieves her aim. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course, especially if you are interested in learning what modern and abstract art is all about. I am a math major with no experience in art history and I really felt like I walked away with a new ability to evaluate and discuss art. ",
            "\u00a0A thoroughly enjoyable and well-taught course. Minimal overlap with HSAR 115, which was pleasantly surprising. My main regret as a (now second-semester) senior is that I didn't take more courses in the History of Art department. They are by no means easy (unless you're some kind of prodigy, which I am not), but the workload is generally concentrated and the teaching superb. \r\n\r\nBack to details of 211 that would be useful: the workload is highly concentrated but on average less work than an average class. Readings are supplementary and useful but not strictly required. (You have to cite them in the exams, though.) Strictly speaking, lecture is also optionalbut a) you'd be a fool to take this class and not show up to the lectures, because they're almost-always exceptional and b) the TFs are no fools and it will be abundantly clear in section if you haven't been to lecture. (No, just because you did DS does not mean that you are God's gift to making smart-sounding comments on a whim. Seriously, we *all* know. Your TFs are grad students. They've made enough uninformed comments in their time to spot one of yours.)\r\n\r\nGrading was, in my experience, tough but fair by lecture standards. Don't expect a flat A unless you really know your stuff. Overcome your fear of criticism and take a well-taught, interesting course if the topic is even vaguely interesting to you. You'll learn something and have a good time doing it. ",
            "\u00a0YES, I would highly recommend this course to bother student both those interested in pursuing art history as a major and those not. This course was invaluable in teaching me to look closely and learning about a large part of my history as an American and encouraging my own independent study and interest with art history. ",
            "\u00a0For people who have never taken an academic course in art history, this is a great primer. 20th century American is rich and varied. There is quite a bit of reading and the essays are graded sternly, so be prepared to put in the work (or take it credit/D). ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would. As my first art history class, modern art was really challenging and personally difficult for me to analyze. However I do feel like I learned a lot and enjoyed the class. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I already have recommended this class (or any class of Professor Raab's) to practically everyone I know. For anyone who would like to appreciate American art more or see art presented in the most thoughtful, lyrical language, this class is a must! ",
            "\u00a0TAKE THIS COURSE! If you are interested in modern art, think you might be interested or are not even sure what modern art is, then take this!! It will provide you with such an amazing foundation of knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student if that student had an interest in modern art. If not, I'm not sure I would. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It's a fun, engaging art history lecture and you learn about great art works. "
