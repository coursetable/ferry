            "\u00a0This class helped me so much to develop my writing skills and my own form of writing. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about the history of minimalist music and the composers involved! ",
            "\u00a0-was exposed to an expansive and detailed survey of American minimalist music \r\n-explored and experimented with writing conventions and format through weekly essays\r\n-practiced public speaking through weekly presentations\r\n-applied knowledge and techniques developed in the course for a large end-of-term research paper ",
            "\u00a0This course claims to be both a writing and music course and delivers on both fronts.  Every week you learn about new minimalist composers/compositions within a certain decade, and every week you also write a paper about the topics covered.  Papers are extremely modest in length, never going over two pages with the exception of the final paper.  However, the writing in this course is very much quality over quantity; the grading of writing is fair but very specific and in-depth.  On the music side of things, you learn how to better listen to and understand the structure of new pieces of music.  This is especially true of music that is radically experimental and original, a description that fits many of the compositions you will listen to  in this course. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: Constant writing. Weekly two page essays was a way to constantly keep us writing and getting better. 5 person class allowed for great feedback from all students because we could get familiar with everyone's writing style\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Eventually, I got tired of writing just because two pages a week was a lot. ",
            "\u00a0The small nature of the class kept it a lot of fun. I was able to engage with the material and get to know all of my classmates really well! ",
            "\u00a0-very well formatted, especially in terms of size\r\n-the field trip may have panned out if planned earlier\r\n-enjoyed the guest speakers\r\n-good direct feedback on every paper\r\n-sometimes feedback came a little late\r\n-the listening quizzes could have been implemented earlier\r\n-I liked the unknown listenings in particular ",
            "\u00a0Most of what I have to say about this course is positive: it's interesting, well-organized, covers a wide variety of topics, and has a very reasonable workload. "

            "\u00a0Yes! It was so much fun and I learned a great deal of interesting history! ",
