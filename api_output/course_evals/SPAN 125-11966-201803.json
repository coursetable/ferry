            "\u00a0Learned basic conversational Spanish. As the name implies, this course is intense. Lots of work and class time. But it really pays off. Within the space of a few months I developed my Spanish skills and improved immensely. Taking this class has made me excited to continue studying Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0I gained Spanish speaking, reading, and writing skills and improved my language skills far more than I thought was possible in one semester! ",
            "\u00a0I was definitely able to involve listening, speaking, and writing Spanish by taking this course. ",
            "\u00a0Really great and integrative class that helped me foster my Spanish speaking and comprehension skills. We learned the language through regular practice and class activities as well as through culturally responsive/relevant movies, music, and literary pieces. ",
            "\u00a0The intricacies and beauty of language. This course offers and in depth look and intensive look into language. The large time commitment make learning a language a necessity and a great way to fully immerse yourself into learning a language. ",
            "\u00a0I learned conversational Spanish for various contexts and a good level of listening and reading comprehension. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal of vocabulary and almost all of the verb tenses in Spanish. The course developed my reading, writing, speaking, and listening comprehension skills. This gave me the confidence to conduct conversations in Spanish, and if I go to a Spanish-speaking country I have the ability to communicate with and understand others. ",
            "\u00a0This class felt like a mini-immersion program at the beginning of my day. Prof. Sab made sure to train us on every aspect of the language, from speaking to writing to those tiny little grammatical details that make the difference between sounding like an American and a native speaker  and she did it with a sense of humor, rigor, and rapid-fire organization. "

            "\u00a0Very strong course; I wish there were more opportunities outside of class to speak in a more casual manner i.e. more office hours, spanish films, doing activities as a class. \r\n\r\nIn general the class is well designed for student learning and is great the way it is. ",
            "\u00a0This course was incredible. It was fun and engaging, and something to look forward to every day. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course involves all the well-organized activities that will help you learn Spanish. But for people who have not been through the process of learning a new language, this may be a challenge. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: A large time commitment to fully immerse yourself in the language. Great introduction into the culture\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The material is at time rushed because of the shortness of the semester ",
            "\u00a0The course moves very quickly and is immersive, which is great if you want to pick up a language and start speaking straight away. The resources were at exactly the right level to be challenging but fun, and every class was engaging. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is its routine, the steady workload that develops a broad range of skills, and Professor Sab, whose humor, organization, and dedication to the course makes it a great experience. The weakness of the course is that sometimes it feels like a high school class, with basic activities (inevitable in basic language courses) and occasionally busy work to fill the almost two hours of class each day. ",
            "\u00a0I can't think of a single weakness. Rigorous assessments, a commitment to speaking Spanish throughout the entire class, nightly homework that really helped hammer in some of the major grammatical concepts, and a friendly learning environment made this one of the best language courses I've ever taken, at Yale or elsewhere. Take it if you get the chance. "

            "\u00a0Yes! If you want to develop your Spanish skills quickly, this class is perfect. However I would not recommend this class to someone just looking to get the language requirement out of the way. SPAN 125 requires extensive time and effort. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It is one of the best courses I have taken. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who is serious about learning Spanish, and believe that language could only be obtained in an immersive environment. This class definitely is able to provide that environment. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class!! The professor and material are amazing and easily accessible. ",
            "\u00a0Yes it is a great way for students who have some Spanish background and are looking to refresh themselves and relearn the language. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely!!! If you want a fast introduction to Spanish, you can't do much better than a daily two-hour dose of Lourdes. The class was engaging and fun, and gave me a solid foundation in Spanish and cultures of the Spanish-speaking world. The fast pace can be challenging but if you keep on top of the assigned work, it's very manageable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It's a great, structured way to obtain a level of conversational Spanish. Even if you don't continue with L3/L4, it's a strong foundation in the language. The workload is 1-2 hours of homework a night, though the expectations and grading are very fair. There are many factors/assignments that go into the final grade, which gives you ample opportunity to make up for any weaknesses you may have in one area or subject. ",
            "\u00a0YES. But only if you're prepared to really learn Spanish  to not just get a basic vocabulary and a semi-proficient understanding of grammar, but to put in the effort that comes with acquiring a full range of expression. It'll be hard. Embrace it. "
