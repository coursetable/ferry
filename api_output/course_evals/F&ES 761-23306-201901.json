            "\u00a0I learned about the entirety of the climate change regime, from its late 80s/early 90s roots up until the Paris Agreement today. We learned to analyze mandates and their consequent agreements, understand the nuanced language and negotiating skills necessary to develop such instruments, work within the confines of national and international political scenes, and negotiate our own statements. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to unpack an international climate change agreement, its various sections and the language used within each clause/provision. Using the nuances of language and constructive ambiguity, I practiced negotiation skills similar to actual COP meetings. I gained a deeper appreciation of the US position in international climate negotiations and the role that they continue to play. ",
            "\u00a0I learned an insane amount about the process and history of international climate agreements. There is no better way to learn about the dynamics of historic climate agreements. ",
            "\u00a0A greater understanding of the beaurocratic process. ",
            "\u00a0(1) I learned the story of international climate negotiations, which was fantastic. \r\n(2) But more importantly, I learned very practical skills: How and why to write clearly and concisely, how to condense a complex topic into a format easy to understand, how to isolate the key points from a reading, and then how to orally communicate these points in a group setting. \r\n(3) I learned how important language is to negotiations.

            "\u00a0I didn't know what to expect going into this class--just that I wanted to take it because I knew so little about the subject material and wanted to get a taste of the international climate scene. I was pleasantly surprised with such a well-structured, well-thought out, and detailed class. Sue Biniaz is THE person to learn from on this stuff, and she brought in just the right amount of anecdotes to make her points come alive. The readings also seemed chosen purposefully, and I learned a lot from them each week. ",
            "\u00a0The knowledge that I gained from the class exceeded my expectations. Other classes that I took about similar climate change agreement materials did not give me the same satisfaction and learning output as this class. I believe I can use the knowledge and skills in further research, and Sue was an exceptional resource. ",
            "\u00a0They surpassed my expectations in many ways. I was expecting there to be a little more about the law involved, but I was not disappointed about the focus on the logistics of actually negotiating these agreements that Sue set for the class. ",
            "\u00a0I was expecting it to be centered around more activism, rather than politics. ",

",
            "\u00a0The course was intentional and concise in the skills and knowledge it was meant to cover. Each class session was planned well to deal with a certain topic, and we kept abreast with the readings and syllabus. I enjoyed the negotiation sessions that we had to work with a partner, and I hope it weighed fairly into our class participation grade. Sue was also able to bring in exceptional speakers who really added to our learning on each topic, such as non-governmental participation in climate agreements, climate finance, and US negotiations. The assignments were also manageable and detailed enough to make us think about problem-solving on international environmental agreements as if we were government negotiators ourselves.\r\n\r\nOne weakness I would find is important to fill is that the law school and FES calendar as mismatched, such that a significant number of students missed out on a class during the spring break. I suggest having a make-up class in lieu of the missed session. I would have also appreciated letter-grade feedback for each assignment, and mid-semester class participation feedback to know how I was on track. ",
            "\u00a0Strength is that it is relevant, real-world stuff, coming from an instructor who has been in the trenches doing the work.\r\n\r\nI wish, however, that Sue would take some of the political knowledge she's gained over the years, and help us learn how to find chinks in the armor, to have a real-world chance to change things; not simply how to work within the confines of the system. ",

            "\u00a0You probably won't be called out in class to prove you've prepared, but the best way to get the most out of the class is to do the readings and really prepare for the negotiations. ",
            "\u00a0take it even if you are not considering participating in any negotiation process - if you are planning to work on any topics relating to the environment on an international or even regional scale, this class is so useful! Sue is incredibly insightful and you will have a much better understanding of the substance, process, and communication surrounding international environmental agreements. ",
            "\u00a0Be prepared to do the readings each week in order to follow along with the nuances brought out in class by Sue. Also make sure you leave enough time for the assignments--there aren't many of them, and they aren't too difficult, but you do need to put a lot of thought into crafting a logical and easily-understood argument. And go to office hours! ",
            "\u00a0This course is amazing and definitely worth your while. I learned so much from Prof Sue Biniaz. She's an extremely experienced environmental lawyer and negotiator, and her personal wealth of knowledge is very inspiring. I think the readings will be relevant and engaging, especially since they are brief enough to read, so keep up with the readings and you'll get the most out of the class. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take copious notes in class and get to know Sue, She's awesome and very generous with her time. ",
