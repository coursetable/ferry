            "\u00a0- I got MUCH better at reading and writing in Russian.\r\n- I gained the ability to read difficult literature in Russian (still far from perfect)\r\n- I also got much better at analyzing literature ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about Nabokov and his style and the Russian literary tradition. My reading and writing abilities improved dramatically over the course of the term. ",
            "\u00a0You get a wonderful and thorough introduction to the major Russian works of Nabokov. You tackle 4 major works of Nabokov (reading them all in Russian fully): the Eye, Defense of Luzhin, Invitation to a Beheading, and The Gift. Constantine is an expert on Nabokov; he knows everything from his influences to his personal life to his literary devices. ",
            "\u00a0My Russian vocabulary, reading comprehension, fluency, and understanding of the Russian canon and literary tradition improved tremendously. ",
            "\u00a0I significantly improved my Russian, especially my reading and writing skills. I also gained a thorough understanding of Nabokov's view of art and its relationship to life. Overall, I feel like I am walking away with a very complete knowledge of Nabokov's Russian works and the various motifs and stylistic devices he used within them. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0- There's so much work. I know that it is meant to be a challenging course but sometimes I feel that the fact that it is expects so much leads students to read in English just so that they can finish the assignments by the due date. ",
            "\u00a0The work load is a bit unpredictable for this course. We were often asked to read rather a lot of text all at once, but then in class we would only cover a very small amount and then not be asked to read again for a while when a similar thing would happen again. ",
            "\u00a0This course extremely depends upon how much effort you put into it. The task is colossal, especially if you do not have a ton of experience with Russian (I has only a year of intensive exposure before the course). Nabokov is hard to understand in English and even harder in Russian so you have to commit if you want to get the reward from this course. I'm sure you could read everything in English only or only read parts of the work and do well in the course. But this will deprive you from full immersing into the world of Nabokov, which Constantine will guide you through. ",
            "\u00a0I think the class should have been focused more on reading comprehension than analysis. It might also have been better to dive deeply into one book, maybe Dar, instead of run through many books without fully understanding them. ",
            "\u00a0The class covers a decent amount of material, most of Nabokov's early works which were written in Russian. Much of the class revolves around discussion of aesthetic theory and the purpose of art, or how the artist fits into society. The material was very interesting, though Nabokov definitely isn't for everyone (I know some students in the class began to find Nabokov's style too ostentatious at the end). Having read Lolita and Pale Fire, I knew what I was getting into. This class has a pretty difficult workload, lots of reading each week, but Constantine is pretty understanding and the assessments are always very fair. I wasn't always able to finish the readings but paying attention in class and understanding key themes in the books was usually enough to do well on the exams. ",
            "\u00a0This course is really ambitious in scope, which is both a good thing and a bad thing. In reading as much and as quickly as we did, we definitely learned a ton--but at times, the pace was so rapid that it felt like we were rushing through significant parts/ glossing over some really interesting things. This was especially true when we read \"The Gift\"; I think we could have spent at least another two weeks discussing the novel, but we ran out of time. On a similar note, the workload was pretty overwhelming. Again, with weekly reading responses, vocab quizzes, unit tests, and dozens of pages to read every day, it felt like the syllabus was trying to fit way too much into a limited timeframe. Overall, though, I did learn a lot (and learned to interact with literature in a completely new way) and enjoyed my time in the class. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely. You get so much better at Russian (specifically reading.... it doesn't really help your speaking ability). Constantine is the best ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would. This class was very interesting and opened my eyes to a new type of literature that I hadn't read before. Definitely for seasoned speakers of Russian though. ",
            "\u00a0If you are committed to reading everything in Russian, then yes take this course. It will not only help you improve your Russian, but expose to the Russian origins of one of the greatest authors of all time. I wouldn't worry about the difficulty of the course in terms of grading, but I also would not recommend the course if you just want to put in the minimal effort required. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course only if you already have a very good ability to read long Russian texts. For the first-time Russian student in a literature class, this would not be appropriate. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely, if you are able to read Russian and are interested in Russian literature definitely take this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only take it with the understanding that you will be expected to WORK. You learn a lot and your Russian improves pretty dramatically, but that comes at the price of a pretty crushing amount of work. But if you're interested in reading Russian literature (even if you don't have much of a literature background to begin with) this is definitely the most comprehensive and in-depth class you'll find on the subject.
