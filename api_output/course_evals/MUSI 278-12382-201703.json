            "\u00a0The course is really based on what you put into it- the reading are fairly in depth, though occasionally overly dry and academic, and separate the course from just being a summary of the history of the music. On the other hand, most people don't do the reading so its not very much work other than the four papers assigned. The papers are decently long for a class that isn't a writing credit and the prompts often arent posted until within a week of the due dates. The course overall felt a bit disorganized at times, and we didn't really get to much of modern hip-hop. It felt like a mostly dub-centric course, with some background into the foundations of hip-hop, but really not discussion much after the 90's. The final paper is actually pretty interesting in how open it is, and really gives you an opportunity to research whatever seems cool, especially the modern stuff that wasn;t really covered in class ",
            "\u00a0Very compelling lectures and readings! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: material!! super interesting, and great subject-matter expertise from the professors. i also really enjoyed some of the readings (i loved \"the social genesis of sound fidelity,\" plus the aesthetic-analysts-slash-historians like schloss and fouch). i also had a nice time with the straightforward \"did you absorb the things we talked about in the readings and class\" format of the term papers.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: other readings too dense/theoretical to relate to class discussion or not mentioned; disorganization. \r\nSpecifically: first paper deadline was still during shopping period for some students; prompts were released really late; last in-term paper deadline was really close to reading week when other classes were already doing end-of-term projects; syllabus typo in which the deadline for a paper was listed separately as two different dates. readings changed often and were posted last minute or even after they were due to be read--some of the late readings were clearly late b/c John Klaess was trying to change the readings to be responsive to class. that was awesome, but the tradeoff was that few people did the readings. also, the first part of the dub part of the class were done as a lecture in which we were not held accountable for readings, so i think people got into the habit of not doing them from that as well. \r\n\r\na lot of the disorganization got better over the course of the term as the professors got into the groove, so i think much of it might have been because it was the first year the course ran. if the course runs again, i would check through the syllabus for typos, and maybe shift the introductory unit to the end and make it a concluding unit? it seemed like those texts related to both dub and hip-hop, and could just as easily be studied at the end with retroactive applications to the genres as at the beginning. this move would also allow the last term paper to not be so close to the deadline for the final paper--instead of having a \"unit quiz\" paper for this synthetic unit, the class could instead be required to include a source or two from this unit in final papers, or an in-class midterm could be held. (basically, i am in favor of any change that results in two papers not being written for this class so close together in time.) \r\n\r\none final thing that would be helpful would be to clarify, in writing, the class policy for accessing readings. because the posting of readings was inconsistent, i was not sure which readings were my job to get versus the professors' job. ",
            "\u00a0The only weakness of this course is that it will probably be a one-time offering. The professors also could have been more strict about student accountability for the readings and listenings. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Veal simply wasn't organized. I received only half of my papers back, which hampered my abolity to improve my writing and thinking skills. ",
            "\u00a0The language of the course can be esoteric at times but it exposes you to a lot of information. ",
            "\u00a0the format of the course as far as the dub unit and hip-hop unit can use some modification. The time frame for each unit was not effective. The introductory unit was counterproductive at best. A final class session to wrap up all material would also be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very thorough and detailed in investigating certain areas and ideas  in the histories of both Dub music and Hip-Hop music. It, however, suffered from material organization in that the course focused unevenly on the history of Dub music, leaving the history of Hip-Hop music relegated to only a few weeks of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0This class was fantastic. The first unit was rather difficult but was necessary to give the rest of the course a solid template for reflection. Overall great course. One thing I would like to see is a little more detail on the syllabus as far as dates for assignments, but everything worked out in the end so its not too crucial. "

        [
            "\u00a0If you're willing to grind out the 4 papers, its really not too much work otherwise and at times is actually very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Great class! It's a lot of writing, but the lectures were really compelling. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a really fun introduction to hip-hop and dub, which was a really interesting and influential genre that involved the pre-digital remixing of Jamaican music like reggae. The semester I took this course, there were a fair number of organizational hiccups because it was the course's first time being offered, but the material was still really compelling. The grading came solely from papers (1 short, 2 medium, and 1 long) and class participation, which was a little weird because it's a lecture and not a seminar. A lot of people seem to blow the work for this class off, which made me a little sad because there's not a ton of work and most of it was interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yesthe ability to discuss the intersection of politics and music-making is very relevant to the modern mind. ",
            "\u00a0yes! Veal is an incredible professor. anyone who listens to the music he teaches about or ethnomusicology should take a class of his. Klaess, who instructed the hip hop portion was also fantastic: incredibly knowledgeable and great at stimulating thought provoking discussions. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend this course to another student because it was fun, challenging, and gave me information and knowledge that I cannot get anywhere else. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course. It is fun and insightful and provides valuable knowledge on the musical genres. ",
            "\u00a0For students interested in either dub or hip-hop this is a must take. Professor Veal is also a great lecturer and would recommend this class just to hear him talk about the two genres. Overall tone of the class was very laid-back, allowing for easy participation and an overall good time while in class. Klaess is also a genius when it comes to all things hip-hop, and while the two have different styles of teaching, they had an incredible chemistry when it came to leading the class. The transition between the dub and hip-hop units felt very natural. "
