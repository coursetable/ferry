            "\u00a0A sense of the field of STS and the major debates, questions, and problems (ha!) which are ongoing in the field. It was also a wonderful introduction to the different methods and objects available within the field. This was one of the most well constructed syllabi I have ever worked with. ",
            "\u00a0This course exposed me to STS theories that I need to be familiar with in order to engage with the scholars who are working in my field. These theories and methods we discussed also gave me tools that I can apply to my own work as a historian of science and medicine. ",
            "\u00a0I got a much firmer handle on the foundational texts of science studies. It has been probably the most useful course I have taken at Yale, as I've been able to apply a lot of the theoretical concepts from this course to other projects I'm working on. This was also the first course I've taken that had so many individual reading assignments each week, and I was able to learn how to manage multiple readings and arguments about a single topic. It forced me to find better ways to take notes about readings in order to keep track of all of them. ",
            "\u00a0A better understanding of science & technology practice, critical engagement with everyday technologies ",
            "\u00a0This course truly helped me develop an understand of what STS is as a field, both in terms of the contours of the field, its history, and the directions I can take it for my own research purposes. It was SO helpful! ",
            "\u00a0I became literate in a field to which I was previously relatively unexposed to in a way that was incredibly gratifying. I also got in the habit of writing to a point more clearly about material I was still working through. This class was so useful in providing theories and frameworks to make sense of (the) world(s). ",
            "\u00a0In this course, I learned a great deal about the discipline of STS, and read many texts I had never read before. I also learned how to find common themes within many different kinds of texts and to ask critical questions across readings. I thought a lot about how my work fits within STS, and the relationship between STS and science. This was by far the best course I've taken so far at Yale, and the texts and themes we discussed in class have been and will to be very generative for my thinking. "

            "\u00a0This course was an incredible introduction to STS, which I think is essential for anyone who wants to engage seriously with the field. I cannot think of any major weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0There were so many readings assigned for this course, and they were so dense, that I often felt like I couldn't get as good of a grasp on them as I would have liked to. Class discussion helped me a good deal- we were able to flush things out so I always left feeling like I had a better grasp on them. But it was still very difficult. I wonder if less readings would be better? ",
            "\u00a0I think the structure of the course was really helpful for getting a sense of the major theory-methods packages of science studies. The weekly reading responses helped me engage with the material in a different way, and I liked that Lisa incorporated the responses into the class discussion. The two bigger writing assignments helped me review and process the course material and connect ideas from the course to my own work and interests. The only weakness I can think of is that the reading load was pretty heavy and dense, and we sometimes didn't discuss all of the readings. Maybe each week could have one fewer article to read? ",
            "\u00a0Strength: well-organized, excellently moderated discussions\r\nWeaknesses: reading list was very well-curated but readings were quite long for *some* weeks ",
            "\u00a0I have almost nothing but praise for this course. I think I especially loved how organized our class tome was. Although I appreciate free discussion, with something like this class, I do want the professor to take some lead and direction, giving us the lay of the land. And this is exactly what Lisa Messeri did. The only critique I would have would be that there might be too many readings for each week. Not in terms of page numbers but in terms of number of authors; we rarely got to all of them and I often felt like the last two were very shortchanged. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this courses sequential aspect and felt like each class nicely built up to the next one. The assignments were instrumentally valuable to my own thinking beyond just performing to demonstrate completion of the readings. Discussion was fine but I wish we either had more time to cover the readings or fewer readings to make the most of the time. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Great readings/texts; helpful commentary from the instructor on the texts and themes during class; overall good class discussion\r\nWeaknesses: No feedback on written responses; sometimes the class discussion took turns that got us off track, and we also did not always get to discuss everything we read to its full extent\r\nHow to improve: In certain weeks, it may serve the course to cut down on one reading in order to devote more time to overall discussion. Also, for students who led the class early on in the semester, having a bit more direction might have been useful. It was also difficult to turn in readings by 5pm on Monday and midnight would have been an easier deadline. "

            "\u00a0Yes! This was my favorite seminar this semester. The readings were wonderful, the different weeks of the syllabus spoke clearly to one another, and the course assessments were useful and relevant to my work even as someone from outside the field. They challenged us to think reflectively about the role of and processes which underlie academic work. I had a great time in this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think this course is necessary if you want to be a historian of science and medicine. This course was my first exposure to many of the methods and theories that we discussed, and I recognize that knowledge of these theories is vital to being a successful contributor to my field. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Lisa is a great teacher, and she fosters great discussion. The class had a great relaxed atmosphere. There was one week when a visiting accepted student was sitting in on the class, and I have a sense that he ended up deciding to come to Yale in part because of the class. The readings were really useful for my own work, and I imagine that I will return to a lot of the readings and my notes in the future. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely yes. The course sheds light on a much needed field (science & technology studies) and provides a depth and breadth of knowledge necessary to start engaging critically with technoscientific practice ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely would. I think this is a well organized and succinct intro into a very diverse and hard to define field! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It was fun, engaging, important material, and really representative of what critical thinking ought to look like. ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely!! One of the few courses in STS offered and a great course! "
