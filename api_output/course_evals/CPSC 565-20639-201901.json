            "\u00a0Theory of distributed systems, literally THEORY. ",
            "\u00a0I got a broad view of the theory of distributed systems, which I very much needed for my PhD research. I became familiar with the way distributed systems people think and with which they approach and analyze problems, the standard models used in the field, and what the interesting questions are. I learned that careful case analysis, although tedious and unpleasant at times, can bring you far in terms of proving theorems (in the discrete world at least). But I would say that the most important thing this course teaches is a distributed way of thinking and of analyzing and designing algorithms, which is radically different from the sequential one we are usually taught, but nevertheless is used in practice all the time, and so is important for a Computer Scientist to be familiar with. ",

",
            "\u00a0Although this is a pure theory course, I was still expecting some hands-on assignments in distributed systems applications. ",
            "\u00a0The material in this course was very interesting. I think there could have been more assignments to keep the course more engaging. Otherwise, the assignments were great and really helped reinforce the material from class. "
