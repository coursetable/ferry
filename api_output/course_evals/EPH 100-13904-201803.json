You really mean to tell me that waltzing in to a little Cover Letter Session and sitting in the back for 20 minutes is only worth 1/3 of the credits for enduring an entire day of nonesense? I'd urge the YSPH to reevaluate how they award credits!! It is not fair! You should also make zooming in an option or have some way to do make-ups. Like record the session and post a video online with a quiz or something. It shouldn't be this hard NOR should it place such a burden on the students. ",

As someone who has worked for 6 years, I'm not sure most of them are particularly useful for me, but I have the following things I think could be helpful for us older folks:\r\n1. a session towards people who have a career but are switching\r\n2. time management techniques!!!!!!!! These are so useful\r\n3. career mapping (things like purpose now, 5 year, 10 year)\r\n4. I think this is a thing already but salary/benefits negotiation\r\n5.

There are also too many requirements outside of class to make it to 8 sessions. May have been better to structure it for different levels students are in, because I felt so zoned out.

            "\u00a0I can't speak on the skills seminar offered during the week because of conflicting schedules. The Saturday session offered on public speaking helped me to learn how to speak about myself in under 5 minutes. The video recordings will come in handy in the future. ",
            "\u00a0This course is clearly tailored for recent undergraduates with very little to no work experience. As someone who has been working for a few years, I found this course material unhelpful. Additionally, I'm a joint degree with SOM and receive much of my professional services education through the SOM curriculum so I don't think this series added to my knowledge. I suggest removing this requirement for SOM joint degree students since professional development is such a key part of the SOM curriculum. ",
            "\u00a0The professional skills series is generally beneficial, however as a student with work experience after undergrad, I find some of the topic areas to be rudimentary. For me personally, I would have appreciated more sessions dedicated to the summer internship. The one session I attended was very helpful! ",

I think people should be able to opt out if they have done the latter. It conflicted with the global health seminar in the evening, so I had to attend the noon ones. And the noon ones conflicted with my actual paying job, forcing me to work later hours to make up for it. The sessions have useful information, but definitely make assumptions about the participants. I appreciate that they are offered, but really don't think they should be mandatory. ",

            "\u00a0I have enjoyed each of the sessions I have been to so far - they are very helpful! Specifically I really enjoyed the speed interview session. One downside of this course is that it is difficult scheduling-wise. The sessions are offered at inconvenient times. ",

",
            "\u00a0This series is great for younger students who may not have a lot of work experience - however, I don't think the topics overall quite apply to folks who already have job experience in different industries. I would love for there to be more variety that could be more geared towards people with more years of experience. Also, need more varied times/sections. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course is geared more towards students with little to no professional experience. As someone with a few years' work experience, I found some of the modules of this course (such as Resume and Cover Letter writing) unhelpful. I think students with a certain amount of outside work experience should be allowed to place out of some or all of the modules in this course. That being said, I thought all of the seminars that included panels with employers, alumni and/or students were generally very informative and helpful. ",
            "\u00a0not very well advertised timings of the class ",

            "\u00a0I was frustrated with the timing of the professional skills seminars because they often overlapped with the required Global Health Seminar. I attended both of the Saturday seminars which were helpful, but I think they should have been worth more credit because the relation of time to credit on the Saturday ones was not the same as the ration of time to credit on the ones during the rest of the week. Also, two of the seminars I had planned to attend were cancelled or moved to a time I could not attend, which was also frustrating. ",
            "\u00a0This course provides me with essential job-hunting skills. ",
            "\u00a0I was a bit skeptical of the session before starting it but I actually found it very helpful. Both the coaches I worked with gave very useful feedback and I liked that they were not trying to impose a certain \"style\" of speaking as correct but rather helping students improve themselves within their own personal style. The exercises and format of the workshop were also good. ",

            "\u00a0Its a good course, just the timing conflicted with the global health seminar which was very frustrating. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, the sessions are hit-or-miss. Some of the info provided is extremely basic, but sometimes I learn something I truly didn't know before. Overall, it can feel like a chore to attend some of the sessions, but it also makes sense that not everyone has had the same exposure. ",
            "\u00a0This course is not at all useful for anyone who has worked in a professional setting prior to attending YSPH. The sessions during the week clearly cater to the lowest common denominator and provide rudimentary information for students who do not have experience working in a professional setting. For instance, one session titled, \"Navigating the MPH job market\" focused entirely on the basics of reading a job posting. While this may have been helpful for a handful of students, the vast majority felt that a much more helpful use of their time for a similar session would be focusing on emerging employment trends for people with MPH degrees. Alternatively, the Saturday sessions were much more helpful because these included tailored one-on-one skill building and coaching. However, it is impractical to ask students to attend lengthy Saturday sessions. Additionally, the required 8 credits for this course seems like a waste of time for most students if the sessions during the week cover only extremely basic employment skills. \r\n\r\nThis course might be improved by requiring fewer credits and/or providing some sessions tailored to students who do have professional experience and some for students who do not. ",
            "\u00a0Great way to ensure students gain information about professionalism and the working world. Unfortunately many of the sessions were offered on Thursdays evenings, which clashed with my Global Health Seminar Series ",
            "\u00a0I would want the programming to be more advanced. I understand the basics of writing a resume and cover letter and want that next level of guidance. ",
            "\u00a0I was deeply disappointed by this course. It routinely took away time that would have been better spent studying for my other courses.\r\n\r\nI have been in the professional world for a number of years and found all of the \"offerings\" relevant only to those with little or no work experience. I was particularly disappointed by the \"Navigating the MPH Job Market\" seminar as it lacked relevant insight into the MPH job market specifically. I found it was more of a \"Navigating the Job Market 101\" seminar.\r\n\r\nIn the future it would be beneficial to break students into sub-groups or allow students with significant professional experience to opt out. ",
            "\u00a0The professional skills seminar was often more of a chore than anything, and gave somewhat useful information on occasion. The source of my frustration is the worry that course materials (slides, etc.) will be shared between students who did and did not attend lectures. We are required to attend a certain number of lectures anyway, so I don't understand the emphasis on ensuring that only students who attended a lecture have access to those materials, especially because many of us were enrolled in a class at the same time and were unable to attend. This program is very short, and limiting materials that could have been helpful during the first semester on the premise that they will be available during the second semester seriously handicaps the students applying for internships during the winter break.
