            "\u00a0I learned to study and discuss photography in the context of black history. I learned about the various ways in which photography has been used for political and personal reasons and how to interpret formal choices in this light. ",
            "\u00a0Learned how to critically analyze a photograph and its formal qualities, using both historical context and critical art theory. ",
            "\u00a0It did a great job of showing how photography and images have affected the way Black people are defined and how they define themselves. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to analye and describe art photographs, and look at them within historical context. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about how Art history interprets photography and about black artists. ",
            "\u00a0I had never done any serious analysis of photographs before. This course was a fabulous introduction to putting history, theory, and form together to consider the politics of representation in photographic works. I also enjoyed learning to think about photography in conjunction with other media, such as text or collage. "

            "\u00a0The syllabus was amazing and Mercer did a great job of incorporating the readings into our discussions. I would have liked to read some books in addition to the essays. Two of our classes met in Yales archives but I think the course wouldve benefitted from even more focus on photography in the archive. \r\n\r\nAlso  Prof Mercer has a habit of speaking before and after every student, in a way that sometimes limited our ability to really engage with each other and the material. I wouldve appreciated more space in the classroom to mull over the topics at hand. ",
            "\u00a0The seminar produced some very interesting discussions and Professor Mercer established a good balance of providing his own interpretations and allowing us to lead the discussion and contribute. At times it did seem like he was looking for a specific answer to a big interpretive question, which discouraged us from speaking from time to time, but on the whole I think I was a very open space. All of the readings were engaging and applicable to class and I was actually able to get through them all since he did not assign a copious amount of pages. The graded assignments were also really interesting and gave us a lot of leeway to talk about things we were interested in. The one aspect I might change is the feedback and grades- we met to discuss submitted assignments about midway through the semester but we never received any grades back. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Mercer is amazing. The class was organized, the readings and discussions were incredibly interesting. The only negative is that you dont get comments or grades on your papers but to fix this I just went to office hours and talked to him. ",
            "\u00a0The subject matter was a strength. Class discussion was a weakness. It could be improved by asking more open questions. ",
            "\u00a0The seminar wasnt facilitated the best for discussion because while the professor is very knowledgeable he was also searching for specific answers that we werent always aware of and things can be subjective in this field. ",
            "\u00a0A major strength was the focus on presentation-based assignments, especially where we could include feedback from our peers in a further revision of our projects. The syllabus was also arranged very precisely so that every week followed the last and built on the ones before. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely ",
            "\u00a0Definitely would recommend for both for art history majors or anyone else the body of work we studied is one that might not come up in a typical class but it is so rich and interesting. The readings are interesting and accessible and the written assignments and final presentation are spread out throughout the semester and did not require too much time. You might not get any feedback on your work until the end of the semester, but unless that sort of thing bothers you it wasn't a huge problem. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If youre interested in the history of the photography as a tool for decolonization and incited social change in the black Atlantic diaspora, take this course! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! it was so interesting ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course to another student. I think its interdisciplinary nature would make it appealing to students with all sorts of academic backgrounds, and not just art history or African American studies. "
