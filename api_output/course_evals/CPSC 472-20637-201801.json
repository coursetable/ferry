The initial psets were frustrating because they were vague and underspecified. Psets 4 and 5 were more interesting as they required coding. \r\n\r\nTAs were also great and came in clutch during OH. I wish there was a Piazza though. ",

Scaz is a great lecturer and is able to keep lectures engaging by including videos and providing a social perspective to the robots. The workload wasn't bad, 5 problem sets, and I loved the design aspect of the problem sets. The design questions were very open ended but from an engineering standpoint, I loved that. You could come up with whatever answer you wanted as long as it worked. The midterm and final were fair, although with such a range of subjects it was a bit difficult to tell what would be on the final. Even so, the final was very fair. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures in this class in general were pretty interesting. However the main issue was the grading as there wasnt really a right answer and it seemed like the grading was kind of arbitrary sometimes. Also they graded based on style which I think is unfair if you dont tell someone youre going to grade on style. ",
            "\u00a0Very efficient lectures, very comprehensive syllabus. I liked it as something in-between a survey of robotics and studying specific concepts in-depth. Some classes felt wasteful, unimportant, didn't fit in in a way that made sense  evolving robots, dynamical systems, false assumptions, autonomous cars, but the vast majority of classes seemed interesting, engaging, and/or relevant and I appreciated the new ideas to think about, particularly in a less technical manner. ",
            "\u00a0The course excels in its instruction--Scaz is a wonderful teacher who is clearly incredibly passionate about robotics. The only thing I would change about the course would be to set up a Piazza forum to ask questions. ",
            "\u00a0Scaz is a great lecturer and classes are very engaging. The course does a great job at inspiring you to pursue future careers in robotics and AI, but the downside of trying to cover such an immense field in 3 months is that you won't get to dive very deep into actually programming or implementing anything non-trivial.  Lectures veer between being very insightful and informative, to some that are essentially looking at videos of cool robots. Problem sets can be challenging and uncertain (no test cases to pass), but do not need significant mathematical or programming skills, and are definitely doable. The TAs are great and really helpful, and it's definitely worth getting to know them better. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are incredible; the assignments are substantial but not too much so; the tests are very reasonable. Overall, a fantastic course that does not require any changes. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very broad. I wish we could have focused more on certain parts that were crucial for the development of robots today. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course had a lot of strengths, especially the lectures and homeworks. I particularly enjoyed the coding homeworks. I thought the design homeworks were confusing and it was hard to get help on them. ",
            "\u00a0Scaz is a super engaging lecturer! Some homework were a big step up in difficulty from lectures and exams covered a lot of small details. Material is generally very interesting! ",
            "\u00a0Strength: the material is interesting, Scaz is great, and a lot of the class is talking about cool robots. Weakness: the early assignments concentrate on design more than programming, and that can be hard for computer science students. I also found they were graded on the harsher side. ",
            "\u00a0Scaz lectures very well ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of this course was the professor. Scaz did a great job making sure that each lecture was engaging and informative. I also appreciated how interdisciplinary the course was, in that we saw not only topics in computer science but also touched on topics in biology and psychology. The main way I feel like the course could be improved is I wish that we had gone into more depth into a few topics rather than a cursory overview of a bunch of different topics. I also wish we had more assignments that involved programming. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Scaz is a great lecturer and robotics is a very interesting field.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Psets were hard and required independent time to understand, because lectures did not dive deep enough into topics. ",
            "\u00a0The great strength of this course was that the psets reflected, tested, reinforced what we learned in class. The weakness of this course is that it is a survey course and there were many topics we just weren't able to learn about in deapth ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are fantastic. Honestly, the course had well thought out material, the expectations were reasonable, and the tests were fair. The weakest part of the class was the problem sets. Clarifications would come out late, or points would be deducted for things not specified in the assignment. Clearer communication for those would be much appreciated. ",
            "\u00a0Scaz is an amazing lecturer who really keep you engaged with the material. The psets in the second half of the course are also very interesting-you get to implement a genetic algorithm. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures for this course were engaging and interesting, and were very well organized - Scaz was able to fit a lot of information into the semester. This class felt more like a history than a computer science class. This isn't necessarily a weakness, but as a computer science major I wanted more coding. It was interesting working with the simulation program towards the end of the semester, and I think more problem sets could incorporate that software. ",
            "\u00a0Psets don't contribute to learning and are really superficial ",
            "\u00a0I think both the problem sets and lectures were strengths of this course. The problem sets were doable but also challenging. I feel that I learned about how to design architectures from the problem sets. The lectures were very well put together, informative and interesting.\r\n\r\nAt times I think the lectures could have been a little more detailed in the material they present. Also, the test could more closely match what was covered in class. ",
            "\u00a0We learned about many different robotics systems and technologies, but sometimes it was confusing how each part fit together and related to each other. Also, with some of the more technical skills and details we learned, we didn't do many examples in class, so it was hard to implement them in the psets. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of the lectures were very, very interesting, and the psets (especially the last two) were actually really fun. The first couple of psets were a little vague in what they asked for. I felt really supported by the teaching staff. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Lots of fun information learned, Scaz is super knowledgeable and makes everything interesting\r\nWeakness: the exams and p sets are all over the place. The homeworks have a sort of arbitrary grading scale and feedback isn't the most clear on it and the exams test a lot of seemingly random details that aren't always covered in the homework or extensively in class. It's kind of a mixed bag ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are very interesting and Scaz showed us many cool videos about robots. The workload is also relatively light (3 lectures a week) and the problem sets are not hard. However, sometimes the problem sets leave you hanging as it covers content not exactly covered in class and so you will have to go for office hours to clarify many concepts. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- Scaz is a great lecturer! The lectures had fantastic material and it was really engaging. I did not want to miss this class. I also quite enjoyed the psets, even though some of them were really frustrating in the moment to work through, however figuring them out was a great feeling. \r\nWeaknesses- Office hours were relatively infrequent compared to other classes of similar sizes, more teaching staff could be used in the future. The psets could have been more balanced so that the latter did not take as long as the former took longer. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures for this course were a genuine pleasure to sit through. The professor was engaging, the material was interesting, and the slides were easy to follow. You could really tell Scaz cared about what he was talking about. However, while the final exam was great, the midterm was rather difficult and some homework assignments were also hard. Overall, a really interesting class, but not necessarily an easy one. ",
            "\u00a0The course was structured in a very organized way conducive to learning. Scaz always tried to tie new topics in with what we learned before. The psets were interesting and not super time-intensive. Scaz is also very very knowledgable about his field and very skilled at breaking down what he knows at a understandable level, even for non-cs majors. My favorite part of class was when he told stories about different robots. The only thing I think could be improved is that Scaz could add some time for questions. The earlier pset problems were also mostly subjective questions, and it seemed like the TAs took points off arbitrarily, so more coding / objective-oriented psets would be cool. ",
            "\u00a0One of the most interesting courses at Yale for anyone with a slight interest in robotics. The professor is amazing. I only wish there were more computer science-related psets. "

            "\u00a0If you are a computer science student and looking for a not-too-time-consuming, yet interesting elective I would recommend. ",

            "\u00a0Yes! One of the better CS elective. Problem sets are interesting and challenging (at least the programming assignments are); and Scaz and the TAs are well-organized and helpful. ",
            "\u00a0yes ",
            "\u00a0The psets were engaging and educational, but the first few caused a ton of stress because the grading seemed so difficult to predict. The same goes for the tests - even though I understood all of the material, it seemed there were too many opportunities to get points off for misinterpreting the expectations. I was constantly stressed not because the material was hard, but because I wasn't sure how the TA would decide to grade... ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This is a great CS elective. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student; even though CS201 and 202 are prereqs, I didn't take 202 and I was totally fine. I had to brush up on coding in C, but only 2 of the 5 problem sets required coding at all and it was totally doable to figure out. If you know C, you definitely don't need the prereqs. I thought this class was super interesting because it combined robotics and human psychology; we talked a lot about how humans interacted with robots and I thought that was very interesting. If you're interested in robot design, the history of robotics, and how humans interact with robots, totally take this course. The problem sets do use open ended design questions; I know other people didn't like that, but I loved it. It allows you to come up with really creative solutions, and as long as it works, then you're right. You aren't bound by stringent requirements for the problem sets, but I know other people didn't like the lack of structure. It depends on what you want out of the course. ",
            "\u00a0I recommend this course to any one looking for a survey class in robotics. The main thing is that this class is honestly probably more of a social science class then it is any kind of normal computer science elective. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course as taught by Scaz. Go to every class (including Friday lectures) and studying for exams + the few problem sets will be easy. The course is not technically difficult and is a bit multi-disciplinary, which makes it a really nice elective to include among all the other EE/CS options. If you're looking for a class on how to program and operate robots, this is not for you. If you want interesting concepts to think about and ways to go about designing robots and how robots interact with the world, this will be appropriate. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It's an interesting, useful, and exciting course. ",
            "\u00a0The course deals with one of the most interesting problems of our age - attempting to imbue 'intelligence' in robots. Take it if you would like to get a broad overview of the field and learn how implementing even a seemingly trivial behavior can be extremely challenging. However, note that the programming component of the course is minimal, and if you've already taken courses in AI you may not learn much that is new. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Scaz is a fantastic lecturer, and the material speaks for itself. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It is definitely a fascinating class, and it touches on aspects of design that very few other CS electives offer. ",
            "\u00a0This course is overall pretty good. Scaz is a great lecturer but you should definitely attend lecture. The design homeworks are very challenging and the coding homeworks fairly straightforward. The exams involve some trivia. ",
            "\u00a0Yes if youre willing to put in work for exams and psets ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student; it was a fun CS elective and I was able to learn a lot about the field of robotics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Amongst the field of CS electives, robotics was pretty chill and interesting. The exams were hard and based on memorization, though. ",
            "\u00a0As far as cs electives go, this is a good one. Scaz is a good lecturer and definitely keeps the lectures engaging. The TAs are wonderful people and very helpful and the work load is challenging but not outrageous. I didn't think that the exams were always the best in terms of material tested. ",
            "\u00a0This was essentially a history class. Most of the things we learn about are not used today. That said, as a class with a historical lens, it is great at what it does. (There are 3 coding problem sets, using the software package Webots and coded in C, but the lecture material focus is largely historical.) ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student! This is a great course where you can sit back, listen and let Scaz change your perception of robot. It's a unique CS class that you don't want to miss out on! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course - it's an interesting class that fits nicely within a busy schedule. If you attend lecture and pay attention, you won't have any major challenges and you'll learn some interesting stuff along the way. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to anyone interested in learning more about the software behind robotics. I would recommend it to a friend because I found the lectures very interesting and the problem sets challenging but engaging. It does especially well assuming no knowledge of robotics. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who wants a broad overview of the field of intelligent robotics. You learn about everything from low-level mechanisms to more abstract concepts and ideas in Intelligent Robotics. It doesn't go into much detail on any one particular topic, but it gives you an overarching understanding about the field and how the major ideas and technologies in the field have progressed over time. Scaz is a great lecturer, which is great because it's important to go to lecture in order to understand the slides. The psets are sometimes difficult because you don't go into so much detail about them in class, and also sometimes are only really doable if you wheedle some vital hints out of the TA, but there are only a couple of them. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this course. Scaz is a great lecturer, and the psets are pretty fun, especially the last two. The topics are really interesting, especially for people who don't have any experience with robotics or AI/machine learning, and who want to learn. ",
            "\u00a0Yes if you're interested in taking a class that is interesting and will teach you about how robots evolve and how the theory has changed. Don't take this class if you're looking for practical/classroom-to-lab knowledge because the theory isn't always directly applicable to anything. But it is fun and you will enjoy lectures. ",
            "\u00a0Yes if you are interested in robotics, even if you are not a computer science/engineering major. However, a few of the problem sets requires some coding background. Overall very fun and chill class. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this class! It's a great CS elective, Scaz is a great lecturer, you learn interesting material and the psets are time consuming but fun! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially if Scaz is teaching it. It is so hard to find a CS class where the lectures are truly engaging, and this is one of the few. While the midterm might be difficult and you do need to go to every single class if you want to do well on any assessments, it is definitely worth it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! This is a great 4th or 5th class and worth taking whether you're a CS major or not. The lectures are super interesting, and Scaz is probably the best lecturer I've had at Yale so far. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone interested in robotics. It's a relatively low-workload computer science elective, but you probably won't learn a lot of heavy CS skills unless you were particularly interested in studying robotics. It's a niche class/field. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, a really unpleasant experience. Homework is arbitrarily graded, test questions are arbitrarily chosen (8 questions, 10 points each). Lecture is pretty interesting sometimes, but the content just doesn't feel relevant most of the time. 2/5 psets were interesting/satisfying to do, the rest were just painful and annoying. Some questions the TA's have a hard time grading (like drawings of complicated diagrams, where they'll just take off points because \"it's messy.\" Would not recommend as a CS elective credit - I had thought it was a gut, but it's the worst kind of class, where it takes an annoying amount of time and you don't learn anything.
