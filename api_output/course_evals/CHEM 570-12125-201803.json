            "\u00a0The course set out to deepen our understanding of the basics of quantum mechanics, and it did exactly that. It serves as an excellent introduction to the material, and Prof. Hammes-Schiffer did well to make the concepts as accessible as possible with active learning techniques and a manageable pace. The demonstrations with web applets were especially instructive. "

My only concern is that the difficulty of the homework doesnt rise to level of the test questions, and because we only have a midterm and a final, it can be hard to prepare/do well in class. I think perhaps having more exams that count for less could improve the course ",
            "\u00a0See question 1 for strengths.\r\n\r\nMy one complaint would be that the pace was a bit slow at the beginning, such that I felt the material on Hartree Fock and DFT felt rushed at the end. "
