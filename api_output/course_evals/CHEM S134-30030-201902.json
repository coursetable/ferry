The lab reports and understanding what happened after completing the action is more important than how well you memorized what the lab manual said before going into the lab. ",
            "\u00a0The lab quizzes were often too difficult and the laboratory reports were often graded quite harshly. A positive was that the teachers assistant was always willing to help out, but to a certain extent. "
