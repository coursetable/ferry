            "\u00a0We learned a large number of tactics to use when developing our performances for songs. Andrew is a strong proponent of not planning the whole song, but very thoroughly developing the context and your character so that you can experience the song naturally as they would. I really liked using that because it kept our performances live; we never did songs the same way twice but every time was effective. ",
            "\u00a0I learned better techniques for acting, singing, and obviously acting while singing. This includes things like the 5 questions, psychological gestures, and tactics. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I thought Andrew's tactics were great; we learned so many skills that we could use in our performances and it was so fun to sing in the class because every performance felt different. I do wish that we had gotten to do more songs total though; we only worked on about 3 songs before getting the SHEN recital music and I would have loved to have tried a few more. ",
            "\u00a0It was always unclear if/when assignments were due, and I thought we would work on more than three songs over the semester, but overall I learned a lot about those songs and others by listening to my classmates perform. "

        [
            "\u00a0I definitely would recommend this class to anyone who is a musical theater performer or is interested in that art form. It's definitely a scary class because it asks you to be very vulnerable with your music, but it's a really awesome experience and you come away having learned so much. I now feel very confident taking on new pieces of music and developing my context and character for them. I'm also able to worry a bit less about 'doing it right,' and instead I'm able to focus on making my context detailed enough to make the song feel real in the moment. It's a very freeing and interesting style of performance. ",
            "\u00a0Not super well organized. Some students were obviously more liked than others. ",
            "\u00a0Its a really fun class that really can help you grow as a performer and as a student. You get pretty close to your classmates as well since its such a long class every week and you get to interact a lot. "
