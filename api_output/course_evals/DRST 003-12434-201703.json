It's a very particular skill and I'm grateful to have more insight into the nature of philosophical arguments. ",
            "\u00a0I came into this class with zero philosophical knowledge. Now I can confidently say I know how to write a structured philosophy paper and use basic philosophical terms. I also have a solid ground understanding of the big tenants of philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0How to think philosophically, engage with philosophical texts, and how to write argumentatively. In short, a lot, and it was great. ",
            "\u00a0Learned  how to write a philosophy paper, learned philosophical reasoning skills, how to discuss philosophical texts ",
            "\u00a0I know feel as if I better understand what philosophy is, why it is important and how it has evolved. Entering, as I did, with absolutely no knowledge of philosophy I have come to understand how to engage with the philosophical ideas of other and how to develop my own. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to digest philosophical texts charitably; write clearly and thoroughly; and work through arguments and counter arguments in a methodical manner. ",
            "\u00a0I got a very good but brief overview of classic philosophy. I learned how to dissect arguments and present strong objections. We went from Plato and Aristotle through the Stoics, Skeptics and Epicureans all the way through to the Christians Augustine, Aquinas and Anselm with more in between. ",

            "\u00a0The strength of this course was the class discussion, led by Professor Dembroff. They did an amazing job of letting us explore the avenues we were interested in, while keeping us on track with insightful follow up questions. Some professors want to dominate the conversation, but Professor Dembroff, gratefully, is not one of them-- and yet, my DS discussion in their section was better than all my other sections. The weakness of the course lies in the nature of DS: I'd like more time to discuss each book, but the sheer number of authors that we plow through precludes us from doing so. Overall, a sacrifice I'm willing to make, but it still can be frustrating at times. I'd like to see more diversity in the curriculum and rotating cast of lecturers, though. Philosophy, for whatever reason, seems to have the most trouble in that respect, compared to the other two DS disciplines. ",
            "\u00a0I wish there had been more resources and examples of how to properly write a philosophical paper, resources geared towards complete beginners. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strength is how interesting class discussion is. Seminars were always helpful and made me think critically about he text and my own ideas. On the weaknesses, it's difficult to engage fully with the works we read when given so little time to read and then discuss them. ",
            "\u00a0The authors and texts covered in this course were exactly what I had hoped to have read upon exiting. I think discussion was too often caught up in minutiae and therefore missed larger important issues. ",
            "\u00a0A weakness (inherent in Directed Studies) is the fast pace: there's a lot of ground to cover, leaving little time to really work through texts and understand them at a deeper level. At the same time, the breadthbeing able to touch upon so many essential texts and see the conversations between authors across the centuriesis also its greatest strength. ",
            "\u00a0The course covers a very large period of time, so discussions can't always be super in-depth, but it appears to be a necessary sacrifice for the sheer breadth of knowledge you can gain. A great strength of this course is how intertwined all the works are. Their commonalities make for such fruitful discussion especially later in the semester when were able to compare authors and their arguments. ",
            "\u00a0The course would be improved by more consistent, regular testing of our knowledge of each work. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were the professors who lectured and led section and the works studied. A weakness was perhaps spending so much time on Aristotle when we didn't even cover Boethius or Plato's 'Symposium'. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course include engaging seminar discussions, challenging and stimulating texts, and great professors. Weaknesses include a fast-paced reading schedule. This means that the class spends less time on each of the texts than they probably deserve. "

            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend DS to another student, while keeping in mind that most students do not opt into the program, and there are valid reasons to make this choice. I'm happy with my choice, though. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend DS Philosophy. I finally understand the big ideas attached to the names of thinkers we throw around all the time: Aristotle, Plato, etc. This course offers a good foundation and intro into Philosophy, and is suitable for people who never have taken it before. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, it is good to learn about the foundation of modern philosophy through reading and writing papers in this manner. ",
            "\u00a0DS Philosophy is a challenge but very rewarding once you start to understand the texts. Sections provide interesting discussions and Prof Dembroff is great if you're lucky enough to get them. ",
