            "\u00a0This course helped us to learn how to write idiomatically for each section of a typical orchestra, as well as how to orchestrate small ensemble pieces into larger versions. In addition, we learned how to work with music software, particularly Logic Pro. ",
            "\u00a0Orchestration skills improved, learned more about individual instruments. ",
            "\u00a0This course did an incredible job developing my orchestration and composition skills, specifically in making me feel more comfortable with an area that I was nervous to explore. I became more comfortable composing for large ensembles as well as notating for and using a variety of different instruments. "

            "\u00a0This course is great because it is so project based. The best way to learn orchestration is obviously by doing it. Moreover, the small group discussions during labs are really beneficial.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think that the first project in particular, the Bartok duo, was too boring and not fun at all. The lack of freedom and choice of a boring pizzicato duo means that I didn't fully engage with the course when completing the project. Not until later did I invest more of my time and best effort into that course.\r\n\r\nI think there was a lot of work to be done on projects at the end of the year, but not enough work on projects at the beginning. Perhaps assigning one more project at the beginning of the semester would keep students busier orchestrating. ",
            "\u00a0The course was great, though it could have been helpful to add some more score study to it. ",
            "\u00a0-well-structured & informative\r\n-scoring projects were very helpful\r\n-homework occasionally felt like busywork ",
            "\u00a0This course did an excellent job of starting off small and gradually increasing the complexity of assignments by the end to the point where it was quite amazing seeing the work everyone was capable of doing for the last couple projects of the semester. I really loved learning something about a particular section of the orchestra in one week and immediately getting the chance to incorporate it into the next assignment. ",
            "\u00a0The material was a little too similar to what is covered in MUSI 320/420. Since those classes weren't a prerequisite, I felt like I was repeating a lot of material. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were exciting orchestration projects, attentive instructors that gave very helpful advice, and the student presentations that allowed us to connect and praise each other. If I would change something, I would like for there to be more activities that encourage interaction between students. "

            "\u00a0This is a great course to get familiar with the orchestra and orchestral instruments, and to learn to work with software instruments in a DAW. It's as much work as you are willing to put into it, which means you can get a lot out of it if you put in the work. Highly recommended! ",

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to other students interested in composition. It is very important for people interested in composition to understand how to write for many different instruments, and this course forces you to do just that. "
