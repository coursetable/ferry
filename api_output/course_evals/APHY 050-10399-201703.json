            "\u00a0I worked on my ability to make approximate calculations using informed estimates. Professor Prober would frequently pause to pose hypothetical quantitative questions, causing us to think critically about the assumptions we have to make to arrive at a figure.\r\n\r\nBeing a hybrid of a science course and a policy course, Prober's main lesson was to \"ask the right questions\" based on our observations. Throughout the semester, in scientific and nonscientific contexts, he showed us how people made history by asking the right questions. ",
            "\u00a0I worked on my investigative skills, research abilities, and critical thinking. ",
            "\u00a0I learned an interesting array of different modern tech around the world. Not much on public policy though. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about various different technologies that I use on a daily basis but unfortunately knew nothing about. I think the information we discussed in class will make me a generally more informed person. "

        [
            "\u00a0I think the main takeaway of the course (to ask the right questions) is salient to students in all disciplines. In my opinion, this takeaway represents the very best that a scientific mindset can contribute to non-science students. Bearing an SC distributional designation and being \"not intended for science majors,\" this class does everything it promises and more. This class shows exactly why we need, and how students can benefit from, the SC distributional requirement. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: breadth of course, guest speakers \r\nWeakness: lecture format ",
            "\u00a0It was a lot of lectures and not much about being a seminar. If we talked about the policy part a little more, there would be a lot more conversation back and forth ",
            "\u00a0We covered many different interesting topics and had some amazing guest lecturers (including the VP of IBM Watson!). However, I wish we had more back-and-forth discussion because the class did not feel like a seminar. It was really just a small lecture. ",
            "\u00a0The course ended up seeming a little more like a lecture than a seminar.  I really enjoyed the amazing guest speakers and lunches/dinners.  More class discussions in a conversational manner could potentially improve the class.  Nils is awesome too.  He helped a ton with going over questions that we had from the p-sets. "
