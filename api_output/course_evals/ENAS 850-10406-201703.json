            "\u00a0The material in this course was new to me.  However, the professor did an exceptional job presenting the information in a manner in which it was accessible.   The course is a step by step introduction of solid-state physics, walking the student through crystal structures, phonon and electron modes, and finally semiconductors and devices. ",
            "\u00a0I understand the lattice structure, phonons and electrons behavior, and the band structure, semiconductors, dielectrics. ",

Because I only take the first solid state course, if possible, I hope professor Victor Henrich could talk something about superconductor and superconductivity, because this is a very important topic in solid-state physics. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is the material in addition to the professor's clear passion for it. Given the focus is conceptual understanding, more thorough reading materials on the latter third of the class would have been invaluable. ",
            "\u00a0In my opinion I think this course is great and I find no weakness about it. ",
            "\u00a0The instructor for this course put a great deal of effort into developing each lesson plan.  Unlike many courses I have taken at Yale, where the instruction seems like an afterthought, it is clear that the professor is dedicated to ensuring the students  get the most out of each lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: every point is clear and Victor is really patient to answer my questions.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Too fast, sometimes cannot catch up with the point. ",

            "\u00a0The detailed reduction of some important formulas should be done in the class. Meanwhile, the exam should contain important derivations. ",
            "\u00a0Let me start by saying I recognize that a first course in solid state physics is hard to teach. The interests of theorists and experimentalists vary greatly in this subject. With that said, I feel the course taught fall of 2017 was too focused on concepts of interest for experimentalists. Lecture derivations were surface level and felt rushed. When students would ask for more depth there didn't appear to be much interest from the instructor to give deeper explanations. Maybe this was forward thinking about what was necessary to understand future topics and concern over the length of the course. All I know is I was left feeling a bit empty about what was covered. I recommend teaching a more well rounded course to better satisfy both theoretical and experimental interests. Again, I realize this is easier said then done. ",
            "\u00a0I think it is good enough for a first-year course. All the materials are arranged in a logic way and I could review some concepts and explore more new parts in solid state physics in this class. ",
            "\u00a0One major strength of this course was providing a conceptual understanding of the physics that drive processes in crystalline materials. Over this course, there was a constant stress on relating different topics thinking deeply about how to use the basic knowledge we learned to answer difficult questions. "

            "\u00a0Yes if you want to know the basics of solid state physics ",

            "\u00a0If someone has taken a course in solid state physics previously I would not recommend this course. If someone hasn't then yes I would recommend it. It exposes students to the fundamentals of solid state physics. If a graduate student was intending on taking this course I would tell them to expect content not much different or difficult than an undergraduate course teaching out of Kittel. ",
