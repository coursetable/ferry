            "\u00a0This class was a comprehensive survey on the history of film music, starting with operatic conventions and silent film and going through more advanced topics in the modern day, such as minimalism and digital cinema. The first half of the semester saw material taught chronologically; after midterm, the focus shifted to individual topics. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the history and development of film music  and how to analyze it in writing. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about film music in this class. I always paid attention to it when I watch films, but this class gave me a set of tools to actually analyze and think critically about it. I also learned a lot about what professional film composition looks like, which has impacted my thinking about my life path. That's invaluable. ",
            "\u00a0I developed an understanding of Film music, learning the vocabulary of the discipline and its history. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about the use of music in film, its history, and about music in general. ",
            "\u00a0History of film music, types of film music, impact of film music ",
            "\u00a0We learned about the history of film music from the origin of cinema to modern film, common film scoring practices , prominent composers, and did a survey of films with particularly interesting scores. ",
            "\u00a0An understanding of how film music interacts with the visual elements of a film; its impact on film narratives; methods and techniques utilized within film composition "

            "\u00a0The class was very well structured, and professors were engaging, respectful, and passionate. The variety of assignment types, including written analyses of film music, hands-on experience scoring a brief clip of film, and student-led discussions worked well to create an environment of excitement and learning.\r\nMy biggest whine is that the discussions often felt scripted--rather than an open forum, it felt like professors were asking leading questions with an answer already in mind, and trying to nudge us toward those answers. ",
            "\u00a0The course was well taught by Prof. Kreuzer and Prof. Ladd. I thought the material was engaging and I really enjoyed the topics that the professors selected. I also had a great time writing the midterm and final paper as it was easy to select a topic to write about. I do wish that the class had a little more discussion among students as it was a seminar class. While the professors were great at directing the conversation, it almost felt too directed at times. ",
            "\u00a0The readings could have better organized, more discussion or assignments. ",
            "\u00a0It definitely has a music focus despite being cross-listed with the film department, this is not necessarily a problem but it does introduce a unique challenge for students coming from film heavy, or music heavy backgrounds. ",
            "\u00a0The interactive aspects of the course were definitely a strength. All of the readings and screenings were interesting if sometimes a bit dry. ",
            "\u00a0This course was quite comprehensive and did an excellent job of accommodating both film and music majors. The reading were informative, class discussion was productive, and a wide variety of material was covered. My only suggestion would be it seemed like there was a relative gap in terms of the eras of film covered; we talked a lot about early cinema and modern cinema, but I felt that a few decades of film music were relatively underrepresented.

            "\u00a0Highly recommend--the Music department can often seem stale in its offerings, and this is a class with an entirely different focus and perspective than the typical rabble you get from classic professors who like classic music pedagogy. ",
            "\u00a0This was my first class in the music department and it was a wonderful experience. I felt like I learned a lot and Prof. Kreuzer and Prof. Ladd gave good feedback on my writing. Even though it was a writing class, I would say that this class probably helped my writing more than any other class at  Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I thoroughly enjoyed it and I don't think another course exists relating to film music. ",
            "\u00a0Would definitely recommend. The class had its flaws int eh beginning with getting its footing but professors Kruezer and Ladd care a lot about this class and are very attuned to what the class is interested in. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course! I learned a lot, the screenings were fun. Prof Ladd and Kreuzer did a lot to make the class accessible to people of different backgrounds and to get feedback as the class went on. There werent a lot of opportunities for feedback as theres only a short midterm paper. Though this class doesnt seem glamorous (you dont like get to meet Julie Andrews or go on a field trip to NYC), I learned a lot and had fun. I wish we had done a little more theory. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone interested in film music. "
