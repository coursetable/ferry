            "\u00a0It's a great survey course if you want to be introduced to various topics and studies in modern music cognition. There are few common themes that the course centers around; instead, the class is built around the analysis of scientific papers on a variety of topics including rhythmic perception, pitch matching, etc. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me much more than I had previously known about basic aspects of music (pitch, rhythm, timbre, etc.) from a scientific-psychological perspective. The course explores in depth the nature of acoustic phenomena and how they give rise to auditory phenomena. We spend a great deal talking about this acoustic-auditory distinction, from how we evolved to have relative pitch to how Western music theory is based on the tuning restraints of human musicality. I also learned a lot about experimental paradigms in music psychology. ",

            "\u00a0This course was incredibly disorganized on many levels. The assignments were not very well designed to test what we learned. Lectures were often completely different from the readings and what we were tested on. We were not given enough time on the assignments. Exams were very weirdly designed and did not reflect what we were \"supposed\" to have learned. Also, the professor did not respond to a single one of my e-mails, and the music notation system that was introduced took up a lot of time to learn, and we were rarely ever tested on it. I also doubt that I will ever have to apply that music notation ever again in my life, so it took up a lot of time for something that was not helpful or relevant, in my opinion. ",
            "\u00a0This course was not developed in a way for students to succeed. The professor does not give clear expectations or instructions, telling you one thing but doing something else (regarding homework, quizzes, exams). The quizzes and exams consistently had errors forcing you to have to email about getting points back. There were \"sections\" that only met three times due to the professor not being able to schedule them until well into the semester and cancelling for numerous reasons (sometimes after you had already showed up to section). The topics covered did not reflect the syllabus. The course was not level for music and non music majors; the new notation did not create an equal playing field as the professor said, and the singing aspect was not related to course content. ",
            "\u00a0lectures were just slideshows on whatever professor quinn happened to study or care about at that moment, and there was never any explanation for learning and performing the sight singing in section\r\n(the tests were also open book but trickily worded so you just ended up searching the text and trying not to get tricked) ",
            "\u00a0We seemed to learn much less about each topic than I expected. We moved through topics without ever getting as in depth as expected. It also didn't feel like the course was greatly organized or planned which took away from lectures. ",
            "\u00a0This class was disorganized, poorly planned, and not at all formulated to help students learn. It seemed that the professor was not invested in teaching and did not give much thought to the class. The course did not build on any themes over the course of the semester, and it seemed like an outlet for the professor to indulge in his personal research rather than provide a deep source of knowledge or unified introduction to the material for students. I came away not feeling like I had gained any new broad ideas to think about or significant knowledge. The assessments were all multiple-choice online and did not provide any opportunities to synthesize or build knowledge. It is very little work but very little reward. ",
            "\u00a0The course material is interesting, but the course itself is very disorganized. The first couple of weeks were spent dancing around the topic \"what is music?\" without making many significant points, and the lectures introduced very little new material than what was covered in the readings. Sections were meant to introduce us to more cognitively representative methods of singing, but it at many times felt like filler. We should probably not be spending the majority of class singing basic solfege. ",
            "\u00a0The start of the semester was good, but it felt like it gradually became less and less engaging and structured. I wasn't sure what the goal of each lecture was or how it pertained to the overarching themes listed in the syllabus. Structurally, things seemed confusing - we ended up only having 2 exams, and maybe one month's worth of sections. There were also a very small handful of students that were the most vocal in class, which could be kind of annoying. It felt like they would ask a question and then pursue it for the last 15 mins of class, while the rest of us had to sit there and listen. ",
            "\u00a0The readings for the course are excellent, and the lectures are fascinating and not mere repackaging of the reading. The lectures involve cool demos and are overall very interactive. The only thing that could have been improved was starting section earlier. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Lecture content, presentation, and preparation; leading class discussions; instructor knowledge and understanding of topic(s); relevant readings with diverse viewpoints\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\nSyllabus detail/accuracy=hard to prepare for class/evaluations\r\n*hard to predict workload \r\n*lack of quiz/test dates (we had 2/3 mentioned tests)\r\n* didn't mention that sections would happen outside of class time (it ended up being fine, but was a bit surprising and worrying at first)\r\n* assignments mentioned on syllabus didn't ever come to fruition \r\n         There were no written assignments like the syllabus said there would be. These may have actually been helpful so tests seemed like a tool to \r\n         evaluate our learning rather than didn't seem like a tool for the students find out what we were supposed to learn. \r\n\r\nParticipation and being \"generally responsible\"\r\n* It remains a bit unclear as to exactly how  grades for this category will be factored into the course when (from what I could tell) attendance wasn't taken in class or in sections and, aside from a few students who had been in previous classes with the instructor, there was little evidence to show that the teacher/ta could assign names to each of us unless we were in a previous course with the teacher. That's not to say anything inherently negative about the teacher/student rapport, just that from a grading standpoint I don't know how grades will be fairly distributed when there seemed to be an advantage for those already known by the instructor.\r\n\r\nImprovements: Honestly, there could have been more assignments to help better shape learning expectations and to promote a more steadfast understanding of the covered topics. The short written assignments that were mentioned in the syllabus probably would have been more useful for in-depth understanding than canvas quizzes alone. I didn't feel that the canvas quizzes were an adequate representation of reading comprehension. Because of the scarcity of quizzes and assignments, the tests felt a bit too much like an experiment to see what we were supposed to learn instead of being a test of what we did learn. \r\n\r\nI enjoyed the course and it was interesting, but there was a frustrating lack of predictability (syllabus didn't really match what actually happened in the class.) ",
            "\u00a0A lot of interesting readings, though I felt the system of quizzes/finals was an ineffective way of testing us, since it mostly centered around reading comprehension. I was also confused by the singing portion of the class which never felt truly integrated into everything else we talked about. ",
            "\u00a0The material of the course was definitely its biggest strength. Ian Quinn has designed a lot of great lectures and teaches them quite well, and made me really think critically about my experience of music in a way I hadn't before. The biggest drawback was definitely organization; a few too many canceled assignments, one canceled exam, inconsistent sections, and generally not enough information presented about what was expected of us. Prof. Quinn also spent a bit too much time in the second half focusing on interpreting scientific papers -- a useful skill, but not necessarily what we were looking for. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this course provided a lot of valuable and interesting information! However, it sometimes felt a bit disorganized, and I often felt unsure of how I was being graded. I found lectures really interesting though, and looked forward to coming to class every day! ",
            "\u00a0This course was extremely unorganized. Sections for it did not start until a month into the semester and were cancelled multiple times, once when 5 minutes after they started.\r\n\r\nThe grading was also very confusing and the short quizzes were unnecessarily stressful. ",
            "\u00a0The course spent a lot of time covering music theory, which, while certainly informative and applicable to the 'music' listing of the course, tended to overshadow the 'cognitive science' aspect. The last few weeks of the course were those chiefly focused on cognition, and I would have hoped to have more time devoted to that.\r\nThat being said, the course was truly engaging and eye-opening. Professor Quinn was an excellent instructor. He encouraged class participation and took care to explain concepts thoroughly. I left every lecture intrigued and curious, and motivated to take on the readings. ",
            "\u00a0The course material was interesting, however it was often hard to tell how it was supposed to fit together. The pre- and post- midterm halves of the class felt quote different. Also the online examinations were very annoying. They frequently had mistakes, and it is more difficult for me to take tests off a screen, so I always felt like I was performing worse than what I felt I knew. ",
            "\u00a0Although I found some of the individual lectures engaging and truly fascinating, the overall shape and trajectory of the course were incoherent and poorly outlined. \r\n\r\nThe relationship between Prof. Quinn's notation system and the purpose of the course (i.e. Music Cognition) was unclear and frustrating. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: lectures! They were very engaging and thorough, and Prof. Quinn is very good at listening and answering students' questions.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: organization! very little information was provided on the syllabus, and there were a lot of \"surprises\" throughout the course (including the time and date of the final exam). Also, the multiple choice questions were often worded ambiguously and the email I sent to inquire about some of the questions went unanswered. I also wasn't convinced that we needed to spend so much time learning and singing the alternative notation system. "

        [
            "\u00a0Honestly, I would not recommend this course. It was disorganized and spent a lot of time / emphasized very specific topics that were not very relevant to what we were supposed to be learning. It was kind of a mess at times, and the grading was unjustifiably brutal. Assignments were not clear, and readings were not discussed enough to allow us to answer the difficult questions about them on the assignments ",
            "\u00a0No. You will go crazy from trying to figure out what is expected of you and trying to work around the professor's disorganization. ",
            "\u00a0no ",
            "\u00a0Good class if youre intrigued by overlaps in music, acoustics, and psychology! ",
            "\u00a0I would not. This class sounds like it would be interesting and is on a topic I would love to learn about, but unfortunately I learned very little from taking it. The class is poorly structured and does not follow any continuous threads or themes, nor does it build on ideas for more than a single class. The class either focused on very esoteric elements of the professor's research or on very specific academic papers, and I came away feeling like I had learned very little about music cognition or the field as a whole. I have rarely learned so little in a class at Yale, which is disappointing because the subject is such an interesting one. It just seemed like a scattershot waste of time that the Professor cared very little about. The assessments are very frustrating and do not test real knowledge, but seem like a way for the professor to have the computer grade multiple choice questions rather than have to read students work, which makes it difficult to even do well in the class, despite it being so unchallenging intellectually. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course for as an elective within the music or cog sci majors, but if you're looking for an engaging SO credit, I'd probably look elsewhere. For music majors, it's a nice introduction to more psychological/research-based aspects of music. ",
            "\u00a0It was OK. Remember that your time at Yale is limited and you can only spend it taking so many courses. I don't think I would have taken this course if I'd known how it would be. It started at really well, but as the semester wore on, things got increasingly confusing - both structurally (like when exams were) and thematically (what we were learning in the course, and how it linked to overarching themes of the syllabus). ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course, especially to those interested in psychology/cog sci at all, or in music at all. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I enjoyed the course and it was interesting, but there was a frustrating lack of predictability (syllabus didn't really match what actually happened in the class.) ",
            "\u00a0While I appreciate Quinn trying to make a very unusual course, it ultimately felt too disorganized and I'm not sure how much I gained from it. We read some interesting articles but we also read a lot of very technical articles on cognition test procedures and I'm still not sure why exactly. We also had to learn how to sing from a redesigned form of notation which felt very disconnected from the rest of the class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend music cognition, primarily to other musicians. The organization needs some work but the course itself is engaging and enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student as long as they understood that reading of scientific papers played a huge role in the course! The topic was fun, interesting, and helped to start a deeper personal investigation of what music is and what it means in daily life. ",
            "\u00a0This class is interesting, but do not take it for anything but Credit/D/Fail because it is not worth it otherwise. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Ian Quinn is an excellent instructor, and the subject matter of this course is engaging. However, there is a heavy emphasis on music theory, so be aware that those without musical training may be at a disadvantage. ",
            "\u00a0Not really. The course was good for me as a music major in need of an SO credit. Prof. Quinn is an interesting lecturer as well. Overall, I don't think I'm taking much away from the course though. ",
            "\u00a0This course is not for someone who wants to gain an introductory level of knowledge about music cognition, as the material was too haphazard for that to be possible. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, overall. I like Prof. Quinn and the material we covered. "
