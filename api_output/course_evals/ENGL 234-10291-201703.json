            "\u00a0I developed a deep understanding of and appreciation for the politics and experiences of the post-Reconstruction American South, as depicted by some of the best black literary figures in the canon. ",
            "\u00a0I gained familiarity with a truly incredible curriculum of books. We had stimulating conversations every class, and the two essays were a good exercise in analytical writing. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the major themes that Black Southern authors write. My understanding of how to read and interpret poetry increased. ",
            "\u00a0Deep analysis of texts. ",
            "\u00a0I read lots of amazing literature and learned how to write analytical essays about more modern texts. ",
            "\u00a0Exposed my self to a canon I did not know before. ",
            "\u00a0I gained valuable insight into the cultural consciousness of the black South and the interactions between black southern authors. I got great feedback on papers and worked to improve verbal communication skills in class. ",
            "\u00a0My close reading skills imprived significantly this semester! ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the black south! Such an amazing class where you read important books and learn about a period of time/ specific culture. ",
            "\u00a0New way to think about literature, how to communicate my thoughts more effectively in a written and oral format, and a new way of seeing how the black south has manifested in its literature. ",
            "\u00a0In this class, I gained familiarity with a canon of literature I also learned to think more abstractly about the idea of canonization, both generally and with regards to the specific texts we studied; I had read some of the works on the syllabus before taking the class, but reading them in the context of each other was really helpful and interesting. I have, in the past, felt frustrated sometimes with classes that focus on literary history at the expense of close reading of the texts, but here, the balance between the two felt perfect and enriching of the overall experience. This class also pushed me to become a better participant in class discussion, and a better writer. ",

        [
            "\u00a0I think that certain books on the curriculum did not hold up to the rest, particularly Charles Blow's memoir. I think that the due dates of the papers could have both come a little sooner. I don't think that either one needed to be at the time that it was due (since we had so much flexibility on the topics) and they came right around when most midterms and finals happened. This could be easily avoided by making them due two weeks earlier than they were. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this course. There are a lot of books that you have to read, and this can be overwhelming. However, every book is worth it and should be on the syllabus. ",
            "\u00a0It's a very strong course as is! ",
            "\u00a0Excellent reading list, excellent section lead as well as any I've had at Yale by Prof. Mahurin. ",
            "\u00a0The course was one of my favorites at Yale. Prof Mahurin was fantastic at leading discussions and the books on the syllabus were great. At times, the class verged on over praising the works, and the last book on the syllabus Fire Shut Up in My Bones didn't live up to the other books on the syllabus. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly, I have nothing but good things to say about the class. The work load was challenging but reasonable, the readings were excellent, and the class discussions were structured but not rigid. In other words, this class is the bomb. ",
            "\u00a0Grading is WAY too harsh. also, the class size should be minimized probably... ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: awesome professor, genuinely interested and enthusiastic classmates, good syllabus, healthy workload.\r\nWeaknesses: I didn't entirely see the point of the final exam. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: great content, great teacher, loved the literature, was able to handle the papers\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: hard to gauge what was expected of us in our papers until after the first paper, which at that point meant that 20% of our grade was decided. I also fee that we didnt get to talk about the books as much as I would have liked because we would get in-depth on one specific passage. \r\n\r\nImproved: Let is know from the beginning that the essays are going to be free-form. Also maybe streamlining the comversations/moving on so we can dedicate time to other parts of the book. ",
            "\u00a0This was truly an incredible class. I loved almost every text on the syllabus, and even those that I didn't love as much individually felt productive to read in the context of the others. I was constantly challenged and inspired by the other students, and by the ways that Professor Mahurin structured discussion. I almost wish we had written one more paper, just because the process of paper writing (anticipating Prof. Mahurin's standards as well as coming up with our own prompts) forced me to do some of the hardest but ultimately most productive thinking of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Very good overall class. Maybe required meetings with students to make sure every person gets the most out of it? Some didn't get as much as others but wish they did. "

            "\u00a0This is an incredible and intellectually engaging course, especially in the intimate seminar format. You should only take it if youre prepared to read all of the texts thoroughly and engage in class discussion, because otherwise you wont get as much out of the class. But all the books are extremely worth reading, so it isnt difficult to devote the time and energy to the reading and writing assignments. Dean Mahurin is an amazing professor whos funny, engaging, helpful, tough, and expects a lot from her students. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this class!! Professor Mahurin is an incredible teacher and class is always interesting. So many of the books are really incredible. The grading on the two papers is tough, but overall two 5-7 page papers, a presentation, and a final is not that much work. The reading load is also manageable. Cannot stress enough how good of a course this is! ",
            "\u00a0I would without a doubt recommend this course. Dean Mahurin is an excellent professor and really knows her stuff. This class exposed me to a diversity of authors who I normally would never have read. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Professor Mahurin is great and this class just tends to attract students who are engaged with the material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely.  One of the most moving courses I've taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Fantastic syllabus and fantastic professor. A must take for anyone interested in race in the south and the wonderful literature that has come out of it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you have the opportunity to take this class do it! ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely! Just make sure you're willing to spend a ton of time on both of those two papers because prof. mahurin is an extremely harsh grader. \r\n\r\nbut it's really not that much work and you'll learn a lot, and the books are amazing! TAKE IT! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone with an interest in American literature or AfAm studies, and to anyone looking for a great writing/humanities course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes because the books and open discussion was fascinating. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to read some incredible books with a professor who will really push you to think critically, carefully, and passionately. This class was intellectually rigorous, but it was also a lot of fun. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, great course explores literature that's often overlooked "
