            "\u00a0My french DEFINITELY improved. I'm coming from an unusual spot in this class in that I hadn't taken french for three years, but the fast-paced and cumulative nature of the class definitely was effective at getting my french back quickly. ",
            "\u00a0Language skills especially my listening and speaking skills improved hugely ",
            "\u00a0After taking French 140 I have developed a deeper understanding of different grammar mainly the subjunctive and relative pronouns. I also learned to express myself clearly in a french essay and provide an analysis of different texts. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my comprehension of the French language as well as my speaking. I gained knowledge about French culture and history specifically about France during the second world war. ",
            "\u00a0I wasn't able to speak a full, correct sentence in French at the beginning of the semester and at the end of it I was able to deliver a 15 minute presentation--FULLY IN FRENCH! ",
            "\u00a0I developed my knowledge of french grammar aswell as my appreciation of french literature and culture. ",
            "\u00a0My French knowledge definitely improved at a rapid rate throughout this course. In particular, the emphasis on conversation in class and presentations really helped improve my speaking skills, something I had been weak in before. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0There is definitely a strong emphasis on speaking and culture, and not on vocabulary, which I enjoyed but that might not be for everyone. The class focused mostly on literature and being able to clearly explain yourself in french, which again I liked. ",
            "\u00a0It's very intensive which is a strength in terms of your exposure to the language, but it means that the workload can feel a bit unrelenting ",
            "\u00a0This course was taught through immersion which I believe is the best way to acquire a new language and particularly at this level it is important to continue engaging in French dialogue to improve our accents and command of the language. I only wish the class was longer! Often we had debates in class or discussions about the readings that could have gone in if it had not been for time constraints. ",
            "\u00a0This class was extremely helpful in improving my abilities with the French language. Professor Burton was extremely creative, engaging, and supportive so that all of her students felt comfortable to speak in her class. She was always fair with grading and provided all the help that her students could possibly want or need. ",
            "\u00a0it was strong. Only problem is that the workload is a lot ",
            "\u00a0It is a strong and enjoyable course. Considering the amount of in class testing and the evaluations we did at the end of every module, it seems unnecessary to put so much emphasis on the final exam in the overall grading of the course. ",
            "\u00a0The course is extremely well-organized, running like a well-oiled machine. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I would, if you're ready to put in the effort. This isn't a class you can just breeze through; if you are on the fence about whether you really would enjoy this class (and you don't have to take it) then I would recommend not taking it. ",
            "\u00a0Only if you really like french ",
            "\u00a0Yes - while it is a very full-on course you learn a huge amount, and your language skills improve massively ",
            "\u00a0Yes. If you are a student with strong speaking abilities who needs to improve grammar this is the course for you as French 130 would be far too easy. I found that my AP French class prepared me well for this level because unlike other AP French classes my European teacher emphasized speaking and reading. However if you are a student that was taught AP French in English and arent a strong speaker this class may be difficult but I would recommend shopping anyways. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student because of the level of engagement that is required of the students in an encouraging supportive environment. For students looking to improve their French, this class is perfect and I looked forward to coming to class every day. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Its an engaging and enjoyable course. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend it. Its a great way to learn a lot of French very quickly, and the readings and research are very interesting. "
