Given the time of day this course was schedules, it is nice that lunch was provided. However, because this class is a journal club style, it is imperative that students read the papers. The students clearly did not read the papers and therefore discussion was lacking. If students do not read the papers, and do not come to class prepared for an in-depth comment and critique period, that this course become a waste of time. ",
