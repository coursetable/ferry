            "\u00a0I learnt about how to measure proportions, shade, value, tone and composition. Overall this greatly improved my drawing ability and also indroduced me to a quirky aspect of the art world. ",
            "\u00a0This class was so LIT. I see the world very differently now, and have developed a new sense of how I look at the world and how I draw and how I even THINK. ",
            "\u00a0There's really too many things to list. I really learned a lot from this class and it's definitely one of my favorites. \r\n\r\n1. how to draw still life: fruits, boxes, buildings\r\n2. 1 & 2 point perspective drawings\r\n3. figure drawing\r\n4. tones\r\n5. drawing faces\r\n6. experimental / creative drawing (abstract)\r\n7. creating symbols / letters that aren't a language (i forgot what you call this) ",
            "\u00a0I started this class with no knowledge of how to draw, and by the end of it I felt like I had learned the foundations of an analytical skill. I learned a lot about how to draw but also about important artists and art history moments. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0You learn a lot as you draw a lot for homework. I enjoyed the figure drawing in class but aside from that the class could be improved by doing more drawing in class. I enjoyed the peabody trip but would have loved to do more trips outside the classsroom. ",
            "\u00a0The class itself was a lot of fun, but it's a lot of work because there's a lot of homework. In-class itself is a lot of fun, but it started out quite slow because we drew boxes for a couple weeks. ",
            "\u00a0biggest strength: you learn a LOT because there is a lot of drawing during class and there is also a lot of homework\r\n\r\nweakness: the workload is the most out of almost any of the yale classes i took but it's honsetly worth it. "

            "\u00a0Yes!! It was super enlightening and challenging and totally worth the workload ",
            "\u00a0absolutely recommended. the instructor edgar serrano is really really good and helps you learn a lot. ",
            "\u00a0This is the best class I've taken at Yale and it makes me wish I had started doing art courses sooner in my college career. it's a lot of work, but in return you are able to dig into the development of the skill in a way that's really rewarding. "
