Homework is mind-numbing; I think actually implementing a full cryptographic protocol would be really cool. Take a page from other classes like 433: I think Yale students are totally able to implement SSL or ElGamal with elliptic curves.\r\nLectures are quite dry. They could be spiced up with demos. Examine a crytpographic protocol in action, or implement one in class, or have students stand up and simulate one. The math can and should be done live on the chalkboard; slideshows are terrible ways to learn.\r\nPlease continue having a math grad student as the TF. ",
