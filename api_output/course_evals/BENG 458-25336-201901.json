            "\u00a0This was a great class to introduce me to multiscale modeling of biomechanical systems. I learned the reasons behind making a model and why models are useful. I learned how to implement models using Matlab and Continuity. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Amount of freedom to explore. Allows you to learn so so much. ",
            "\u00a0This course made difficult material relatively reasonable to grasp, and the homework assignments were always relevant to the material being taught in class. Prof. Campbell genuinely wanted everyone to do well and did a great job of checking in on everyone's progress. ",
            "\u00a0The class does really well in guiding you step by step through implementing a multiscale model. I really enjoyed the structure of the modules as well. The first day was a lecture that introduced you to the type of model or system to be model. The next two classes were workdays where Prof. Campbell would walk around assisting us through the model building. On the fourth day of the module, we would have a literature review, which helped us to develop our scientific literacy. "

            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this class to another BME senior. At this point, it's a great way to put together everything you've learned into a really cool process of model building. Professor Campbell's lab activities guide you through step-by-step through the process in a way that helps you to understand what is going on and the reason for doing those steps. The workload is manageable and the class really does facilitate learning. ",
