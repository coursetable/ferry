            "\u00a0I developed the skills to critically examine academic papers in the field of economics, especially as it intersects with public policy and political issues. The curated list of papers covers a wide range of topics that help students understand the econometric methodologies used in academic papers, as well as the types of ideas and research strategies that make certain papers exceptional. The assignments in the course pushed us to develop our critical abilities, and to expand on existing papers using the skills we learned (and a lot of advice from Professor Reyes). ",
            "\u00a0I gained a great deal of insight into the methodology of economic inquiry, and developed the ability to more rigorously examine economic papers and conduct my own research. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about econometrics, research methods, and recent microeconomic research findings in this class than in any other economics class at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a variety of skills related to reading, critically engaging with, and conducting empirical economics research. I read numerous significant papers in the field of applied microeconomics that showed the breadth of questions that economists investigate and the variety of tools used in these investigations. I also developed skills needed to read these papers with a critical eye, identifying novel and useful strategies, as well as finding pitfalls and limitations of the arguments. Finally, through the data exercises and final paper, I was able to gain practice doing my own research, going through a simplified version of the research process once. ",
            "\u00a0The course, in many ways, introduces you to how to think like an economist. The course provides an overview of a variety of topics covered in the econometrics courses (such as treatment effects, IV and 2SLS, difference-in-differences, etc.) and shows how they are applied in papers throughout the economics literature to issues of direct policy importance. The response papers are a great way to hone analytical skills while the final paper is excellent preparation for an empirical senior thesis in economics. "

            "\u00a0The strengths in this course have to be the quality of Professor Reyes's teaching, the assignments and the way they push you to expand your thinking in Economics, and the quality of class discussion. If one is interested in the material, and is willing to prepare for class discussion, the class has virtually no drawbacks. ",
            "\u00a0A great strength of this course is its reading list. Professor Reyes selected a wide variety of interesting readings to focus on a different methodology each week. The readings were all relevant and held my attention. ",
            "\u00a0Great class- good choice of papers, good division between instructor lectures and class discussions, effective way to teach econometric methods ",
            "\u00a0There are many clear strengths of this course. The readings were almost all extremely interesting (and the ones that were not still seemed important). Professor Reyes leads a great seminar, which is especially true if you have a good cohort of students interested in the material. Learning from peers and having a chance to discuss and ask questions about the readings were highlights of the course, as well as the opportunity to investigate questions that I did not realize economists studied as much as they do, from the impacts of women's representation in government, to the impacts of segregation, to the effects of neighborhoods on children's long-term outcomes. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The course has an excellent, well-curated syllabus with papers from prominent public economics (including Chetty, Fryer, Bertrand, Goldin, Mullainathan, and others) that explore crucial issues with deep policy relevance in the economics of race, crime, gender, policing, the environment, and education. The seminar setting was intellectually stimulating yet relaxed, and discussions were insightful and flowed well, even though the course was not very large. The assignments one the course of the semester added a lot to the course, and I appreciated the intermediate steps the professor provided for the final paper. Most importantly, the professor was excellent, helping to explain the often complicated models in these papers and providing excellent feedback and guidance throughout the course. \r\nWeaknesses: Very few, if any. If at all: 1) while I appreciated the scaffolding that the professor provided for the final paper, I would perhaps have appreciated an additional scaffold between getting feedback on our outlines and submitting the final paper (since it was the first time writing an empirical paper like this, I didnt have a good sense of whether or not I was on track); and 2) I would have perhaps liked the empirical assignments we did to be better tailored to the types of empirical work we would do in the final paper (as opposed to merely being Stata warmup). But otherwise, no significant weaknesses. "

            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to another student if the student were interested in economics as it applies to public policy. Many of us students discussed how great that day's class had been many days; we enjoyed Professor Reyes's teaching and the papers we had read. You should expect to read mostly academic papers, but, especially if you are considering pursuing Economics further, it is a great introduction to what economics academic work is like. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student. I feel that this course was a great capstone for the Economics major, as it solidifies knowledge of fundamental econometric identification strategies and prepares students to conduct their own research. Professor Reyes is also a great professor and highly knowledgeable, and I looked forward to class each week. ",
            "\u00a0Yes- take this class if you want to go to grad school in economics or if you want to be able to understand the results of microeconomic research ",
            "\u00a0This is the best economics course I have taken at Yale by a significant margin. Professor Reyes is a stellar seminar leader who also provides extremely useful feedback on all written work. I learned so much in this class, especially in terms of seeing how various theories and econometric methods are used in actual economics research. While the class is a bit more work than average, I feel as though I learned so much through doing this work, and almost nothing we did felt like a waste. I cannot recommend this class enough! ",
            "\u00a0In an economics department that is quite deficient in its public economics offerings and with a dwindling focus on applied microeconomic fields, this course is incredibly refreshing. I came in to this course as someone seriously considering the prospect of economics graduate study but who had felt dissuaded from pursuing it by the Econ-Math track courses like General Equilibrium Theory and Vector/Real Analysis. In taking this course, I hoped for a setting where I could hone my knowledge and skills in econometrics while applying it issues of relevance to policy, and this course not only delivered but renewed my interest in economic research and graduate study. The course is structured around an excellent, well-curated syllabus with notable papers from top authors in public economics, with each week an examination of both the empirical techniques used in the papers as well as issues discussed in the papers. In this way, the course provides the opportunity to synthesize knowledge from previous econometrics courses (like treatment effects models, difference-in-differences, IV/2SLS, etc.) while examining a wide range of topicsfrom racial bias in the use of police force and gender pay gaps to HUDs Moving to Opportunity program and the implications of violent movies for crime rates. The seminar format of the course lent itself to better exploring these papers, and class discussions were insightful and flowed well in a relaxed classroom atmosphere. The course has a sizable workload; in addition to the papers, there are three reading responses on the papers we read, about three Stata assignments, and the final paper that builds off of the results of one of the papers we read in class, an assignment which itself had several steps (summarizing the paper, replicating the results, submitting the proposal, etc.). Yet the assignments all definitely add to the course a great deal; the response papers were a great opportunity to practice analytical skills, while the final paper, while challenging, provided a great opportunity to practice the sort of quantitative and qualitative techniques that I might use in a senior thesis.  Prof. Reyes is a visiting professor from a liberal arts college (Amherst), and its immediately evidentas someone whos found teaching quality in the Yale Economics Department to be very hit-or-miss, Prof. Reyes stands out. She has a clear passion for empirical economic research and explains the material very well, taking the time to walk through the models and empirical strategies of the papers we read and providing very thorough guidance and feedback on assignments. Shes also a great resource if youre interested in graduate study and want to talk through the application process for grad school or full-time research assistantships. Overall, this has easily been the best course in this department, and is a true must-take for anyone interested in writing an empirical senior thesis, pursuing economics graduate study, or simply wanting to rediscover how exciting economic research can be. I truly wish the Yale Economics Department offered more courses like these. "
