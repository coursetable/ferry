            "\u00a0Instead of just hearing or reading passively about Thomas Berry and his work, I gained a better understanding of Berry's teachings. This course informed many insights I had in previous R&E courses. ",
            "\u00a0This course, and JOTU before it, was the most transformative and inspiring course I've taken at Yale. Insights it gave me included a whole new way to relate to education, to non human life, and to the universe beyond and including Earth. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about an area I was completely unfamiliar with, that of the ecological movement's origins without a religious community and a philosophy that can transcend all disciplines/communities to motivate humans to be more focused on environmental and ecological issues. This course helped me think more holistically and beyond pure scientific or technical aspects. ",
            "\u00a0I got to know the great scholar and philosopher Thomas Berry and was really inspired by his whole life in exploring the reality of the world and combining various religions and traditions. ",
            "\u00a0What I learned about Thomas Berry's thought helps me in connecting and finding meaning in the content of other courses at FES. It  is helpful in answering the question: Why? ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the influential work of Thomas Berry, who was a historian of religions and an early and significant voice awakening religious sensibilities to the environmental crisis. His saying that \"earth is not a collection of objects but a communion of subjects\" is something that I'll remember forever, and will apply to my professional work. "

            "\u00a0Strengths were numerous. Incredible instructors and TF, great classroom atmosphere full of participation and thoughtful conversation. Also really liked the hybrid course model, although some of the video lectures were very long. ",
            "\u00a0It provides a completely different perspective on environmental issues and how today's societal institutions can play a role in addressing the. I find that a strength. We also covered the history of the origins of the universe to today and that gave me a valuable fact base and perspective on our environmental situation today.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't say the course has weaknesses. I think it could be helpful to not only present the philosophy behind Thomas Berry's work but maybe also add in some practical examples where it is being or has been applied. ",
            "\u00a0I do think the current design is perfect. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The content in Canvas is very good. Rich and well organized.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: At times, I would have liked discussions to be more grounded. This is, that we talked more about implications of the concepts and ideas we shared for action. And, about the How? I understand that this is not the nature of the course. ",

            "\u00a0Take it, and every other class Mary Evelyn and John teach until you graduate. ",
            "\u00a0Be ready to think outside the box! It does not ignore science but it isn't science. It's a bit more like a philosophy course, even more so to me than like a religion course. Also has a good amount of history content so be aware of that. ",
            "\u00a0Students who have interest in religion and ecology, and want to know how one could learn from the previous scholars and combine very different knowledge and ways of knowing to explore a new, broad way, should take this course. ",
            "\u00a0As its name indicates, it is focused on Thomas Berry's thought. If you are not familiar with topics related to religion and ecology this may be too specific. I recommend taking the courses Introduction to Religion and Ecology or Journey of the Universe first. ",
