            "\u00a0My understanding of calculus functions of multiple variables. My quantitative skills also greatly increased. ",
            "\u00a0I felt like I learned the course material well, but more importantly I think that I learned how to find and solve problems and bad spots in my understanding of the math I was learning. I think the fact that we were asked to study a lot on our own and learn some concepts on our own made that possible. ",
            "\u00a0You will learn a lot from this class. It's multi-variable calculus, whatever skills that uses. If you need to take it you'll know what skills this class develops. If you don't need to take it, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, JUST DON'T. Don't think \"oh hey, math is cool, why not take 120.\" It is a kinda cool class, and multivariable calculus is also kinda cool, but the grading is unforgiving. ",

We covered several different methods of integration for these integrals, such as Green's Theorem, Stokes's Theorem, and Divergence Theorem. ",

            "\u00a0Teaching was poor on the whole.  There were a lot of resources for studying which I liked.  Also the grading on tests seemed kind of arbitrary which was frustrating for those of us not acing the exams.  Ie an algebraic mistake was taxed more than a calculus mistake. ",

            "\u00a0The good thing about this class is that it does teach you multi. You'll learn and be prepared for whatever you use multi for (do you ever use multi? who knows). \r\n\r\nThe bad thing about this class: grading is harsh and unforgiving. The midterms leave little room for error, they're six questions or so each, so you better not mess anything up. There's only 2 midterms, and those plus the final are pretty much your entire grade. Homework grade is 10%, enough to make you have to do it, not enough to help your grade in any substantial way. ",

            "\u00a0The course has lots of resources online and in person with the peer tutors, office hours and what not. The thing that could be improved is that the course could give better grades because of the large number of students taking the class who have taken multivariable already that hurt the curve for those of us who are taking it for the first time. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Interest of instructors in student's success in course.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Would have like to seen more visuals/ proofs to build conceptual understanding. ",
            "\u00a0It was clear that the people running this course wanted to try and standardize it across all of the different sections, since we all took the exact same exams at the same times. However, I thought this was difficult to achieve, since there were so many different instructors teaching the different sections. Some instructors spent more time on certain topics or certain types of problems than others, so it was clear that we didn't all emphasize the same things, but we all took the same tests. I think that it could be improved if the instructors made the tests for their own sections, instead of having us all take the same exams, because then the results of our exams could reflect our learning for accurately. \r\n\r\nI think that a strength of this course was the peer tutoring system, because the peer tutors could be a really valuable resource for helping us with topics that we needed a little more guidance on. I thought it was really good to be able to work on the problem sets during one of the peer tutor's office hours. My instructor also held office hours twice a week, and I went to those very frequently. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: graduate students are not all good at teaching, difficult material requires teaching/study groups led by good teachers throughout the course ",

            "\u00a0Yes, will help in other courses. ",
            "\u00a0I think it would depend on the student's interest in math. As a history major with no affinity, I might suggest to students like me a different course to fulfill QR requirements. However, I think there is something to be said for expanding one's horizon. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you like calculus. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0If you have to take it, yes, you might as well. From my experience hearing what other students say and going to review sessions, Miki is the undisputed queen of Math 120, everyone will try to get into her section. Fima is also a great instructor, Thomas Hille will create the greatest chalkboard graphs you have ever seen, and Jeremy is really nice and approachable for asking questions. \r\n\r\nBut if you don't have to take it, seriously don't. Go take ENAS 151 or something, apparently they have extra credit and curves. What a beautiful concept. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to learn fun math, take 230; if you want to apply it in sciences, take the calculus for applied science and engineering; otherwise, this is a great class that goes over the basics calculus. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but would have like to have had more visuals/proofs to build a more solid foundation for conceptual understanding. ",
            "\u00a0I know that Math 120 is a required course for a lot of majors, so if you haven't taken multivariable calculus before coming to Yale, it may be necessary for you to take it. However, if you have taken multivariable before or you don't need the course, you may not want to automatically sign up for it. \r\n\r\nI found this course frustrating because of how much exams that weren't written or graded by my instructor determined my grade, and I didn't find these tests to be very helpful when it came to facilitating my learning. If you've already taken multivariable calculus, it may be a better idea to try and go straight to linear algebra or another math course, and if you haven't, then it may be a good idea to shop an alternative course or two if you don't need Math 120 specifically. ",
            "\u00a0No, the material is very difficult and if you don't get a good teacher and are not willing to invest a lot of personal time in the course, you will not learn. "
