            "\u00a0Although you can tell that this is merely an introductory course; I learned so much that I wasn't able to in high school. Don't believe anyone when they say the workload is too much; it's definitely one of the most reasonable classes I've taken at Yale in terms of work. The readings are interesting and thought-provoking, and the lectures are amazing. The assignments were creative and allowed me to digest the material of the course at my own pace without drowning in assignments (a rarity!). Take it with Professor Feimster if you can, but definitely take it regardless! ",
            "\u00a0This class gives you a much deeper and more meaningful insight to the Civil Rights movement and the different stages of activism as they appeared throughout the 20th century. Professor Feimster is amazing and inspirational. I would take this class if you can, regardless of what you are interested in studying. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to critically think about a period that everyone studies in school and knows about, but rarely has studied the details. It's easy to take notes when you're younger and take in information about the Civil Rights Movement at face value, but Professor Feimster challenged us to view the movement as much longer than the traditional 1954-1964 \"Classical Period.\" By beginning in the 1930s and 1940s, we were able to see how many of the events and triumphs of the 50s and 60s would not have been possible without the groundwork beforehand. I also learned to read a text in depth, looking for insights into gender dynamics, tone, and current events at the time. ",
            "\u00a0I developed skills relating to how to better convey historical information in a creative format (through the zine and children's book projects), I learned much more about the Civil Rights Movement and the necessity of lengthening it from its traditional, classical narrative, and I learned so much about the necessity of not only challenging conventional understandings of history but also broadening my perspective to include voices often marginalized and not included in these conventional understandings of history (allowing for a greater understanding of the Long Civil Rights Movement as a whole). ",
            "\u00a0With the 4 response papers we wrote, I got a lot better with that style of writing--focusing on one part of the reading and making that my thesis for the rest of the paper. It's a tough style, but it's worth getting a better grasp on. \r\n\r\nThe kids' book project was also an interesting exercise in writing about the violence of the Civil Rights Movement in terms that children can understand. It's important to talk about that with all age groups and learning how to write for children is a cool thing to do. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely learned a lot about the civil rights movement and people involved in it that I had never heard about in other classes. This course goes beyond Rosa Parks and MLK, and really gives a holistic understanding of the movement. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the classical Civil Rights Movement as well as a lot about what isn't usually taught in the United States' history curriculum. ",
            "\u00a0As a first year, this course was a great intro into some basic college-level humanities; managing reading assignments, response papers, and weekly discussion sections. However, I think this course is fundamental to understanding American society in the 21st century, and honestly is a must-have for anyone interested in politics as it relates to civil rights (and these days, it always relates somehow). If your current perception of the Civil Rights Movement is that it started and ended in the 50s in 60s, that Martin Luther King was a conservative/moderate, that racism is in any way over -- you can gain so much insight on our current racial identity discussions today by taking this course. ",
            "\u00a0I completely challenged and expanded my view of the Civil Rights Movement, and realized that it came from a whole tradition of activism that I didn't know about. I challenged many more of my preconceived ideas and the knowledge I had learned about specific leaders. I improved my response writing skills and got to learn fun art skills while making the zine and book. ",
            "\u00a0Through this class, I gained a new perspective and appreciation for the Civil Rights Movement for being more than for the equality of black people, but also a call to action for blacks to stand up and take action for themselves. I enjoyed learning of characters that I had now heard from before like Ella Baker and Pauli Murray. Before this class, my knowledge of the Civil Rights Movement did not extend far beyond the major legislation of the '60s like the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act, the Montgomery Bus Boycott, and central characters like Martin Luther King, Jr., Marcus Garvey, and Malcolm X. But after this semester, I feel like I have a better understanding of the movement, especially in its early years. ",
            "\u00a0This class is AMAZING. You will learn a lot about the long history of the civil rights movement, and not just about the classical narrative. Professor Feimster is a genius and amazing at what she does. Highly recommend. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to think more critically about narratives that are we are taught, and also had fun doing creative work with the zine and childrens book. ",
            "\u00a0Through this course, I learned about the many people and facets of the Civil Rights Movement that I didn't know about before. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed learning about the forgotten leaders of the civil rights movement and learn about a time period that is usually ignored but played a critical role in the movement ",
            "\u00a0I learned to rethink the oft-oversimplified narrative of the Civil Rights Movement I'd learned and read about in the past, evaluate historical movements more critically, and consider the grassroots activism social movements evolve out of before they crest on a national stage. I also learned to think about the divides between legal changes and political reality. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a broad over-view of the Long Civil Rights Movement. Was able to express what I learned through multi-media platforms. ",
            "\u00a0- To view history with a critical lens.\r\n- To evaluate everything that I once thought I knew, and add more backstory/history to it.\r\n- To treat all of my assignments as calls to action.\r\n- To recognize that there is a longer Civil Rights Movement rooted in a much deeper, convoluted history. ",
            "\u00a0This course felt very different from a typical history lecture, because Prof. Feimster really encouraged us to engage with the material and think critically about it. I learned to not take narratives at face value, and I learned the value of more creative assignments. ",
            "\u00a0By taking this course, I was able to enhance my knowledge of what the Civil Rights movement encompassed as well as analyze the movement from different angles such as the white perspective. I learned about the different forms of activism and the lives of not well-known civil rights activists. ",
            "\u00a0I have learned a good basic introduction to the history of the Civil Rights Movement. ",
            "\u00a0I developed the ability to think more critically about who shapes history and what narratives are excluded. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about American History than I could have hoped, and I think this course is a must-take for anyone interested in learning more about race relations in the country today. ",
            "\u00a0The course covered a long period of he civil rights movement that I had otherwise not known. Goes much deeper than any typical course taken in high school or earlier. ",
            "\u00a0Through Professor Feimster's lectures I learned more information than I think I ever have from a class- a huge and yet also incredibly in depth understanding of the Long Civil Rights Movement. I have learned how to understand political movements- not just the Civil Rights Movement but ALL movements- through the lens of the work of many different people. Professor Feimster's lectures were mobilizing and incredibly inspiring. ",
            "\u00a0Histories of the long civil rights movement, and how to represent information creatively through zines and children's books ",
            "\u00a0This course brought light to a lot of figures who were integral to the Civil Rights movement who have been forgotten throughout history. It also opened my eyes to how long and arduous the movement actually was, and how it started long before the 60s. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the stories that are often omitted in history. We were taught about the great influence of the women and lgbtq+ influencers in the movement. ",
            "\u00a0This class introduced me to many characters previously unknown to me in the fight for civil rights. It also showed me ways we can retell the story of civil rights among children and students. I found the topic really interesting and important ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about the telling and recording of history. This class really supplemented what I knew about the Civil Rights and made me question how one examines causes and contributors to events. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the extent to which the Civil Rights movement extended, the many figures that weren't acknowledged by my previous teachers, and just how much I didn't know about the movement. ",
            "\u00a0This course focused on expanding students' knowledge of the Civil Rights Movement to include its long history (beginning in the 30s and continuing through the 70s+), ideological diversity, and lesser-known key figures. The class's assessments were mainly art projects (midterm and final) and four pretty traditional reading responses. From those, you ideally learn how to condense pretty complex lives and issues into short, digestible information. I feel I also learned how to get crafty! But that definitely was not my goal for the class, and I don't know that I'm happy it was the outcome. ",
            "\u00a0Learned so much! From understanding how history frames certain events and people to gaining an understanding of the long civil rights movement and what was at stake for many actors involved ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think critically about US history and how to transmit that knowledge to other people ",
            "\u00a0This course provides you with a much more developed understanding of how the Civil Rights Movement came to pass, how its leaders came to lead, and how the methods they used worked (or didn't). ",
            "\u00a0I learned an entirely new way of looking at the civil rights movement-- the real history behind the history, and how the media/special interests have obscured the narrative for specific political purposes. ",
            "\u00a0History about the civil rights movement ",
            "\u00a0Learned a nontraditional narrative of the civil rights movement. Solidified reading analysis and writing skills, and pushed myself creatively with the projects ",
            "\u00a0The creative projects especially helped me think how to think about historical narratives in a different way -- we had to challenge the way we had been taught a certain story, the story of civil rights, throughout our childhood and figure out how to re-represent it through different mediums, and this was an incredibly helpful exercise, both in terms of helping me reconcile my early education with my later education, and in thinking about the different ways to teach a subject. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how the history of the Civil Rights Movement is much different than we might think. The timeline is much more expanded, and it's possible that it is still essentially going on today. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a tremendous amount of knowldge about the long civil rights movement wih a special focus on individual contributions! I have learned the importance of story-telling and developed those skills with our creative assignments (making a zine and a children's book.) ",
            "\u00a0I was afforded the opportunity to see the history of the Civil Rights Movement in a COMPLETELY different light. I learned about people that I never had heard of before yet were so integral to the movement. In addition, I was taught to question why the Civil Rights Movement is taught the way it is and the ramifications of this choice. Generally speaking, this class allowed me to study the discipline of history in a completely new and much more enriching way. ",
            "\u00a0This course exposed me to many stories that are vital to a full understanding of the African-American struggle for equality but are not widely known. With my work in this course I was able to get much better at historical analysis of lesser known events and their impact on the world despite the lack of acknowledgement ",
            "\u00a0I gained a far deeper and more accurate understanding of not just the Civil Rights Movement but activism and organizing around racial injustice in the U.S. more generally. I thought critically about the narrative I had been told as a child and came to new understandings through lectures and section. ",
            "\u00a0The Civil Rights Movement was something we only ever covered in school during Black History month, and even then it was always the same story, focusing on the decade from Brown vs. Board to the civil rights act. This course gives a broader look at the movement as an ongoing struggle, starting in the 1910's and going into the 1970's. ",
            "\u00a0Such a wonderful breadth of knowledge and historical figures I learned about in this class! From Ella Baker to Pauli Murray, it was so so enlightening, for sure. I looked forward to each assignment, reading, lecture, and section. It really opened my eyes beyond the classical period of the civil rights movement to examine the historical origins that aren't apolitical in the slightest. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write reading responses, how to kind of manage a large reading load, create questions that relate the readings, the whole course, and the current context, be creative with projects, express important topics through nontraditional, more hands on methods. ",
            "\u00a0Gained knowledge about the progression of the civil rights movement as a whole ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to view individual parts of history as part of a larger story. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the history of the Civil Rights movement and its enduring struggle. There was a lot regarding how the history we were originally taught isn't always necessarily what it seemed... We dove into that and uncovered the reality. ",
            "\u00a0This course teaches you incredibly necessary, untold histories of the LONG Civil Rights Movement and just how powerful people are. It teaches the past to frame the present and motivates you to work toward a better future. ",
            "\u00a0Wow there's so much of American history they don't teach you about in school! This class completely changed my understanding of 20th century American history, and so greatly expanded my understanding of American social movements. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Femister's class is the best class I have taken at Yale. From archive work to organizing, her class teaches both real life skills for both academic and professional work. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a more rich history of the Civil Rights Movement through a narrative, biographical lens. "

            "\u00a0Professor Feimster's lecturing is definitely a strength. She comes to each lecture with notes, knowing exactly what she's going to talk about, but delivers the information in an engaging way. There was never a class where I wasn't furiously taking notes and hanging onto the topic at hand. It was also great to switch up the format of lectures from time to time, from regular lecturing to watching documentaries. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were certainly Professor Feimster's lectures--her unique style almost made it feel like she was telling a story every time and was incredibly engaging and interesting, section, and the projects. Honestly the only weakness I found was that I wish it were a yearlong course because, at the end, I wanted to keep exploring and understanding more of the Long Civil Rights Movement. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The creative projects as mid-term and final was awesome. I loved using my creative abilities and hands to express my understanding of a humanities course. It was also so nice not to have to worry about shoving dates and names into my head and just being able to sit and absorb information in a way that was more natural for me during lecture. I think the readings were all very interesting as well--there were a lot of primary sources from civil rights leaders like Pauli Murray, Fannie Lou Hamer, Malcolm X and Ella Baker. We also watched a lot of footage from \"Eyes on the Prize\" and other documentaries which was super cool to see/hear accounts firsthand. There were also plenty of opportunities to get extra credit that included learning more about the course, like going to the DH Lab or movie showings and lectures.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think the lack of visual aides during lecture made it a little more difficult to follow. Especially with the civil rights having such a wealth of great imagery, it would have been cool to see more of the people/events we were hearing about. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of the course is the DIY/creative projects. Making a zine and designing a children's book were great ways to interact with the material and made what we learned so much more accessible! ",
            "\u00a0Amazing class everyone at Yale should take this course ",
            "\u00a0From what I've heard, the assignments were less intense this semester, but I found the assignments to be helpful nevertheless. Professor Feimster's lectures, her knowledge, the way in which she designed the course, the midterm and final were all strengths. I think the only weakness is that I would have liked to go more in depth on certain aspects of the course, but of course that is a problem with all lecture courses. ",
            "\u00a0The first thing about this class (at least in Fall 2017) is that the lectures tend to not offer anything that you don't get from readings/section. In retrospect, the class is structured such that I realistically could have not gone to a single lecture and still managed to do well on the assignments (usually based on reading or outside research). For some, this could be a pro or a con. In my opinion, I still found Professor Feimster's lectures incredibly insightful in the context of what's currently going on in politics.\r\n\r\nStrengths: All things considered, the workload was extremely manageable and I found section to be something to look forward to. The larger assignments were often very visually-based (your midterm is creating a mini-magazine, and your final is creating a children's book), which I enjoyed.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The readings didn't always match up with the course lectures -- I didn't mind, but there were points that Feimster had so much to cover that we would end up hearing about a topic that we'd already read about more than a week before. I also wish we had written more in this class; throughout the course you write 4 response papers which are supposed to be roughly 800 words, and in trying to summarize the readings, analyze them, and comment on them, you'll easily exceed 1000. ",
            "\u00a0This is by far the best lecture course I have taken at Yale. There are engaging lectures by Professor Feimster (who is awesome), pertinent discussions in section, and unique hands-on projects. The only thing I can think of to improve it might be to have more of a focus on timing because sometimes it could be a little confusing when we skipped around time periods in lecture. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the readings and the section discussions and the in-depth lectures. They were all very interesting and enjoyable to participate in. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing lectures, but we watched too many documentaries in class. ",
            "\u00a0It was well organized and gave me a good idea of the thesis that Professor Feimster was advancing. I liked how we had smaller assignments spread out throughout the semester, since that kept us engaged consistently. I do think we could have dived deeper into the themes, events and people that we were studying. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Feimster is an amazing instructor. She is by far the strongest part of the course. Everything else was great too! The only weakness was the lack of rubrics. ",
            "\u00a0I generally thought it was a pretty strong and well planned course. Maybe a little bit more specific about what is required in the response papers before the first one was due ",
            "\u00a0Professor Feimster's lectures were outstanding - she presented a comprehensive and engaging narrative each class and consistently connected trends we discussed in the course to modern political issues. I also felt I had the opportunity to engage with the course material through a compelling variety of mediums in class and in section: lectures, documentaries, archival analysis, and music. I wish we had a lecture or two at the end of the course to discuss the legacy of the civil rights movement and how ongoing civil rights struggles have evolved out of and diverged from it. I also wish we had time for the lecture on organizing in Lowndes County, but I know it's pretty tough to cover the whole movement in a single semester! ",
            "\u00a0I really appreciated the work-load. It was just enough to stay on top of readings and the class. Reflection papers were a good way to bring what I learned together. Weaknesses were that perhaps lecture could have been more engaging. Perhaps more PPT usage! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- Many narratives are covered.\r\n- Professor Feimster is uncut about how she views certain issues and history.\r\n- Hands on projects for both the midterm and final.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Section could be more argumentative and allow people to do more critical thinking. \r\n- Ran out of time sometimes because there was so much to cover in lecture, but that is quite understandable. ",
            "\u00a0STRENGTH: Lectures, content, themes\r\n\r\nWEAKNESS: Section meetings ",
            "\u00a0This is an amazing class. You learn so so much and the readings are great. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the assignments (a mini-zine and a children's book), and I very much enjoyed learning from Professor Feimster. In the future, I think this course can use a more varied set of readings beyond memoirs and biographies of civil rights leaders--to include readings on the movement as a whole, not just individual people. Overall, though, it was great. ",
            "\u00a0Great Class! ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the weekly readings and appreciated the fact that we spent so much time on lesser-known figures of the Civil Rights struggle. I also enjoyed that Professor Feimster integrated documentaries and videos into her lectures and was very conscious about using digital resources throughout the semester. \r\n\r\nI was not a huge fan of the art projectseither the zine or the children's book, but especially the children's book. For students like myself who are not particularly art-inclined, constructing an entire book was a really intimidating task that took me several hours outside of the time I spent writing the book itself. I also ended up paying out-of-pocket for supplies to make the book because I didn't have any art supplies, which wasn't something I realized I would need to do at the beginning of the semester. I have a couple suggestions for ways to improve the projecteither allow students to choose between the children's book and a normal final paper or test, or have students turn in the final draft of the children's book but not necessarily have them make it into a full book. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the readings in this course-- the autobiographies were fascinating and helpful in telling history through stories. However, I would have loved some secondary articles to see how scholars are thinking about these things today. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Feimster's lectures were incredible and the readings assigned were illuminating and always very interesting. I honestly can't recommend ways for it to be improved. I so appreciated the assignments that were given- they were VERY manageable and always helped me understand the course material more thoroughly. ",
            "\u00a0I like how the projects substituted the exams. This allowed me to just focus on the lectures instead of worrying about what would I need to remember for the exam. ",
            "\u00a0I would have appreciated if we watched fewer video clips, because i really liked professor Feimster's lectures. ",
            "\u00a0I really really really appreciated the zine and the children's book projects in this class, along with the response papers. Not having a large paper for this class made me enjoy learning so much more and I appreciated the opportunity to approach the course material from a different, more storytelling-based angle and to engage creative thought. The readings for this class were generally excellent. I appreciated that they were not overly long but still provided rich material for thought and discussion. Sometimes lectures became a bit dull, but I did enjoy the incorporation of documentary, film, and other medias. Lectures also did sometimes feel somewhat disjointed. Perhaps this is because we covered a longer period of time (so maybe this was inevitable, since it is the Long Civil Rights Movement). ",
            "\u00a0I thought the assignments were very interesting and challenging, but I would have enjoyed having more traditional essay-like tasks. The four reading responses were my favorite assignments of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0A weakness is that there were many documentaries and films shown in class that I feel could have been assigned for homework. While they were engaging and relevant in class, Feimster's lecture style is so engaging that I don't want to stop listening for an outside commentary that I could have seen last night. ",
            "\u00a0This class had many strengths. Professor Feimster is a great lecturer and is obviously immersed in and passionate about the topic. If you've only had your basic Civil Rights chapters in elementary/middle/high, you'll obviously learn a lot. But I found that even with extensive family education about the Civil Rights movement (including some of the longer history of black resistance), I was still shocked by how much there is to learn. I was lucky enough to have an AMAZING section, too, so you might be able to talk through some of the issues that echo throughout the semester's work with cool, open people.\r\n\r\n***A weakness to know from the beginning*** (particularly if you are not a first-year/sophomore): the assignments in the class feel very tedious. For both the midterm and final, there are a number of \"check-in\" assignments just to make sure you're doing the work. On an upperclassman schedule and level of independence, it's a bit annoying. Also, there is lots of art. An option to do the children's book project at the end or a longer academic paper (bc the children's book is really both a short paper and a project) would have been nice. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a blast! The assignments were enjoyable and lectures were highly engaging ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: teaching staff is great, lectures are great, material is great. Assignments are creative and uniquely challenging ",
            "\u00a0This course had great lectures, the assignments were interesting and different, and the section was helpful. The only weakness was that the class didn't incorporate the readings very much. ",
            "\u00a0I really loved the theses of the lectures-- the base knowledge was incredibly subversive and interesting. However, at times, lectures felt a little too prepared or forced. Also, I do appreciate the kind of different knowledge and skill base valued by the major semester projects; however, I'll admit that I found the openness a bit jarring, considering how we might be evaluated. ",
            "\u00a0This class has a political agenda, and at times it is difficult to understand why we do not discuss other sides of the agenda. I was often frustrated because things that I believed to not be fact were presented as fact in this class, and it was especially difficult because I felt like I did not belong in the classroom since I was not someone who was directly affected by this struggle.

            "\u00a0THIS IS SUCH AN AMAZING CLASS. Every lecture is incredible. The midterm and the final projects, although they are difficult, make you think in a completely new way and encourage creativity in a way most Yale lectures certainly don't. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Feimster's lectures were incredible, the readings intriguing, and the projects captivating. The only thing I was unhappy with was that the course could not go on longer than it did, for it felt that it stopped short of where it should have. ",
            "\u00a0I really loved the Professor's lectures, and I feel like section really helped to emphasize what we were learning in class. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures are so interesting! My only complaint is that the lectures were so narrative based that i sometimes felt confused about the timeline / historical context of the Movement. The course would benefit from having a more general guiding text that we read throughout the semester  in addition to the primary / secondary sources already included. ",
            "\u00a0This was a very strong course. Prof. Feimster gives engaging and powerful lectures and incorporates vidoes and images into the class that faciliate learning further. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this class were the fantastic Professor Crystal Feimster who presented the information in a very engaging way and challenged us to think about the course material differently. Additionally, the assessments (the midterm and the final) were very creative and much more helpful to the learning process than a long test or research paper. My teaching fellow, Anna Duensing, was great and the discussions that we had in section were always great.\r\n\r\nI would not say there were many weaknesses of this course. If anything, I simply wish that we had more time as Professor Feimster was forced to cut some things out at the end. ",
            "\u00a0The midterm zine project and the final children's book project both provided novel and interesting ways of understanding and thinking about the course material. Both made me think about the reader more than regular essays I've written in the past and they forced me to take different approaches to the subject matter. These assignments also did not feel like they were created just for the sake of doing something different. Making us present our ideas in a zine and a children's book made me work outside of my comfort zone and really engage with the projects. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the projects (both the zine and children's book) were great opportunities to get creative and approach the material differently from the same paper format every Yale student has gone through too many times; lectures were really engaging and interesting (Prof. Feimster is AWESOME!); section discussions addressed key topics in the readings and I always left feeling like I had thought about something from a different angle; readings were super informative and thought-provoking.\r\n\r\nI think the class could be improved if there were some opportunity for group work or to have prolonged conversations and relationships with classmates throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were very engaging. Section was sometimes a little unorganized, but it allowed for organic conversation. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: lectures, beautifully delivered, amazing phrasing, very engaging, and fully aware and responsive to the current cultural context. I really found myself reflecting on current events in a new light. The projects were also great, and allowed me a degree of leniency and creative interpretation that I can't find in other classes. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this class are many. The lecture style setting of the class makes it feel like story time every single time which is very enjoyable. The sections were very fruitful as well. The assignments were definitely a way to get hands on experience as to what activism looked like and could continue to look like which left me feeling inspired. ",

            "\u00a0There are ongoing projects that sometimes feel like a lot of small assignments (i.e. not jsut 3 big papers, you lowkey always have to do something for this course) but there are manageable if you don't lose track of the schedule. Discussion section quality really varied between TFs so that's disappointing. Also I wish grading was more transparent and consistent across TFs and assignments. ",
            "\u00a0This class only has a weakness for those who clutch to the idea that for a class to be good it needs to be incredibly difficult. Professor Feimster has created a class that empowers students with knowledge and shows how that knowledge can have a real effect. You learn the material in a way that is fun and allows for you to really internalize what you learn. ",

This class just overall is excellent at presenting new information in such an inspirational and passionate manner.

Most people hadn't heard of Pauli Murray until the residential college was named after her, yet she was a key figure throughout the Civil Rights Movement and a trailblazer. It's important to revisit what we think we know and this course is facilitated perfectly to reinforce what we know and introduce us to so much more. ",

This will be very different from most other courses that are heavily driven in papers -- the midterm and final are replaced by what some consider to be art projects. That being said, there are a lot of people on Yale's campus who could benefit from understanding the roots of racism in American society, and understanding their role in the system that still functions today. \r\n\r\nI often found myself intellectually challenged by other students in section, which was a tremendous learning experience itself. The course load is light (in my opinion).\r\n\r\nThe last thing I would say is that this course is pretty accessible. The required books altogether cost $25 off of amazon, which was far cheaper than what I was paying for one math textbook this semester. And if for some reason that is an issue, Professor Feimster is the kind of person who will help you make it work somehow -- the first week she told us that she wanted everyone to be able to take the class, which is something that shouldn't be taken for granted.

Go to lecture because Feimster is incredible and the content so relevant to 2017. ",

Learn about all the women that made civil rights happen!

It's not the most difficult/rigorous class (which can be good, depending on what you're looking for), but it certainly changed my whole perspective about civil rights, black power, and political organizing.

This class has a political agenda, and to have a TA tell me that my political beliefs are WRONG in section is quite appalling. The lectures were often disorganized as well and half of them are just videos that Prof. Feimster plays. Professor Feimster definitely cares about her students, but at times it seems like she cares more about some students than others.

I was looking for a class that would challenge my understanding of the civil rights movement in the modern day and how racism and discrimination prevail in our society, but this is entirely a history course. Lots of engaging lectures by Feimster, she is super cool. Note that she is a professor who reads notes and uses little visual aides, it makes for great story telling but it is easy to lose focus if you aren't listening intently. The TAs were all-stars too and very supportive of students and their efforts and advocacy on campus. "
