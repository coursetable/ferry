What's more, some examples which are closely related to economics and real world have been combined in class, and I suppose they are very helpful in introducing how math can be applied. "

Sometimes the in class quiz had more questions than we could do in 30 minutes so the instructor kindly gave us more time to finish. However it influenced the pace in class and we ran out of time as a result. I suppose it will be better if one question is cut off in some quizzes. ",
