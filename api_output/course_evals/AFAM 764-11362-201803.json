            "\u00a0This was the best possible course I could have taken to begin my graduate studies. I learned about historiography, thought about what it meant to be a historian, what sorts of questions we should ask, strengths and weaknesses of others' arguments. ",
            "\u00a0I got a deep take on the historiography of the Civil War, slavery, abolition, and the extended network of scholars that Prof. Blight has been a part of for four decades. I also got a better sense of how to talk about black history in 19th c. US history. ",
            "\u00a0As someone whose background in history is rather weak and underdeveloped, I was initially quite intimidated by this course because I did not know what methodologies were acceptable in history or how histories were measured against each other. In addition, I had no idea how to approach reading a massive history in only a week or so. However, I found that Professor Blight and my classmates were incredibly generous and quickly grew confident that there were advantages to engaging with these works from outside the discipline. In learning about the United States in the 19th century, I also learned about the history of the discipline as well as current innovations. I was exposed to a variety of different approaches to historical research and historical writing. Finally, by reading histories, I have adopted a greater burden of proof and evidence for my own argumentation that can only help my future research. "

            "\u00a0Strong reading list, great discussion, good system of having students \"present\" but without a lot of stress. I suppose a weakness was how popular it was because the class was quite large so participation could be intimidating. Can't really fault the professor for this though. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that some of the readings were repetitive. For people who don't study abolition, for example, \"Scorpion's Sting\" was kind of hard to get into because it seemed like such a particularly historiographical argument, and surrounded by several other readings about the same period, it didn't add a lot of depth. I also wanted more of a broad sweep of approaches, not just synthesis vs. original monograph. And I wanted more topics--more about Reconstruction, Mexico and Texas, westward expansion, and more racial/ethnic diversity than Af-Am and Anglo-Am (Indians, Chinese, Spanish/Mexican, immigration in NYC from Irish to Italians, etc.). I also thought the seminar had too many students in it to facilitate easy discussion. Many students seemed intimidated to speak up, except for a few who regularly spoke. This could be improved if Prof. Blight more actively encouraged participation by allowing for extended silences and asking questions that bring more students into the conversation. ",
            "\u00a01. As someone relatively unfamiliar with the historiography of 19th century America, I would have enjoyed reading more older works. Some of these did appear in the recommended reading lists, and we did have the chance to read an \"old, bad book\", but I think the course would have been more useful to me, in terms of preparing for exams and for teaching, if we'd spent a few weeks on the same topic--say, Reconstruction--and read two or three books from the last century, to get a sense of how writing about the topic has changed over that time. I think we mainly read books that had been published in the last ten years or so, I imagine that this seminar was more useful for specialists in the field who are preparing for orals. 2. The syllabus was tilted heavily towards slavery and the Civil War. I suppose that this is fair, given Prof. Blight's interests, but it might have been good either to include readings on political/cultural topics outside of slavery (perhaps on the Mexican War, reform movements, industry/technology), or to change the title of the course. 3. This seminar was really too large for effective discussion. It's good to accommodate all comers, but this makes it hard to get to know the professor and to feel that your voice matters. ",
            "\u00a0The course covered quite a bit of material in a way that was not overwhelming and it was well-organized. The initial assignment about the definitions and boundaries of history was a useful way to start the course. In-class presentations are always good exercises for synthesizing an argument which will be incredibly important as students move into their comprehensive exams. And the final writing assignment allowed students to branch out beyond the syllabus a bit and pursue a question that might not have been explicitly discussed otherwise. The class structure seems to have been perfected over several iterations. Therefore, the only suggestion for improvement might be to include on or two examples of histories that are interested in the Civil War but are not using it as the central event through which the history is structured. (And, it is quite possible that all examples of 19th Century American history have to include the Civil War as the central thread.) ",
            "\u00a0The best thing about this course is that Professor Blight is willing to assign texts that aren't just paint by the numbers, but rather tell narrative or story or unique writing style. Sometimes graduate school can feel a little bit robotic, and it gets boring simply breaking each book down for its methodological contribution. However, it would have been nice to have there be more of a mix of books that are skimmable and box that require more of a deep dive. Narrative texts are great, but they are not helpful when you are trying to lay down a foundation of facts about what happened broadly in a specific time period, and there were moments where I just wanted more exposition or just historiographical context. "

            "\u00a0100%. I learned so much in this course and really felt like it taught me what a historian ought to be like. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It's good orals prep, and Blight knows his stuff. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only to one who specializes in the history of slavery and the Civil War. It would be impossible to discuss the 19th century without devoting a great deal of attention to these subjects, because of their relevance and lasting impact, but it also seems unfair to devote an entire 19th century seminar to them. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to any student who might be interested in the Civil War as a national cultural event, the 19th century in the United States, history as a discipline, or the craft of writing an academic book. The course has a manageable workload and students have some control about how they complete the assignments in order to make the course fit into their other commitments. I would highly recommend this course to other students in history as well as other disciplines. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Any course with professor Blight is worth taking, particularly one about the status of the field, considering his position in and knowledge of it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it does what the title says it does. I will say that for non-specialists its not the easiest class to dive into, or to use to just get a background in the time period. It helps to know something about history as a discipline and the 19th cent as a time period going in. "
