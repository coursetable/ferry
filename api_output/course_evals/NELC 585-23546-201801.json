            "\u00a0a strength of the course was that it mixed practical information with real discussions and a broad range of material.  I enjoyed getting to talk about the way  simple things matter in exhibits, like labels, and also talk about more complex issues of peoples' engagement with an exhibit.  a weakness of the course was that the classes weren't always planned well enough to cover everything we were supposed to talk about.  I also would have appreciated a bit more feedback on assignments as we progressed through the semester so that I could be sure I was doing the assignments correctly and improving my work. \r\n Additionally, some of the students outside the department had a bit of a harder time finding and accessing the materials they needed for assignments.  both of these things could be easily rectified in the future with a little bit of foresight.
