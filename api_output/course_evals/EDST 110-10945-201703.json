            "\u00a0This course exposed me to facets of (and issues within) the U.S. education system that I had never before explored.  The course is a survey and does not go into depth about many topics, but most of the topics covered are worthy of discussion, and the class is enjoyable. ",

            "\u00a0I think I did a lot of critical thinking in this class, which was very exciting for me.Professor Debs did a good job of presenting all sides of a debate, so students had to grapple with the different aspects of an issue instead of going with their personal experience. I also learned how to write an education research paper which I think is a good skill! ",
            "\u00a0This course really expanded my knowledge of the topics and sectors related to education, and inspired me to want to learn more about policy and history. I really appreciated the focus on social justice and awareness of structural problems, as well as the call to action to help fix them. ",

I learned a lot about the history of the education system, different types of education, and the racial tracking of students that is implicit in U.S. education today. ",

This class helped me understand the ways in which education is a place where equity can be achieved but also often times facilitates inequities. This class also helped me reflect upon my own education, understand it and appreciate it better. ",

            "\u00a0In a broad sense, I developed an understanding of the most salient debates in education today.\r\n\r\nIn a stricter sense, I learned about the history of relying on education as an alternative to more interventionist policies to reduce poverty and economic distress, stereotype biases present in high stakes testing, the acting white debate, and the granular differences between magnet, charter, and voucher schools.\r\n\r\nAs a student of color, I became more attuned to my identity both in the school context and out.

            "\u00a0The course covers a wide breadth of topics, but does not necessarily provide an in-depth look into all of them. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Debs was very interesting and greatly helped make the course so interesting. The class also exposes you to so many different fields of educational reform that many of us found our interests in education shifting to new fields or widening in scope. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The lecture format of this class is disappointing although necessary. My favorite classes were the ones where we broke off into smaller discussion groups. ",
            "\u00a0The survey nature of the course is helpful in that it exposes us to a myriad of issues in education that we could explore further on our own.  The usefulness of the readings varied; fewer or shorter readings that are more concentrated with the content we discuss may be more beneficial.  I felt like I was one of few students who completed all of the readings.  Regardless, the sources in the readings were impressively detailed and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0The best strength of the course was definitely Professor Debs; she was amazing, passionate, and cared so much about her students!!  Hearing her excitement towards the course content made me excited!  I think the course was also, for the most part, well-structured.  The biggest weakness in the course was the lack of TFs... the course was definitely at a larger capacity than it could handle, which was noted by 29-day assignment returns, which is definitely below what is should be.  A 3rd (and potentially even 4th) TF would do wonders. ",
            "\u00a0I think something that could be improved would be a little less reading and more discussion of the reading material either in class or in section. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: It covers a wide breadth of topics, which is vital for an intro course. It allowed me to figure out which areas I am interested in so I can follow up with those more in the future. I enjoyed the breadth because it made me realize how many aspects of education I find cool/interesting that I didn't really know about before (ELL, deaf education, culture of power, higher ed, etc). I also thought that Professor Debs did a good job of breaking up lecture with different activities--like presentations, polls on reform, the data exercise, etc. I also REALLY enjoyed the classroom observation we got to do--that was a really valuable experience. I think Professor Debs also did a great job facilitating class discussion, which were rich and interesting and filled with people's individual experiences--I thought the discussion part was great!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: it had a lot of readings. I never could do them all so I felt out of touch with some lectures, which is unfortunate.But it also might have been a me problem. Professor Debs tries to remind people to \"read strategically\" and \"for the gist, not the details.\" ",
            "\u00a0I thought this was a very good introductory course that covered a lot of material in surprising depth. I think a regular section would be good, because when I went to the optional section it really improved my learning and understanding of the material. ",
            "\u00a0A great opener for understanding ed studies. My only regret is that there was not as strong of a linearity as I would've liked. The continuity between the subjects is always hard because it's on top of learning the subjects themselves, but I think it would've added to the experience. ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus for this course is excellent, and I often wanted more information on many of the topics we studied, but there just isn't time in such a broad course. The class setting was at times a little odd because it is a lecture course with about 70 students, but Professor Debs would encourage class discussionmostly the class just seemed too big to do so effectively. While this was Professor Debs' first time teaching this course it makes sense that there were some kinks in the syllabus, so I assume next semester this will be worked out, but at times readings just seemed to be assigned because she liked them and she did not realize how much there actually was. A huge strength of this course was the visit to a New Haven classroom. ",
            "\u00a0The course goes over a broad set of topics and students are assessed in a few different methods (in-class essay, take-home paper, etc.). If I am nitpick, I felt as if I would have benefitted from knowing a little bit more about expectations for the different assessments, but really don't think the course had many weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the reading load of this course should be lighter. The assigned reading was unrealistic and we could have gotten just as much from reading less of all the same sources. It also felt like we did not have time in class to engage with all the readings. Another potential solution is making sections mandatory. I think it would also make sense to have section and then make the class period shorter, because we would be able to address the material more in section. ",
            "\u00a0Maybe the most enlightening aspect of the course for me was the classroom observation exercise and the written reflection that followed it. It really helped me understand a side of education that I had never seen before and helped me better reflect on my own educational experiences. The school I visited was right around the corner from Yale, and was a place of learning that I otherwise never would have learned from. \r\n\r\nMy only critique about the classroom observation assignment was that I had to skip my own classes to attend them. We could only schedule school observations when school was in session, which is approximately from 8-2. However, as an athlete, all of my own classes have to be scheduled from 9-2 because of our daily practice schedule. Dr. Debs suggested that we go to the schools at 7:30 when they opened, but this option was not available for me either as I always have practice in the mornings during this time as well and so the classroom observation assignment meant I had to skip a few of my own classes to make it work. ",
            "\u00a0The readings were at times heavy, and there was little guidance on the final research paper. I loved the classroom observations, and I also thought the lectures were organized and clear ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: covers a huge scope of topics! Very applicable to things going on today. Gives you both the background of what happened/what is going on now in edu field, as well as starts you on thinking about how to solve those problems.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I liked the attempt at making a lecture-seminar hybrid, but I'm not sure it always worked. I think the model may be improved by doing more of the small-group discussions and less of the \"teacher calls on individual students to share their experiences\" - sometimes the latter could get out of hand, so that one student's lengthy answer could easily be summarized in one sentence of takeaway. But I loved the small group discussions bc it made it easier to engage, and often we'd use these discussions to talk about solutions to problems instead of just sharing problems. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are most definitely the material covered. We crammed a lot of different topics into one semester and it gives one an understanding of not so many specific issues, but a great deal of broad ones. I think this course could be improved through mandatory discussion sessions where we can discuss the readings. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very strong in its breadth and consideration of education through a diverse array of lenses. The readings were quite interesting and compelling, but they were also repetitive and long. Lectures could sometimes get a bit dry, and section was often useless. ",
            "\u00a0Really good survey class, especially in the first 2/3 of the semester. After Thanksgiving break the class got a little more disjointed, as we were focusing more on our final projects, covered different topics very quickly each class, and were not going to be tested on the material. I think it would be good to have had papers periodically throughout the semester instead of the midterm to better and more periodically solidify the material and the readings. ",
            "\u00a0It's a survey course, so of course it has some of the 'pitfalls' of a lecture course -- but that is just the nature of the beast. \r\n\r\nThat being said, Professor Debs does everything she can to make it more seminar-like, with the Canvas discussions, her direct participation with students floating around the class, break-out sessions, the discussion sections, the fact that she does a remarkable job learning everyone's name. That seems trivial to an outside observer, but I think it speaks to the obvious dedication she brought to the course. It was an honor to learn from her -- her knowledge was encyclopedic and her insights were crucial to our edification. ",
            "\u00a0S:\r\n\r\nThis was a phenomenal course. The debates were laid out in an organized and digestible fashion, allowing us to get just enough depth to understand the debates. The field study was also a really unique and transformational experience (I was able to visit Metropolitan Business Academy). Finally, Professor Debs led the course artfully. \r\n\r\nW: \r\n\r\nThis course can be improved by spending a little less time on the abstract / philosophical takes on education and more time on the current topics that those hoping to go into education will inevitably be grappling with. ",
            "\u00a0This course is excellent for students who wish to enter the field of education policy, but can be discouraging for students who actually want to teach. The readings were interesting but seemed to be chosen for breadth over depth. It is a good course and a good introduction to policy and the key institutional issues within education, but students should be aware that the class's focus is not on /teaching/. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a disappointment. Professor Debs clearly wants to teach the class as a seminar. If this is the case, section should have been made mandatory, instead of using 10+ minutes of class time to get into discussion groups. The discussions rarely enhanced the class and sometimes felt hostile. \r\n\r\nThe readings were by far the most interesting part of the course and the lectures were almost obsolete. The lectures were disorganization and often seemed like Professor Debs hadn't taken any time to synthesize the broad range of information she was attempting to cover. Education is such a broad topic and this class could have benefited from a theme, narrative pull, etc. Really any organizing force would have been beneficial. \r\n\r\nThe work in this class was all over the place. It would have been nice if the readings could have been around the same length every week. \r\n\r\nThe assignments rarely made sense. It seemed like this course was designed to be a sociology course, but that was never really acknowledged, making it difficult to navigate when approaching education from a different disciplinary lenses. \r\n\r\nI wanted to love this class, but was continually let down. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course could be strengthened by more structuring of the writing assignments. For a couple of them (purpose statement and research paper) I wasn't really sure what was expected of me. One of the strengths of the course is Professor Debs' use of class participation; a lot of the learning happened through sharing about our own school experiences. The reading was also overly long, and I think students would be more likely to engage with the reading if they were more manageable for a lecture course. I would rather read something short, in depth, rather than skim 200 pages for a class. ",
            "\u00a0This course would have been better if it assigned less reading but encourage students to engage more deeply with the readings. I did not like the 'harvarding' advice from the syllabus, instructing us to skim/read the readings to get the gist-- i was only able to gain surface-level understanding by doing so. \r\n\r\nThe course was strong in that it provided a wide range of opinions. I do wish, however, that Professor Debs had been more open about her stances on the issues we discussed--she clearly has a wealth of knowledge, and sometimes I wished she would make her opinions clear (allowing us to agree or disagree) while presenting all the sides, instead of masking her own opinions for the sake of not being biased. ",
            "\u00a0I felt that the course was unproductive.  We did not read any of the books we were required to purchase in their entirety.  There was not enough discussion in the class -- I think this could be solved by making the course a seminar and having two sections of it.  This course is fairly new, so understand there were some hiccups.  I think it would have been highly beneficial to have less reading and to go into concepts a tad more, rather than have the professor just give a brief summary of what we were supposed to read. ",
            "\u00a0This course had A LOT of readings and they were oftentimes quite long. I believe the reading list could be shortened as it was overwhelming to read that much. Also, this course had trouble recapitulating the main ideas of the course for me. Oftentimes, I felt lost after leaving class, and I think it was because of a lack of organization. The class mainly consisted of PowerPoints and some discussion. Every day in class treated a different topic and it seemed that we never went back to review those topics in the following days. In essence, I felt there was not enough review of the topics covered. The class would just skim through the topics and never return to them. ",
            "\u00a0This course had very interesting reading material that fostered engaging discussions and the development of new perspectives. Professor Debs also allowed discussion during each lecture, which made the class feel much smaller and more inclusive. A weakness of this course is that there was often too much reading material, and I often felt as though I had to skim or skip some very interesting readings for the sake of time. Also, feedback on written assignments was rather vague and inconsistent. ",
            "\u00a0There were a lot of readings that often times were not completely necessary to succeed in the class (especially after the midterm), but all of the content was extremely interesting and I love the way the class was structured. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a good overview but had some gaps in information. ",
            "\u00a0This class should above all be neutral, and I didn't feel that at all. This class felt like the epitome of the echo chamber. Students made unfounded claims, and seemed to have no humility around their limited knowledge. This course needs to be more balanced in the ideas it presents and especially in the class comments, to limit radicalization of thought. ",
            "\u00a0The courses strength lies in the topic of education as it is a topic that is deeply personal and important to people from different walks of life. One of the best parts of the class was hearing about the educational experiences of other students in the class. However, the weakness of the class is the awkward balance between lecture and student discussion. As a small lecture, there were always plenty of opportunities for student discussion and input which was often times productive but other times proved to be tedious and not as effective as lecture would have been perhaps. ",
            "\u00a0Though the topics of the course were interesting and readings were well chosen, it ended up feeling rather repetitive in some parts - for example, we spent most of the first half of the semester on various forms of educational inequities. While critically important, many classmates seemed to agree that many of the studies seemed to blend together. Further, we spent little time talking about the modern day policy landscape (for example, specific policy considerations of DeVos), or the current state of reforms (besides a few good readings on the internal conflicts among ed reformers). I'd be hard pressed to say that I could leave the class being able to really better able to evaluate what works and what doesn't in the US educational system. Granted, the course was certainly meant to be a mile wide, inch deep survey - yet it felt like we didn't necessarily cover the breadth. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course gives a very good layout of what education looks like in the United States, but it gives too much breadth and not enough depth of important issues. Furthermore, even in it's wide scope of topics, there were still multiple issues not covered such as children with disabilities and lgbtq students. ",
            "\u00a0The course was amazing in giving the broadest overview of education possible. Even though it was a lecture, professor Debs did a great job making it feel engaging by splitting us up into smaller groups to discuss issues and topics in more detail, giving us a chance to hear a diverse group of ideas from people with different educational backgrounds. ",
            "\u00a0Although it is a survey course, I think there was not enough time spent on the topics and too much on the theory of people like Montessori. Other than that, it was a great overview of education as a study. ",
            "\u00a0- not enough substantive engagement with the reading\r\n- not enough in depth focus on individual topics before moving on to the next ",
            "\u00a0I felt like this was a great course and that Professor Debs did a really fantastic job. I especially appreciated how students were encouraged to talk about their own experiences in the education system and more broadly how participation was encouraged during lectures. I also enjoyed the opportunity to conduct a classroom observation and to see how a lot of what we discussed in class operates in practice. I felt like the assignments in general did a great job at giving us choice in what to write about and combined objective research with personal experience in a compelling way. \r\n\r\nIn terms of weaknesses, there are a few additional topics that I would have liked to have seen covered (mainly some basic developmental psychology and a bit more on pedagogy/learning styles.) I feel like 1-2 lectures on these topics would have been helpful especially when approaching the classroom observation. Furthermore, I felt like the reading load could sometimes be uneven and that it would have been helpful to have it more spread out/a clearer sense of which readings to prioritize. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Breadth of information covered! Final research paper, very interesting diverse readings \r\nWeaknesses: More stuff on pedagogies please! Putting them into practice. Also, the presentations in class moved too fast in terms of material covered. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: sections and lectures were always really interesting and engaging \r\n\r\nweaknesses: sometimes there was too much reading assigned i think "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course for a student with a serious interest in education - the workload is otherwise not worth it. That being said, Professor Debs is amazing and tries her best to be invested in every one of her students on a personal level. She also really tries to make sure we receive a comprehensive view of American education, both historically and in the present. ",
            "\u00a0This course is amazing. Anyone with any interest in education and educational reform should strongly consider taking it. ",
            "\u00a0I would indubitably recommend this course!  Professor Debs is amazing at what she does, and Yale truly needs more professors like her.  A few recommendations, though (to course administrators): 1) I wish the TAs were on a rotation for who graded which assignments.  This year, the TA assignment was split by the alphabet, and since one TA was a harsher grader, some students did noticeably better with similar quality work.  2) This class was more writing than I had anticipated.  It's about the equivalent of an ENGL11X writing class.  A potential outlet to increase this class would be to see if an optional WR credit could be fulfilled.  It'd be less than one more paper's worth of writing.  ALSO, to students: don't treat this course like a gut.  Attendance/participation is a large chunk of your grade, and Professor Debs pays sharp attention to who's in class and who's not.  But trust me, this isn't a class you'd want to treat as a gut anyways! ",

I think that Credit/D would be a good option though, because you could go to all the classes and benefit from the rich class discussions and touch on the different topics/readings, but not have to stress as much about the grade. ",

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend for other students to take this class. Since taking this class I have realized that I want to work in the education field after graduation. The material in this course changes quickly, so if it is a unit you're not particularly interested in, it will soon change. The education field is such an interesting and relevant area of study right now and there is a lot more to it than one might originally think. Obviously take this class if you want to apply to the Ed Studies Scholars program, but you should also take this class if you want any more information on what was such an integral part of your upbringing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It opened my eyes to how complex our education system is - really engaging and interesting course. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course, especially if you want an introduction to the American educational landscape. This class covers a lot of really interesting information! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0Yes--this class if very interesting if you do not know a lot about the education system in America. It is a very broad survey of the history and policies in U.S. education. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to everyone before they graduate from Yale. As Yale students we have all extremely benefited from educational systems around the world in one form or another and this course is extremely helpful in understanding how this is not the case for many other people. Even if you are not an Education Studies scholar you should take this course because education is relevant to all of our lives and this course will give you a foundation to be a little more critical and reflect more on something we sometimes take for granted. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, mostly because I think it is something that every body should be informed about, and the readings are always interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Even if you're not interested in edu at all, this is a great course to explain many larger societal problems in the US, and esp within the scope of edu. Applicable to everyone bc we all have gone through some sort of edu to get here, and this will impact the future of your family and future generations of Americans. ",
            "\u00a0YES ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to other students. It's a great way to gain insight into whether the Education Studies program is one that may interest you and if the field of education, in some shape or form, is one you may like to occupy. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The material was fascinating and important and Professor Debs was great. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. ",
            "\u00a0I took this course as a senior and I'm really glad I did. Professor Debs is a great professor and gives you a good grasp of the most salient debates in education today. The workload is manageable (1 midterm exam, 1 final paper, 1 classroom visit + write-up). The interactive/collaborative aspect of the course is also cool since you get to meet and learn from other aspiring educators. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course if you are interested in education, not because it is a good course, but because it is required for better education courses. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend Ed Studies to someone interested in education and in reflecting on their own educational experiences. ",
            "\u00a0If you want an intro to what the various things people study within education studies, then yes, i would recommend ",
            "\u00a0If a student is interested in becoming and education studies scholar, then yes.  If not, don't waste your time.  You'll learn more by just reading books on education on your own time. ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend this course to another student if they are very interested in education. The readings are many, but they are interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. If you have any interest in education or teaching, take this course. It will really help you figure out which areas you're interested in and the classes you might want to take next. Professor Debs is great and gives such good insight during class as to possible areas of study/job search/etc. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to someone who wants a general introduction to education topics in the USA. Due to the scope of topics this course covers, there is more breadth than depth, but the written assignments allow students to more deeply pursue a specific topic. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course is amazing and should be taken by anyone even remotely interested in education. ",
            "\u00a0This is a good intro class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because I believe all Yale students should learn about the systems and processes that got them to the institution they sit in today. ",
            "\u00a0The class is a bit of a mixed bag - one certainly learns more about the research in educational inequities in the country, as well as a nice mix of other topics (SPED, Native American education, etc), but in general it suffers from spending too much time (much of the first half) on inequities, with less reflection on important topics like philosophies on the purpose of education, and how policy solutions might arise from different philosophies on the purpose of education. It's really difficult to make an introductory course that satisfies the interests of everyone taking it though, and Dr. Debs and the TAs certainly put in a lot of good effort to the course. The classroom visit was one of the highlights, as were the guest speakers (Dr. Kao and faculty from Amistad). ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it to anyone who's looking to be an education studies scholar. ",
            "\u00a0Any student, whether you're interested in education or not, should take this course. Professor Debs is amazing, and it's both interesting and valuable to have an appreciation for the diversity and history of education philosophy, practice, and policy. The course also spends a good amount of time on inequities in education, giving students from different backgrounds an idea of their place in the education field. ",
            "\u00a0yes, i would recommend this course to anyone who is developing or considering an interest in education. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student! It's a great start to learning about fundmanetal topics in education and discuss your personal educational background with your peers. I know I really cherished the opportunity to reflect deeper and more academically on educational topics which I've been pondering for a long time. ",
            "\u00a0I took this course credit/d/fail which I would also recommend for anyone who is not in Education Studies. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to learn more about the field of education, more survey-basic sense, it's a great class for you! ",
            "\u00a0yes i learnt a lot "
