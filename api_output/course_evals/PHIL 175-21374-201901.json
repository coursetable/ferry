More than other Yale classes I've taken, people really liked to hear themselves talk in section, and if you are a little slower coming up with comments you can get kind of locked out of the conversation.

Since people are graded on how much they talk, people are forced to speak before carefully considering their thought- it leads to a lot of shallow conversation. This is supposed to be fixed by saying that to get points they have to be thoughtful comments but it is seriously ridiculous to expect people to come up with 3 great things in 50 minutes and be lucky enough to get the chance to say them before someone starts talking ",

The papers (although short) are graded tough but fair and really require a great load of work from a student outside the class. ",
            "\u00a0The key strength of the course is the Professor and the lectures, which were consistently amazing. Definitely the best lecturer I have had at Yale. The second strength was the dedication of the TAs, who gave me so many helpful comments. Perhaps the only weakness of the class is how much participation is factored into the final grade, which makes section a competition to speak which can sometimes dilute the quality of the conversation. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: excellent professor, lectures engaging, TAs great, opportunities to ask questions/seek help, workload manageable\r\nWeaknesses: maybe more focus on the text because I think it's important to develop a clear understanding of the ethical argument laid out by the philosopher before evaluating--this class seemed tilted more toward the evaluation portion, but I think interpretation is also critical to philosophy.

There should be a clearer outline of the lectures throughout the semester, so we know what we are discussing ahead of time. There is clear feedback on the papers which is greatly appreciated. Section was helpful because it elucidated the lecture and allowed me to grapple through the texts with my peers. However, I wish there were more office hours with TAs to discuss papers, as I felt like my papers could have been improved much more had I some questions answered before writing them. ",

He's polarizing, the papers are graded harshly, the lectures are interesting, the readings are more or less optional (although you'll probably get more out of the class if you actually do them), and lots of students take it Credit/D.

It was almost as if lecture was simply a time to hear Shelly speak, but that the rest of the course (writing essays and meeting in section) was an entirely different affair simply run by TFs. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were great, but the sections were not conducive to learning about ethics. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Pretty much everything. Shelly is a great lecturer who clearly knows so much about ethics. TFs (at least mine, your results may vary) were very good, and section was a particular highlight. Unlike most introductory philosophy sections, this section isn't very exegetic at all; this is a great example of \"doing philosophy\" instead of merely learning what other philosophers said. We actually had really meaningful debates about complex and controversial ethical problems. I thought the papers were graded fairly and the feedback was very helpful. Shelly makes a point about how hard his class is, I don't really buy it. If you put some though into the papers, you should do fine. Don't take it Credit-D, save that for something else.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Honestly, can't really think of any. ",
            "\u00a0Shelly is a great lecturer but at times he takes to long to get to the point. Our unit on utilitarianism was interesting, but the actual information we learned could have been summarized much more quickly. However, I typically enjoyed both coming to class and the discussions held in my section. ",

The current method encouraged people to participate for the sake of a participation grade, even if they had nothing to really contribute. It also encouraged some people to dominate the conversation and others to interrupt if they felt they needed to participate. In general, I think it made section a more stressful and less productive environment. ",

Tas can not look at your papers or talk directly about your topics so it is impossible to learn to write better. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Shelly. Interesting content that, when presented in an engaging manner, can actually be a lot of fun. Weaknesses: section can become very abstract very fast when people have weak understandings of course content but try to argue about it. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, the course was excellent. The lectures were very interesting, and were not simply about certain intellectuals, but rather also about bigger ideas and topics. \r\n\r\nThe discussion sections were not as great in my opinion. The grading system was pretty confusing, and based on mid-term participation grade information, I felt like I was rewarded for participating much, much less and for making more basic points in discussion. I think that revisiting or at least making the grading system more clear for students would be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0strengths:\r\nlearned a lot, Kagan is a good lecturer\r\n\r\nweaknesses;\r\neverything else about the class especially the grading ",
            "\u00a0Shelley Kagan IS the course. Hes such an engaging lecturer and makes things so interesting. Section was always interesting and went by quickly. The only issue would be students sometimes dominating the conversation and not allowing for meaningful conversation because they would shut discussions down. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that lectures were extremely interesting in their own right. Hearing Shelly lecture is very captivating and inspiring; however, I would have personally liked there to be more structure (both visually and online in some form) for students to follow. I also thought that the grading was especially harsh, and could have been more lenient to many of those who were writing their first philosophy papers. ",
            "\u00a0It should either cover more (not just deontology and utilitarianism) or make it more explicit that this is only a small introduction to ethics. While it is obviously intro ethics, and of course you wouldn't expect to get very in-depth about any topic, having it be an introductory class suggests that it is a survey class, which at least gives the suggestion that it would cover the main types of ethics that are \"worth taking seriously,\" but then does not even touch on virtue ethics. This creates the impression that deontology and utilitarianism are the only two \"legitimate\" options for moral systems. ",
            "\u00a0My only qualm with the class is that resources were not made readily available online, so when students lost essay prompt sheets or missed a lecture, there would be no way for them to catch up or retrieve these things. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the structure of the course with engaging lectures, a section, and just three papers throughout the semester. I thought that the progression of the course was great and really made me think critically about \"morality\" as a whole and outside each individual moral theory. ",
            "\u00a0The course was good, not excellent, but good.  Clearer expectations for section and papers would be nice. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are in Shelly's lectures and the readings, both of which are excellent. The only suggestion I have, though, is that the guidelines of section be clearer. Our section tended to devolve into a few voices talking over the rest, and surprisingly, those students tended to be rewarded by the TA for their contributions. This is not how section should be. It felt like the more often you spoke, the better your grade was, which is obviously a perverse incentive. Instead, the quality of contribution should be valued over quantity. ",
            "\u00a0Changing the grading system would be nice. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of the course is the emphasis on writing. A weakness is that some of the people in the class can be very annoying because they think they know everything. I was one of these people for a period and I feel ashamed. Just let Shelly talk, for the love of god. Stop interrupting with insights. ",
            "\u00a0Loved the lectures. Feel like the reading could be better incorporated though. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this was a great course that really dove into the material covered and gave a great overview and introduction into several of the basic theories in moral ethics. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Shelly is obviously an incredible lecturer, and each class is incredibly engaging.\r\nWeaknesses: Could talk about the texts in class a bit more, and as always, grading is harsh. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Shelly Kagan knows what he's talking about, learning from a true and renowned expert in the subject matter cannot be beaten.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Shelly does not structure lecture well, I find it hard to know what his points of emphasis are (ie; what we should be remembering). Thus, the course relies heavily on dense philosophical texts. There are very little visual guides to help us map the concepts in our head. Incorporating Powerpoints in the lecture would improve it. ",
            "\u00a0The material was structured well. The order in which we discussed various philosophies worked well and each theory seemed to build upon the previous. No major weakness with the course. ",
            "\u00a0Shelley did a great job in the first half of the course. He spent so much time building up the ideas from ground level, and because of that I had a strong base by the second half of the class to keep going back to. The second half was harder, because we had less time to cover more stuff, and so I found myself getting a bit more lost than usual, but I think it was all fair at the end of the day, and I think this class was very strong. ",
            "\u00a0I really loved this class, Shelly is a great lecturer, but I recommend credit-Ding the course, as not having to worry about grades made the material much less stressful to enjoy and engage with. ",
            "\u00a0I love the lectures but the content is hard for papers ",
            "\u00a0Lecture notes perhaps, but that wont happen. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are an absolute highlight - Shelly is an entertaining and insightful lecturer. He sometimes gets a little too wrapped up in his performance, but you will learn a lot anyway. He really doesn't care about the philosophical texts themselves (which are very short), so it doesn't feel necessary to do the readings, since any important content is covered in class. The main way the class could be improved is the TAs. For the first weeks, I had a very poor TA who did not do a good job teaching the content or helping with papers. But when I switched sections, I enjoyed the class much more and had a very positive experience. The essay prompts are interesting, and you will learn more from writing essays that any other part of the class. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: It really doesn't make sense for the instructor to assign readings that we'll never talk about in lecture or in section and never write about in the papers. The massive emphasis on section participation is huge drawback. It really encourages people to interrupt others to get their two cents in and the TFs are told to stay as uninvolved as possible which often means that the discussions get really ridiculous and people start saying a lot of nonsense just to get that participation grade. I really disliked how the TFs told us that the purpose of the sections was to encourage us how to \"be assertive\" in conversations. For a lot of people, that just means being kind of rude. \r\n\r\nStrengths: The paper prompts were really thought-provoking  and I liked how they encouraged us to focus on thinking critically about possible holes and objections in our claims. The professor was engaging, but the lectures were definitely very redundant. A lot of time is spent rehashing concepts/ideas/thought experiments -- kind of like beating a dead horse with some of those. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: This class missed the point lol. THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS RIGHT AND WRONG. YOU MUST REMOVE THIS IDEA OF \"MORALITY\" FROM YOUR MINDS. THERE EXISTS NO OBJECTIVE MORALITY. QUESTION ALL OF YOUR MORAL JUDGEMENTS. WHY DO YOU EVEN THINK THESE MORAL DILEMMA TYPE ESSAYS EXIST. FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS PHILOSOPHERS HAVE BEEN STUDYING MORAL PHILOSOPHY, AND THEY STILL HAVEN\"T COME UP WITH AN OBJECTIVE ANSWER TO THE TROLLEY PROBLEM. HMM I WONDER WHY. BECAUSE \"MORALITY\" IS NONSENSE- YOU EITHER PUSH THE FAT MAN OR YOU DONT- NEITHER DECISION IS RIGHT NOR WRONG, IT IS SOLEY A DECISION. SEEK WISDOM MY FRIENDS. CLEANSE YOUR POOR JUDGMENTAL MINDS.\r\nStrengths: Super well taught, very engaging lectures- I paid attention throughout all 50min lectures, did not do any readings, and still learned the ideas of the key philosophers covered. Super low workload too- just 3 papers of 5 pages each. They are also chill with letting you make up sections if you have to miss. Also the grading can be a strength if you credit/D this class because it really pushes you to improve. Good TAs! And good amount of feedback on papers. Shelly is a funny guy too ",
            "\u00a0During discussion sections, I felt stupid. Now, certainly don't think it's problematic to feel clueless at Yale. I wouldn't take a class about something I already know everything about. However, I don't think these sections are structured to facilitate students learning AT ALL. Students are graded according to 1) how many times/how often they speak, 2) contributing \"meaningful\" thoughts/critiques of the material and 3) demonstrating proper discussion section ethics. Section doesn't necessarily provide students with an opportunity to improve/become better at making/critiquing philosophical arguments. It doesn't provide a space for students to try on/test/propose arguments that aren't entirely solid. If you're a slow-thinker, section can be very difficult and disheartening; I would recommend coming to section with questions/comments written down so that you have something to contribute (of course, that technique doesn't facilitate organic conversation).

I went into the course thinking I would be really interested in ethics, but I realized I'm more interested in ethics applied to real life such as business/law and this class is definitely more philosophy/metaethics/normative question focused. Not a bad thing if you're interested in that, obviously. ",

            "\u00a0YES. This is an essential Yale course. As a stem major this was not a requirement and a class I elected to take for fun and boy did I love it. It's is tough so that is something to consider. Additionally if you are taking a tough course-load or take STEM classes I highly recommend credit D'ing the course. In order to succeed grade-wise in the class you have to dedicate a sufficient amount of time to engage with the material outside of class (re-reading lecture notes, re-reading texts, engaging peers in conversation, and meeting with TA's regularly), this is very hard to balance with a tough course load time-wise. The teacher has amazing energy and is a great speaker. TA's (from my own experience and that of other peers) are great and really push section to the next level and dedicated a lot of their time to helping students. If you even think you are interested in this class, shop it. Just keep in mind that while it is a lot of fun it require a good amount of work. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is a great course for anyone. The knowledge is surprisingly relevant and applicable and the lectures are fantastic. With a bit of work an A is attainable in spite of the harsh grading. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Moral philosophy poses very interesting questions that have no clear consensus, but the discussion is very intriguing! You'll learn different moral theory views and also get to discuss your own views and hear your classmates' views as well. Shelly is a great lecturer and loves questions and engaged students. Section requires engagement and active participation, which may be difficult for some, but it really helps you develop your own thoughts and hear other thoughts that you've never thought of before. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Very interesting stuff. And don't credit/d/fail, the grading isn't that bad. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student that wants to improve their argumentative writing. If you've had a philosophy background, I would stipulate this course would be too basic and not engaging. However, if one has no background in philosophy and wants to learn more, this is a good starting course. This course is definitely above average, but also overrated and not necessarily a \"must-take.\" If you plan to work hard, then I would not worry about Credit/D/Fail-ing this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah - although it's definitely not for everyone. ",
            "\u00a0100% ",
            "\u00a0No ",
            "\u00a0Yes, only issue is they don't give the rubric for the essays ( a tad annoying) ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to another student who wants to learn and practice writing philosophy essays. Lecture is engaging and interesting as are the essay prompts. Consider credit/d if you have a heavy course load or if you would like to eliminate stress. ",
            "\u00a0If you are into thinking about moral choices and applied ethics, this is the course for you. If you are not into discussing abstract themes, this is not the course for you. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely I would recommend it. This course is one of the jewels in the bluebook. It's accessible to anyone and everyone, is taught by a great lecturer, has really minimal work, has a section you'll actually want to attend, and covers topics that are profoundly meaningful. If you are interested in the questions \"Why should I do good things?\", \"How do I know if what I do is right?\", \"Who gets to define what 'right' even means?\", and the like, you should absolutely take the class. ",
            "\u00a0If you're the type to freak out at the prospect of getting a B+, fine, take it credit/d. However, I think if I wasn't taking this class for an actual letter grade I would have gotten nothing out of it. I tried on the papers (which are actually pretty interesting to write) only because I was scared of the grade I would get. This made me both write and rewrite them before I turned them in and that process is where I learned the most about philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student, particularly one who wants to become a better writer or thinker (everyone?!). Don't be scared by the grading system. I think if you follow Shelly's guidelines, you'll surprise yourself. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Shelly is so fun, an amazing lecturer, and puts together an excellent class. It's not as scary as its reputation would suggest. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course. Professor Kagan is very captivating and intelligent, and I thought this course provided me with a new way of thinking about important ideas. ",
            "\u00a0NO! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this class is a must! Dont be scared by people saying its so hard and if you take it, credit d. I was fooled by that and consequently credit d failed it. DONT WASTE A CREDIT D! I tried to put in little effort into my essays but I ended up wanting to work hard on them because they were interesting. Even without proofing and editing a lot, I got B/As on all of my essays. If I had tried just a little harder I could have gotten solid As. Its not that hard and I wasted a credit d. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - I learned a lot about my own values by taking this course, and found that the class helped me learn a lot about how to live my everyday life as it did how to learn more about how to forgive. I think that this course really helps one to reconcile their own views on life, and to present structured theories to complement those views. Definitely worth taking for that alone. ",
            "\u00a0Only if you haven't taken other ethics courses. It is fairly easy (though I did take it as a senior major) if you go to lecture. ",
            "\u00a0This class shift my perspective completely. It was not easy, as someone with a weaker background in the humanities, but I still thoroughly enjoyed it. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The lectures were incredibly engaging, and my friends and I would often walk out of class and continue to talk about the moral theories over lunch. It really is challenging course material, but will push you to think in different ways if you're not used to philosophy. The papers require a lot of thought, and the grading system is harsh. Unless you're really into philosophy, I would say that it's a perfect class to credit-D. ",
            "\u00a0I do not care if you take this course credit D.  If you take this course credit D, you know that I know that you know that you won't try.  If you don't take this course credit D, expect to work really really hard.  Rewrite your papers, it's a necessary condition for a decent grade. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was very interesting and accessible. You learn a lot about morality, whether we should be moral, and what acting morally truly means. It's important for everyone, no matter what their life path is. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only if you take it credit D. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is an incredible class with valuable and engaging material. Just be aware that it is far from a gut, and you will likely not do as well as you hope. ",
            "\u00a0Take it. Kagans crazy but the good kind. ",
            "\u00a0YES. This course is truly excellent. I actually enjoyed it, but the content is so broadly applicable and essential to life that I would recommend it to everyone, even a student who doesnt enjoy philosophy. Any class that is fun to wake up for on a Thursday morning is a GREAT class. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend. Shelley is amazing. The class is wonderful. Take it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend! I took this course as a requirement for EPE, but truly think that this is one of those courses that students outside of the major take anyway for Shelly. If you're curious about the field, or are looking for a cool class to broaden the way you perceive certain situations, this is it. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, for anyone looking for an introduction to the world of philosophy, as this assumes no prior knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0I would not -- do not take this class for fun. It was much more challenging than anticipated, as writing philosophy papers is a difficult adjustment. ",
            "\u00a0I personally wouldn't just because I was not interested in the material the course covered. If this topic is something that interests people then it is a good introduction to various moral theories and where they get their authority from. ",
            "\u00a0Please take this course. Everyone is constantly complaining about how Shelly is a hard grader, but that is complete bull. He gives you a grade that really tells you how you did, and provided you with a very clear document how to write a philosophy paper that tells you how to improve. Just following that document alone gets you so far. Also he gave us so much creative liberty, and you dont really get that in many other classes. It gives you a chance to breath and be independent, and I couldnt recommend it more. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, you should take it before you graduate. ",
            "\u00a0yes ",
            "\u00a0A great lecture class and great TFS ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course. Shelly's energy and keen sense of humor encapsulates the essence of a perfect Yale lecture. Class expectations are high, but your grades will reflect the amount of effort you put in. I will say this, however: take the class, you won't regret it. ",
            "\u00a0You do three distinct things in this class: You have section about a text, you go to lecture, and you write papers. They dont feel connected. Shelly is a great lecturer, but the lectures are rather repetitive. Small workload, but stressful if youre taking it for a grade. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely - to anyone thinking of taking this class, DO NOT be scared of the grading structure. Shelly loves to brag about how many C's he hands out, but when 25% of the class is taking it credit-D-Fail, the number of C's doesn't mean much. If you work hard on papers and meet with TA's often, your grade will be totally fine. Aside from grades, you will learn a ton about ethics (especially Mill and Kant) while being consistently entertained. Also, your writing will improve substantially, since the TA's do expect clean, logical, concise arguments. ",
            "\u00a0I don't think I would have stayed in this course if it weren't a requirement for my major. The sections are truly a waste of time and while Kagan was a fun lecturer, it's difficult for me to really articulate what I've walked away from his lectures with. ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course (Cr/D/F)!! Only because Shelly is a great lecturer and it gets your mind thinking about morality. Thinking about what is right and wrong, and what WAS right and wrong will eventually lead you to the conclusion that there really exists no right and wrong. You must leave this class realizing that THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS RIGHT AND WRONG. YOU MUST REMOVE THIS IDEA OF \"MORALITY\" FROM YOUR MINDS. THERE EXISTS NO OBJECTIVE MORALITY. QUESTION ALL OF YOUR MORAL JUDGEMENTS. WHY DO YOU EVEN THINK THESE MORAL DILEMMA TYPE ESSAYS EXIST. FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS PHILOSOPHERS HAVE BEEN STUDYING MORAL PHILOSOPHY, AND THEY STILL HAVEN\"T COME UP WITH AN OBJECTIVE ANSWER TO THE TROLLEY PROBLEM. HMM I WONDER WHY. BECAUSE \"MORALITY\" IS NONSENSE- YOU EITHER PUSH THE FAT MAN OR YOU DONT- NEITHER DECISION IS RIGHT NOR WRONG, IT IS SOLEY A DECISION. SEEK WISDOM MY FRIENDS. CLEANSE YOUR POOR JUDGMENTAL MINDS. TAKE THIS COURSE, BUT DO NOT BLINDLY AGREE TO WHAT THE PHILOSOPHERS, OR YOUR FRIENDS, OR WHAT I SAY. YOU MAY NOT SLEEP AT NIGHT FOR A WHILE ESPECIALLY AS YOU TAKE THIS CLASS OVER THE SEMESTER, BUT ONCE YOU REACH THIS CONCLUSION YOU WILL FIND PEACE. I THINK. ",
            "\u00a0It depends. If you don't need to take this course, don't do it because you're \"generally interested\" in ethics. It's an interesting course, but the grading is too difficult for it to be taken casually. \r\n\r\nYour experience/ enjoyment of the course will vary a lot depending on your section (how it's facilitated, the TF, the classmates within etc.). I personally found most of my section discussions rather pretentious (and not necessarily an enjoyable pretense). I often left feeling as if people talked a lot, but nothing truly meaningful was said. "
