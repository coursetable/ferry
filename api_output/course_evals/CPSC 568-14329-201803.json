Improved my skill at reasoning through and constructing standard theoretical computer scientific arguments, primarily algorithmic complexity, reductions, and probabilistic proofs. Greatly enhanced my intuition and understanding for the nature of computation, and greatly enhanced my ability to find and write proofs and arguments originating in that understanding. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: Great lectures, very interesting content. Assignments were instructive both to developing intuition and solidifying understanding of facts. Also struck a good balance between challenging yet practically doable, though I would've preferred what I understand to be the slightly longer assignments usually given when the students in the course fit a more transitional theory mold. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Weird to have a textbook which is acknowledged by the professor (and apparently the authors) to be (charitably) vague to a fault or (uncharitably) simply wrong. Some of the extended proofs (gap theorem, Toda's theorem, the TQBF -> IP reduction) covered in lectures got bogged down in technical details and notation difficult to grasp orally, although they were approachable through the text and lecture notes.

However, the course was instructive towards the foundation of and techniques generally used in theoretical computer science, and so still imparts substantial value. Ultimately it is very interesting and engaging material excellently taught, which is always worthwhile. "
