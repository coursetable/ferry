This not only impoverishes the kind of feedback given (since it all comes from the same one or two people), but it also risks making the presenter feel that their work is undervalued or undersupported by their peers. This seems especially one-sided given the fact that we all present something at one point in the semester or another: it's clear that some students are far more willing to take support/feedback than they are to give it.

It's a rare opportunity in our field to have an entire room of people read through your work very carefully and to challenge the way you're thinking about things in a productive way. "
