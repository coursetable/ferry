            "\u00a0I thought the midterm \"exam\" paper is a real strength of the course. I think more professors should use this model. I enjoyed how we are all given the same \"archive\" and asked to write a paper. I think this focuses students' attention on critical analysis. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I thought that discussions sometimes got off track. It was hard to follow people's thinking at times. This is not so much a weakness of the course, but simply an observation. I'm not sure if there's a way to have student's do some intellectual work before class-time so they can refine their thinking a bit. One model I've found useful is having student's write \"thesis sentences\" for each of the readings prior to class. This helps the students distill what the main thesis of each reading was. This adds to the workload, so maybe cutting a couple readings/chapters from each week would be necessary. I think this would help students focus in on some readings each week and really understand them. This deeper understanding would lead to better discussions. Just some ideas/hypotheses... "

Also, Doug Rogers is a really encouraging and helpful professor. In terms of readings, some weeks are better than others, but overall it's an engaging course. "
