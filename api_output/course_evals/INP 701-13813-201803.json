            "\u00a0I really liked the format of the course and clearly it has been mostly unchanged for a reason because it seems very successful to me. \r\n\r\nThe one suggestion I would have is to maybe stress a bit higher expectations in discussion early on, but I know it has to be balanced with encouraging everyone to contribute.

            "\u00a0I learned a great deal in this class, particularly at the end going through essay revisions. The class was definitely worth it, but it is not easy and takes a great deal of time. Students should be aware of the effort and time they will need to put into it, but I do think it's helpful and provides a good overview of the field, getting to see work from various faculty members, and practice in writing.
