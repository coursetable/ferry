            "\u00a0Definitely started thinking about the concept of civil war in a more metaphysical way than I have in the past! I have also been able to brush up on my Latin again given it's been some time since I have translated. I also gained more knowledge about the history of the period! ",
            "\u00a0I learned about Roman Civil Wars in a variety of literature forms. I learned how to deeply analyze and draw conclusions from Latin texts. This class pushed me to make intertextual connections and back up all my claims with evidence in essays. ",
            "\u00a0I feel like I gained a deep insight into Roman civil wars through an examination of many authors and texts. ",
            "\u00a0The course offered opportunities for improvement in Latin translation and literary criticism. ",
            "\u00a0This course made the argument that civil conflict is central to the Roman identity, and we read several texts from a few centuries of Roman history in order to examine the ways in which that conflict gets played out in Roman historiography. I hadn't thought about that idea at all, but after this course I find myself seeing traces of it everywhere I look (in Roman history and lit, mostly, but similar threads in post-Civil War American stuff). Glad to have been exposed to the texts we read. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I think that the class was well-structured! We were given a rigorous (but not unreasonable) amount of homework, and we would always go through the tricky parts in class together. I do think that I would have liked some more handouts on the history or even 10 minutes more of discussion of it in class; I felt that sometimes I couldn't catch all the literary references because of that.\r\n\r\nThis class did have more assignments than most other classes do. We have a midterm, 4 quizzes, a short paper, a long paper, and a final. One of my friends who is a senior classics major ended up not taking the class because most other Latin courses have maybe 3/5 of those assessments. While this obviously did provide me a lot of opportunities to improve, I did feel that the assessments became harder to keep up with at the end. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Peirano, who is brilliant and kind, was a strength of this course as well as the small class size. In the future, however, it may improve the class to conduct it in a roundtable format, as opposed to lecture. ",
            "\u00a0The course was an excellent survey of Roman literature on civil wars. We could potentially have read less Lucan but it was important that we examine him heavily. I would have enjoyed more discussion of secondary literature. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Peirano Garrison ensured that course assignments were long enough as to offer opportunities to practice Latin translation and short enough to cover in class. The format of the class allowed for student improvement and learning. ",
            "\u00a0It's a really good Latin literature course. I can't think of any improvements. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Take this course! Professor Peirano Garrison is fantastic, and she makes herself readily available. The course does make you grapple with hard Latin as you will be spending a majority of the course in Lucan. You will have to be prepared for quite a few assessments if the syllabus is still the same, but you will receive clear feedback on how to improve. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, especially a Classics major, who wishes to read several authors and is interested in wars and the epic form (Lucan) after Virgil. ",
            "\u00a0This course was outstanding. Professor Peirano was super knowledgeable on all the material and a great instructor: kind but fair. We read a large variety of authors (with a heavy focus on Lucan) and wrote two essays, so it was a balanced course. The Lucan texts were some of the most difficult Latin out there, however, so make sure you're up to scratch. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Very much so. Good for anyone interested in the late Republican/early Imperial period of Roman history; good for anyone interested in Roman literature and historiography; exciting, complex readings; a great teacher. "
