            "\u00a0Learned a new way of thinking about the world -- looking for hidden systems and how to hack them. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to look at the world around me -- particularly at aspects of the world that I previously saw as mundane, neutral, or purely functional -- with a much more critical, analytical lens ",
            "\u00a0How to think critically about global networks and think more apatially ",
            "\u00a0I thoroughly enjoyed the course and gained so much perspective on the architectural elements of global infrastructure through Professor Easterling's enlightening lectures and Caroline's section discussions. This was such an incredible opportunity to see into the mind of Easterling and those of other architects, and it also provided me an opportunity to research and write a final paper on blockchain technology's influence and impact on industrial spaces and international development throughout the world. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided knowledge regarding the developments and networks that help construct our globalized world. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about the crazy extrastatecraft that structures our world. So interesting! ",
            "\u00a0More than anything, globalization space offered students a new way of thinking critically about the phenomenon of globalization and how its impacts manifest spatially. ",
            "\u00a0This class offered a unique view on globalization rooted in the analysis of spatial products as tools of influence. While looking back it is hard to pin down specific skills learned, the purpose of the class is not to equip its students with ways of finding the right answers to problems. It is about broadening perspectives, engaging with people from different academic backgrounds, and learning to emphasize familiarity with macro-level dynamics of globalization rather than subscribing to the often perilous belief that the world is comprised of many problems with straightforward answers. I will definitely look at technology in different ways and I think this class definitely helped me refine my perspective of the world as a Global Affairs major. ",
            "\u00a0What Prof. Easterling calls \"medium design\" and \"split-screen thinking\": seeing relationships between networks, stories, and people in the world. Great introduction to design and architecture concepts for students of other disciplines and development of innovative analysis and critical problem-solving ",
            "\u00a0I really feel like I picked up a new and important tool for analyzing systems through this class. Applying this lens to a research project I'd been working on for a year already really did give me a fresh perspective and two new major insights into the work that is ostensibly an engineering project. I took this course to fulfill a distributional requirement, but part of the reason that I want to go to a school that HAD distributional requirements was that I knew it would force me take classes that I would enjoy and learn a lot from but might not otherwise take. I thought that this would give me a different perspective than other engineers and allow me to see problems from multiple angles and as a result, to be more creative. I was NOT disappointed with Globalization Space in this regard. One of the ideas that I thought of while writing my final paper got me so excited that I have spent the first two weeks of break building spreadsheets to flesh it out and see whether I can somehow apply for funding to run with it for a little while. Its crazy that something that seems so theoretical and philosophical has turned out to be so practical but that's what I love about all this anyway. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a variety of theoretical approaches to globalization issues. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to trace various technologies, patterns and phenomenas and relate them to the greater connected idea of globalization. I also learned the vocabulary of the field, and learned valuable examples of globalization. ",
            "\u00a0Interdisciplinary course that helped me understand the spatial networks and agents that shape globalizing forces. This course helped me to think about urban issues from a critical and problem-solving mindset ",

            "\u00a0This course teaches you a mindset, and if that's the way you think about it, you'll love it. If you try to memorize everything, you'll go crazy, but if you just try to absorb the ways of thinking that the material showcases, it'll be way better. ",
            "\u00a0Loved the structure of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths -- fascinating lectures, nice section discussions, complex readings\r\n\r\nWeaknesses -- readings were sometimes a little inaccessible, content was so diffuse that it was sometimes hard to get a sense of what the course was really about ",
            "\u00a0This course was interesting and very presumptive, without a terribly large amount of concrete evidence covering the issues we focused on. I loved how Easterling was able to tie completely independent concepts together with ease and steer us through the syllabus with passion. A weakness of the course has to be a lack of readings that introduce the technical jargon and thought processes of architects for students in the class who have no exposure to said field of study. ",
            "\u00a0The readings were a bit arcane sometimes, but the lectures were very interesting. I loved the final paper, really great format. ",
            "\u00a0The Pecha Kuchas and final papers were wonderful ways of tailoring the course material to address a specific field of interest, and I think that if there were a way to improve the course it would be to provide more opportunities for student-to-student engagement. This is a vague suggestion, and I believe the course does this well in the first place, but any way to lean harder into this strength would be a plus! ",
            "\u00a0Well-designed course with very interesting lectures and development of new analytical skills ",
            "\u00a0I'd say the major strengths of this course were the two instructors, Professor Easterling and Caroline. Both were super helpful, patient, and encouraging. One major challenge for me was all the vocabulary and the sort of philosophical approach that is just different thinking than I'm used to. I appreciated Professor Easterling being so welcoming to students from other disciplines, but I did feel like I was a bit behind at first. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are interesting; however, they remain theoretical, even where they could include real-world application. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting content and ideas but could be more structured to allow better student engagement ",
            "\u00a0the course is at times confusing and vague and the lectures as well as the readings can be hard to follow. I loved the course material but wished it was more accessible and the ideas we were talking about seems unreachable because of how confusing and broad they were. I loved the final project and the pecha kucha and also got a lot out of the readings, which were challenging but rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were well-structured, and I learned a lot from the readings and section discussions. Because the concepts were fairly abstract it was difficult to understand how to apply the material, and I felt that the vocabulary and topics of discussion were hard to adopt if you weren't already familiar with the material. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were all incredibly interesting and the flexibility with the final paper was much appreciated. At times, I wish the lectures were a bit more connected to see common themes. "
        ],

            "\u00a0Yes -- each lecture is like a mini-TED talk, and this course really teaches you a new way to think about the world. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting course that brings together many different topics with flexibility to explore your interests or things you've never before become interested in. For example, the intersection of design and global development logos. ",
            "\u00a0Yes -- if you're open to an unorthodox, vaguely defined, but very interesting course and you're ready to challenge yourself with a complex and diverse set of readings, then this would be an excellent class for you! ",
            "\u00a0This is such a fun course! There were its pros and cons, but overall, I highly recommend it. \r\n\r\nProfessor Easterling is so cool and so amazing. She's extremely knowledgable about a large number of things and is able to easily tie them together. However, I did feel that the times I was able to follow along best was when I had done the readings before the lectures for that week - otherwise, I would miss some nuances that I picked up later when I did the readings later on in that week. \r\n\r\nI do feel like the language in this course might be a little hard to follow, and there was a fair bit of work to be read by philosophers, which can be quite difficult to read if you don't have a background in that. That being said, however, the TAs make themselves very available to you and are genuinely passionate about the subject and want to see you understand everything and fit all the pieces together. There are reading responses every week, but what really helped me understand the course was the final paper, where you can write about anything as long as it relates to the theory of the course, and you really have to work to pull it all together then. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it challenges you to think in new ways ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student simply because of its interesting application of seemingly uncorrelated topics into a framework for explaining the networked world. I enjoyed Easterling's lectures, although she was occasionally hard to follow and used unnecessarily complicated vocabulary. The workload was manageable and did not detract from the learning within the course. ",
            "\u00a0Take this if you want an interesting and low-stakes fifth class! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! One of the great successes of the course was its eagerness to bring the skills and insights of students from various schools and disciplines to bear. ",
            "\u00a0While I am not entirely sure if I bought into the overall thesis of the class, it provided a welcome shift in perspective and it truly does help one view the spatial products that surround us in a new way. If you want to be fascinated by the seemingly mundane, I would recommend this class. Easterling is a passionate, colorful instructor and, while her lectures can sometimes seem vague or sweeping, the readings are interesting and sections seem to represent a truly diverse range of perspectives on the topic, even though Easterling's background is in architecture, and indeed many of the undergraduate students come from an architecture background as well. I would say to shop this class for a bit to see if you can get a feel for Easterling's lecture style. While I liked her approach and her vibe, I understand that it is not necessarily everyone's cup of tea. Caroline is a WONDERFUL TA. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Definitely take this course just to hear Prof. Easterling lecture; her lectures are fast-paced, blink-and-you'll-miss-it stories of the world, incorporating history, current events, and cultural analyses. It's listed as an architecture course, but it is truly interdisciplinary and feels at times history, political science, global affairs, sociology, etc. ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend this course to people from other disciplines, not just architecture. I'm from an engineering background and this gave me some really cool new insights into my own engineering research that I haven't been able to stop thinking about since classes ended. I really underrated the class at first, I was just taking it to fulfill and Hu requirement, but I'm so glad I did. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone.The lectures and readings are very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to anyone seeking a light workload and interesting material. However, the structure of the course is odd, with few assignments. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. It is very interesting material, and is very different from what I've learned in almost any other course. The final project is very open ended and is enjoyable if you pick a topic you are interested in ",
            "\u00a0It is a good course to take if you are interested in abstract interdisciplinary approaches to globalization/urbanization, but if you like specifics and concrete problem-solving, this is not the class for you. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student from any discipline. The applications of all the course's insights were particularly meaningful, and I think everyone would appreciate the class environment and Professor Easterling's teaching style. ",
            "\u00a0I wouldn't recommend this course to another student, unless you're comfortable with ambiguous and abstract concepts that don't really feel grounded in fact. I didn't feel like the lectures added up to any real argument or narrative as a whole, and the way we were supposed to talk about the material felt more like a collection of buzzwords than anything else. Readings were mostly very dry and occasionally interesting. Professor Easterling and the TF (Caroline) were both really passionate, helpful, and supportive, which saved the course a bit. I'm not sure if it was just my personal dislike of the material, but I was pretty disappointed in argument/content of the course. "
