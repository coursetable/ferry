            "\u00a0I learned how to conjugate verbs in present, past, and future tense (formal and informal) as well as a lot of vocabulary. We learned how to introduce ourselves, ask for directions, inquire about various things, make simple sentences. Before this course I really couldn't form a single sentence in Korean: I could respond to questions asked in Korean via one-word answers, but after this course I am able to respond to questions asked in Korean pertaining to time, money, direction, location, and age. ",
            "\u00a0We started with the alphabet then moved onto vocab then grammar. We learned informal polite past, present, and future tense and formal past, present and future. Starting a couple weeks into the semester I think we had vocab quizzes basically every day, so we learned a good amount of vocab in small doses but over a short period of time. We started with basic conversations (hi, how are you, what year in college are you, where are you from) and ended with giving directions and locations of things, and using transportation to talk about daily routines. We learned particles, weekend and vacation plans, making appointments, things you can or can't do, how to talk about things you want to do, etc. We also learned numbers in various contexts (how to count things, how much things cost, etc.). ",
            "\u00a0basic Korean grammar, some culture ",
            "\u00a0Learned the Korean alphabet, many verb tenses and different levels of politeness. We also covered a lot of vocabulary in the class and sentence structures. ",
            "\u00a0I built a very solid foundation for Korean, both written and oral Korean. I also learnt more about Korean culture. ",
            "\u00a0Basic Korean, enough to form sentences in past, present, future and express simple cause and effect. ",
            "\u00a0A basic understanding of Korean, including mastery over the alphabet, simple grammar, and rudimentary sentence structure. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a very holistic understanding of both Korean language and culture. I was honestly very surprised by just how much I learned at the end of this L1 Korean course - I felt as if I have already gained enough knowledge to maneuver in Korea without a translator. I am definitely far from fluent, but I was very impressed by just how much this course taught me. "

            "\u00a0I wish this course taught vocabulary in more organized chunks. Sometimes it seemed like we were learning completely random words without direction or aim. I seemed as if the course was structured around learning various tenses but I couldn't really be sure. I wish this course had more organization or that students were shown the organization of the course at the beginning: i.e. spending 2 weeks on introductions, 2 weeks on present tense, 2 weeks on future tense, etc. Sometimes the beginning-of-class PPT presentations were way too fast... \r\n\r\nOn a positive note, this course does a great job at getting students to practice speaking Korean. The in-class partner conversations were very useful and the end-of-chapter oral presentations did a good job at this. Professor Park also does a great job providing feedback on written assignments. She's really quick with grading and this was very useful because you got feedback right away. She also roams around class listening to us converse in Korean and, while this makes me kind of nervous, she is very nice about interjecting and correcting, but in a super kind way. This course also provided many low-stakes opportunities to practice spoken and written Korean without fear of penalty towards one's grades. That was nice. ",
            "\u00a0The environment was really encouraging and conducive to learning. We started off really basic to make sure everyone had a solid foundation but also ended up moving pretty quickly, so I feel like I learned a lot. I loved that this class met every day. I feel like I got to know my professor and other classmates well. I really liked the conversation exercises where we talked to other classmates about their likes/dislikes, daily routines, or whatever unit we were talking about. I also loved the cultural presentations - they were so interesting to listen to and really fun to research. One weakness is that I wish there were a heritage option for L1. I'm really excited to take heritage Korean and wish there were an option before L3. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very engaging class discussions\r\nNo weaknesses ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that you learn a great deal of Korean in one semester and the class is structured to build upon previous things. One weakness is that each class is very short, but that is not specific to this course ",
            "\u00a0The course moves extremely quickly, with homework and vocab quizzes every day. It really leads to immediately noticeable improvement across every week and my language level at the end of the class surpassed what I believe I could do across 3 months.\r\n\r\nSometimes the work can be a little lumpy, in that it is not evenly spread across the days allotted. One day may have one simple worksheet to fill out, but the next day will have a large workbook assignment due in addition to two more worksheets that were given that day. It would be helpful if some of the assignments were given earlier/more evenly spaced, but the workload was not too high overall. ",
            "\u00a0I was honestly very satisfied with how this course was taught in every aspect. The daily vocab quizzes really forced me to allocate at least a bit of time daily towards language study. The exams were also very well written and tested for student understanding very thoroughly. I don't think the course has any outstanding weaknesses. "

            "\u00a0Yes! KREN 110 is a great L1 course. Perfect for people with little to no exposure to Korean. Please do not take this course if you are a native Korean speaker who speaks Korean to their parents; this will be way too easy for you. This course is more suited towards Koreans whose parents speak Korean, but you respond to them in English. There were a couple of native speakers who definitely should have started in L2.  Please don't be those people. You are wasting your time. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Professor Park is incredible - she is one of the nicest professors and people I have met at Yale and such an encouraging person overall. She creates such a great classroom environment and was wonderful to get to know this semester. She really cares about her students and puts so much effort into making sure we are doing well in the course. When we presented our dialogues or cultural presentations she showed so much interest, made helpful comments, was so engaged with our work. She would make sure to critique our grammar or pronunciation but never in a rude or harsh way. I really have no complaints about the course. I was genuinely sad when it was over and feel like I learned a lot. A comment about L1 languages in general: there's something about being in an environment where everyone knows basically nothing and starts from scratch that's really special. Learning an L1 language allows you to learn something new and be in an environment where making mistakes is okay, and that's something so rare here where people are (or pretend to be) so accomplished at everything. I'm Korean American and never learned the language in an organized setting, so that was also really great personally for me to do. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, very helpful for learning the language and culture ",
            "\u00a0I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS COURSE, especially with Professor Park! She is an amazing professor and is very willing to help, especially if she sees that you put in effort. She is super nice and amazing at teaching. Honestly it was one of the only classes I have ever looked forward to. ",
            "\u00a0For sure! I will recommend this course to anyone who is interested in Korean culture or Korean language. I think the 50-min per day class schedule suits the purpose of language learning. The workload of the course is also perfect to build the foundation without too stressing out. ",
            "\u00a0Of course! It's a fun class and you learn korean as long as you put in some dedication. ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend the course to any student looking to learn Korean. It is interactive and fast-paced, leading to rapid improvement over the semester. Meeting every day is something that can deter people, but you really see the benefits via the repetition and drills by doing it Monday through Friday. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to any students interested in learning Korean. The professors are super engaging and the classroom setup is very inviting to non-fluent speakers. "
