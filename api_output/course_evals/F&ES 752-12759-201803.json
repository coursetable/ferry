I'm glad I took this course my first semester at F&ES because I think it serves as a jumping-off point for more specific areas of study. I appreciated that Liza always made sure to present the most up-to-date research on the topics at hand and I feel like I came away with a good general understanding of the world of tropical forest research.

The papers we read were fascinating and did offer a deeper ecological dive. I would have liked assignments or quizzes more focused on integrating all of that information throughout the semester.

I also appreciated that we could pick whatever topic we wanted for our final project, as long as it related to tropic forests.\r\nI think it would have been better if the professor had posted the slides at least a few days before the lecture, so that students could print out the slides if they wanted to in order to take notes on them.

            "\u00a0The lectures were really informative and I really love the inclusion of recent research to back up what the topic of the day was.  It was cool to see so many different ways that experiments and analysis are done.  The discussions were nice but the ones where we had more structured points to focus on were more productive. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: relevant recent scientific papers and reasonable workload most of the time. Interesting topics. Weakness: workload at the end was more than called for (presentation + project + exam). Occassionally too simplistic / too slow of a pace in lectures for concepts covered in general ecology. Textbook was almost useless. Would have loved to discuss articles more in terms of critiquing their methods and results instead of assuming they are correct all the time. ",

It was a well-structured course with regular reading questions that ensure everyone has a knowledge of the readings and can participate in discussions. Liza often brings in speakers with experience in particular fields which I found informative and enjoyable. \r\n\r\nThe weaknesses of this course may be that the level of difficulty of the material is a bit low for students with a background in ecology. ",

Having Liza as an instructor is definitely a huge strength for her area of focus and all of her background knowledge. It was a please to have her as an instructor but I feel like I spent the semester enjoying this course rather than taking my own competency to a higher level. I am more aware of many topics but would have like more specialization. The final projects offered that opportunity, I would have liked to have done that with multiple topics throughout the semester but am not sure what I would have cut out to make time for that. ",

            "\u00a0Take this course - the professor's approach is no-nonsense, wants her students to learn and expects quality discussion but assigns very reasonable work and is willing to accommodate your interests. Guest lectures are fun and unlike other classes where end-of-term presentations by students seem like a waste of time, it is genuinely enjoyable to learn about other peoples' interests and reasons for taking this class because of the way the assignment is formatted.
