            "\u00a0This class is focused as much on the material as well as general scholarship. Meaning how one should approach the articles we read, study the sources used, and look for bias in the author. As such, it is very much a class about writing in academia as it is about the Ottoman Empire in the Great War. As such, we study how others have studied the empire and common narrative tropes like the decline and such. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a great amount of unique and nuanced insight into the lives of people living during this historical period in the Middle East. I had never taken a class on this historical period before so it was very beneficial for me. Professor Simsek gave us a lot of information on very interesting and unique aspects during this historical period. "

            "\u00a0I think one improvement would be some type of response to respond to before the class or selecting a student or two to introduce a certain reading. Doing so will put everyone on the same page on knowing what readings to especially focus on or what themes to really dig into during discussions I think and help lead to delving deeper into certain topics. ",
            "\u00a0I really do not think this course could be improved. Professor Simsek did a great job leading the discussions during class and he made sure all the students were very engaged throughout the class. "

            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course to another student for the following reasons: 1) The material is very interesting and not commonly studied 2) Professor Simsek is a great professor and provides great information on how to become a better historian, writer, and researcher ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course if you're interested in military history/the Ottoman Empire! It's an excellent history seminar and goes into the last days of the Empire in great detail while taking care to explore the different cultures and populations within and around the Empire (Kurds, Greeks, etc.).
