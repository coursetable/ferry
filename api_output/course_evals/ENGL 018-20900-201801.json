            "\u00a0I came into this course thinking English and writing were my weakest academic areas. Professor Gordon helped me improve upon my weaknesses and feel more confident in my strengths. I have become both a more insightful reader and writer. I have grown academically more through this class than any other class I have ever taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0This course really improved my close reading skills and in deriving multiple interpretations from a passage or work. Many of the insights I took away from the course surrounded new interpretations and connections from works and their sequels that we read in class. I feel that I've really gained a strong ability to compare themes, tropes, characters, etc. across a variety of works and subject areas. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a much deeper understanding and appreciation for authors who write sequels of works. I used to look down on sequels (what movie has a better sequel than the original? exactly), but in this class you get to read some fabulous literary works and sequels to them. It's fun to compare the works, and Professor Gordon has such a profound understanding of English Lit that you could never go wrong taking a class with him. ",
            "\u00a0We read texts in this course that are extremely important, acclaimed works, but I would not have fully understood or appreciated them if not for the insight of Professor Gordon. ",
            "\u00a0My ability to write concisely and succinctly has improved significantly through Professor Gordon's helpful feedback. I've also become much better at making connections between seemingly different works. ",
            "\u00a0My writing and critical thinking skills really improved. I became more comfortable sharing my opinion in a group of students. ",
            "\u00a0This course was unbelievable. Professor Gordon helped us develop critical thinking skills in an innovative way: by having us combine analyses from multiple works. His edits and genuine love for his students helped me develop not only these thinking skills, but stronger writing skills as well. Moreover, his choice of course material and manner of conducting the class had a significant effect on my discussion skills, learning to understand and appreciate multiple interpretations of work. ",
            "\u00a0Analyzing literature ad writing about it--this class also focused on originals and revisions which was interesting because it meant that a lot of our in class discussions/paper were comparative rather than focusing solely on one piece of literature. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Gordon's instruction was absolutely incredible. In this course, I learned how to write an important piece of cross-analysis that was not only insightful, well developed, but creative as well. From our small discussions, I was able to hone in on my communication skills, and at the end of the course I participated in a debate that helped me to understand the fundamentals of argument building. Through the various guests and outside events that Professor Gordon organized, I was able to expand my concept of the books we were reading. ",
            "\u00a0Literary analysis, comparative writing, close reading ",
            "\u00a0I improved my writing. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided me with a new perspective when analyzing and comparing literature, considering sequels, revisions, and reverberations. "

            "\u00a0GREAT professor! Joe Gordon is AMAZING!!! The content is phenomenal and class each day is insightful. Nothing needs to change...this course is amazing and I would recommend it to everyone. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course lie in its excellent reading list and ability of the professor to balance guiding a discussion, providing his insights, and allowing students to express their insights and opinions as well.The way the class functioned on a day-to-day basis was very much conducive to student learning and allowed me to get the most out of the course that I could.  I think a weakness of the course lies in the fact that writing assignments were dealt with nearly entirely outside of the classroom, without much general guidance from he instructor. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Great class discussions, very knowledgable professor, food during class\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the reading is a bit too much. I liked the structure we had for some assignments where there were additional optional readings if people had extra time. ",
            "\u00a0The plays and novels we read in this class were so interesting, and Professor Gordon's insights elevated the level of engagement and discourse. One weakness is that at times, discussion was difficult, but the entire class brought spirit and energy to an already strong selection of works. ",
            "\u00a0The professor and reading list were definite strengths! The discussions were always super interesting. Professor Gordon also brought food for us which was a definite mood booster. ",
            "\u00a0Can only think of strengths to be honest, with Professor Gordon being the largest one. In terms of course material, I felt that the structure of the course was extremely beneficial for the students, with gradually increasing gaps between the works we examined. This allowed us to build skills over time while still constantly challenging us. ",
            "\u00a0Professor is incredible, reading list is really interesting and the addition of performances was amazing. ",
            "\u00a0I think a major strength was the curriculum--the book pairings are all really interesting but also provide a pretty big range of different types of literature. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Gordon was very good at leading a conversation, and in class there was never a dull moment. The resources that he offered, from extra help to additional readings were incredible helpful and were useful in leveling the playing field for students who were coming from different backgrounds and educational experiences. One thing that I think could improve would be now outside events were set up to be mandatory, yet outside of the regular class hours. ",
            "\u00a0The course was wonderful, I only wish we'd had more time to talk about all of the readings. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Gordon is a fantastic teacher, and I liked the books we read a lot. "

            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY. You will not be enriched more by any other English course and professor. ",
            "\u00a0I would without a doubt recommend this Cours to another student, as I believe the teaching is nearly unmatched compared to any other course I've taken at Yale thus far. I think this course causes one to view literature and his/her interoperation's of it in an entirely different and more complicated light. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It gives them the chance to read through older texts more in depth as a class. Going into this class, I was nervous about the course as far as content is concerned. However, I am very glad I went through with it. Great class, would highly recommend. ",
            "\u00a0Without a doubt. You'll improve your writing a lot, but the workload is also very reasonable. This class was also inspirational for me: we met the Q brothers and Michael Cunningham, so that really added to the course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any freshman interested in literature. It's not too difficult but earns a writing credit, and we gain superb insight into seminal texts. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. We read a wonderful selection and I really enjoyed our classroom discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! The class was so fun to attend twice a week. Professor Gordon is amazing and he only teaches this class so definitely take the opportunity to have him as your professor. ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely. Professor Gordon is an unbelievable professor and will help you develop as a student in amazing ways. He is also extremely kind and fun as a professor, always engaging his students and gaining a special place in all of our hearts. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! On the professor alone this is my favorite class Ive taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah! It was a cool course and I enjoyed it. It is also just nice to be in a seminar. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to every first year, if not to read the amazing selection of books, to have the opportunity to learn under Joe Gordon, who is a invaluable member of the Yale community. He is an incredible resource to undergrads and puts in the effort to show his concern and dedication to each and every one of his students. ",
            "\u00a0Yes.  The class was a very interesting topic with a fantastic professor and a great reading list. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the reading list and the professor are great. Also, the essays felt warranted, and there wasn't any pointless busy work. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. "
