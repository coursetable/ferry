            "\u00a0I learned the ways in which statistics applies to American political behavior research. I also learned in the general the empirical aspect of political science. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a more technical knowledge of the theories that political scientists have developed regarding how American citizens vote, and how their preferences are affected by external and internal events, such as news coverage, political ads, and performance analyses. ",
            "\u00a0How elites \"campaigns, politicians\" and voters make their voting decisions. Lots of discussion of utility. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to evaluate research papers more critically--in particular by looking at the qualitative and quantitative methods employed by political scientists and determining their strengths and weaknesses. ",

        [
            "\u00a0The class does a great job of making sure students understand the math behind research articles. It is a good class to build a strong foundation in American political behavior. ",
            "\u00a0The course provides a broad overview of a number of fields of study within Political Science. Many readings are quite technical, and the course could be made easier for undergraduates by setting aside time to do objective analyses of the pieces before critiquing the arguments in them. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes the readings were bad, and the discussion focused on why the readings were bad. But once you realize that the readings are just a prompt for discussion and not something to emulate, you're fine. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Henderson is a good discussion leader and a very knowledgeable and dedicated professor. I enjoyed some of the explanations he gave about the denser sections of the papers we read. Other strengths included the comments of students who actually did the readings--these comments were usually very insightful and spurred better conversation. The main weakness of this class is that it became clear that some students were not doing the readings, which spurred many others not to do them as the semester wore on. This may be partly because some of the readings got very technical. (I had a pretty tough time understanding some of them.) A potential remedy for this issue may be for Professor Henderson to preface the next weeks readings--either by email or in class--in order to make them easier to contextualize and consume. He could also include a few questions for students to keep in mind as they read the papers, so that they can be aware of the key points they should be looking for. While it might seem that a \"preface\" might give away \"the answers,\" in the classes I've taken where this has happened I've found the opposite effect--because all the factual points of the article analysis (e.g. what's the main point, what do the authors argue, what methods do they use, what do they conclude, etc.) are already given, students have to push beyond those points in order to have anything to offer in terms of discussion. This usually makes for a better seminar, and despite the extra work students have to put into actually doing the readings, having context makes it easier for students to start and finish the articles.

            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to any student who is interested in American political behavior, especially in learning about the literature in this field. ",
            "\u00a0For students interested in the more technical aspects of Political Science, this is a great course that provides strong background and useful conversations. Because it is cross-listed as a graduate school class, there are always helpful grad students who can help analyze readings and make them more understandable. The readings can take a little while to get a full handle on, but comprise much of what we know about Political Science today. ",
            "\u00a0Lots of reading. You get what you put into it. If you really try hard to figure the stuff out, you'll be mentally exhausted by the end of the seminar, but you'll learn a lot. Otherwise, you can skim by doing minimal work, but then you'll be wasting the seminar. ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested in learning how to better critique the methods and conclusions of researchers (a valuable skill for any student, but especially upper-level students in the major), then this is a good class for that. The professor is a really nice, chill guy who is very knowledgeable of the finer points of political science research and design. He's also great to talk to during office hours--he very willing to answer your questions and help you work your way through the material, and also cares a lot about his students as individuals. ",
