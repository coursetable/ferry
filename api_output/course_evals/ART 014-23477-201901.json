            "\u00a0Learned a lot about Yale's collections, different artists, and my own artistic approach ",
            "\u00a0I was exposed to how to conduct research on artistic processes and the historical contexts which culminated in such artistic works. ",
            "\u00a0the class helped to build my confidence in discussing art, i learned how to share my thoughts coherently. structure of the class was supportive, helped to learn how to think about art and discuss with others. i will take this with me for the rest of my life! ",
            "\u00a0I gained the ability to think creatively and question everything I hear, never accepting a statement for absolute fact. ",
            "\u00a0This course was invaluable to me. I would not describe myself as traditionally artistic, and indeed lack classical training in virtually every medium (drawing, painting, even handwriting). For the techniques I do know (poetry, photos, digital art, a bit of music), I am self-taught. This course encouraged me to realize that this doesn't matter. Through talks with various artists and exposures to various forms of art ranging from modern photography to seventeenth century treatises on color (my personal favorite course), I was exposed to a great deal of art culminating in a final presentation utilizing various techniques I had developed in the class. Overall, I learned that there is no single artist--anything, from a simple sketch to a complex interactive project utilizing sculpture and audience interaction, can be considered art if evaluated through the correct lens. And in this class, both are equally valid forms of expression. ",
            "\u00a0It's a very unconventional class; every week we got to view the collections of one of Yale's institutions (the Art Gallery, Peabody, Beinecke, Haas Arts Library, Babylonian Collection, etc) and reflect on how the objects applied to an aspect of art history and how we can apply them in our own work. Every class we also got to Skype with contemporary artists (some of which were quite important), which was a fantastic way to learn about how research can be utilized to create art. Karin Schneider is wonderful; it is a great class for learning about what resources are available at Yale for students to use! "

            "\u00a0We talked on skype with a different artist every week, so you get a lot of exposure to different networks of ppl ",
            "\u00a0The course was a bit disorganized, but it was its first time being offered. I would say that with a few more semesters under its belt, this course would be a must-take first-year seminar for students looking to flex their creative muscles and explore all of the academic/artistic/historical resources that Yale has to offer. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: each class structure was so different. no two classes were similar, which made attending classes fun, exciting, unpredictable\r\nweaknesses: some parts of class felt a bit rushed in order to get through all the material. would have loved more time to be able to allow for more thoughtfulness and time for engagement with some of the material ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that the course was so entirely creative, I had to dig deep to think of something rather simple. ",
            "\u00a0At first glance, I thought this course to have a glaring weakness: the lack of structure and rules. Professor Schneider encouraged us at our first session to respond to the work of art presented to us in any way possible, even \"hitting a wall ten times\" if that was what the piece made us feel. I at first felt like I would be judged for this, and that she preferred some forms of art to others, but after completion of this class I can see that the lack of structure is its greatest benefit. You can express yourself in literally any way possible. Whatever your talent (or lack thereof), you will be evaluated based on your ability to create thought-provoking art, and literally nothing else. By combining research and the artistic medium, this course is perfect for individuals who may never take an art class again: you may find it easier to focus on the research and historical aspects of art and respond to that, and that is valid as well. Overall, the strength comes in the encouragement provided by Professor Schneider: she will find your work impressive regardless of talent and you will feel welcome. The only weakness comes from the fact that we go to a different location every week: while I would not change this (and the breadth of materials presented is one of the best parts of this class), there may be one or two lectures that you do not click with. Furthermore, it is at times difficult for Professor Schneider to connect to Skype in order to talk with the artists in the course due to having to set up a new projector every class. However, it is still incredibly engaging to be presented with a new collection (and a conversation with new artist) every week and I am easily willing to sit out some technical hiccups to make it happen. Also, it was a bit weird knowing literally none of my grade before my final presentation (and checking in with students about their progress may help) but everything turned out fine. "

            "\u00a0yep ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only if you're ok with a bit of unstructured learning and navigating some ambiguity with assignments and overall course information. ",
            "\u00a0highly recommend. i really loved this class. you can come into this class with no background in art - you get the most out of this class this way! you learn to trust your gut and your instincts. class was tremendously inspiring ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student wishing to pursue a career in the arts or sciences. I provides a strong foundation for any career related to thinking and creating. ",
            "\u00a0I strongly believe this is one of the best first-year seminars you can take. It works great as a 5th credit and will round out your coursework dramatically, especially if you do not typically study the arts. You will receive a large amount of knowledge, artistic theory, and most importantly confidence--if you do not already, you will believe yourself to be an artist by the end. Professor Schneider is wonderful, the materials presented to you are rare and impressive (including an original book by Newton and ancient Babylonian amulets) and you will enjoy this course. You will receive individual feedback, unique conversations with contemporary artists, and a wide array of material to build your final project from. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, take it, even if you are not an art person. As a first-year, you learn so much about the resources that Yale has to offer, each class is different and interesting, and the time commitment is not very high. Karin Schneider is a great teacher and very supportive. "
