            "\u00a0The class provides an excellent introduction to the political history of southeastern Europe, with a focus on the nations of the former Yugoslavia, which I think is an under-covered and often misunderstood region of the world. The class uses Yugoslavia (as well as Albania, Bulgaria, and Romania) as a lens through which broader questions about political regime types, democratic transition and consolidation, international intervention/global politics, ethnic tensions, and transitional justice are considered. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a much better understanding of communism in general and the breakup of Yugoslavia which are both topics I knew very little about before. ",
            "\u00a0I learned one or two political science theories that applied to situations of Balkan history. ",
            "\u00a0This course is an incredible survey of a region in Europe that, at least in my experience, is not covered much in other courses. This course does a fantastic job of balancing history, with political science, with looks into what life is like in the region today. Additionally, the writing assignments are much more creative than in a usual political science course, which made them much more interesting, and in some cases challenging to write. ",
            "\u00a0Basically, this course taught me insight into the Western Balkans, a region that I knew nothing about before this class. I learned so much fascinating history and political theory. This course taught me how to think and write critically about a complex, dynamic topic. Moreover, this course taught me how to comprehend issues in literature and film and tie those into broader topics of the class. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about Eastern European history and communism! Fascinating history and a bit of Poli Sci as well. ",
            "\u00a0Truly not sure that I developed any knowledge. Most of this class was focused on learning one theory of democratic consolidation as proposed by Linz and Stepan. Then, we applied that framework to the Balkans. Maybe this is an annoying epistemological qualm, but here goes: the political science framework did not allow me to analyze the Balkans in a more rigorous manner. Instead, the class was hung up on minutiae of democratic consolidation. ",
            "\u00a0This course served as a great introduction to the Balkans. I loved how some of the topics we dealt with in this course was about the intersection of ethnicity, nationalism and politics. I thought it was very fitting for what continues to happen today. Moreover, the course also pushed me to keep up with current events in the region. ",
            "\u00a0The course allows you to learn about the recent history of a region that really isn't covered in high school history courses. The Balkans have a really interesting history and understanding the rise of nationalism and the conflict in the '90s helps provide a better perspective to analyze events of today. ",
            "\u00a0I developed an understanding of the Yugoslav republics and their paths after the dissolution of Yugoslavia. Also, I understood the international response to the war in Bosnia. ",
            "\u00a0Briefly went over the rise of communism in Eastern Europe but later delved into the existence and fall of communism within Yugoslavia ",
            "\u00a0This course allows students to explore the concepts of democratic transitions in post-communist countries and gives a historical look at the Balkan region. The history of the Balkans (especially the former Yugoslavia) is incredibly in-depth and insightful. Not only does one get a sense of the history of the region but the culture as well. After taking this course my understanding of the Balkan region completely changed for the better and I now understand the various factors that impact the history of that region. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the political situation in Eastern Europe/the Balkans during the 20th and early 21st century, how they transitioned from communism, and a lot about the conflict in Yugoslavia during the 1990s. I learned about different regime types, the definition of democracy, and how to analyze the type of regime in a given country. ",

            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the class! Professor Aldrich's lectures were so engaging and interesting, and the perspective that she brings as someone who lived in Croatia for a short time and is very knowledgeable about the region's current politics (as well as the history) is so valuable. I also really liked the different kinds of materials that were on the syllabus. Besides for the standard academic books and articles, we also watched a BBC documentary, read a graphic novel, and watched dramatic films produced in the region. I found this variety to be really valuable because sometimes it can get really dry just reading articles, no matter how interesting they are. The BBC documentaries were amazing, and it was so interesting to see so many of the people who were key player's in the region's conflicts being interviewed and talking about these things first-hand. All of these different sources provided interesting perspectives and different ways of learning that I thought helped keep the class exciting throughout. The course is also structured really well and has a good flow to it, the theoretical readings at the beginning are so helpful for understanding the rest of the material. \r\n\r\nIn the future I think it'd be helpful to have more feedback on the film review assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Andrea Aldrich - she was very knowable about the information and excited about teaching it which made it very enjoyable to learn about. ",
            "\u00a0This course could be improved by necessitating a more rigorous understanding of the history of the breakup of Yugoslavia. ",
            "\u00a0Sort of a confusing experience. I really wanted to love this class--I took it because I'm interested in the history of the region, acknowledging that a PoliSci class wouldn't be my first choice of methodology to learn about the Balkans, but with the hopes that I would learn something new. I'm not sure if I did; the lectures did not have a lot of content, context, history, or nuance. We learned maybe two actual political science theories, but I don't think any of them happened historically in the Balkans? I feel like a study of the area requires careful, nuanced, and deep understanding of much of the history of the region, but it seems like all that was required was the parroting of buzzwords from slides. We spent way too much time defining things like \"nationalism\" and \"democracy\" in painfully basic terms, and much less time talking about how those ideas actually manifested and developed in the region. I found that I would take about half as many notes in an hour and fifteen minutes as I would in most 50 minute lectures. \r\n\r\nThe greatest weakness of the course were the assignments. I thought readings were occasionally interesting, but we never discussed them. Instead, we had three 2-page film reviews, which originally sounded delightful but quickly became the worst part of my semester--it was obnoxious to hunt through sparse notes from class to find an obvious point that could then be defended by evidence from the movie. These were exercises in bland and formulaic regurgitation of theses like \"Tito was an authoritarian,\" while in the files on Canvas there existed more complex articles that would have been so much more interesting to analyze. \r\n\r\nThis class wasn't difficult, it was just continually annoying. I didn't learn anything new about the region, but then again, I also did not learn anything new about political science. ",
            "\u00a0The strength was the intriguing topic. I knew little about this region before this class, but now I come away with a wealth of knowledge. Weakness: The course was pretty confusing and hard to follow at times, but I believe that this is due more to the complicated and dynamic region and not the fault of the class. ",
            "\u00a0Great course! Instructor was great, course materials were engaging and the film reviews were entertaining. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the reading load was fair for an intro lecture, participation was not graded (it was a 9am lecture), definitely developed a better cultural understanding of the Balkans. Exams were also fair. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the professor assigned fairly arbitrary grades for film reviews and essays. While the rubric listed something to the effect of 'an 11.5 means that analysis strongly develops the thesis and links it back to the main argument' you really cannot genuinely quantify what a 'strongly developed' versus 'moderately developed' argument looks like. Truly, I worked hard on some assignments and received B-range grades and then would put in little effort and receive A-range grades. \r\n\r\nSide note: this course could probably become a WR credit. Don't mind at all that we wrote lots, do mind that feedback was unclear. Please hand essays back with comments in track changes. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed watching the films and, especially, the BBC documentary. ",
            "\u00a0The course benefited from the use of multimedia throughout the course, with videos used for lecture sometimes and movies to deepen our understanding of the current theme in class. However, the class felt like there was quite a bit more writing for a class that wasnt counted for a WR credit. ",
            "\u00a0Loved the structure, lectures, and professor! ",
            "\u00a0I thought that the subject material of this course was fascinating! It's such an understudied region with such a rich history, and I loved having the chance to learn more about it. That being said, at times lectures felt a little disorganized, and there were points where it felt like we were glossing over important/interesting details. I also did NOT enjoy the group activities; I felt that those took a lot of time for very little intellectual benefit. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in comparative politics, or European politics more specifically! I have loved the comparative politics classes that I have taken at Yale, including this one, because they always debunk a lot of the preexisting ideas you have about a country or a region, and this class is the perfect example of that. The course teaches you to critically examine various domestic and international political actors and events, and helped me realize the region's political complexity. It is a very interesting region of the world--stuck between Europe and the east--that I don't think most Americans know very much about. Taking this class will teach you so much about the region and its politics, and when you're done you'll have a handful of new countries to add to your travel bucket list! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, most definitely! Even though this class met at 9 am, I still looked forward to it and enjoyed going because Professor Aldrich was such an amazing lecturer and the material was very interesting! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend that any Yale student understand the events of the breakup of Yugoslavia and politics of southeastern Europe. However, I'm not sure if this class is really the best one for teaching it. I was always a little disappointed with the content covered, and I am not sure if I actually feel like I have learned much about the politics of the region. ",
            "\u00a0With hesitations. If you know how to do PoliSci, or can tolerate frustrations better than I can, and really want to learn about the Balkans, I would maybe take this class. It was made more painful because it was at 9am, and frequently the content of the lecture regularly did not begin until ~9:25. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It offers a comprehensive look at a region that there are few opportunities to study here, and uses a wide range of sources and activities to do so. Furthermore, Professor Aldrich is an amazing professor who works hard to make the course as engaging for her students as possible. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! The course is fascinating  chances are you will learn so much about an area you don't know much about. Professor Aldrich is extremely caring and nice, and she really wants her students to do well. The assignments (we had two film responses, one longer essay, a midterm, and a final) are all approachable and easy to complete, and they facilitate learning. Even though there are a lot of assignments, it means each one doesn't count a lot towards your grade so it's a nice trade-off. I found the grading to be (more than) fair  if you put in the work you should get a nice grade. Professor Aldrich does have a different grading scale though (94 and up = A), so watch out for that. Overall, take this class! It is incredible, you'll love Professor Aldrich, and you'll learn so much! ",
            "\u00a0For sure! Anyone looking for a lighter workload class where you still learn a ton and get to hang with the coolest and most understanding professor ever should definitely take it. ",
            "\u00a0Maybe. I took this class thinking that we would learn tons about the Balkans, as a Tim Snyder Part III but that was not what transpired. If you want to look at the Balkans through one democratic theory, then do it! The class is also easily organized for learning. A dense, unhelpful reading was thrown to the dustbin of history and we instead watched BBC documentaries about the conflict. Now that I've said 'documentaries' this sounds like a cop-out class, but I assure you it was not. ",
            "\u00a0It's an interesting class on an important region, but note that there is a good amount of work - 3 papers in addition to a midterm and a final. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! Super good and well-taught course on a really interesting area of political history that doesnt always get a ton of coverage. I enjoyed the assignments and felt like I learned a lot without the class feeling overwhelming or overburdensome. So, so glad I took it. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to students because it serves as a great introduction to the Balkans. It is a very interesting part of the world that is often ignored in current politics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The course is very well taught and the material is extremely interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this course! I would take more classes with Professor Aldrich if I could. It was well-developed to facilitate engagement and learning with the material, and there were no heinous surprises on the exams. I feel like I have a much better understanding of South Eastern Europe after the course. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The region has a rich history and its important to understand how the communist regimes before the collapse of the Soviet Union shaped their transitions to democracy later. Also, the war in Bosnia is imperative to understand and know the atrocities that occurred during it so it never happens again. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! Professor Aldrich is an absolute gem and she made the content extremely engaging ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student who wishes to understand the region better. This course is an excellent learning experience for understanding how politics and conflict intersect in the Balkan region. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in Eastern Europe at all or communist/postcommunist regimes, definitely take this course. Even though it is a polisci course it's very accessible (I'm not a polisci major) and Professor Aldrich does a really good job making sure we all understood the fundamentals. It's a really interesting look at an area of the world that I feel like we don't talk that much about, and a part of history that I had not really been taught before. The reading can be a little dense but that may be because I'm not used to super political readings, but overall the workload is very manageable and Professor Aldrich is a really good lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0This is a super interesting course with a really friendly professor, but quite frankly it's a gut. Do with that what you will. "
