            "\u00a0Reading Spanish literature, more rapid tense choices (i.e. picking tenses without thinking about it) ",
            "\u00a0I have definitely improved my spanish speaking abilities as well as my listening and reading skills. I read some interesting literature in spanish for this class that has also informed me of spanish history and culture. ",

            "\u00a0It is very well organized but sometimes not the most engaging and requires a lot of work. ",
            "\u00a0The course is fine. ",
            "\u00a0A strength was the series of assessments. They were varied and allowed many criteria to be evaluated. For example, if one struggled with written exams, there were ample opportunities for speaking evaluations. A weakness was the homework towards the end of the semester. I would spend 2-3 hours each night on it. I often became frustrated and would lower my quality of work because I was tired of the amount of time I spent on it. ",
            "\u00a0The class is well organized and the expectations are very clear. Class every day can get a bit monotonous, but the course definitely facilitates improving on one's spanish abilities. The workload, however, was disproportionately distributed so the last few weeks were extremely heavy with work whereas the rest of the semester was manageable. ",
            "\u00a0There seemed to be a lot of work towards the end of the class, when some nights in the beginning only had 10 minutes of homework. The homework could be better spaced so the last few weeks wouldnt be as stressful. ",
            "\u00a0I think there could be more reading. I like the historical discussion as well. There is too much focus on grammar and not enough on speaking in class. Instead of exercises at home, reading and reading comprehension would be better. Also there were no take home essays in this class which I did not like. I wish it were more like a literature class and felt less like a grammar course which is totally possible. ",

            "\u00a0If you want to get better at spanish, definitely. Class every day gets boring and sometimes a drag, but I feel confident in my abilities in spanish now and I have learned some very valuable things about history, culture, society, etc. that expand to more than just learning the language. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially if you really want to improve your Spanish. ",
