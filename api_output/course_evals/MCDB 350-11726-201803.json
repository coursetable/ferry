            "\u00a0A satisfying overview of epigenetic mechanisms and consequences for human disease. Super interesting upper level MCDB class. Also learn how to read and present scientific literature, the importance of which cannot be overstated for the MCDB major. ",
            "\u00a0An understanding of the basic biology behind epigenetics (DNA and histone methylation), the conditions under which it will occur, and how this is essential to human health and well-being. This course allowed us to coalesce ideas from developmental and molecular biology as well as genetics. Also we learned how to critically analyze and discuss scientific literature. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this course. I learned how to thoroughly read and discuss primary literature, and I also learned higher level epigenetics and biological concepts. I found this course challenging, rewarding, thought-provoking, and interesting. Truly cannot say enough good things. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about different fields in epigenetics, its applications to human health, and how to read primary literature effectively and evaluate figures for clarity and credibility. ",
            "\u00a0I learned many novel concepts that I had not known before about epigenetics. Epigenetics has always been a field of biology that I did not know much about, and I believe this class has done an excellent job in laying the foundation for more complex classes as well as has done a successful job at connecting the relevancy of epigenetics to the real world. ",
            "\u00a0Epigenetics was a great class. The course is structured to give you a great foundation for the non-DNA sequence changes that can have enormous effects on our gene expression and thus well-being. I really enjoyed the lectures and learned a ton of compelling concepts about the effects that environmental factors can have on our bodies, as well as molecular agents/mechanisms that I've never heard of before. ",
            "\u00a0Pretty in-depth dive into epigenetics' most relevant topics: the actual cellular mechanisms driving epigenetic modifications, different types of epigenetic modifications, how epigenetics plays a role in imprinting, cancer, etc. ",
            "\u00a0We learned basic epigenetics topics (DNA methylation, histone modification, chromatin organization) as well as their application to human diseases. The topics were emphasized on a conceptual as well as mechanistic level. ",
            "\u00a0Foundational understanding of epigenetic concepts! ",
            "\u00a0I learnt how to engage with primary scientific literature, understand the methods used as well as the rationale behind each step taken by researchers along with the potential shortcomings of their work. ",
            "\u00a0We learned about the concepts underlying epigenetics and how to apply them to different situations and experiments.  We also spent half of our time reading and discussing scientific papers that investigated the ideas we learned about in class.  While reading these papers, we tried to be critical of the methods and the results presented. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: weekly primary literature discussions, super friendly professors, interesting material\r\nWeaknesses: lectures were not super compelling (but I don't think this is the professors' fault - it's just hard to make reading off a powerpoint interesting) ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the way the course was formatted with one lecture and one discussion section that the professors lead. I made more progress in interpreting papers this semester than I have in three years of biology classes, and the fact that the professors were leading this part of the class I think was critical to it being rewarding. I did not feel overwhelmed or stressed out by the material or exams, but rather that it had all been well taught and well-explained. My main critique is that I would like to see even more applications to human health and public health. Epigenetics has some really interesting insights to areas related to behavioral health, sociology, and public health, for example how stress and racial trauma can be inherited. I think at this high level of a biology class we not only should be learning the biology, but connecting it to a larger social view of human health. I also think that potentially meeting three times a week, and then having two lectures and a section may not be a bad idea if it allows this more nuanced information to be covered. Additionally I think a cap on the class would be helpful to allow better/more meaningful interaction between professors and students ",
            "\u00a0This course is excellent! I loved the format with weekly sections as well as lectures, because we could engage with new material in many ways. Both professors were great, and I loved the layout. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include weekly discussion sections on primary literature. Papers were generally very interesting (I think one, instead of two papers, per week is much better). Strengths also include the incredible depth of knowledge by both professors. Weaknesses include a little bit of lack of clarity in the lectures, despite being very interesting. It would be good to have scanned pdfs of the textbook for parts of the lectures that are more mechanism-heavy and require memorization. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this class was the discussion papers that were required every week for discussion. These papers were responsible for connecting the concepts that were taught during lecture to the the research science/clinical world. ",
            "\u00a0I think the class is structured great. I like how it's split between two professors, and I think all the exams were fair. The discussion sessions improved my ability to read/understand primary literature, and the final projects (which were much more creative than those from other STEM classes I've taken here) provided a great summary of the foundation laid in class. I don't have any complaints! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Both professors are great and very approachable. Lecture material is genuinely interesting. The exams are very fair and non-cumulative, so you won't feel overwhelmed with information. Some information of course always carries through exam to exam, but I thought the grading system was very fair. There are a variety of assignments such as participation in discussion session and a written assignment at the end of the year. Because half of the classes are spent discussing papers, you get a nice exposure to different types of information, so things don't get boring.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Discussion section was sometimes a bit of a free for all when the questions were very detail oriented or the questions moved too slowly. I think putting more emphasis on organizing the discussion section when presenting would facilitate staying on time. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: excellent instructors, well-organized, good discussion section\r\nImprovements: shorter exams, longer office hours ",
            "\u00a0The material is super interesting. Both professors are great. I love the emphasis on talking about these topics with people outside of the field. \r\n\r\nI wish there had been more time for one on one meetings with the professors to enhance our learning. I also liked learning about all the epigenetic mechanisms, etc but wish there had been more lectures similar to the first one with a zoomed out perspective on epigenetic effects. Ie what types of things might be inherited transgenerationally. ",
            "\u00a0The course used a lecture-seminar structure, which was very helpful. The lectures covered the baseline content required to engage with the latest scientific literature which would then be discussed in the seminar. The seminar then reinforced what was learnt in the lecture. The use of two complementary lesson types helped to strengthen the course material being delivered, making it approachable, interesting and up-to-date. ",
            "\u00a0The professors of this course are great and so sweet.  It is such an interesting course and the material covered is fascinating.  We learned the material to a great depth, which was very difficult but rewarding.  Reading papers every week for section was hard because they are tricky to understand, but being in a small setting is nice and it was usually kind of fun.  The exams were much harder than I expected them to be; maybe I did not concentrate enough on memorization.  A large spread of students abilities leads to very different performances on the exams so I am not sure they are quite fair.  I did enjoy the last assignment, which was writing about a scientific paper.  The one thing that was annoying was that we did not have a huge amount of freedom in the paper we chose. "

            "\u00a0Highly recommend for an upper-level MCDB elective. Low workload, interesting material, and you really learn how to critically look at primary literature and gain insight from actual experimental research. This is so key -- if there's one thing you should take away from the MCDB major, it's this. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This is such a great, if not the best, upper level MCDB class. The work is so manageable, the professors are great, and epigenetics is a really fascinating emerging field that is very connected to human health. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, DEFINITELY! Excellent. Well taught, engaging, cool science. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course because epigenetics is an understudied but remarkable field with exciting implications for human health. Both professors are very kind and passionate about their week. That being said, 2 hour lectures can feel a little too long and scientific literature can be daunting at first -- although the environment of section makes it easy to just try. It'll be much easier by the end of the semester. Lectures can be a little confusing because there are not many words on slides, so you have to attend in order to understand concepts and catching up can be difficult. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the professors teach this class extremely well. The workload is definitely not that heavy and only require you to read a paper every week and review the slides of every lecture. The class in and of itself also offers very interesting learning material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's a fantastic class for the aforementioned reasons. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is a very interesting course on epigenetics taught by two great professors. I found the material to always be quite enthralling and you move quickly through a lot of information. The class is organized in an extremely fair way, so there is grading between three exams (no final!), participation in discussion, and a final written assignment. Class does not get boring because half the time, you are discussing scientific research papers. ",
            "\u00a0Yes if you are looking for an interesting upper-level MCDB course. The professors are excellent and very kind and sweet. There was only one lecture per week and the other class period was used as discussion section for a weekly paper relating to the lecture, led by two students each time. The exams were fair but a bit on the harder side. But overall I gained a deeper understanding of epigenetics and everyone seemed engaged. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Really interesting course ! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to individuals who have some background in genetics or molecular biology as the course does assume some prior knowledge. However, if someone who does not have college-level background in these fields wishes to find out more about epigenetics, I would not discourage them from the course as it is possible to do so but with the awareness that additional work would be required to stay up to speed. ",
            "\u00a0Most definitely! This was a wonderful course that every science major should take because it is truly eye-opening and changes the way we think about genetics and health in the world. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this class; it is just such an interesting subject, anyone who has an interest in genetics and molecular biology should take this class.  The professors are lovely and meeting with them one-on-one to discuss papers is a great exercise.  The concepts and mechanisms we learn about are just fascinating and we learn really useful scientific methods for anyone who wants to learn more about it. "
