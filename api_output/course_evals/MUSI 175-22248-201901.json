You have the ability to listen to music is a completely different way if you so choose. You also learn some things about the exclusivity of the Western Art Canon and some problematic issues that classical musicians face. ",

            "\u00a0This class was absolutely incredible--learned how to analytically listen for musical elements; situate musical styles and genres in time; trace the evolution of Western Art Music across time; and write papers about music. Not only has this class enhanced my appreciation and understanding of music, but it has also allowed me to develop auditory learning skills and to make connections with other humanities courses. If this class is taught again (sadly, not by Professor Moore), you should without a doubt take it. ",

            "\u00a0This class covers of \"Western Art Music\" (what we would colloquially deem \"classical\"): Europe from 1100s-1900s, and United States in the 20th-21st centuries. This is not just music analysis, but also a historical and cultural overview. Composers include Palestrina, Mozart, Tchaikovsky, William Grant Still, Duke Ellington, Kendrick Lamar, etc.\r\n\r\nI learned how to better analyze music based on the cultural context in which it was created. I also have a better understanding of the lives of certain compsers. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about Western musical history and different genres through time. I can appreciate classical music a lot more now, as well as jazz and contemporary art music. For someone who enjoys music but didn't know anything, this was a really useful class! ",

I acquired the necessary historical context that now allows me to listen to music and understand how it performs within the intellectual history of its day. ",

            "\u00a0One strength was definitely the professor and I'm sad that she's leaving. The TAs were also great. They were all very passionate about this class. I felt that I got good feedback on all of my assignments. The lectures elaborated well on the textbook material and I never felt short on sources. \r\nI think the only glaring weakness from this class was that it had a section. The lecture is small enough that it did not need a section and I struggled to fit it into my schedule. Sure, it was cool to have the occasional smaller discussion, but I often felt that Prof. Moore delegated to section material that she did not wish to teach herself. ",
            "\u00a0The listening material is delicately chosen, very representative. ",
            "\u00a0I thought it was a great survey of the history of western art music. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Very fun and interactive lecture, easy to follow course structure, low workload\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: textbook is boring but you can thrive off of lecture so it's fine ",
            "\u00a0The course is really well taught all-around ",
            "\u00a0Great class, most of the stress came from a very unexpected first quiz as to how it would be structured. ",
            "\u00a0This course really gave me some fun gems of music I now like to listen too. Excellent overview of the tradition, and not too challenging. Keep notes on the specific pieces from the assignments tab as you go through lecture--this will be an invaluable study help. The courses use of canvas was sometimes frustrating. Too many tabs. Too many seperate lists to navigate between. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures and section are excellently lead.  The quizzes and exams are also excellent reviews of material. ",
            "\u00a0It was great as is ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: highly attentive and attuned teaching staff (Professor Moore and the two TAs); content; lectures and sections; assessments (it was great to test our learning with unknown listenings); paper assignments...everything!!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I cannot think of a weakness--this class was marvelous. It was simply unfortunate that we did not have more time to dwell on certain time periods and their musical styles, but that is the nature of a survey course. ",
            "\u00a0Thoroughly enjoyed this course. It is clear that the professor and the TA's truly love their work. They materialize that via enthusiastic teaching. ",
            "\u00a0They wrongly assume that a lot of kids have experience writing about music and being able to recognize it. They need to advertise the type of audience meant for this class or change the standards. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths -- prof. Moore is wonderful; I learned a lot; listening quizzes and exams were all very straightforward, and the essays weren't bad at all\r\nWeaknesses -- I would've loved to learn more about the different musical genres in the second half of the 21st c. like punk, rock, pop, etc. ",
            "\u00a0The course has an amazing teaching team. Marissa Moore and her two TAs had fantastic chemistry and this translated into an incredible learning experience during lecture and section. Additionally, the passion of the team is contagious. They are inmmensely approachable and patient. I honestly think this course was perfect and had little to no weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: enthusiastic lectures, many musical examples, the course material was connected to its historical importance.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the material tested was tedious to learn and not as important as other things, such as dates and the complete name of the authors. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Great lecturer, variety of composers within genres, range of music from Medieval until now \r\nWeakness: Course only focused on European and North American composers. It would be great to hear more Latin American, African, and Asain music in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: extremely well organized, Prof. Moore was such a great lecturer, my TA Marco was super cool, content was fascinating, great stress reliever  to listen to music, the essays are pretty casual so it's good for a STEM person to dabble in the humanities by taking this class because it's mainly exam and quiz based, quizzes and exams were very fair if you put in the time and studied what Prof Moore told us to study, and the essays were graded very fairly\r\nThis is the last time Prof. Moore is teaching the class! I'll miss her ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: great professor and TAs (professor is leaving though), interesting content, some really incredible pieces of music.\r\nWeaknesses: Not gonna lie, but the more modern pieces started to get kind of strange. They were interesting to learn about, but not necessarily enjoyable to listen to. ",
            "\u00a0This course was perfect for me. Professor Moore was a fantastic and engaging lecturer, using a combination of speaking, music, video, and even hands on activities to keep the course engaging from start to finish. ",
            "\u00a0I think a major strength of the course is the diversity and regularity in assignments. The different types of assignments asked us to engage with the course material in different ways, while the regularity forced us to keep up with the material. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of the course are that it allows you to engage with many different genres of music and write concert reviews at Yale, giving students the chance to experience concerts at Yale. Weaknesses of the course are that I felt like more time was spent on certain musical genres than others. "

            "\u00a0Take the course if you are interested in understanding music. Gave me a lot of insights I didn't know I didn't have. Don't be waved off by the content of the first few lectures, they really don't give you a feel for what the content of the rest of the class will be like. Mostly it's going through a timeline of musical developments. ",

            "\u00a0Definitely take this. Spectacular class ",
            "\u00a0YES!!! If offered again, please take this course! Unfortunately Professor Moore will not be teaching it, but I sincerely hope someone else takes up the reins. What a remarkable class to learn how to critically listen to and analyze music. For humanities majors, it is also invaluable to learn music history--the content supplements other courses so well (you also have an opportunity to hone your writing skills!). I have so many fond memories from this course, and the professor and TAs were so dedicated to their teaching--they provided fantastic feedback on assignments, and they even recorded the final exam review session for those who were unable to attend! 10/10 course. ",

            "\u00a0Absolutely; this has been my favorite class at Yale ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, this is by far the best course I have taken at Yale, period. If Marissa Moore was staying at Yale and was teaching this course again I would in an instant recommend the class to any student regardless of their major or background. However, Marissa is leaving the university and so I don't know if the class will be offered again or if it will be as good. I have never written a course evaluation before, but I felt indebted to the teaching team because this was the most amazing class ever. ",
            "\u00a010/10 Would recommend ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is a very fun class and also challenging. I learned a lot of musical techniques that has helped me enjoy music in a more deeper way. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! You learn a ton about the different genres, composers, and periods in the Classical and Jazz world. I also enjoy music way more than I could have ever done so without the knowledge this course has given me. ",
            "\u00a0This was my favorite Yale class because it was so interesting and well organized. As a STEM person, this class was a fun break from stressful psets and hard exams. This class was the perfect amount of work-- you had to study to do well on the exams and quizzes, but they were very transparently written and fair so that you were rewarded for your hard work. Prof Moore won't be teaching this class next year, so the format might change, but regardless it will still probably be such a fun class to take. ",
            "\u00a0Yes if you're already interested in some of the music covered by the course. I think the way we approached music in the course was more analytical (how the music is structured + what was it's historical context), as opposed to appreciative/listening for enjoyment. This makes sense as music wasn't made to be pleasurable for the listener for a good chunk of music history. The quizzes/tests were kind of annoying to study for, but in general very fair. The assignments were interesting to complete and pretty relevant to the class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but this class does require a fair bit of musical memorization! ",
            "\u00a0YES. If you love history, love music, love learning about different cultures, or some combination of the three, you NEED to take this course! (Even if you just LIKE those things)! ",
            "\u00a0YES. PLEASE TAKE THIS. It's the best class I've taken at Yale. You learn so much that you wouldn't really engage with in any other class (especially if you're STEM, like I am). The assignments are genuinely enjoyable, and you get to listen to a lot of cool music! What more could you want in a class! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student as an introductory music course that really makes the student more appreciative of many music styles and learn a lot about music history. "
