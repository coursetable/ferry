            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the political landscape of Latin America during the 20th century and about conflicts that are often not included in literature courses focused on the region. I also gained visual insight into what these places looked like 50 years ago, which is rare considering that few Hollywood movies or TV programs accurately portray South America. "

            "\u00a0I loved the course. Moira is an excellent professor and even stayed after class to continue discussion with her students. I would have liked to learn more about the historical context of the films in class, as I often realized my Latin American political history was lacking. But overall, the class was excellent. "
