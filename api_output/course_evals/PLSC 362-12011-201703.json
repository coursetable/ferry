            "\u00a0I learned important political theory on referendums and a lot about the dynamics that led to Brexit. ",
            "\u00a0When I came in I was interested in answering the question, \"What are referendums good (and not good) for?\" and I do feel I have a more clear answer to it now than I did previously. I had also not read political science papers before, so that was an important skill I learned. ",
            "\u00a0Insight on public opinion and histories regarding referendums. "

        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: excellent readings, fun Brexit Exercise, the professor is very good at leading discussions and explains everything so clearly\r\nWeaknesses: did not receive grades the entire semester ",
            "\u00a0Great intro class on referendums. Readings are engaging and Prof. Stokes initiates good discussions about the general themes. The syllabus would benefit from better organization though, in order to instill a sense of progression throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - very comprehensive. I like the focus on a single question, \"Are referendums good for democracy?\" and that it is thoroughly examined from all possible angles. Exceptionally well organized, especially for a course being taught for the very first time. Felt like we had a clear sense of direction each week as to what aspect of that question we were answering. Discussions were substantive and helped me clarify my understanding of technical points, but also changed or reinforced my opinion on certain issues, which is always good. Brexit exercise was the best part. A lot of fun and a non-traditional way to learn.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses/suggestions for improvements - a lot of the case studies/example referendums we covered were from the 1980s and 1990s. Especially when we were doing the Brexit exercise, I think it became apparent that referendums are a lot different today than they were then (especially with regards to polarization and media influence). I understand there may be less literature on more recent referendums, but if possible, I think it would be helpful to incorporate some more case studies from the 2000s and 2010s. Also perhaps more referendums on social issues and referendums in less mature democracies might have been more exciting to discuss.\r\n\r\nAs a side note - not sure where else to put this - I think the take-home final was a good idea and preferable to a paper, but that it would have been more appropriate to have 48 hours for it. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Comprehensive, open, good selection of readings and manageable workload\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the lack of structure hinders the course. "

            "\u00a0Yes, Professor Stokes is the best discussion leader I've ever had in seminar. Referendums are very relevant today. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend to anyone interested in democratic theory. Fascinating topic, with a wide range of possible approaches that the readings open up on. ",
            "\u00a0If you think referendums are interesting, absolutely! As someone interested in this topic but with no background in political science, I found this course very accessible and informative. I am sure it will only become even better in future semesters! ",
            "\u00a0Take this class! You'll learn a little about a lot of referendums and their effects. I learned a lot about different political systems around the world and the theory behind referendums is very interesting. Stokes is so nice! ",
            "\u00a0This is an excellent new course and Professor Stokes has put in a lot of effort in developing it. I highly recommend it. "
