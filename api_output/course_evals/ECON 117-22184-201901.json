Proudly, you walk into class and realize you are one of 12 students in a 130 person class. This is a typical Economics 117 class. Shockingly, the material is actually useful and necessary in this class (using R, basic statistics, applications to the real world). Yet the obstacle of both making it to class and staying awake while staring at jejune powerpoints with glazed eyes proved to be too much for me and 90% of my peers. Perhaps 5-10 students in this class possessed a deep love for econometrics and I can guarantee none came. The rest realized you can aptly learn the material simply by glancing over the powerpoints on your own time. You will not want to take this class, but you must for the major (Econ, EP&E etc.) ",

",
            "\u00a0I thought that this was a very solid course overall.  I think one way that this course could be improved is by settling the amount of R code that was used in the class.  While the homework and lectures were very R heavy, the exams (which were the majority of the grade) really were not.  I think it would have been really useful to see less R in lecture and more conceptual topics, and use the problem sets as a space for students to really delve into R and get more experience there. ",

            "\u00a0The early morning lectures were difficult to follow and were fairly fast-paced. Lecture slides were also very long. The group-style problem sets however and the organization of those assignments and quizzes were nicely spaced throughout the semester. There could be more midterm and final preparation. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: well-organized overall:  topics are in modules (probability, descriptive/inferential statistics, regression, etc.); class structure is essentially divided into econometric concepts and R programming; grading into exams, psets (comprising conceptual and R coding sections), quizzes (and optional final project) \r\nWeaknesses: not anything worth bring up ",
            "\u00a0The TA office hours could have benefitted from larger rooms, and the sections were not as helpful as anticipated. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Very engaging lecture slides, easy to keep up with if a lecture is missed.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sections could be better structured to help students learn, my TF was not engaged with material so I rarely went to my assigned section. Additionally, the time of the class to start the week made it slightly inaccessible, especially during midterms. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course is definitely the breakdown of grades and assignments. The occasional open-note quizzes were great for keeping track of how well you understood material. I also think the grade breakdowns were pretty generous overall, especially being able to drop one of the PSET grades. I don't think anyone should go into this course worrying about their grade; if you're willing to put in a normal amount of work, you will be fine.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses is definitely the weekly labs/sections. They're not mandatory, which is great, because every time I attend one, I feel like i got very little out of it. It was a good opportunity to ask any clarifying questions on material, but most of the time you could just look at the lab/section notes online and gain just as much in less time than the usual section. I also think sections could have benefited from more focus on conceptual material as opposed to R.\r\n\r\nThat said, lecture itself was pretty solid and definitely useful. Professor Humphries really did a great job with the slides, especially after he starting focusing more on the conceptual side of things and provided more detailed slides after midterm feedback. Prof. Humphries himself was also very enthusiastic about the material, so lecture was never really dry or boring (what was tough was the 9am time). ",
            "\u00a0This course is very well-organized and therefore, relatively easy to follow despite that the content could be challenging at times. It could improve, however, by incorporating more problem solving in lecture time. ",
            "\u00a0The primary weakness of the course was that it was at 9am, so there was not a lot of engagement during the lecture. The slides were also quite repetitive and could have been more clear. ",
            "\u00a0My only complaint with the course was the fact it was at 9am.  The course could be improved by starting later than 9am. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures could be condensed. A lot of useful information though. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were useful applicable skills using real world case studies to teach them.\r\n\r\nThe main weakness was the fact that there was an emphasis on R programming and R-related skills during problem sets, but an overwhelming bias toward applying pure statistics on the exam. While this is not the worst thing ever, it would have been nice for R skills to be both tested and to some extent rewarded in an exam setting. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Humphries is an amazing lecturer and professor. He cares a lot about his students. However, I think the final exam should be tailored to fit the content more. I believe students were expecting an exam that is similar in length and difficulty as what we were presented with in practice exams from previous years. We were also under the impression that R codes that we have not used previously would not be tested. Other than the final, this course was great! ",
            "\u00a0This course is good because the material is understandable and useful. However, many of the concepts are made excessively complicated by slides and explanations that are far too theoretical. ",

            "\u00a0I think sections should be mandatory considering the large class size. ",
            "\u00a0This course focuses on important, applicable skills (like basic coding and hypothesis testing), rather than unnecessary memorization or complex calculus. It is well-structured for student learning, with constant assignments to ensure that students keep up with the material without adding too much unnecessary stress. In the future, I think that the midterm exam should be more difficult (to differentiate students more on the standard Econ department curve), and that lecture time should not be dedicated to R-coding (except for a basic introduction to the program at the outset of the course). ",
            "\u00a0The lecture notes are very detailed which is extremely helpful with such dense course content ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were the pset, lecture slides, and support from lecturers, TAs and peer tutors. Weaknesses were lecture style and sections. ",
            "\u00a0I had no prior experience with r before entering this class, and I think the course was very good at introducing this language to the students. The problem sets were always very helpful and a good tool to study what we had learnt the prior weeks. However, I feel that the lecture itself could have been more engaging and clear with what was been taught. ",
            "\u00a0The amount of access to receive help in the course is really great. Professor Humphries works hard on Piazza and Canvas to make resources available to students. The amount of time to spend with information is really great. My only thing I would change is to add one more midterm to provide more opportunities to improve grades in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Course was all stats, thought it was boring. Had to take it for econ, would have made it more relevant to doing own research. Probably learned the right material, I just didn't follow all the time and exams were hard. Was not a life-changing course :( ",
            "\u00a0I think one of the major weaknesses of this class was that we did not learn the theory behind the statistical tests we learned. Without knowing the inner workings of the statistical tools we are using, we are just memorizing formulas and their requirements. Another weakness of this course is the emphasis on R. While its a useful language to know, it doesn't make sense that we were tested on knowing R code, since R code is incredibly easy to learn about online. Further, knowing R does not mean one understands the econometrics, and knowing all the econometric tools does not mean we know R.\r\nStrengths: Prof. Humphries does a good job of explaining things. I also really liked the fact that he posted slides on Canvas, as it served as a good reference. "

I think you just have to be willing to go to office hours for some of the PSETs and it is so important to find another group of students to work with. Fortunately, Prof. Humphries helps with finding study groups, which is really nice of him.\r\n\r\nThe class itself also greatly benefits from all the real world examples.
