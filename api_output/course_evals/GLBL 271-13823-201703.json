            "\u00a0A great course that teaches you about important trends and history of middle eastern politics, but also challenges an over deterministic viewpoint of it at the same time. I learned a lot. ",
            "\u00a0- Knowledge about rise of nationaltism, arab spring, American foreign policy in the middle east, islamism, the Iranian revolution ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about the Middle East as a region, and all the different facets of politics, culture, and instability in the region. I learned so much about how politics, culture, and economics interact in the Middle East, and realized how uninformed I was before this class. I also really enjoyed learning from my classmates, who have a variety of different experiences with/from different countries in the region. ",
            "\u00a0I learned all about Middle Eastern history, current Middle Eastern affairs, and different perspective on current and past Middle Eastern issues. ",
            "\u00a0This was a survey course that went over major themes and historical turning points relating to the Middle East. We studied these themes in relation to how they shaped the modern Middle East and the new challenges the region faces today. Learned a lot about the history and repercussions of Western involvement, state hulding, rentier states and the influence of Islam. ",
            "\u00a0Take it to understand how to properly make a political analysis. Emma has had decades of practical experience in Middle Eastern affairs, and offers a critical viewpoint. This isnt a course thats reading-heavy and based on a lot of theory; itll teach you about practicality ",
            "\u00a0The course was a great survey course of the modern politics of the Middle East. I learned a lot from Professor Sky's personal experience working in Iraq as well as from the students in the class who had dedicated a lot to studying and working in the ME. We also regularly reviewed contemporary news that was coming from the region. I enjoyed the class thoroughly. "

            "\u00a0Emma is a practitioner with extremely interesting experiences and an incredible perspective on Middle Eastern politics. Unfortunately, a lot of class time was spent on student presentations. I've always found regular presentations a disappointing way to learn throughout my classes at Yale, regardless of how they're organized. In my experience they generally become recitations of readings, and the only people who really learn the topic in-depth are the presenters themselves. I felt that the only real insights in class came from Emma, from students who were from the Middle East commenting on events in their home countries, or from Josh on the US military perspective in Syria and Iraq. However, those insights were awesome - the kind of information that's really hard or impossible to get from reading news articles - and definitely made the class far more than worth it.\r\n\r\nI think that more focus on discussion would make the class better, but I acknowledge that it can be hard when levels of personal experience/understanding of the region vary widely. Maybe something like assigning students to different countries/blocs and having them present those positions on each class topic, with Emma moderating discussion and moving it forward when necessary, could work more effectively? Or at the very least, creating a hard limit on student presentations (maybe half an hour)? ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- Survey class that will allow you to develop interest in many areas\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- I wish it was less driven by students and more driven by professor Sky\r\n- My experience in the class was enriched when Professor Sky interfered in the discussion.\r\n- Focus is on events and less on historical interpretation and debate. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is having so many people from different countries in the class. Being able to hear perspectives from people who grew up in Syria, Iran, and Saudi Arabia among other countries was really informative and inspiring. I also think Emma's insights, and her ability to prompt discussion during our classmates' presentations was great.\r\n\r\nI really enjoyed how flexible Emma was with letting us pursue what we wanted with our final projects/essays, and how helpful she was throughout the course. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, really really loved it! Hard to think of weaknesses... \r\n\r\nIf anything, I wish the class was a little longer (maybe 2 - 2 and a half hours per week) so we had more time to discuss everything in class! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were the materials covered since going thematically allowed us to really understand the context in which modern issues developed as well as the relations between regional powers. Weaknesses were that each week was essentially students presenting on the readings which was sometimes a full way to engage with the material. However, presentations were often really good its just that it wouldve been great to have heard more from Emma. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the range of topics that we covered, but I wish I heard more from Emma and less from the student presentations. I think the class should still involve the student presentation, but it should not take up the entire class time. ",
            "\u00a0I wish Emma would offer more insight during student presentations. ",
            "\u00a0This course provides an overview of a wide range of topics related to the Middle East.  Students give presentations each week on that week's topic.  While the presentations were good, the course might be improved with more time for student discussion and more input from the professor, who is obviously an expert and whose insights were always illuminating. ",
            "\u00a0The only weakness of the course was that a lot of the material was student taught. While this can be very useful and engaging, I felt I didn't get a comprehensive grasp on all of the issues. I wish Professor Sky would teach more of the material. I did however get a great overarching outlook of the ME. "

            "\u00a0Awesome chance to learn from Emma Sky, who has an incredibly unique perspective on the Middle East from direct experience. If you're interested in Middle Eastern politics and you can get in, you should take it. The class's reading content itself is pretty straightforward and probably won't teach you a ton if you keep up with Middle Eastern politics - if so, you're taking the class for the chance to talk about these issues in a class setting with Emma and (if following past years) a handful of students who are from the Middle East. A lot of people show up during shopping period and you'll be asked to explain why you want to take the course, with precedence given to upperclassmen, people from Middle Eastern countries, people who have relevant backgrounds, and then relevant academic experience. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, knowledge about the Middle East is valuable and building and Professor Sky is one of the most genuine professors I have met. Building a connection with her is definitely a plus. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you get into this class, definitely take it! Emma and the other students in this course were amazing and I'm so glad I got to meet all of them! I enjoyed this class, its readings, discussions, and essays so much! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is a great overview of the Middle East and Professor Sky is clearly knowledgeable. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely phenomenal class!!! You learn so much about Middle Eastern history, current affairs, and different perspectives! Emma is amazing!! My only wish is that the course was actually longer each week! ",
            "\u00a0Definitley recommendation it for people who want to learn more about the Middle East before taking courses that zoom in a bit more on specific aspects of the region. This will provide the underlying context that youll need to really be able to get a lot out of those types of courses. ",
            "\u00a0I recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn more about a range of interesting topics regarding the politics of the Middle East. I do not recommend for anyone who already has a solid background, you may still have a lot of interesting conversations in class, but you will not learn anything new. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Do it to get to know Emma. ",
            "\u00a0This course delves into a variety of fascinating topics related to the Middle East, and the experience of students in the classroom with experience in the Middle East adds greatly to the discussion.  That said, I would recommend students only take this course if they have some background on the subject.  I had very little previous knowledge of the Middle East, and that made the course difficult at times. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course. Learning with Emma Sky was really powerful and insightful. It was a good survey course of the modern issues of the ME. "
