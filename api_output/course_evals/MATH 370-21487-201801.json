            "\u00a0We built up the machinery for Galois theory and then used it in some cool applications.  Very interesting, approachable course. ",
            "\u00a0In this class, we continue from the end of MATH 350 to learn about field theory and various topics in Galois Theory. It continues to clarify various concepts covered in MATH 350 and look at its various applications to help us better understand fields and polynomial equations. ",
            "\u00a0I gained some really really cool *stuff*. People always say that you can learn so much from really simple ideas, to me that pretty much sums up this course. As an extension of abstract algebra you spend an entire semester mulling over degree 2, 3, 4, 5 polynomials. I ended up learning a lot about obscure theory people have used to classify polynomials, but also gained a new perspective of mathematics.\r\n\r\nGalois theory is truly an amazing topic and has made me want to continue studying math, just to learn more about what we know about simple things like polynomials. ",
            "\u00a0Fields, field extensions, polynomial reducible, constructible points, impossibility of certain constructions, theory of Galois extensions and applications to prove things like the insolubility of the quintic. ",
            "\u00a0The amount of information I've learned from this class is overwhelming. I've developed my understanding of Abstract Algebra, dived into the worlds of field theory and Galois group theory, and -- above all -- shown myself the true merits of dedication and hard work. This is one of the most rewarding classes I have yet taken at Yale. ",

            "\u00a0Learn about Galois groups, the Galois Correspondence, normality, separability, rational extensions. Builds on abstract algebra, particularly on knowledge of fields, using it to prove cool stuff about roots of polynomials and field extensions. You finally prove that you can't always solve the quintic in terms of radicals! ",

            "\u00a0This is a very interesting course.  Even though this was Asher's first year teaching Galois theory (and it was on short notice), he did a great job.  Lectures were interesting, and homework was relevant and manageable. ",
            "\u00a0This course was great at covering aspects of Galois Theory and exploring those concepts in depth. ",
            "\u00a0A major strength was the high level of problem sets, Professor, and Peer Tutor. After going through Abstract with Asher and Jason, this class is somewhat more chill. Because they know so much and have such a good foundation in Fields and Galois theory, they were definitely positive things to have when taking the course.\r\n\r\nSome weaknesses include that the topic is still very broad and it turns out there are many ways to learn/approach the major result of Galois theory. At times we learned things in class that seem unmotivated, mostly because there is just so much machinery to learn. Having a more clear outline of the course and maybe a textbook that the class follows more closely with may aid in the learning process. ",
            "\u00a0This class was phenomenal! The results were astonishing and Asher was an absolutely brilliant professor and lecturer. My mind was definitely blown, and I do not see any way to improve the class. ",
            "\u00a0The course is perfectly designed. Perfect. The problem sets are incredibly well made and teach you extra material without you realizing it. The midterms and final are all very fair and test your understanding of the material from class. The textbook is very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I think the layout of this course is fantastic. To start with field theory and then show the motivations for Galois theory makes the course really satisfying for its students. I'm not sure how it could be improved, the problem sets were also really well written. ",
            "\u00a0Asher Auel is, once again, an incredible, conscientious, passionate, knowledgable professor with high expectations. The course was a lot of work (less than 350, but still 15+ hours/wk), but it was almost always fun and I learned something from each pset. No real weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0Anything taught by Asher requires no improvement. ",
            "\u00a0Biggest strength was definitely Asher Auel! So helpful, friendly, responsive, etc. Go to office hours! Asher is both helpful with material and will talk to you about life. He also provided thorough study guides for exams, which always seemed pretty fair. Homework was not as bad as in abstract algebra. Concepts were in my opinion a lot harder but the psets were shorter. Weaknesses were the material often moved very fast, although there is a lot to cover so I'm not sure how to address this. Sometimes the big picture got lost in trying to understand the details of proofs. ",
            "\u00a0First midterm far easier than the rest of the course so dont be fooled. ",
            "\u00a0Very engaging course. Lectures went over important results, and Asher is a brilliant lecturer. Exams were generally fair, and Asher gave study guides that were really helpful for preparing. Psets were fun (though time consuming!) and necessary for keeping up with the material. TA Office Hours were EXTREMELY helpful (go Jason)! Can't think of anything wrong with the course, it was overall structured very well! ",
            "\u00a0I think that the focus should be more on the field theory and continuation of abstract algebra from MATH 350, as opposed to delving so deeply into Galois theory. ",
            "\u00a0It's well taught, and prof Auel was really helpful always. \r\nThe first half semester is fairly manageable and in the second half course material starts to get harder and broader. ",
            "\u00a0The course does a good job at presenting its abstract content well - it's structured to allow students to understand the material on a deep level. However, I think the course could move faster, as we did not cover everything that was initially planned on the syllabus (including some important points). ",

            "\u00a0Yes, anyone who has dared to take Abstract Algebra will gain a refreshing view of math and algebra in general. It is not as intensive and oftentimes more interesting. For those who have not taken Abstract, definitely take these two in sequence, these courses are more about a logical thought process than a quantitative mind. ",

            "\u00a0Yes without a doubt if you're a math major. It's a lot of work and extremely difficult, but amazing material ",
            "\u00a0YES, YES, YES, and YES. If you've already taken MATH 350, there is NO reason not to take this course. In the past, 370 was considered a grade-killer under Miki (though still worth the work). Now that Asher's teaching it, there's literally zero incentive not to enroll. Do yourself a favor! ",
            "\u00a0DEFINITELY take this class if you took Math 350. The topics covered are so beautiful, and the group theory from Math 350 come back and make a lot more sense when applied in Galois Theory. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Especially with Prof. Auel, it's a great continuation of MATH 350, although more chill, more abstract, and more beautiful. If you want to know why we can't square the circle, this is the class for you. (Also Grace Hopper enters at the end in a really awesome way - convex hulls!). ",
            "\u00a0Evariste Galois and Asher Auel are two of the finest human beings to walk this Earth, and when they team up they are unstoppable. ",
            "\u00a0Depends. Personally I actually did not like galois theory as much as i expected to, as there seemed to be a lot of tedious computational stuff (like computing minimal polynomials) which started to seem pretty pointless after a while. But it is a good class and you learn a lot and it's the natural extension to abstract algebra. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. 350 and 370 make a great yearlong algebra course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Asher Auel is a must ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you took Abstract Algebra, definitely consider this sequel! Galois is really fun and you prove a lot of cool stuff about roots of polynomials (insolvability of the quintic!). I've heard mixed opinions about which of Galois or Abstract are harder, but I think most agree that Galois psets are less time consuming (though that's not saying much). The course is structured very well--lectures are interesting and cover important results, many of which are not included in the textbook. Overall a rewarding experience, especially if Asher is teaching! ",
            "\u00a0No. Unless you are already particularly interested in polynomials and/or Galois theory from an abstract perspective, or are planning to go into algebraic academia, this course is just unnecessary. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a crazy journey. Ostensibly easier than 350 but at least under Asher I felt like the workload was about the same. That said, it's incredibly satisfying to look back at how much you've learned at the end. I highly recommend itAsher is a great teacher and this class taps into a lot of fundamental curiosities I've had about math for a long time (how polynomials work, compass-and-straightedge construction, finite fields, etc.) ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it, for various reasons: 1. Galois Theory is where things have to be. You also witness the kind of beauty you always look for in math. 2. You'll hone your reasoning skills. 3. It's well taught, the problem sets are very well organized: you learn a lot by thinking through the problems. ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend this course for any math major; knowing Galois theory is essential. As abstract as it is, it's also relevant and teaches a lot about polynomials and finite fields, which pop up everywhere. It's also really interesting - if you ever wanted to know why there is no \"Quintic Formula\", or why there is no way to square the circle, this class will answer those questions. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this class! Especially if you're a math major, but even if you're not and you made it through 350. Galois theory is beautiful and fascinating, and so worth learning. This class in particular taught me a lot about mathematical thinking and about proof-writing. It was a blast. "
