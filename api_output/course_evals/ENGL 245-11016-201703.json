            "\u00a0Thanks to Professor Gaige, I developed a vocabulary surrounding fiction and the creative writing process that has allowed me to better conceptualize my strengths and weaknesses as a writer. Her feedback was honest and constructive, and her suggestions allowed me to refine a very rough concept into a piece that I'm proud to have written. Her dedication to the craft and genuine interest in helping her students gave me a lot of insight on successful fiction writing, as well as mentoring. ",
            "\u00a0improved my writing skills and demystified the process of creative writing ",
            "\u00a0This class significantly helped me grow as a writer and reader and helped me find my own style. Workshopping was very beneficial for my own writing as i learned form my classmates and learned what critiques were common. I learned about different skills and common flaws of writing that made me conscious of my own. ",
            "\u00a0Learned the basics of what goes into a strong ficiton piece. Creative writing, lots of life lessons. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a number of narrative techniques for writing short stories, including various narration strategies, content time manipulations, and characterization choices. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write fiction and how to critique others' work. As a poetry writer, I didn't know how to transfer my poetic style to the composition of short stories, but Professor Gaige helped me through this process. I learned a lot about what it means to be a writer, and how writers grow from successes and from failures. The class atmosphere was wonderful, and I gained skills in how to read other students' work and give helpful critiques. ",
            "\u00a0I really was able to develop the skill of thinking deeply and seriously about fiction writing. I improved on giving other students feedback and learned how to edit and adapt my own writing and ideas. \r\n\r\nIt was an incredibly insightful course in terms of reading fiction for craft, and it allowed me to think about what I read and what I write with a new clarity. "

            "\u00a0draws a great group of students who I learned a lot from. we produce less work during the second half of the semester when we move into workshop, which is maybe not ideal. ",
            "\u00a0The students in the course were its primary strength because everyone was engaged and very dedicated to each other's work. The structure of the course was also nice as we started out writing shorter stories to help us develop skills before writing a long story. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: consistent writing\r\nWeaknesses: not many ways to teach someone how to be good at fiction... ",
            "\u00a0I thought this course's greatest strength was the workshops; they really helped us learn from each other, both in terms of direct criticism and from exposure to other types/ techniques of writing. I did think that we didn't really have quite enough time to discuss the short stories we were assigned to read, and because of that I felt that I didn't get that much out of that part of the course; I would say that future classes should either devote more time to analyzing fewer stories, or spend more time workshopping/ discussing the various fiction writing techniques we learned about. ",
            "\u00a0One of the greatest strengths of the course was the amazing class atmosphere it cultivated. I enjoyed reading my peers' work and bettering my own work through this process. Professor Gaige also was an amazing part of the course - she is so insightful and helpful. I always felt that I could go to her to discuss a story, and she gave wonderful insight into the potential and future of the story. Her kindness and passion, and the kindness and passion of the other students, truly rubbed off on me and my own work. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of the course is just the sheer amount of writing that we did. I loved the exercises we wrote and the two stories that we wrote and then edited. Feedback from Professor Gaige as well as meeting with her one on one was incredibly helpful, and being able to receive letters from my classmates was insightful. \r\n\r\nA weakness was the weeks we were supposed to be working on final edits. I just didn't feel the push and the direction I had felt earlier in the class. "

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course! Even if you've never written a single story, or if you've written just one in a different class and aren't sure if you should keep trying, Intro to Fiction with Professor Gaige will teach you where to go next and leave you with a very satisfying product (or multiple products!). While I didn't find myself blown away by any particular experience in the class, I was consistently excited to attend seminar discussions and chat with Professor Gaige about my work she always has great advice to give, and you will benefit greatly from it. ",
            "\u00a0yeah if you want to do it you should ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to people who enjoy writing and want to get better. It is a great course, but only for people interested in this. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to get into creative writing, need a writing credit, or just enjoy writing fiction, this is a great minimal-workload course that will help you build a portfolio ",
            "\u00a0Yes; you will definitely improve as a writer, and having your writing workshopped the way it is in this class is always very enlightening. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. You don't have to be a fiction writer to take this class (I wasn't!). I wrote poetry, and taking this class opened me up to the wondrous world of fiction and the characters we can inhabit in this world. Professor Gaige is a wonderful teacher and mentor, and the workshop format is very conducive to productive learning and progress in the realm of writing. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah. ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend this course to anyone who has an interest in reading or writing fiction. \r\nIt was very forgiving and fun class, it was creative in a refreshing way that also had direction. I thought it was a great introduction, and will really make you feel like a writer. "
