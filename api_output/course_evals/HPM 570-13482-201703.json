The professor sometimes just scrolled over the content and made a few comments and hoped for the students to solve the problems on their own without any informative instruction. \r\n\r\nThe overall pace for the class was very slow. It took the professor a lot of time to click on here and there, open this folder and that folder to find his files. However maybe it is also wrong to say that the class was overall very slow because the professor sometimes would skip the whole new things and move on. He hoped us to figure out the answers by ourselves and be ready for doing the assignments. Then, wait until next class with the hope of him explaining the answers explicitly, sometimes he would just scroll the answers over and say, \"here, look, the answers, this is what you should do to obtain this, this, that number.\" \r\n\r\nI don't think I get anything out of this class.

Those with more humanities were incredibly frustrated because of assumptions of background knowledge.\r\nConsider using a real textbook that progresses in a connected way. \r\nThe homework actually needs to be looked at by the TA's and specific errors pointed out.  Several of us made the same errors in our exams that we had in our homework (because we were told in class that there was more than one way of reaching the answer!)\r\nThe solutions posted need to have explanations rather than just the answers, especially as the instructor often did not finish the solution in class.\r\nReduce the generalized reading- or give a overview of what one is supposed to have noted. Just giving me a reading that is barely connected to the math is insufficient to make me \"see\" what you need me to.\r\nTA's and instructor need to work together. There were too many communications where the TA's felt that they were being asked to work more than they were supposed to and one did not feel one could understand the instructor. We were left to our own devices.\r\nThe TA's changed the meet-times far too often.\r\nIn addition to course meeting times, the TA scheduled hours should be posted with the course schedule. I was not able to attend TA hours because of a consistent conflict.\r\nExtra TA's should be allocated to new instructors, to make sure that there is bandwidth to compensate for unpredictable inefficiencies ",

It was the worst taught course I have taken in 12 years of schooling.\r\nThe materials used as explanatory texts left to be desired, as they were much more detailed and contained more difficult concepts than what was described in class. There were a lot of readings for this class, but very few were useful in the way of explaining concepts that we discussed in class in more detail in order to make them comprehensible.

It was made worse by disrespectful students who were openly rude when the instructor struggled to respond to questions.

I felt like I came out with less knowledge and more confusion than before, which is unfortunate because I was very much looking forward to taking this course. The topics meant to be taught in this class are ones that are useful and marketable, yet after an entire semester, I don't feel that I have learned any of them. \r\n\r\nEvery class was started with a Qualtrics \"quiz\" that asked different mind-teaser questions that were apparently relevant. However, we were told that the lessons taught by these questions were important that we needed to understand, but the class never got the questions right and the answers were never explained, even when people specifically asked for explanations. It left me feeling lost right when the class started.\r\n\r\nFor most of the class, the instructor used the projector to put up notebook paper with illegible handwriting, making it difficult to follow anything. When powerpoints were used, they were all over the place and difficult to follow because the instructor would switch between screens so often. Questions were not adequately answered by the professor, and often several students would step in and answer questions for other students. There was even an instance in which the instructor did not remember how to complete an example problem.\r\n\r\nThe exams were difficult to understand and could never actually be completed without hours of frustration for each question. For every exam, the questions had to be clarified by the instructor, leading to more confusion. I spent 20+ hours on each exam because I had to teach myself the concepts and somehow interpret the questions to turn in an answer. I have never been so frustrated by a class, let alone one that I actually wanted to learn the material in. Everything about it needs work. ",

It would be helpful to spend more time on examples in class to drive home the quantitative skills. ",

However, this class was so poorly taught by Paltiel's replacement that I feel like I was cheated out of my tuition money by taking it instead of something else this semester. It was not only a waste of time, it was an incredibly frustrating experience because the instructor did not listen and improve on our suggestions. Organization was lacking, answers were inconsistent, and the midterm was unlike any of the assignments. I felt like by the end I was just combing through Paltiel's old slides to teach myself how to do CEA for the homeworks/exams. ",
            "\u00a0I think a major strength of this course was the interesting nature of the topic and the problem sets and readings. Doing the problem sets was when I felt like I really started to understand the material and its practical applications, and the readings were a very helpful guide when completing them. On the other hand, I think a weakness of the class was the lectures, because they always felt a bit disorganized and I never felt like I learned 2 hours worth of material. I think this course could be drastically improved by making the lectures more streamlined and focused. ",

I stopped going after the first few weeks because I realized my time was better spent looking at previous class notes. Could have put more work into the course but grew frustrated early and decided to invest my time in other work.\r\nIt could be improved by providing feedback on homeworks.

I cannot believe this person was allowed to teach a Yale graduate course. \r\n\r\nHe makes the infuriating mistake of forgetting to include crucial information for take-home exams he created. This happened for both the midterms and the final. I spent hours on an impossible problem that he later emailed us about with new information DAYS after the exam was given.

Sanjeev lost control of the class very quickly, and for good reason. He did nothing to convince anyone he knew what he was talking about, and this occurred every single week. Homework and exams were painfully unclear, and the examples typically had no relevance to public health. Yale administration really needs to reconsider this man's position in the faculty. Sanjeev needs to feel embarrassed for such low quality work this semester, such a non-effort in instruction. I genuinely feel as thought I am owed an apology for wasting my time in this class.

However, he sometimes failed to find the notes and would conclude the whole talk with, \"sorry, this totally went off my mind.\" ",

The calculations were incorrect several times.\r\nWhen a substitute teacher is assigned a course, the main teachers' recordings of the same classes should be made available to the students so that they can get what they need to from the class.\r\nThe instructor should be evaluated for teaching skills by advisors 1-2 sessions into class.\r\nIt seemed as if the instructor was assigned to teach this class on the day of the class, which put him in the situation of teaching somewhat unfamiliar stuff and not having the comfort of rearranging material to match their own preferred flow process (even if knowledgeable about the material). \r\nI am sorry for this evaluation, as the instructor tried really hard. This was poorly structured by the institution to the extreme frustration of TA's, students and instructor. ",

            "\u00a0His strength is definitely his enthusiasm for this subject matter and the fact that he does care about teaching the students and improving the course as much as possible.\r\n\r\nThat being said, it seems the professor underestimated the amount of preparation it took to, for lack of a better word, prepare the course. \r\nHis major weakness is the inability to teach.\r\n\r\nHis explanations on the subject matter in class were too concise, because he spent most of the class explaining why a concept was important instead on explaining the concept itself. He also gave us few readings that clearly explained the concepts discussed in class.\r\nIn the future the class could be greatly improved if the professor actually takes time to explain the concepts themselves, give more practice problems with solutions separate from the homework, and select cost effectiveness texts which are easy to read and to the point rather than specialty texts (where out of 20 pages only 2 are pertinent, there is no reason why I should have to read 20 pages of a phd level thesis for an introductory course). Frankly , unless I specialize in that topic, it will confuse me even more.\r\n\r\nThroughout the class there were several times when he tried to explain a homework assignment involving excel and he himself was confused as to what he was explaining. \r\n\r\nThe class pre-requisites state that one does not need to know economics to take this class, but in at least one class the professor used economics formulas to teach without explaining them well enough.\r\n\r\nThe presentations for the class were powerpoint presentations from previous years, and for the rest of the classes he professor used a projector  for showing hand-written problem solutions. I would suggest making and using powerpoint presentations, even if this more time consuming to prepare given that the professor does have quite poor handwriting so the notes were very hard to read.\r\n\r\nHis exams were confusing, poorly worded, and filled with errors of spelling. For the second test, no one in the class got an answer to an essay question right to the disappointment of the professor. IF however, no one out of 100 students or so gets an answer right, it is likely because the question is worded poorly which illustrates my point above.\r\n\r\nAll in all, this was one of the worst courses I have taken.\r\nThis is regrettable because I do feel that the professor cared, but he does need to significantly improve the way he teaches the class.

Fairly simple concepts were explained in a very convoluted manner, and requests for clarification often led to even more confusion. The methods behind concrete skills in cost effective analysis were never well explained, and students often had to go home to teach themselves the material from the past professor's powerpoints, rely too heavily on the TFs, or resort to the internet to learn the content. At the beginning of each class, the instructor began lecture by insulting students, saying that the majority of us do not understand basic economic and cost effective concepts, yet failed to teach us any of those concepts. He spent much of the lecture going off on tangents. It was frustrating that the homeworks and the exams hardly covered what was \"taught\" in class: the homeworks and exams tested us on very concrete skills, but we were never taught those concepts properly in class. The instructor would be a great motivational speaker but not an instructor for a class where students are trying to learn concrete skills. ",

",

            "\u00a0Professor Kumar got more comfortable with teaching throughout the courses, but I generally had difficulty learning from his teaching style. I think it may have helped if there was a clearer lecture format: technical material we should learn, an option to apply those skills, and repeat. Instead, I felt as if there were too many extraneous comments that didn't contribute much to our understanding of the topics. Overall, CEA is a difficult course to teach, and he has great potential for improvement throughout his academic career. ",

He does not seem able to tell when his students are following his instruction or when we are lost, nor does he seem able to convey which parts of his discussion are core and which are simply asides. It was impossible to determine the arc of the course or precisely what he was aiming to impart from week to week. Any learning was mainly self-taught by reading some of the homework.  Several students simply stopped showing up.  A shame, because the content is very interesting. ",

People would pay attention more if you started with the solutions to the last homework, rather than opening with a questionnaire. I felt that toward the end of the course you were getting better at explaining these concepts, but that doesn't erase the building blocks were missing. ",

We get a lot of questions about aspects of the review and how he got there, but his response doesn't really answer our questions. a lot of us end up just giving up making him understand our question or understanding his answer. \r\nThe lecture is also not very effective in teaching us anything. it's unfortunate because you practically have to learn from the readings but the readings aren't really comprehensive. As a student without any econ background, you're always left feeling like you don't know enough to answer the question in full. ",
            "\u00a0The professor definitely knew the material, but the course was designed for a different teaching style. The professor would benefit from teaching a more theory oriented course than the emphasis on the quantitative. I would definitely encourage him to do so as his knowledge of the field was incredible.
