I think that the word limit for these essays made it impossible to fulfill all of their requirements (especially in the cultural exploration part). I also think that though topic of cultural analysis was very interesting and appropriate, the essay had unrealistic expectations from students (e.g \"The essay should be an in-depth cultural analysis and comparison\").
