            "\u00a0So many skills about engineering, very few about actual music. Essentially a physics and engineering class. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a much more detailed understanding of acoustics in musical instruments as well as of principles behind electronic instruments. I also got a lot of hands on experience with tools in the CEID and really got to put my learning into practice. ",
            "\u00a0The principles of acoustic and digital instruments production and design, and starting and completing a project!! ",
            "\u00a0I learned an incredible amount about how instruments work and how that translates into what we hear in digital music. I also gained many skills while constructing different types of instruments. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about the basics of musical instruments from a physics & engineering, as well as musical, standpoint. Learned how to use CEID resources & shop tools. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the iterative design process necessary in engineering projects ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the physics of sound and about various aspects of music tech. I also learned some engineering skills--for me this hands-on aspect was the most valuable and enjoyable part. In my case it was more a working knowledge that I got and nothing very deep or conceptual although I'm sure this depends on the person. Additionally the course seems to attract many creative/innovator types of people. It's a treat working with them and seeing their projects, so there's also insight to be developed that way. "

            "\u00a0You learn a LOT about engineering and the process of constructing anything that requires intense precision. That being said, the workload is insane, and I often felt overwhelmed by this course. ",
            "\u00a0The courses final project is definitely the strength and defining feature of the course! Its so much fun to develop an instrument from start to finish, and the professors are there for you the whole way. However, I found the problem sets much less interesting and often too repetitive or busy work feeling. Also, the labs sometimes felt disorganized which was annoying. ",
            "\u00a0The course is fantastic!! ",
            "\u00a0I wished the labs were slightly more involved - part of my motivation in taking the course was to build things so I wanted to construct more instruments. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: incredibly interesting, final project is a lot of work but very fun. Weaknesses: none. ",
            "\u00a0The topic and final project are fun but a little intense. The first half of class was a little dry but we learned many important concepts that we used later ",
            "\u00a0I thought that the open-ended nature of the final project was great. It worked especially well since the the professors were very available to help and talk - Larry especially obviously invested a great deal of time in teaching the course in the last few weeks. I felt that the structure was very conducive to doing ambitious work as a student and I might've learned more from this project than almost any other single class at Yale.\r\n\r\nMy one criticism of the course would be that the lectures sometimes felt a little disorganized, especially from class to class - it sort of seemed like we received some basic physics background (which was invariably useful) along with a smorgasbord of other topics in little depth; while I recognize that the class is helped by a broad exposure to topics, since the final project is expected to embody some creativity, the organization seemed insufficient. ",
            "\u00a0For a group with a lot of range in terms of ability/previous exposure, I think the instructors did a good job of targeting the average, then offering both extra help (\"make an appointment if you don't understand the homework\") and extra learning opportunities (\"stay after class if you want to see a more rigorous proof\"). Lectures tend not to be a highlight for this course (the final project is). Labs were fun but I dreaded them because I could never keep up and my lab partner ended up doing the whole thing. The field trips were fun. The instructors are clearly knowledgeable about their respective fields and they make a great team. Konrad is very easygoing, approachable so you feel you can ask him about anything. He's incredibly patient and will answer any/all questions in the same very thoughtfully detailed way. Larry is extremely committed to making himself available for project guidance--you get the feeling he cares a lot--and puts in truly insane hours during the last few weeks, I've never seen anything like it. Shai, the TF, is great with both theoretical and hands-on help and is particularly good at clear explanations. "

            "\u00a0If they're willing to put in a lot of work, absolutely. But this class is very capable of taking over your life, so it's important to be careful. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would overall! However I would only recommend it to students who already have a strong background in music, physics, and engineering. Its a lot of work and its much more enjoyable to start from a solid baseline and be able to spend your energy more on the project part. ",
            "\u00a0I ABSOLUTELY reccomend this class to anyone interested! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, whether or not you have a music background. A great class if you want to get hands-on engineering experience in the CEID. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely. This was my favorite class. I would just be aware that it is a lot of work, and especially if you don't have a decently strong background (prerequisites are a bit misleading). I didn't and it was exhausting just trying to keep up. But my god was it worth it. It is beyond satisfying when something finally works or makes sense or what have you. The final project where you make your own instrument is tons of fun and super rewarding, all the more so if you can afford to get a little monomaniacal about it. "
