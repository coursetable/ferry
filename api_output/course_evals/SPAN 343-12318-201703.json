            "\u00a0I feel like I got a very good survey of contemporary Latin American writing, as well as humor theory (especially at the beginning, the class had a surprising amount about the theory of what humor is). Overall, very good class, and I learned a lot. ",
            "\u00a0I am now better at deciphering humor in Spanish texts. ",
            "\u00a0Spanish! Literature! Humor! ",
            "\u00a0I learned about humor in Spanish literature. I first learned about the philosophy behind humor, and got to see the philosophy in action. I was able to identify and discuss humor that was anything from in-your-face to very subtle. I saw how humor was used to push boundaries of literature of the day, and distort and mock commonly perspectives to prove a point or open the eyes of the reader. I also vastly improved my close reading skills in Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0We learned about the use of humor in Latin American literature ",
            "\u00a0I developed a significant working knowledge of various theories of humor and an understanding of how they apply to literature in general. I gained an ability to recognize techniques employed to create a humorous effect in prose. I also improved my analytical ability in Spanish, and learned a lot about various Spanish-American authors and their literary and historical influences. ",
            "\u00a0This course was great for learning about a variety of Spanish-speaking authors, the ways humor appears in text written in Spanish, and writing both close reading essays and longer research papers. ",
            "\u00a0This course exposed me to a lot of great literature and perspectives on humor I had never considered before. ",
            "\u00a0I gained insight into the many theories of humor and leaned how to analyze humoristic pieces of writing. ",
            "\u00a0A lot about contemp Spanish literature (and its elements) and backgrounds on the authors. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think critically and to write better in spanish. "

            "\u00a0Professor Gonzalez is a great teacher, and he alone is the main strength I think. A semi-lecture class like this lives or dies by its professor, and he absolutely makes it worthwhile. A weakness might be that I would have preferred more of an overarching narrative to the class, but I still loved everything we read. Honestly that's just being picky. ",
            "\u00a0This course was taught by an incredible professor, but the material that the course covered did not always seem to have elements of humor. The course could be improved by reconsidering the presence of humor in each of the texts that we read, and perhaps providing an outline for students to track the key elements of humor throughout the semester. Also, I would have preferred three (or four) papers over two papers and three pop quizzes. The pop quizzes seemed to test the wrong things (i.e. content knowledge over appreciation of humor). ",
            "\u00a0It is a very good class. I don't really see the need for any kind of major change in terms of the class itself. I feel as if the readings have been perfected already over the years and are extremely engaging. Each brought a different exciting perspective. ",
            "\u00a0Although this course was advertised as a seminar, most of the time it was a lecture with very low participation from the class. I feel that I did not improve my speaking abilities at all in this course, but I did improve my reading and writing greatly. There is a relatively low workload, except for the 15-20 page final paper. ",
            "\u00a0This course was awesome. I did think that we sometimes did not discuss the literature piece that had most recently been assigned because of overlap conversation from the class prior, which made it hard to refocus at the beginning of class. However, Anibal and Joserra did a great job of engaging students and guiding us through. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked this class so I don't think there are any explicit weaknesses; the strengths are that it is well organized and we cover a wide range of work ",
            "\u00a0The theoretical and literary readings for the class were all interesting and enjoyable. The emphasis on short stories made close reading for humorous techniques both possible and effective. Lectures were always interesting, and provided a lot of insight into the historical and humorous meaning of the works we studied. However, the lecture style of the course was not conducive to much student discussion and input; it was often difficult to get a word in, and not many opportunities to do so were given. ",
            "\u00a0This course was great for its breadth of authors and texts, but there was no overarching narrative. I felt like the entire course hinged on what we read the first two weeks of class. I wasn't really sure what to make of many of the texts other than stating that it was funny. What about the effect on authors' lives on their sense of humor? Or the way that certain literary movements affected the structure of humor? I feel like we dealt a little too closely with just the texts to be able to bring meaning to them. ",
            "\u00a0The material of this course was very interesting and the readings were enjoyable. The one weakness of the course was that the discussions felt very one sided. The professor did most of the talking while students, for the most part, just listened. However, this may have had more to do with the people in the class and their willingness to speak up. ",
            "\u00a0Very interesting reading material, and I loved the discussion based class! "

            "\u00a0I really liked this course and would recommend to another student. They would have to be comfortable writing in Spanish though. The final paper is 15-20 pages, which is longer than any previous english lit papers I've had to write at Yale (those are usually 10-12 or 10-15). ",
            "\u00a0Maybe. This course is what you make out of it. I wish I had worked harder, but at the same time it was not often necessary to work hard to get a good grade. ",
            "\u00a0Would definitely definitely recommend this to another student! It was an amazing class, with an astonishingly brilliant professor who cracks a lot of jokes while keeping things intellectual as well. You'll talk a lot about the literature in terms of the politics happening around the time as well as discuss themes of morality, life, and leaving. ",
            "\u00a0I 10/10 recommend this course, or any other taught by Anibal. This course was especially fun because there really were moments in which the whole class would burst out laughing. The reading level is not overly demanding but does require some planning ahead. The discussion is what you make of it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's good if you want to keep up with your spanish ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you are looking to read a variety of interesting, funny texts written in Spanish, or if you want to improve your essay writing skills. But if you are looking to improve your day-to-day speaking skills, I would look for another class. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely recommend! The main difficulty is just keeping up with the readings, so be sure to put aside plenty of time for that. Go to office hours! ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! Easy Span class! ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend this course because it is very interesting to explore humor with such emphasis. "
