I remember walking into the British Museum and seeing some Chinese bronzes during Spring Break and being able to distinguish from what time period they were from. ",

            "\u00a0This class was pretty cool in the sense that we not only got to read about the objects, but we also got to see some of them at the YUAG. I liked it when Dr. Niu would give a brief overview of the history of a time-period at the beginning of class. It would be nice if she did that more. "
