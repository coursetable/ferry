            "\u00a0Professor Richards taught me a lot about how to read and understand theory and how to apply it to a text. This is not often taught in Yale English classes (which mostly focus on close reading). ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about fiction. As someone who isn't an English major, but who is deeply interested in literature and writing, it was really cool getting into books in the way an English major or person focusing on literary analysis would. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Richards was really good at making sure we had the skills we needed to get through a junior seminar in English.  We talked a lot about the theoretical texts we read, and when they were difficult to digest, she not only explained them but provided us with reading strategies to use in the future.  I know a lot more about the YA novel, and now I can't even watch The Golden Compass as a joke with my friends without thinking about the Chosen Child. ",
            "\u00a0I dont think Ive shut up about Foucault since we read him the fourth week of the semester because I cant believe I lived my life without knowing him or his work before this class. Professor Richards emphasizes from day one that the course centers around biopolitics; consequently, this class has given me an excuse (and the theoretical framework) to and through which I can analyze not only literature, but the world at large. I also learned how to read and evaluate theory, which isnt something Ive been very good at doing in the past (in fact, very few of my classes have had us engage with theory the way Professor Richards incorporated the theoretical material in the class), which made me feel as if the reading I was doing each week could be relevant and applicable to understanding the current political climate. Finally, not only did I improve my close-reading/writing skills, but Professor Richards taught us how to fully use the library resources/library resource search engines we have available at school, which was unbelievably useful information to learn. ",
            "\u00a0I was able to learn a lot about the experience of others through both the wide variety of books that we read and discussed, and the amazing people in the class. I learned how to better critique, analyze, and appreciate books better. I learned to take part in strong discussion whereas I normally wouldn't because of my classmates, my professor, and the subject matter that was being taught. ",
            "\u00a0I've never taken an English class before, so for me our work on close reading and comparative literature theory were entirely new skills. ",
            "\u00a0Textual analysis within modern texts and cultural issues ",
            "\u00a0I learned about biopolitics and the processes of population management from multiple perspectives by taking this course. I also learned how to engage meaningfully with theoretical academic work, and that surprising connections can be made between seemingly disparate material (such as a young adult literature and Foucault, for example). Finally, this course taught me how to really conduct academic research. The tips and tricks Professor Richards taught us for navigating Yale's resources were much more helpful than the senior library session required by the English major. "

            "\u00a0As I mentioned before, the theory was really helpful! But it was also a bit much, especially in the beginning when I hadn't read any theory before. I think I would recommend reading a theoretical text every other week instead of every week--that way we would have more time to go over them and apply them to different texts. ",
            "\u00a0Some of the theory was way above our comprehension level.  It was miserable to get through some of it, and I didn't get as much out of those readings as I did out of the more decipherable ones.  But other than that, I loved this class.  I loved all the readings (okay maybe not We Want Everything, but that's okay), and I always enjoyed class discussion.  Richards is a brilliant seminar leader, and discussions were always efficient and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the class are entirely in the syllabus Professor Richards creates, her expertise knowledge of the material, and her facilitation of the class itself. I loved the balance of weekly page-turners and theory, and Professor Richards would always ask the best questions to launch us into important, engaging, and thought-provoking discussions. She also was perceptive enough to know when we were struggling with either a theoretical concept or text, and would give us mini-lectures so that we could truly ground our analytic discussions in the theory we had read for the week. The only downside of the class is that because we are reading books that are supposed to provoke visceral reactions, sometimes class discussion would become focused around those reactions (past the go-arounds Professor Richards would do where she would purposefully ask us for such reactions to the texts), and could easily become tangential. While Professor Richards would get us back on track, and while these reactions were helpful in our understanding of, say, fan culture and fan fiction, they could sometimes get a bit frustrating. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the class were that the discussions were always lively and interesting. The class kind of felt like a weekend bookclub, like we would all be there discussing the books with each other anyways. The environment was really supportive and I felt really comfortable contributing my thoughts. The professor is also a great strength of the course because of her ability to lead and steer discussion. She also deserves more credit for the books that she choose and the order she had us read them. \r\n\r\nThe only weakness about the course was that sometimes the book discussion would go on a little long and it overtook the time we should have been discussing and understanding the theory texts. Sometimes I left class still not understanding what was going on in the theory side of class. Maybe an out-of-class section could be encouraged for those that want to examine the theory readings in more detail? ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were getting to read fun (but also sometimes disturbing) books like those I enjoyed in my adolescence, while taking them seriously as true literature. Often we do not get classes that celebrate popular fiction as literature in this department, so this was a treat. Another strength was that this course taught me how to really understand and utilize the arguments of theoretical papers, another skill which I feel is largely not taught in the English department. Professor Richards also worked very hard to make the classroom be a safe, fun, and open space for everyone, and the class had sort of a \"family feel\" by the end of it. \r\nThis class was amazing and perhaps the only way it could be improved was to leave a little more time for discussing the theoretical readings. Often we got so excited talking about the books that we ran out of time at the end. But that is really a small point and I think most people still felt like we didn't have enough time to talk about the books as is. This class might do better as a twice-a-week seminar, so we could have more discussion time. ",
            "\u00a0This class has engaging subject matter and Prof. Richards is always a delight. But because we read a book a week, in addition to some theory, it often felt like there wasn't enough time to engage deeply with any of the really specific issues in the text. Discussion, especially with such a large group, bounced around and jabbed at moments at a surface level. "

            "\u00a0Professor Richards is great! She will expose you to lots of cool YA lit, especially books you probably haven't heard of, even if you do read YA! The theory is kind of a lot, especially at first, but helpful in the long run! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Aside from the fact that novels you'll read are pretty good, the actual analytical component you learn becomes extremely valuable for a bunch of other classes you'll take. ",
            "\u00a0If you're an English major looking for a junior seminar, you absolutely MUST take this class.  If you're anyone else, you should also take this class.  The workload is not bad because you're reading one YA novel per week, which often feels like reading for pleasure.  The theoretical texts we read open up the novels in such interesting ways, and Richards is a patient, brilliant seminar leader.  She gives excellent feedback on papers, and I'm leaving this class better equipt to handle dense theoretical material than I was when I came in.  tl;dr TAKE THE CLASS ",
            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY YES. I cannot recommend this course enough. You will LOVE the readings (both the YA-page-turners and the relevant/social-justice-minded/amazing theory), and want to complete them every week. Whats more, you will love class. A friend of mine from the class described it as the one class she was still looking forward to going to, after the excitement of shopping period died down. I totally agreeand would add that even when I was mired in midterms, or was approaching the end of the semester, I would still excitedly rush to this class every week. Professor Richards absolutely fantastic, and creates a class environment conducive to some of the best discussions Ive had during my time at school. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to any student because the topics discussed like, racism, institutional oppression, queerness, innocence, sexuality, and feminism, are all very important and should be engaged with by everyone. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely recommended! This has hands down been one of my favorite classes at Yale. I looked forward to going to seminar every week to discuss the always enjoyable readings and listening to professor Richards and my classmates intently and enthusiastically participate. A wonderful class overall that anyone who enjoys or appreciates YA fiction should definitely take. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. If you are willing to actually do the readings, you will get so much out of this course. You will also thoroughly enjoy the company of your fellow classmates, since anyone who takes this class is automatically an amazing human being. Professor Richards is a delight and an excellent teacher. Even though the theoretical readings can be difficult sometimes, she does a really good job of taking you through them piece by piece. This course taught me that you do not have to be a genius to understand even highly jargoned academic work, contrary to popular belief. You'll also learn a lot about how to write a research paper.\r\nBut more than anything, take this class for the reading list! The books Prof picks are not the most popular YA books that everyone has read, but you will quickly add them to your list of favorites. This is an amazing class and I think everyone should take it. "
