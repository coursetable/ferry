            "\u00a0Fabulous. Going to be super successful one day.\r\nSpeaking a little slower would help!\r\nBeing a little clearer about expectations for grading our papers might have been nice. ",
            "\u00a0Sarah is very personable and always had time to meet. If I e-mailed her or asked her questions after class, she followed up with above-and-beyond responses, often attaching helpful links and/or articles.\r\n\r\nIt's hard to provide comments regarding how Sarah's teaching might be improved, because our theological aesthetics class was ... different than any other course I've taken. There was SO much material, and we didn't spend enough time on any thinker (except, perhaps, Kant) to really get a good feel for what they were trying to do. So, I always left section feeling like we needed more time to even just cover the basics - I'm not sure Sarah could've done anything to change that. ",
            "\u00a0Very smart, but grades harder than my professors who teach seminars. ",
            "\u00a0Sarah Zager was an excellent TF. During section she brought in different material that shed light on class readings, facilitated discussion well, and gave terrific lectures. Outside of class, she was generous with her time and pleasant to be around. ",
            "\u00a0Sarah has the gift of teaching and was passionate about the material of the course. There were times I would go into section thinking that it was going to be worthless because I hadn't understood the text and she would manage to make discussion lively and clarifying. I appreciated her use of the white board, which may sound silly but many professors and TF's I've had at YDS don't manipulate that readily available visual resource. It was helpful in this context for diagramming thought (in Kant, for example) and defining specific terms. She made good use of handouts and bringing in excess materials (like art and literature) to help in our grasping of the material.\r\n\r\nSarah was almost always attentive to the ways in which material could be confusing to us, but even so sometimes her presentations in section were really fast-paced. That is really my only critique. ",
            "\u00a0Sarah is very knowledgeable about the thinkers we covered. I think that by the end of the semester, our discussion group was going very well. I really enjoyed working in pairs as opposed to groups. I found this very helpful and we had some great interaction and discussion with the texts. She is also funny and personable and makes her lectures interesting and engaging.\r\n\r\nI wish that she had been more clear on what she expected in the papers prior to the due date. It might have helped to take some time in the discussion group to cover what she wanted in depth. I also think that sometimes she was overly-critical of a thinker in class and we might have bypassed what the thinker was trying to say in particular places because of this. ",
            "\u00a0It was clear that Sarah was invested in this course, and knew a great deal about the figures we discussed.  She also made time for students.  She did a good job. ",
            "\u00a0Sarah was really great. So invested, so eager, so smart, so hardworking. ",
            "\u00a0Terrific TF. Brings enthusiasm and zeal to the discussions, and her lectures (on Hegel and Heidegger) were very good. Also very resourceful when it comes to recommending secondary sources and has a helpful method of commenting on papers. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated how Sarah made herself available for her students; moreover, the thought, time, and energy she spent on making discussions fruitful was deeply appreciated. However, something that could've been improved from a strict pedagogical standpoint was to maybe slow down a bit while speaking, and to keep discussion material directly related to things discussed in class. Sometimes I had a hard time understanding how discussions related to the week's lectures. Also, it would've been helpful to have discussion sections more discussion based than lecture based so that students can verbally process the material with one another, and ask questions concerning the lectures. ",
            "\u00a0Gave great lectures! Very knowledgable of material. Kind, funny, and available to help. \r\n\r\nSometimes I needed more direction with the information given, and maybe more big picture/over arching relationship between the philosophers would have been helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Sarah Zager grew on me, and I am very thankful that she was our TA. At first, I was rather intimidated by her obvious passion for Philosophy, which very much says more about me than her really. Her feedback on papers was always helpful, as were her explanations in seminar. She was very good at managing students of different levels of philosophical training, and, like Prof. Hare, she brought in beautiful pieces of art for us to consider. I think Sarah will make a wonderful professor one day. ",
            "\u00a0Sarah is generous with both her time and knowledge - going out of her way to make suggestions that she thought would be helpful. She is inspiring in her tenacity - she would not give up until the students would understand the very complicated concepts some were encountering for the first time. Needless to say - she is also very patient. All good traits for a philosophy professor. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Hare could not have picked a better teaching fellow. Sarah was absolutely wonderful. Her understanding of the material was extensive and spot-on, and her ability to teach was far better than even many tenured professors at YDS. I fully recommend Sarah as a TA for other classes at YDS. Her influence made the material that Dr. Hare taught pop. The course would not have been nearly as impactful had Sarah not clarified and taught us so well. ",
            "\u00a0Sarah Zager is wonderful. She is a gifted speaker (much like Prof. Hare, she relays information in a clear and truthful manner). Outside of section/class, Sarah engages with you wherever you are at on the topic at hand. Her ability to steer clear of pretentiousness and judgment makes for an authentic and productive conversation. \r\n\r\nIn class, she lectured unexpectedly--and well--and in section, she always made an effort to elucidate concepts for people less acquainted with the discipline of philosophy. She also offered clear and generous feedback on our paper. We were so lucky to have her! I think she will make for a wonderful professor. ",
            "\u00a0Sarah was an exceptional instructor. She is smart, approachable, and made our learning very enjoyable. I highly recommend her for future teaching positions. ",
            "\u00a0Sarah was always prepared for section, and had thoughtful activities planned. Sarah was also available for office hours. ",
            "\u00a0So clear, so knowledgeable, very helpful. Sections were lively and clarifying, and you have a talent for lecturing as well! Many thanks for comments on the paper! Very helpful, and your perspective on the course material was invaluable for me, helped me consider the implications of philosophical concepts for different religions and people groups. Thank you so much! ",
            "\u00a0Sarah was an excellent Teaching Fellow  every week we flew through very dense philosophical texts, each with their own systems of terminology and methodology. She did a fantastic job clarifying complicated concepts and elucidating important points that were previously unnoticed. Never a moment in section was wasted, I was very grateful for how much material Sarah could get us through in just 50 minutes. The only facet of section that didn't seem to be always productive were the times we split off into partners/small groups before reconvening as a whole  I personally found that hashing it out together as a class to be the most helpful.
