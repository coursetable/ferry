The slides and notes are updated regularly, which is convenient since there is no need to purchase expensive textbooks. The professor has also proved to be available to answer questions not only at office hours, but also at the end of class. Thanks to the supporting material posted on Canvas, I was able to follow what was going on without too many problems. \r\nThat being said, I am afraid I have to be critical of Professor Saez for how she handled class time and interactions with students in general. The fact that the midterm was designed poorly and led to issues with curving and grading is not so serious in and of itself. People make mistakes. Yet, what was problematic and frankly disconcerting was how the professor dealt with the consequences of her original mistake. Multiple emails were sent out, each  \r\nmaking the curve more lenient in an attempt to make up for the first mistake in writing the exam. Of course, some students started complaining that other people's grades were being bumped up, which in turn affected their chances of being in the A range at the end of the semester. While the professor was clearly trying to be accommodating and wanted to help students after acknowledging her error, she ended up making matters worse, to the point that we were eventually advised by one of the TAs not to contact the professor with questions about midterm grading because she was too stressed to respond. I realize she might have found herself in a tough spot, and that she may not have been used to it. Unfortunately, if you choose to teach at Yale you have to know when to be firm and not be a pushover. ",

            "\u00a0The examples we studied in class were very applicable to real life, which was a great strength. Another strength were the comprehensive notes the professor published in addition to the lecture notes. This course could be improved by having psets graded more routinely, making the ungraded psets more similar to the graded psets (to give students more to practice), and by showing more work and thinking behind the answers in the slides and notes.

There should be more communication between the professor and TAs because it was pretty clear sometimes that TAs did not know what the professor expected and so would say things that contradicted what the professor said. ",
            "\u00a0The class needs more practice problems. Only 4 problem sets are graded (which is nice, until the midterm and final exam roll around). Also, it doesn't feel that comprehensive - it just teaches you how to solve a set of specific (and mostly theoretical) games. ",
            "\u00a0Appreciate that the slides and notes are uploaded online and that the sections are used to review psets. Could be improved by more evenly spreading out the graded psets, and more detailed solutions that show work for pset and exam solutions posted online. ",

Although the key concepts for each lecture were relatively few and simple, Prof. Sez would speak very rapidly and progress through slides so quickly that it was hard to absorb the material being presented. It seemed quite often that the TFs hadn't been briefed on the course materials (e.g. giving misleading information on the midterm, not being able to adequately respond to questions about the problem sets). Further, as someone who learns best by active practice, the lack of practice problems (for both the midterm and the final) made it very difficult for me to prepare myself for a class in which exams account for 70% of the grade.

Often times when I asked clarifying questions, I was given unclear answers or \"I don't know.\" Lecture notes were not posted before the lectures, making keeping up with the fast pace of class impossibly difficult. The tests were created such that getting one question wrong could significantly dip your grade. Also, little to no feedback was provided on graded p-sets, so I found it difficult to learn from my mistakes and improve in the course. ",

The easier material was essential to build a foundation, however I believe that the material before the midterm could have been condensed. ",

            "\u00a0Professor is horrible; the other professor was much better. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The material is fascinating, and the workload is really manageable. I did not know that Game Theory could be so in-depth, but I feel as though I really do know how strategic players would act in a myriad of situations. The last third of the class was my favorite, because we learned about Bayesian Nash Equilibrium and how beliefs play into shaping strategies, and also evolutionary game theory, which I was able to apply to my psychology classes when asking the question of how innate traits came to be. Workload-wise, there are only four graded p-sets (out of 12 total), and if you work in a group and go to office hours, they're not too bad. Lastly, I thought that the organization of lectures was pretty good, and I was engaged in most classes. I definitely know that some hold the opposite opinion, but I really think its a matter of concentrating during class and not giving up when you don't understand one thing. That, and being able to understand Maria's accent. \r\nWeaknesses: This is probably going to get redundant, but the midterm was a little janky for lack of a better term in that one question was weighted way too much and ended up being sort of a trick. However, I was most disappointed not by the test itself but by Maria's response--she did try to fix the issue, but when her fix proved to be flawed, she couldn't handle the critique and ended up just avoiding talking about the midterm. The TAs were okay for the most part, but if you were really lost and had big conceptual questions rather than problem-specific ones, they often didn't quite know how to answer. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures could be rather dry, and often the Professor seemed to have trouble understanding what issues and topics confused the students. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very interesting but the format of the lecture made the material difficult to understand. I would have liked for every lecture to have begun with an overview of the topic and how it fit into/built upon the previous topics. Often I found myself lost halfway through the lecture, not knowing exactly what we were doing. ",
            "\u00a0Looking back on the course, I do feel like I learned a lot about game theory. But this class was often frustrating: lectures were sometimes difficult to follow, I frequently didn't feel well-prepared to complete problem sets, and the content and grading of the midterm was somewhat unfair. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures could be improved greatly. The Lecture Slides themselves were fine. However, the professor could've been better at lecturing. Individually in office hours she was great. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Pretty good workload, Maria's lecture slides and lecture notes were a lifesaver. Maria is also incredibly kind and helpful, choosing to sit with you one-on-one for more than an hour at a time just to help you through some material. She really just wants you to learn and understand the material, as game theory is her passion. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There was a bit of a debacle with the grading of the midterm, so a lot of people (including the prof) were stressed out about these logistical things. Would recommend a clearer grading system from the get-go. Also, I understand the desire for ensure student attendance, but it'd be helpful to get ahold of the lecture slides ahead of time so that we could take notes on them if we so choose, as she goes through the slides pretty quickly in class. I think doing this wouldn't harm attendance, since it's still necessary to attend class to understand the fullness of the material. ",
            "\u00a0The TAs and section are very helpful. I did not feel that the way we learned in class always translated to answering the problem sets. We spent a significant amount of time on the theoretical part behind the material, but not enough of real practical examples done in class. There should be a better balance. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Maria Saez Marti was the strength of this class. She is whole-heartedly passionate about what she does. She loves to teach. She loves game theory. I definitely think her passion reflected in my performance in and enjoyment of the class. I think the range of content is just perfect. The first half of the semester is focused on building your tools and vocabulary, and the second half jumps into more complex games that reflect real life more closely and demand more logical complexity. I love this course. No weaknesses to report! ",
            "\u00a0The course has excellent material and the formats in which material provided to students were excellent, from the slides Professor Saez shows in class to the detailed written notes she presents on Canvas. The course would be improved if there was a change in the way lectures were ran. Professor Saez often goes too fast and provides little explanation of new material the first time around. This meant that Professor Saez had to take a lot of lecture time revisiting material she had originally thought was understood by students. ",
            "\u00a0Strenghts: material\r\nWeakness: Lecture Notes weren't precise and lectures were inefficient at times. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of the course is how interesting the material is. The problem sets were also well-designed and manageable. However, I thought lectures were rather confusing, and also did not do a great job of connecting the material to applications in the real world (they were too focused on the mathematical computations-- which are necessary, but not sufficient, in really understanding game theory). The exams felt rather poorly designed, too, and not a good test of how well one understood the material; getting entire questions right hinged on one noticing small details or tricks to the problem.

            "\u00a0Yes. It helps you become a more informed decision maker. ",
            "\u00a0Good Econ elective, but by no means an easy class. If you've taken intermediate econ and math 120, this course goes pretty smoothly, but with less exposure to the topics and more complex math (ie. state dynamics), it takes more time to learn and can be tricky. TA's and office hours are really helpful with the homeworks. Midterm exam was relatively easy (even though there was a debacle with one of the questions), and the final was very difficult. ",
            "\u00a0No. But the subject matter is fun so take it if it's not with Maria ",
            "\u00a0Potentially ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the topic is very interesting and has many applications. ",
            "\u00a0I might consider Marina's course due to her increased engagement in class. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. It was incredibly interesting and will get you to think in new ways. Maria was great, as were the TFs. The workload wasn't overbearing (4 graded PSETS and more ungraded ones), but it was enough to help students learn the material. ",
            "\u00a0Its interesting, but frustrating in terms of grading ",
            "\u00a0If you need it or are interested ",
            "\u00a0No if the professor is the same. Yes because material is interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I would, especially if Marina comes back to teach it (we had two guest lectures from her, and they were great. She taught it with Maria Saez last year I think). This course is not perfect, but in terms of Econ classes, I really did enjoy learning all the material, and even the difficult p-sets were more fun to figure out because, well, you're solving games! \r\nDisclaimer: I took this class with some friends, which I think was a tremendous help/made the class a lot more enjoyable. Talking through psets and confusing material is crucial to success. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it, but it would be on the condition that you were interested in Game Theory to begin with. Those looking for a good econ elective or serious intellectual challenge would be better served elsewhere. ",
            "\u00a0I would reccomend this course, without the same teacher and TA. ",
            "\u00a0I genuinely liked the content of this course, and I wish I could recommend it. But unless considerable changes are made to how the course is taught, I do not recommend this course. Lectures were sometimes difficult to follow, the weekly problem sets vary wildly in difficulty, and I was frequently frustrated by how the course was taught. ",
            "\u00a0I would only for the material. Again the Lectures were rough ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to other students, with caution. I think if you are prepared to attend every lecture and listen raptly to what the professor is saying, as well as be on top of your problem sets (aka doing all of them, even the ungraded ones - only 4 are graded) then you will do well. I went into this class thinking it was going to be a gut and it definitely wasn't!!!! Even though she provides a good amount of supplementary material, it's easy to doze off in class or choose to skip as a result, and if you do so then you miss out on a lot of important material and walkthroughs available only in class. You also really have to pay attention because English is not the native language of the professor or the TAs, and while that's not their fault, it does make communication with each other (e.g. wording on exams, understanding the prof. from the back of the lecture hall) a bit harder. Also, game theory definitely gets more math-y/econ-y in the second half, so keep that in mind. All that being said, Professor Saez is incredibly kind and patient and will work with you through whatever (content) questions you may have. She does want you to succeed! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend having some knowledge of econ prior to taking this course. The course also is much more manageable if you speak to the TAs regularly. I would not say this class is easy. It's not especially hard but you really do need to pay attention if you aren't especially savy at econ. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I definitely recommend this class to every student, and please take it with Professor Maria Saez Marti! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to other students because of the interesting material presented in this course. If you enjoy solving puzzles and/or problem solving, this course is fun and will keep you interested. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but if you have trouble understanding accents, take it with Halac. ",
            "\u00a0I'm not sure that I would recommend this course. Unless you need it for your major, I think most people would get more out of watching online Game Theory videos or reading a textbook, since this class both had confusing lectures and was also not particularly easy to do well in. "
