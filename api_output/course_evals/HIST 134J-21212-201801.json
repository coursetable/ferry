            "\u00a0I learned so much about the history of Yale and the ways in which Yale has shaped/been shaped by the rest of the country. I definitely sharpened my research skills during the final paper process and also confirmed how fascinating this place, and the impact it has had on American history, is. I also had a lot of fun while doing all of this. ",
            "\u00a0I had fun and learned a lot. ",
            "\u00a0I learned all about the history of Yale and how that reflected times in America as a whole. I learned about Yale's founder and all about the residentially college system, important figures in Yale history, women at Yale, diversity at Yale and sports at Yale. This class was incredible. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I learned a ton about Yale history but, more importantly, I learned so much about life.  I am beyond grateful to have taken this course my senior year.  It was a truly life-changing experience. ",
            "\u00a0Yale & America took a broad look at US history through the lens of our one institution. I thought that the material would be too specific, but I very much liked that dichotomy, as it sharpened my historical analysis! ",
            "\u00a0This was the best course Ive taken at Yale. It taught us how to interpret history as it was at the time and not through a presentist lens ",
            "\u00a0I learned a ton about the founding and development of Yale. I learned about how the community itself evolved and how the focus of Yale has shifted throughout the past couple centuries! This class made me appreciate Yale in a way I hadnt before. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to be a better historian in this class. Professor Gitlin challenges you to think like a historian and build arguments from archival sources. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about Yales place in American history religiously and culturally. I learned about Yales founders and important figures through its history. "

            "\u00a0I really loved this class and felt like it was a great community to be a part of. I thought the organization of the course and the different themes each week made a lot of sense and were structured in a way that was not overwhelming but built upon previous discussions so that by the end of the semester things really fit together and came full circle. I liked that we had weekly interlocutors and thought that was a great way for us to budget our workload across the semester, although it felt like many weeks we did not really use the interlocutor guides in class discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the people (gemeinschaft)\r\nWeaknesses: perhaps a confusing syllabuswhat to read and when at times unclear. Some assignments weren't on the syllabus, and some that were never happened. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: This course is incredible. I absolutely loved every lecture because I learned so much about Yale that I would never have known. Honesly this class was so incredible because there is so much important history about Yale that I feel every Yale student should know. ",
            "\u00a0The course was terrific ",
            "\u00a0The strength is the professor. Hes so well-versed in Yale history yet also so willing to discover new things thanks to the research of his students. Hes engaging and fun! His only weakness is that he doesnt teach more courses! Everyone should have a class with Professor Gitlin before they graduate. Hes an outstanding educator. ",
            "\u00a0This class was great. My peers were truly engaged, there was a ton of great reading, and Prof G has an infectious energy. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the two written assignments and the Cole porter assignments. I sometimes wondered why we were given so many handouts because we never really looked at or discussed them. "

            "\u00a0I would encourage every student at Yale to take this class because they are inherently part of the subject matter but, more importantly, it's a blast! Anyone who is spending four (or more) years here should know about the history of the institution and the reach it has, and how we as Yale students fit into that bigger picture. I know it's an immensely popular course as it is and can confirm that is absolutely for good reason. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this to any student at Yale. It has been my favorite class I have taken at Yale so far. I wish that every student could take it! ",

            "\u00a0200%\r\nI would recommend this to every student, even non history majors.  Professor Gitlin is a wonderful (and brilliant) person who cares about his students like none other I have come across at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yale & America was so much fun, and Professor Gitlin is such a friendly instructor. The course was a fantastic way to finish my last semester at Yale, so even if you aren't a historian yourself, you should really consider Yale & America! The themes are broad while still accessible, and the final paper allows you to delve into Yale's archival collections if that's what you want to do. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely ",
            "\u00a0EVERYONE AT YALE NEEDS TO TAKE THIS CLASS. It will make you appreciate Yale in a way you hadnt before. It will make you walk around campus with a smile on your face. It is hands-down the best class at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this course if you can get in. Prof Gitlin makes you a stronger writer and historian and cultivates a comfortable classroom dynamic. You will learn so much about Yale, which is invaluable as we pass through the halls. Moreover, you will get closer to your cohort and write a fantastic paper! ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! This is an awesome course that I think every Yale student would benefit from taking. It gives you a great perspective on Yales past and present. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely.  Every seminar meeting consisted of rich, stimulating discussion.  Professor Gitlin productively directed conversation and provided clear, useful feedback on writing assignments.  The reading list was excellent. "
