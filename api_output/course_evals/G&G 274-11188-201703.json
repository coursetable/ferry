            "\u00a0I learned to apply knowledge of geology and geophysics and the way fossil fuels work in the economy--I also learned about their sustainability and I applied many scientific concepts (especially chemistry ones!) to work on calculations about the fossil fuels that emit the most/least carbon emissions.  We also compared different nations carbon emissions and looked into the reliability and likeliness of reducing our carbon footprints across different nations. This was truly an extremely insightful course.  If you put effort into the class readings and listened to the professors lectures (he really is a beacon of knowledge) then you would have been able to pick up an unsurpassable amount of information from this class! ",

            "\u00a0This course teaches you about the different types of fossil fuels and its use today and its past trends. You look at how efficient each of these fuels are and alternative sources of energy, and also how these fossil fuels are developed based on the Earth's geology. ",
            "\u00a0Great examination of fossil fuels, energy futures, and scientific background. Interesting coverage of how fossils fuels formed across the world. Varied problem sets covered petroleum reserves, Kaya equation and specific oil fields. ",

I liked that there was math, but it was very manageable math. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about fossil fuel development and energy usage. ",
            "\u00a0This class teaches you about the composition, formation, and uses of fossil fuels. You will learn about the implications of using fossil fuels, and how their effects are evaluated. You will also learn about general energy trends in the world, and what might be the future of energy in both the developed and developing world. ",

            "\u00a0Very good thorough class. Perhaps more problem sets relating to lecture materials. ",
            "\u00a0This course was well organized and extremely insightful -- I loved that prof Oristaglio included and uploaded slides from the week consistently onto Canvas -- that was extremely helpful. His review sessions were also extremely helpful for the midterm and final.  I loved his use of slides to make his lectures more engaging -- the visuals and graphs in the slides really added to show the information in a variety of different ways.  I thought the class really had a lot of good things going for it -- I even enjoyed doing the psets and seeing the direct real world effects from them. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: well organized, manageable workload. Prof Oristaglio is a good lecturer so even though you didn't NEED to go to lecture to do well in the tests, it was worth it \r\nWeaknesses: nothing really. would have enjoyed going more in depth into the \"transitions\" part of the course but it was mostly fossil fuels. ",
            "\u00a0Strenghts: professor is great! He's super passionate about the material and really cares about his students. Material is also very applicable to real life events and makes you think about how we use energy in the world. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: readings were a bit long and intimidating, might be more helpful if they were condensed. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Oristaglio is a great professor and earnestly devoted to the class. Very willing to help students outside the classroom. The material is great and you can tell that Oristaglio devoted immeasurable amounts of time to create great PowerPoints, outside readings, and class displays. ",
            "\u00a0No weaknesses - great course ",
            "\u00a0Weakness- It is taught so far away from campus and I honestly did not go to lecture sometimes just because of how far it was. ",
            "\u00a0This course provides a comprehensive understanding of the origins and present-day use of fossil fuels. The problem sets augmented the material in class well and the material itself was interesting and well-paced throughout the class. ",
            "\u00a0Oristaglio is a good lecturer and clearly cares about the content and students, this helps to make what could be a dry topic relatively engaging.  A weakness is that everyone gets very similar grades on all the psets and midterm and because of this the professor makes the final very difficult to distribute everyones final grades.  I think if the course was structured to be stricter on grading the whole way through the semester then students who care about the class content enough to put in the time would be rewarded with grades consistent with their effort. ",
            "\u00a0The PSETs weren't really that relevant to the course material and the lectures were sometimes a little bit repetitive. Overall, very interesting though. ",
            "\u00a0I actually think the course could be more engaging in a slightly smaller classroom- the lecture hall in KGL seemed only partially filled at any one time and a classroom might be better for whiteboard usage, etc. ",
            "\u00a0This course is strong in its objective and frank assessment of fossil fuel usage, and its thoroughness in which it explains where fossil fuels come from and how they came to be there. I wish there was more of a sense of future fossil fuel usage and what possible timetables for transitions to renewable energy are. ",
            "\u00a0The class was incredibly disorganized, lacked any clear focus, and had hazy standards overall. ",
            "\u00a0Material was very engaging\r\nWould be better if certain topics were taught in more depth- petroleum and coal systems, long-term climate trends, mathematical topics such as porosity, etc. ",
            "\u00a0One strength was the abundant availability of material (lecture slides, supplemental reading, problem sessions, review sessions, office hours, etc...). Also, the professor was highly knowledgable and could explain just about any relevant concept or question. I felt the course could be strengthened by more serious discussion of (by this I mean more time dedicated in the syllabus to) the 'energy transitions' part of \"Fossil Fuels and Energy Transitions.\" "

            "\u00a0If you're looking for an easy and low-workload science credit, this can fit the bill, but there are other courses that are more engaging and worthwhile for that credit. If you're very interested in gaining a basic working understanding of fossil fuels it's probably worth your time, but the professor mostly reads off the slides and lectures are very easy to tune out of. I fell asleep far more than I wanted to. Professor Oristaglio is reasonable and kind, but I don't find his lecture style engaging in the least. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great overview of Earth Science and Fossil Fuels as natural resources and world energy. If you have taken any classes on natural resources and earth science before, it may be a bit of a review. ",

            "\u00a0Yes I would most definitely recommend this course to another student because it was extremely insightful; the information we learned can be applied to everyday life!! It was very interesting for me as well because I plan on using this course for my major and the class solidified my interest in Energy Studies and other environmental/sustainability efforts.  \r\nThe class was well organized and there's no one else that I can think of that could have conducted this class more successfully than Prof Oristaglio.  He makes himself extremely available if you need his help, his office hours are super helpful and his passion for the subject matter is extremely evident.  He places a lot of care and thought into the course and it shows in the vast material made available and the detail of the coursework. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I took it for the Energy Studies program (and my sc credit). Could have taken more gutty options like Astro but the return on investment in this course is far higher ",
            "\u00a0Yes I'd recommend this course. It could be a good science class for those of you that need one, or also for people who are looking for a class that's mostly pset based and doesn't have any papers. The psets are pretty interactive and you have a lot of opportunity to work through them with the professor. The material isn't hard and is pretty interesting because it's applicable to daily life. The midterm is very fair, but the final was a bit difficult. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to another student. The material is great and it provides a firm context to all the hubbub around \"climate change.\" The problem sets and midterms are straightforward, the final is a challenge (but only 25% of the grade). You won't be disappointed! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely ",
            "\u00a0Super manageable QR that isn't a gut, but lets you learn about some interesting and relevant stuff. \r\n\r\nPsets will take you a few hours (about every week and a half), and that's literally all the work you have to do except studying for the midterm and final. This class requires not much time at all. \r\n\r\nLectures can drag on and be boring sometimes, but that's to be expected. \r\n\r\nProf. O is a LEGEND, though. He is so knowledgeable and presents the course material clearly and is just a real good dude. ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested in energy or fossil fuels I would recommend this course. The final exam was tricky though. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. If you are at all interested in energy transitions and would like to have a better understanding of fossil fuels and what a transition away from fossil fuels might look like, you will enjoy this class. ",
            "\u00a0If you're an Energy Studies student, this course takes a deeper dive into a lot of the topics we covered. If that's what you're looking for, definitely take the course. If you're someone looking for a gut SC credit, this course is not for you- the exams are very thorough and detailed and the problem sets are time consuming. In other words, don't take the course if you're not interested in the topic or if you're not willing to engage. ",
            "\u00a0Would definitely recommend to a fellow student ",
            "\u00a0Take this class to learn about fossil fuel usage. Don't take it to learn about renewable energy. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is a solid course to take. I took it for my science credit. Although there are much easier courses to take for a science credit, this one is not that difficult. Michael Oristaglio seems to be one of those professor that want to see his students succeed. While the problem sets were a little challenging, Oristaglio made himself available to answer any and all questions. (Most professors in a lecture course would leave that to the TA.) Additionally, all the material covered on the two exams, Oristaglio made sure that material was covered in class, on the lecture notes, and covered again in review sessions. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely not. ",
            "\u00a0100%. I loved this course and would recommend it to literally any person who wants to be a concientious consumer of energy. It is well taught and highly informative. The instructor is also amazing and really wants to help students understand concepts and is happy to discuss other energy issues and problems. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. You learn very interesting material that is extremely relevant today. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, to all wishing to get a solid introduction to energy studies ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely!  Interesting topics and Oristaglio is fantastic.  Very fairly taught and graded--clear instructions. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to someone who wants to know about either the earth science and (to a lesser extent) economics of fossil fuel production. I'm interested in renewable energy, and kind of took this course to know my enemy. I was uncertain of whether it was a waste of time at first, but after finishing the course I'm glad I learned what I did. "
