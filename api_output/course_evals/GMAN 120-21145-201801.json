            "\u00a0I became more proficient in speaking and writing German. I was able to apply this to multiple enjoyable projects and learn about German culture. ",
            "\u00a0I developed my German skills beyond an elementary level and learned new content on German grammar and vocabulary. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more advanced german grammar as well as german culture. I gained more awareness of life in Europe. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a more firm understanding of more complex grammar (compound sentences, Genetive and Dative cases). I also learned more advanced German vocabulary. Since we had all taken L1 already, we were able to practice speaking more as a class. And because of that, I feel like my speaking in German became much more fluent. Also, I feel like I have started to get a basic understanding of German culture and life in Germany. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about the German language (vocabulary and grammar) as well as about German, Swiss, and Austrian culture, stemming off of what I learned in the first semester taking Elementary German L1. ",
            "\u00a0I learned German and the culture of Germany/Austria/Switzerland. I think the content of this course was straightforward and was everything I expected and more! "

            "\u00a0The fact it is an everyday course made it a drag to go to, especially as some times its not super exciting. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the course is well laid out and easy to follow. I think that it could be organized better, in that resources like discussion boards, projects, and homework could be consolidated a bit. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very enjoyable. I loved that it was only 50 minutes and the book was useful. The main weakness (while not of the course itself) is of the price of the book. It seems as though Yale could negotiate a better price due to its bargaining power as a major university. $200+ is rather ridiculous. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength of this course was having a great professor. Florian Kastner really made the course what it was.  He used the textbook effectively as a resource, but supplemented it well with examples of German culture and other useful vocabulary lessons. Some of the worst parts of the course (and they honestly weren't that awful) was the online connect homework and the forum. The connect homework was unnecessarily difficult and it wasn't that great of a resource to practice because it gave me no feedback. The forum was just tedious and I preferred the German exchange emails from last semester. I rather communicate with other German students than write a forum post. ",
            "\u00a0It would be very helpful if this course provided more review within its classes. Obviously there is only a limited amount of time to teach everything we need to know, but I this going over vocabulary and grammar which we have already learned more frequently would help with memorization, especially since we are constantly learning new things every day, and only being tested every few weeks, which can often make the burden of all the new things that we are learning overwhelming for those of us (including myself) who find learning languages to be more challenging. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course could be improved by having the forums swapped out with some other way of interpersonal communication. Otherwise, the course was well organized and great! "

            "\u00a0Yes! This class was great fun and I genuinely enjoyed learning throughout it. ",
            "\u00a0If taught by professor Kastner, yes. This class is one that greatly relies on the skill of the professor. This class was enjoyable and I learned a lot of functional German. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, for sure. The German department at Yale is awesome; so if you were even considering taking the language, I would most definitely take it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students interested in German, because it definitely teaches you the language, but compared to what I have heard from students taking other languages courses here at Yale, is a great deal less stressful than the requirements that other language courses demand. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I would highly recommend taking German through the department at Yale to anyone interested in German. The department is phenomenal and the professors are phenomenal--both are always looking out for you and trying to help you understand the language better. Honestly, the German department is a perfect microcosm of what the Yale experience is supposed to be: community oriented and cooperative. I always feel at home in the German department, and thus felt at home in the course. "
