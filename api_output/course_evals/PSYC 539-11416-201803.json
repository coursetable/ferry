            "\u00a0Strengths: Jutta is extremely knowledgeable about this tops given years of experience as a researcher and clinician. The small class size fostered a really good learning environment and good discussion. The guest lectures (Drs. Klonsky, Baskin-Sommers and Cannon) were very engaging and a nice way to bring in Yale's experts on their respective subjects. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It often felt that too much time was spent on complex cognitive models as opposed to other etiological models of psychopathology (more neuroscience, biological, and environmental emphasis would have complemented the cognitive material better). In addition, the student-led discussions that were meant to be built into class did not always go quite as planned (mostly from not leaving enough time or getting sidetracked from the discussion leader's prepared questions). ",
            "\u00a0Strong course. It could have been nice if some of the readings considered some other perspectives (i.e. a lot of the papers covered psychopathology from a cognitive perspective, and I would've been interested to read some more about underlying biological processes) ",
