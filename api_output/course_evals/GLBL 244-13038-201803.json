            "\u00a0This course, to me, reinforced the importance of protecting democracy, and showed how even though democratic institutions may take years (or decades, centuries) to build and strengthen, fascism can destroy them like a steamroller. The course went over not just Nazi Germany, but also fascism in Britain, Italy, and France. Each student gave a presentation on a specific topic, and the papers required a depth of understanding on a particular facet of fascism, including religious persecution, nationalism, and immigration policy. There were a few guest speakers as well, who spoke about how fascism relates to their studies and profession. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about the various definitions of fascism, the elements of fascist ideology, and the history of fascism. ",
            "\u00a0This course began with a historical survey of different forms of fascism in Europe over time, from its rise in Europe during the 1930s to the infamous Nazi regime during World War II. We also touched upon topics that I had never really considered before, from the British Union of Fascists to the history of French collaboration. As we progressed through the course, the topics became increasingly more relevant to the present day as we were asked to characterize the recent resurgence of populist and nationalist movements in Europe and the United States, as well as any potential hallmarks or stirrings of fascism that we identify. All in all, this course provides a strong understanding of what fascist ideology really is, how it was utilized in the past, and above all else, the importance of democracy and democratic institutions. ",
            "\u00a0The Politics of Fascism is a great class that really leads students to explore the various tenets of fascism in its incarnations throughout the 20th century in the first half of the term, and builds up to the present moment in Europe and the United States, where we ask ourselves how far along we are on the spectrum of fascist ideology.\r\n\r\nThis class is writing heavy (two 5-7 page papers and one 8-10 page paper) but you will grow as a writer throughout the term, and having these assignments is also a great way for you to lead further reflection on an aspect of the class that you found particularly interesting. The writing assignments never felt tedious, and are on such interesting topics that you will enjoy doing them. ",
            "\u00a0This class not only taught me about fascism in the 1900s, it also opened up much discussion about todays world and the current political climate. ",
            "\u00a0You'll learn how fascism as an ideology is quite unique, compared to socialism and democracy. I better understood the vague, transcendental elements of fascism that make it a huge threat in the current day. Prof Young has curated an excellent set of readings which provide a unique perspective to the history of fascism, and its enduring threat today. I came out of the course learning more about fascism, but more critically, its relation to democracy; by studying fascism as a rejection against the prevailing ideologies of post-WWI Europe, you'll learn to interrogate democracy itself and why it continues to be unstable today. ",
            "\u00a0I got a basic understanding of the definition of Fascism, the political implications, the history of fascist movements, and an ability to analyze fascistic elements within modern-day politics ",
            "\u00a0I developed knowledge of fascist movements throughout Europe in the 1930s, as well as the rise of right-wing movements throughout Europe and the United States today. I also gained skills in analyzing the tools of fascism and how they have worked and could work today to corrupt or destroy the institutions of democracy. ",
            "\u00a0In this class, I learned how to think critically about the current political system and how to remain a flexible mind when facing a new reality. This class encourages me to further engage with politics outside of the classroom. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: great professor, great readings, very engaged group of students\r\nWeaknesses: ?? ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Lively discussion with full participation, the professor was an excellent seminar leader, excursion to New York City to speak with a Holocaust survivor and visit the Museum of Jewish Heritage, interesting readings, FANTASTIC feedback\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the discussion would get a little carried away with current events ",
            "\u00a0Amazing professor, engaging class, and all-around exceptional experience. This is the type of class you come to Yale for. ",
            "\u00a0I only have amazing things to say about this course. The readings each week were carefully selected to cultivate different perspectives on the topic of discussion and later readings often incorporated many concepts from earlier in the course. In each seminar, roughly the first half of our session was spent discussing relevant items in the news that week, while the second half focused on the readings. Though we touched a variety of salient issues in the current events portion of the class, it was a fun and engaging exercise to connect them back to the concepts we were building in class. Each essay also came with a variety of prompts that grew increasingly broad as the course progressed--lending us further agency to take control of the topic and really dig deep into the material, particularly the aspects that we found most fascinating. Truly, this was a strong, discussion-based seminar that really did feel like a discussion; I found that every single student was engaged with the material and had different opinions to voice, which Dr. Young was fantastic at cultivating. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength of this class is the reason why anyone remotely interested in politics/history should take the course; fascism has become an umbrella term for a lot of things, and this class will lead students to really think about what fascism actually is, and how it articulates itself.\r\n\r\nAnother strength that cannot be understated is that Professor Young is so good at giving you detailed feedback on every paper, which is super helpful! \r\n\r\nBecause this class ultimately builds up to the present moment, we spend a lot of time talking about current events. Although these discussions are always super interesting and linked to what we study, at times it felt like we barely had time to dive into the actual topic for the week because we had spent a lot of time debating the developments of the past week (granted, there were a lot this past term). It might therefore be helpful to set a strict limit on how much time we actually spend on the news each week so that we have ample time to delve into the fascinating topics that we cover with the syllabus. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this class is the discussion that Dr. Young facilitates. ",
            "\u00a0This was overall one of the best classes I took at Yale. The class sessions were engaging and thoughtful, and the class became a real community. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were the readings, in-class seminar discussions, and the dedication of the professor. As students, we were regularly challenged to address the difficult questions and issues of the course, and to put ourselves in the shoes of both academics and policymakers looking at a problem. Professor Young's office hours and the field trip to New York to speak with a Holocaust survivor were also major strengths of the course. The only weakness was that there was often not enough time in seminar to fully discuss all the material. ",
            "\u00a0This class is really strong in its emphasis on leadership and civil responsibility. Students engage actively in the class and are expected to speak intelligently and responsibly. Doctor Young also encourages different ideas and opinions throughout class discussions, which is crucial for students to learn from each other.\r\n\r\nAlthough this is not a history class, it might be helpful to spend slightly more time discussing historical topics touched upon in the readings. The link between the past and the present could be further examined in detail. In this way, class discussion will aid students think through essay topics and produce better work. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely! Take it if you get in. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It gives a great historical perspective that you can apply to current events. The professor is a distinguished scholar who has a deep understanding of the subject, but she lets the students come to their own conclusions. ",
            "\u00a0A fantastic course, would highly recommend. Dr. Young is a wonderful professor. I hardly ever write reviews, but for this course, a must! ",
            "\u00a0Take it. Professor Young is amazing. ",
            "\u00a0I would most certainly recommend this course to other students, and have already done so to several of my friends. Not only is this course's topic relevant to many of the movements or trends we see across the world today, but Dr. Young has constructed this course to really engage and challenge different perspectives--such that everyone comes out feeling like they have had something to learn. This is the sort of seminar that will leave you defending your opinions, interrogating your stances, and perhaps even changing them as the discussion progresses. Looking at fascist, as well as nationalist and populist, ideology over time, you can't help but feel that the present moment in our national and world politics is even more profound. This is truly a worthwhile seminar to take! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Take it regardless of your major (that is actually one of the coolest aspects of the course, professor Young makes a point of selecting a group of students with different academic interests/political views, which makes discussions so much more interesting). This course does not only satisfy an intellectual curiosity on what fascism is; it is essential to understand powerful ideologies and political methods that are once again starting to shape democratic life in the United States and in Europe. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend taking this class if you have the opportunity. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course for a fascinating approach to questioning democracy: through the history of fascism and its implications on the world today. You start the first half of the course studying fascism's historical emergence, and the second half exploring how certain elements continue to plague our world today. Prof Young brings interesting speakers to supplement the historical foundation of the first half of the course, and shepherds the conversation in class well, so that you won't feel as if the whole class is merely an intellectual endeavor without personal stake. I personally came out of this course learning far more about democracy than I expected to from a class on fascism. Do note, however, that with this thematic emphasis on fascism and its threat to democracy, this is a not a course that studies, in detail, the political ideology of fascism and its historical manifestations. We spend a lesson each covering fascism's emergence in Germany, Britain, Italy, collaboration in Vichy France, and its role in the Holocaust, before beginning to explore its more modern implications today. If you're looking for an in-depth study of fascism in Italy and Germany, this might not be the right course. But if you want to study fascism to understand why our world today seems to be undergoing a sort of shift, this is an excellent class to take. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. It is timely, fascinating, and extremely relevant. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone interested in the European fascist movements of the 1930s and how they do and do not relate to the rise of right-wing movements today. The course is also relevant for students interested in democratic breakdowns and the resilience of democratic institutions in the face of fascism. Professor Young is an incredible and dedicated professor who provides detailed feedback on student work and is always available outside of class to help or simply to further discuss the material. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in current affairs and want to have more insights in today's US politics, this would be a great class for you. Doctor Young has a background in policy advisory and she brings incredible guest speakers (via video chat) to class. The class will provide you with the nuances in how policies are made as well as giving you big pictures on broad political and historical trends. "
