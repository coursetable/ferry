I also benefited from the in-depth discussion about methodologies underpinning both contemporary and more foundational works in the subfield.\r\n\r\nThe course presentations forced students to grapple with the nuances and particulars of each paper.

            "\u00a0The course allowed students to present on select papers, which facilitated deep engagement with each paper, and to take a step back to synthesize the knowledge through reading response papers. The course was excellent for both content mastery and methodological learning. One thing I wished there was more of was Professor Queralt's take on matters, or lecture-style synopsis of the way he interprets the topic or question at hand. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n\r\n-- intensive discussion regarding the articles and methods was particularly beneficial\r\n\r\n-- professor was quite engaging and provided extensive feedback on our criticisms/comments on the course readings. It was quite clear that he came prepared to have an in-depth discussion of each reading.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n\r\n-- the small class size made the regular student presentations a bit intense in the middle of the semester, but overall, that requirement was beneficial\r\n\r\n-- wish we'd engaged with more book-length scholarship on IPE to see how political scientists craft and explore questions in a more in-depth, lengthier format "
