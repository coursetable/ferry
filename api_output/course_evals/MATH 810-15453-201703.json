I think if the class had had more regular(incremental) written assignments I might have been a bit less lost. But the subject is very rich and Prof. Minsky brings it to life. "

            "\u00a0Hyperbolic geometry! Minskys classes are always a blast. Take a class with manifolds (complex II, probably) and have a basic idea of topology before this one, if you are an undergrad. ",
