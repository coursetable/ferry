            "\u00a0The course was well-taught and the instructor was brilliant and clearly articulated his points. I just wish that (1) the psets aligned more with what was covered in class (this became more of an issue for the linear regression content) and (2) that the in-class instructions weren't so proof-based (I really liked the proofs, but I felt that he often went too fast in them). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: material is important. \r\nWeaknesses: quite literally everything else. Perhaps the most poorly taught and organized STEM course I've taken at Yale and ever. Quality of lecture is quite bad and thus most people don't go since it's already not sufficient enough to do the homework. Half the class copies homework answers given they are readily available from people who took it last year. First midterm was easy but last test was terrible in every sense; too long, not enough time, material that was not in the book and barely covered, and a lot of calculator work which seemed as a whole unnecessary. Astonished that a required course like this with so many people is so poorly taught and organized. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: textbook is great, first exam was pretty fair, second one was not\r\nWeaknesses: teaching -- i feel bad giving professors critical reviews but I was one of the few people who came to every single lecture and probably ended up worse off for it. I found lectures hard to follow, even as someone who has a decent background in econometrics and stats. The latter half of the course had wayyy too much linear algebra that was completely inadequately explained. He also did not provide any practice exams and the second midterm was quite unlike things we had encountered before. ",
            "\u00a0This is a pretty bad course, maybe even the worst I have ever taken.  Andrew Barron seems to care about his students and is passionate about statistics, but somehow still managed to be a terrible professor. His lectures are almost entirely useless, as he simply rambles while writing random things on the board, making it very hard to follow. To make it worse, he does not post any notes regarding the material, and it occasionally does not line up with the textbook at all, making it especially difficult for the exams. \r\nThe psets are not very difficult, but they are very lazily done (only textbook problems) and take up a decent amount of time (3-5 hours each) and he assigned one every week (13, including during both exam weeks). \r\nThe first exam was mostly straightforward and reasonable, with a pretty high average, as the material lined up mostly with what we had done on the assignments. The second exam (final during the last week of class) was actually just a complete POS. Almost none of the problems lined up at all with any of the assignments. Furthermore, Barron had spent the last few classes talking about a concept not at all mentioned in the book or elsewhere, meaning that to understand it you would have had to rely on his terrible lectures (if you even went to class, otherwise you were 100% screwed). He then made 40% of the exam just on this subject, which had not even been a part of any of the assignments. This was arguably even worse than the infamous S&DS 241 final from Yihong. ",

I relied mostly on the internet and TAs and ULAs to learn the material. The midterm was very straightforward, but the final had some very unexpected curveballs (matrix calculus). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - you learn basic statistics for upper level Stats courses. Weaknesses - lectures are INCREDIBLY dry, attendance drops severely after the first week, psets are very dry as well. Going into the exams there was very little clarity on what the structure would be or what material would be covered. Take it if it's required for your major; otherwise, I'd stay away as there are other courses like 238 that are much better. ",

I ended up doing most of my learning by simply reading the textbook. ",

Textbook references are never explained in class even though the course closely follows the book. Lecture material is consistently convoluted and unclear. ",

However, I think the teaching could have been improved in this course by having a clearer lesson structure and maybe some lecture notes or slidehows to accompany the lectures (currently they are often very difficult to follow). However, I will note that the instructor was nice and approachable even though the lectures themselves were unclear. Also, while the course is currently highly grounded in the book, I really really did not like the textbook that we used. I found the writing to be very unclear, the examples not to be illuminating, that the proofs weren't well explained, etc. I would personally recommend to switching to a book like Casella and Berger which while at a higher level seems much much clearer and better written. Additionally, I did not appreciate the way that problem sets were graded in this course in which the smallest increment deduction on a problem was 1 out of 3 points (which is a relatively major deduction on a problem set worth 18 or 21 points total--and you could lose 1 out of 3 points for very small errors (i.e. not putting a hat on a variable, not drawing a graph in exactly the right way, etc.)). I wish problem sets had instead been graded out of 100 points to allow for a more nuanced scoring system (i.e. losing 2-3 percent for very small errors rather than 5-6+% as we did). ",

            "\u00a0There is very little I can say about the strengths of this class. The lectures were horribly organized and resembled scratch work more than anything else. Notes from class required heavy synthesis afterwards as there were very little few concepts explained and no definitions given before launching into a proof. That being said, the low turnout to every class was indicative of how poor of a lecturer Professor Barron was. On top of that, problem sets were taken straight from the book and most of the concepts were omitted from class, requiring heavy amounts of self study. It doesn't help that the book was very difficult to follow as well. I can confidently say that I have never learned more nothing that I have in this class, and on top of all that, had to suffer from poor course organization and an unfair final test. ",
            "\u00a0Align the classes more closely with the textbook. The homework always seems to follow the textbook, but sometimes class topics stray away from these themes. ",
            "\u00a0This class is impossibly hard. You learn all of the material when you look back at the psets, but you will be extremely lost when you are completing them. The only way you can do them is with help of online sources, friends and TA's. That being said the material was interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are that it was challenging and the teacher was engaged and passionate about the material, a true purists of statistics. It could improve by having the tests more closely related to the psets and lectures. Also more help from TAs in office hours. The homeworks were a bit of a leap from lecture material ",
            "\u00a0Could have more lecture notes for reference ",
            "\u00a0Theory was really unclearly delivered. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: It covers a broad range of material in a way where it's possible to understand why it is you are doing what.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Most of the homeworks and assessments do not test our understanding of what we are doing. When we get to more computational portions, we are mostly on our own to figure out how to use R or MiniTAb ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are really not very helpful in regards to the psets.  There's a lot of time spent on the derivation of formulas.  It's interesting for sure, but I think class time could be better spent on example problems. ",
            "\u00a0A huge weakness was that it was at 9:25am. I strongly believe that is too early for the level of attendance that was required to really follow what was going on in class. The textbook was pretty good and office hours was helpful, but there was no other way to get lecture notes and really make sure you knew what was being covered other than to attend every single lecture. I also think that sometimes the professor got bogged down in the details of a derivation and failed to put it in context (with regard to the bigger picture or especially applications), but he did make an effort to do that at some points which was helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures in this class are terrible. They are impossible to follow, and even though I went to all of them, I did 99% of my learning from the textbook. I love Andrew Barron, and he's a really sweet guy who's very passionate about the topic he teaches, but his lectures are disorganized and he tends to ramble. He doesn't use slides and doesn't post any lecture notes, which is really tough. 80% of the material is straight from the book, but he also covers some stuff not in the book (I think minimax, Bayes average risk, table of additive fits, orthogonality and linear regression stuff). The tests are completely doable if you go to the review session. For the first exam, the test was basically the exact same problems as the review session. ",
            "\u00a0This course is relatively disorganized in terms of the lecture, and I feel that if there were slides posted online, it would be easier to process the information after looking at the slides after class. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Barron is worst professor I've had at Yale by far, and I've had a number of bad professors. He made no effort whatsoever to provide any semblance of clarity. The TAs and book were helpful, but that's about it. ",
            "\u00a0It moves at a good pace to give you time to absorb the concepts \r\nThere is quite a disconnect between the lectures and the textbook and problem sets which makes it a little hard to know what to focus on and to follow the lectures ",
            "\u00a0I would have preferred a more modern/updated textbook. ",

            "\u00a0The lectures weren't very engaging, and we didn't spend enough time focusing on the intuition/motivation, as opposed to the math. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: having a lot of weaknesses is a strength\r\nWeakness: poor in every single aspect ",
            "\u00a0The course is poorly taught, lectures are unclear and only somewhat helpful. I learned mostly from the textbook, but the textbook is also horribly written. For the second half of the course, the professor sped through a ton of linear algebra material in the last couple of weeks which was not in the textbook which made the final signifcantly more difficult than the midterm. \r\nPsets are difficult and stressful and a poor way for students to learn the material. I would stress over completing the psets rather than learning the material. ",
            "\u00a0Some of the lectures felt like it jumped around the textbook a bit, but having the exact concepts we were learning that day explicitly listed was really nice. The other thing to keep in mind is when the assignments come out, not all of the material needed for it will always be taught before it is published. If it seems extremely hard, wait until the next lecture and it will probably get cleared up. ",
            "\u00a0Course advertises itself as more theoretical but doesn't go very deep into the theory, as there are huge gaps in measure theory/etc that would have to be filled before thoroughly proving most theorems. The result is that there are many confusing statements with vague justifications that ostensibly inform calculations but aren't well understood by students. The textbook is also extremely difficult to get through. There are some things that don't make sense about the course considering it's part of an intro sequence - ie why is this also the course for grad students taking their qualification exam? Overall did have some takeaways but they were mostly computational so I think that defeats the purpose of the course. ",
            "\u00a0My complaints about this class are many, and it was because of this class that my semester was one of the more needlessly challenging semesters I've had during my time at Yale. Despite being a student who has spent a large amount of time considering statistics, and who has taken several S&DS courses, I felt woefully underprepared and under instructed at every stage of this class. It failed to leave me feeling as though I came away from the class with a true understanding of the material, and I struggled mightily with every assignment, test, and class weekly.\r\n\r\nI worked as hard as I could for the entire semester, attending review sessions, office hours, additional lectures in the evenings, and studying with classmates, and no matter the extent to which I went to try to grasp the material that was expected of us, I could not reach a sufficient level of expertise. I am not one to hold grudges, and I genuinely tried time and time again to adjust my study habits and processes to meet this course's expectations, but I felt as though it expected me to come in with significantly more understanding and exposure to material that I simply have not reached. Professor Barron never considered students who have not spent several years as a statistics student, instead teaching to the top 15% of the class consisting of grad students. In doing so, I felt myself and several of my classmates being left behind to struggle to learn from a textbook that only covered a portion of what we needed to know. We were never given lecture slides, prior exams, or any other supplementary materials to better ourselves as students, and communication from Professor Barron was sparse at best. The expectations were unclear, and the tests did not in the slightest bit reflect what we had learned in class. Two of the questions on the final exam drew on material that, save for seven minutes at an optional review session, I have never before in my life had exposure to. This example was endemic of a theme of not only pushing kids beyond what could reasonably be expected of them, but also a negligence towards preparing us as statisticians. Homework assignments were rigid, as were all due dates, so even when we fell behind in lectures, we were asked to solve problems on concepts that hadn't ever been presented to us. \r\n\r\n\r\nI tried and I tried to get help, especially from the TA's who were quite often the only available resources, but they failed to hear what students were asking, or to provide support for a class that was clearly panicking because we were not able to do what was asked of us. I felt as though I was not alone in several of these experiences, and daily students would complain about the homework assignments, midterm, and final. This toxic environment led to several other students feeling the need to cheat weekly, and as a result the curve of grades did not reflect properly the students who worked hard and gave honest efforts, but rather rewarded those who chose to shortcut the process. \r\n\r\n\r\nI have had hard classes in the past, and I intend to continue to take difficult classes in the future, because the point of coming to Yale is to be pushed beyond your comfort zone. But a class like this not only makes me question my proficiency in a subject I love, it also makes me question my place here at Yale. It was structured such that students existed in a constant state of panic, and I never felt as though we turned a corner. I exhausted all available resources, and still felt as though I was never set up to succeed, which is a difficult place to be as a curious and driven student. "

The content is interesting, but the lectures are very dry - if you're a Statistics major then you have to take this, but if you're looking to take a survey course, I'd recommend taking another different course. ",
            "\u00a0I would not. While Professor Barron cared deeply about his students and tried, I don't think he taught the material well, and I left the course without a solid understanding of the material, which is too bad, since it is such an important subject. ",
            "\u00a0I would STRONGLY recommend this course to anyone majoring in S&DS or considering majoring in S&DS. Although there are certainly some flaws in this class, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Any S&DS major worth their salt should know the material taught in this class, and the homeworks, though pretty long, go a long way in reinforcing this material. Although some of the lectures can be kind of dry/repetitive, Prof. Barron does a pretty good job of presenting the material, much of which is in the textbook but also, some of which is not found in the textbook at all. The homeworks and tests were very fair, and I received very good feedback on my homework. This course has reinvigorated my interest in statistics. Overall, really enjoyed this class and would highly recommend. ",

            "\u00a0The class is interesting I think, but it involves a lot of self-study, because Barron's not very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I wouldn't recommend this course. The lectures aren't helpful, and as a result, a lot of the learning has to happen independently. ",

            "\u00a0I would not recommend it. This course has the potential to be incredibly valuable and interesting; however, the teaching is terrible, and students should not be expected to enroll in a class just to rely on textbook and YouTube videos. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, problem sets are engaging, and learning the material becomes very insightful to any data analysis you perform. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I know this class gets a lot of heat but if you really sit down and learn the material it is so interesting and I am so glad I sticked with the course. ",
            "\u00a0Requirement ",
            "\u00a0This course is required for the BS for S&DS so is necessary. And I do feel as if I learned some key skills and ideas and that I am potentially better prepared for other more advanced coursework (i.e. like S&DS 410 or possibly ECON 136). However, this course could definitely be made a more pleasant experience in terms of the teaching, grading, and the way that the material is conveyed to students. ",
            "\u00a0if it is needed for a major, gotta do it! I definitely learnt things though so that is a plus ",
            "\u00a0Unfortunately I wouldn't recommend the course to another student, but it is a requirement in the S&DS major. I feel like if it was taught by a different professor it would have been a lot more enjoyable. The concepts taught weren't that complicated but the Professor made them seem way harder than what they actually were. ",
            "\u00a0I would never recommend this class unless it is required for your major. This was by far the worst class I have taken at Yale, and I made a mistake in electing to take this for my Comp. Sci. / Math joint major. I decided to take this class because I enjoyed 241, but be warned that it was nothing like 241. The professor was poor in lecture, the homework assignments were reasonable but taken straight from the book, the book was difficult to follow, and the course structure was incredibly amorphous. I learned nothing in this class, and also did not benefit in my GPA. I would have happily taken any other math class if possible, and would advise everybody to do the same. ",
            "\u00a0If you are majoring in statistics, you should. Otherwise, don't. ",
            "\u00a0No ",
            "\u00a0I'm not sure if i would. Its interesting material and very theoretical so you get a real understanding of statistics which i think is good. but sometimes the theory is very difficult to grasp and the lectures are a bit too theoretical and should be simplified somewhat ",
            "\u00a0If you need to. ",
            "\u00a0If you are willing to put in the time to teach yourself, yes. However, the lectures are not that conducive to learning (although I continued attending throughout the semester) as often times the most important things are only said, not written down, and what is written on the board would often not be followable when looking back through notes. ",
            "\u00a0If you're really interested in the theory behind statistical formulas, sure.  It's not too difficult, and you'll get a lot of ground-up knowledge of formulas.  If you're more interested in the application, there are probably better courses. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely not recommend it if it's not for your major. The lectures were too early in the morning (9:25 MWF), and there were no lecture notes posted online so it would be pretty hard to keep up with the material without going to class. The weekly problem sets were often quite long and difficult, often 10 handwritten pages of calculations, and I relied heavily on office hours to complete them. I do feel like I gained important foundational knowledge about statistical theory, but it was hard-earned from spending a lot of time on the problem sets and trying to decipher my notes and the textbook and asking lots of questions at office hours. The lectures were often pretty detail-oriented and very, very theoretical, while the homeworks were a bit more computational. The professor is really passionate about statistics and actually a pretty nice guy, but I don't think his lecture style is very easy to follow. He often stands in front of a board he's writing on so you can't see it, and moves them around or erases them too quickly to copy everything down. He also talks a lot without writing, so if you fall behind during a lecture it is very hard to catch up and you will probably just miss a lot. I wish there had been more office hours throughout the week-- they were all concentrated on Sunday and Monday, with problem sets due every Wednesday in class, so it was hard to start early or finish things up on Tuesday. There were two in-class exams (not cumulative) which were VERY different-- the first was quite easy and followed the review session almost exactly, while the second was too long and very difficult. Problem sets and exams were graded and handed back in a very timely manner, which I appreciated, but there wasn't usually a lot of actual feedback on them. ",
            "\u00a0The material is really cool, but do you really wanna go to class at 9:25 am three times a week? ",
            "\u00a0Only if they had to. Personally I found the material very interesting, but Barron is so bad that I doubt it's worth taking unless it's necessary. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah it gives you a good foundation in the theory of statistics ",
            "\u00a0Just know that it's a lot more work than 241. (Though not as much work as 230/231). ",
            "\u00a0If you are really interested in theoretical statistics, then yes. If you are more interested in statistical applications, consider taking another class in the department ",
            "\u00a0Only if they need it as a requirement. ",
            "\u00a0No. Poorly organized. Materials are just not helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Barron is not the best lecturer but he is a wonderful person who will do his best to help you if you approach him outside of class. I also had some health issues during the semester and he was very kind about accommodating me. ",
            "\u00a0No. Unfortuantely this is the only introductory theoretical statistics course avaiable for students. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, yes. I assume most people taking the course are doing so for their major, but it was still a fun course to deepen my statistics knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to another student unless it was a requirement - if there's another way to fulfill an intro stats requirement, I think it would be more helpful and enlightening. This didn't give me enough applied knowledge OR theoretical knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0I cannot in good faith recommend this course in its current iteration to other students. It was an experience unlike any I've had to survive, and though the material at its core is interesting, the way in which we were given it made it quite difficult to appreciate the beauty of statistics.
