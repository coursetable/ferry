            "\u00a0I learned critical political theory that explored the interactions between violence and structures in society. ",
            "\u00a0I developed the ability to engage with and critique modern works of political theory in a way that allowed me to understand more about the nature of society and of political violence. ",
            "\u00a0This class was one of the most challenging rewarding I have taken at Yale. I learned how to read political philosophy at an in-depth level and have a productive conversation about it. ",
            "\u00a0Through this course, I developed a greater understanding of a broad scope of political theory pertaining to questions of violence in politics, and better close reading/analytical skills with respect to political philosophy texts. ",
            "\u00a0A capacity to deeply analyze philosophical texts and critically evaluate theories. An ability to write clearly and compelling on these themes and to understand where the philosophical reasoning falls short and to find logical loopholes. ",
            "\u00a0The course is on political violence but is taught as a philosophical phenomenon. I learned how to apply these philosophical critiques to historical instances of violence (i.e., revolutions). ",
            "\u00a0Learned about different types of political violence, theories of political violence, relationship between reason and violence, and non-violence. ",
            "\u00a0This class provides the opportunity for reading comprehension and critical thinking about some dense philosophy and sociology around theories of violence (e.g. structural violence; symbolic violence; physical violence; coercion; relationships between violence, power and authority, etc.). It also is a prime example of a class that rewards people for being skilled in seminar-style comments or questions. ",
            "\u00a0The most important insights gained were from Prof. Kapustin's guided exposure through postmodern views on nonviolence. Postmodernism attempts to analyze violence through a more sweeping and sophisticated lens. This equips students with a radical and more complex view of how society works. In sum, this class did an incredible job in imparting students with a more expansive and intelligent worldview. ",
            "\u00a0A critical way to look at violence. (Lowkey, it's hard to tell the class' merits from the teacher's - because Kapustin is just mind-blowing - so refer to the question about the instructor). ",
            "\u00a0I learnt about the different types of violence that exist, how they map onto each other, and how we may appropriately respond to each. Lots of mental heavy-lifting, but Professor Kapustin is excellent at helping us navigate these deep waters. "

            "\u00a0This course is perfect ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were that the readings were all excellent. However, the definition of key terms up front, or trying to define major themes, would be helpful for students not as well versed in the literature. ",
            "\u00a0Strength was the teaching. Despite being a seminar, Prof Kapustin was able to guide the class unlike any other professor I have seen. He was the highlight. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Excellent professor and syllabus (many of whose works havent been encountered in previous courses in the EP&E department). Well-structured course revolving around core central themes that are carried through over the course of the semester (namely on political violence). Reasonable workload and assignments and stimulating (albeit intellectually challenging) readings.\r\nWeaknesses: Hard pressed to come up with any. If at all, we tend to deviate from the syllabus pacing by the middle of the semester so it may be hard to assess what readings need to be read in a given week. ",
            "\u00a0Strength is certainly Professor Kapustin. He directs the class clearly and with intention, always focusing our discussion and having each student leave with a polished understanding of highly complex and second order texts. Weakness would be time allocation in seminar. I think Professor Kapustin is a bit ambitious in how much of the material we can properly unpack in one meeting, and as a result we tend to lag behind and even miss full weeks of material by the end of the year. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - the course covers various perspectives of political violence and teaches students how to apply those critiques to observable practices. This course develops students' knowledge of political theory, and engages in unique texts that are not commonly read in political science/philosophy courses.\r\n\r\nWeakness - the material is complex and dense, but we were not able to get through all of the material that was planned on the syllabus. ",
            "\u00a0The readings on the syllabus were great, even though sometimes they were quite dense. Seminar was always fantastic every week - Professor Kapustin was a great seminar leader who was so knowledgeable and led seminar very effectively. Class discussion was always lively and enlightening. ",
            "\u00a0This class, like all taught by Boris, is a double-edged sword: Boris is one of the most powerfully eloquent seminar leaders at Yale. He has an incredible talent for synthesizing student comments into mini-lecture style responses, and does a great job of guiding classes with a few pointed questions that get at the heart of the material. His sense of urgency and passion for the material is evident. However, his skill at lecturing and fueling classes with his own rhetorical flair when needed can make the student discussion less lively and less engaged. Do the reading and class will be great!!!! ",
            "\u00a0This has been said many times before, but it is worth restating: Boris Kapustin is a nonpareil professor at Yale and every class with him is a privilege. That is to say, the main strength of this course was Kapustin's phenomenal lecturing. He helped clarify many abstruse postmodern philosophical texts, which otherwise would have been impossible to understand for students on their own. Kapustin's brilliant lectures, expertly chosen syllabus, and care towards students helped to make this course life-changing, I would even wager. There are very few weaknesses to this course. Perhaps the most I could say is that we did not settle on a clear definition of violence in the early weeks of the course. Furthermore, it seemed that we skipped through too many weeks and were rushed for time on some key authors near the end of the semester. These are minor flaws, though, in what was an otherwise excellent course. ",
            "\u00a0This course was amazing, I really can't think of any way it could be improved. Discussions were a perfect balance between being guided by the professor and student insights. Everyone was engaged and seemed like they did the readings and made meaningful contributions to the class. Professor Kapustin's insights were amazing, and every class I felt like I truly learned a lot. ",

        [
            "\u00a0INCREDIBLE. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This was one of my favorite courses at Yale and taught by an engaging professor whose mini-lessons within seminar were some of the more gripping lectures I'd ever received. ",
            "\u00a0YES. take it. ",
            "\u00a0As someone who greatly enjoyed Prof. Kapustins Classics and Moral Choices courses, I was excited by the opportunity to round out my EP&E experience and take Critique. Of all of these courses, I would say that Prof. Kapustin is most in his element with this course. The syllabus is structured around understanding the philosophy of violence and what role (if any) it ought to play in political life. The syllabus is excellent, and includes such critical works as those of Keane, Luhmann, Bourdieu, ONeill, Popper, Arendt, Foucault, and Derrida, among many others (which to my knowledge are seldom discussed in other political theory courses). Kapustins lectures were compelling and engaging; in particular, our session on Popper was perhaps my favorite of his across all of his three classes. As always, he was a strong discussion leader and provided tremendously helpful feedback on essay outlines and submitted assignments. Im hard pressed to think of a better course to finish out the EP&E major at Yale with; a must take for anyone looking for deep intellectual challenge and exposure to critical works in political theory! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! For the sheer pleasure and privilege alone of being taught by Professor Kapustin. But, for any student who has keen interest in learning how to tackle philosophical texts, and has the tenacity and willingness to unpack dense readings, this course is certainly one for you. You will leave with a strong philosophically-grounded understanding of theories on violence and have developed cogent interdisciplinary thinking skills. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course. If you have had some exposure to political theory, definitely take this course. You will read texts that you have probably never encountered before, and you will be challenged. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student who is interested in the course material and philosophy/political philosophy and theory. Professor Kapustin is fantastic and the readings were all great. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you manage to get accepted into the course and are ready to engage with dense readings and very intense discussions of theory, definitely take the course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. If you have familiarity in political theory or philosophy classes, you will get a lot out of it no matter what. The thinkers like Popper, Arendt, Bourdieu, Kojve, etc. are brilliant, so just exposure to them through some readings and through Boris and the class's comments will take you far. However, if you are less familiar with this type of study, you should probably be prepared to dedicate a lot of the time to the readings so you can really synthesize the material. Great class, really exciting syllabus, and Boris is incredibly generous with his time and cares a lot about what he's teaching. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. In fact, this could be one of the most important classes a student can take at Yale. As has already been said, Kapustin is one of the most gifted and insightful instructors at Yale. EVERY course offered by him should be taken and cherished, even if he is just reading the phonebook. Luckily, this course was also filled with fascinating content. Essentially, this course helps students see how \"violence\" (not only physical, direct violence) permeates through society in hidden but pernicious ways. Students who want an elucidated view of how society works and want their worldviews radically re-shaped should take this course. The Bourdieu, Foucault, and Ball readings were especially mind-blowing. Every student who is sincere about learning -- especially in the fields of political philosophy and social science -- must take this course, or their academic experience at Yale will be greatly impoverished. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to any other student, because the material is very interesting and Professor Kapustin offers excellent insights on each reading. Seminar was very well-facilitated; discussions were a perfect balance between being guided by the professor and student insights. Everyone was engaged and seemed like they did the readings and made meaningful contributions to the class. Having the chance to take a class with Professor Kapustin shouldn't be passed up. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Yes. Yes. But only if you genuinely want to learn and immerse yourself in the topic. ",
            "\u00a0Actually challenge yourself at Yale and take this class. Education is about self-reflection; this is one of those rare classes where all your assumptions about politics will be questioned. ",
            "\u00a0For sure, it is potentially life-changing. "
