            "\u00a0A high level of proficiency in understanding and reading  and, to a lesser extent speaking Yiddish. Also, an understanding of what works as translation techniques. ",
            "\u00a0Reading Yiddish provided a solid introduction to Yiddish grammar, and exposed the class to a wide assortment of Yiddish texts. By the end of the course, I was able to read through and translate fairly complicated literary prose with the aid of a computer dictionary. As advertised, this is not a course in Yiddish conversation, and I cannot speak Yiddish by any means; but the course was not solely devoted to the nuts and bolts of grammar, and did provide the students with many chances to engage with Yiddish culture and literature. ",
            "\u00a0Learning to read in Yiddish. ",
            "\u00a0Learned how to translate written Yiddish, including literary Yiddish. ",

            "\u00a0This was a really wonderful course. The grammar-learning was fast-paced but not horribly so, and the texts that we read were interesting. Josh livened up the class with music, food on occasion, and interesting translation activities. ",
            "\u00a0The course was, on the whole, excellent. Joshua designed each module with a real appreciation for proper pacing; as such, grammar review never felt burdensome, and assignments gradually built in difficulty. \r\n\r\nUnrelated to the merits of this specific course, it is a shame that Yale does not have a more extensive set of Yiddish language offerings. Given the sustained interest in Yiddish on the part of the student body, I think that it would behoove Yale to begin a formalized spoken Yiddish program, as well; something along the lines of what UChicago and Columbia offer. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: this is a course that gives you an overall taste of the Yiddish language. You learn a lot about grammar and the cultural Yiddish world. \r\nWeakness: There is a lot of material to cover and you cannot absorb all the information at once. ",
            "\u00a0It's tough at the start if you don't know the Hebrew alphabet, but Josh is a great professor and helped everyone improve both the technical aspects of translation and the literary aspects of translation. Even though I felt like I had to look up every other word (I haven't taken German in years and I don't recognize words of Hebrew or Slavic origin), I got faster over the course and could consistently see improvement.

            "\u00a0Yes, a high recommendation if you're interested in Yiddish as a language or Yiddishkayt (loosely translatable Ashkenazic Jewish culture). Josh was a really good and kind instructor who creates a learning atmosphere that is engaged with the course material. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Especially to students interested in exploring the history and culture of Ashkenazi Jewry, I couldn't recommend the course enough. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because it helps you develop useful skills to read primary sources ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is a great course for anyone who wants to learn to read Yiddish. You'll learn the elements of grammar from the beginning and get a lot practice with different kinds of texts. "
