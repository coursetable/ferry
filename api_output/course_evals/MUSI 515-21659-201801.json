            "\u00a0I got introduced to a new analytical technique, which seems absolutely brilliant! Additionally, I developed a sense of a large-scale musical hearing. ",
            "\u00a0We delved into the Schenkerian method for analyzing a broad range of repertoire. We became intimately familiar with the pieces we analyzed, and gained a strong foundation in the method that will be very useful in our futures as pedagogues. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read, produce, and think about the implications and applications of Schenker graphs.  Thanks to the class, my long-range listening has improved. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Good breadth of material and very good feedback on individual assignments. Most of the basics were learned through readings, but maybe some exercises in the fundamentals would have been a helpful complement to the repertoire applications. ",
            "\u00a0This course had a perfect pace, and the content was engaging every step of the way. I had originally wanted more critical thinking about the method itself, but now that the class is over I'm incredibly pleased with its content. "

            "\u00a0Yes! This is an extremely useful course for a music theorist and any musician who wants to develop performance skills which are based on the compositional structure of a piece. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think all theorists should be exposed to Schenkerian analysis. Whether or not it directly relates to the student's research interests, it is important to have the skills in analysis that Schenker teaches you. I also believe it is a useful tool to teach undergraduate theory, albeit a modified and watered down Schenker. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone else who was at my level of development/understanding.  Whether or not Schenkerian analysis remains central to the field of music theory in the coming decades, I feel as though a course at this level is an advantageous step in any theorist's development.
