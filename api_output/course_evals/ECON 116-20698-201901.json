A weakness of  the course  were the review sessions leading up to the exams. Usually there were several review sessions (on the order of 5-6) but often times only 1 or 2 of them were helpful.

This is something that should've been done at the beginning of the semester. Since lectures are packed with so many people, it's hard to form relationships with your peers. I felt extremely isolated in this regard and couldn't form a study group on my own.\r\n\r\nInstructors did a poor job outlining which textbook sections were relevant and which were not. I found myself confused many times throughout the semester when the chapters in the textbook were very dissimilar to the lectures. Students who read the textbook should not end up more confused than students who don't read the textbook. ",

An example could be that instead of purely focusing on how to calculate the growth of a stock, more of a focus on the theories of how the stock market works (Schiller vs. Keynes vs. Chicago). ",

            "\u00a0Strong in terms of its overview style\r\nWeaknesses: Honestly, Dr. Hawkins posts so much helpful material on Canvas that it can sometimes be overwhelming, this isn't so much a weakness per se as something that I felt I could never keep up with\r\nMoreover, section should be more thorough in my opinion; I found myself not going because it was kind of useless ",
            "\u00a0The course needs a much stronger and more coherent curriculum.  I think it is an issue that the lecturer is not the same person as the course director because Aleh really had no reason to try to teach us in a way that we would build a strong conceptual foundation.  As a result, the problem sets were often thrown together with all of Aleh's random tangents (one of them had a whole question asking us to research how blockchain technology on a basic level which has nothing to do with econ), and I had little interest in the class.  They try all these things to try and make people come to lecture and it would really be easiest to just teach an engaging curriculum for people interested in the macroeconomy. ",

            "\u00a0Strength: Tsyvinski is a homie and a good teacher. 10/10 would recommend.\r\nWeakness: It's an intro econ class  'nuff said ",

            "\u00a0Strengths of this course are the instructors, both professor Tsyvinski and Hawkins are knowledgable and passionate about the topic. They are both excellent at presenting the material in a relevant way. The biggest weakness of this course are the sections. I found that the sections were too focused on elaborating on the material or introducing new material instead of helping to reinforce the material taught in lecture. ",

The course is pretty easy, and I think one major weakness is the approach students take to the course. After every exam, my peers would hope that everyone else failed so they would have an edge due to the curved scale for econ, which is a very unfortunate and not learning-centric approach to a class. Another weakness is there were many times where I felt squashed when trying to ask questions. I think the instructors need to learn how to answer questions better without making students feel like they do not want to help them or that their questions are invalid. ",

            "\u00a0I think a general strength of the course is the material (I think it lends itself well to interesting lectures) and Prof. Tsyvinski is a great lecturer. A weakness for the course, though, was the problem sets. They were long and tedious and I learned very little from them because they were structured too heavily on applications of the material, when I hadn't even practiced the material itself other than in section. Additionally, I see a weakness as the class' focus on big data. Although big data is a great tool for lectures and economics in general, I think it is important to also teach macroeconomic theory first absent big data, especially when data can complicate the material. ",

Being completely honest, this was one of the most organized and effective courses I have taken thus far. \r\n\r\nAs an aside, it would be extremely beneficial if Econ 115 (microeconomics lecture) could be taught and organized in such a way that Econ 116 was.

Though, many of the questions asked on homework problems and tests were poorly worded and more time was spent trying to figure out if a problem was a trick question or not then on actually demonstrating our knowledge of the material.

            "\u00a0The strengths are that you learn the basic material - I'd say some of the weaknesses are just some of the test questions can be somewhat petty, in that they'll ask about a random fact about British wheat prices in 1850, which featured on one lecture slide. (Most of the questions are conceptual or model-based, but I did find these types of questions annoying). Aside from that, I thought the class was good. ",
            "\u00a0This is by far the most organized course I have ever taken at Yale. Literally. I have taken about 15 courses. Every course should be modeled about this course. Everything is just so extremely organized and instructions extremely clear. This is what a Yale course should look like. Dr Hawkins is very very extremely organized. Yale should hire him to hold training sessions for other TFs on how to organize a course and make sure that everything is clear. The only weakness with this course is that there aren't enough practice materials available to adequately prepare you for the exams. Some students, like myself, require an adequate amount of practice over and over to understand some concepts. With very few resources to prepare, this was a bit of a challenge. If we could have at least 6 practice finals, for instance, that would be great. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the subject matter is all very important.\r\nWeaknesses: the course covers too much, forcing the professor to have to rush through material during lecture. Students arent able to learn much from lecture as much as a result. I felt that if he focused on answering students questions and spending more Time teaching us important foundational information, we would learn more. Jay Emerson who teaches intro stats (stats 100) has a lecture style I find the most helpful in any QR class Ive ever taken. He expects us to read through the material in the textbook every week, and then focuses in lecture on further clarifying what the information means and why it matters and how its all connected. \r\n\r\nAlso, the TAs should all be good at teaching. Some TAs would go on and on during section talking about some minor detail mentioned in class rather than focusing on getting us to understand the bigger picture. Students didnt go to section as a result.\r\nMy TA was William Hawkins who is AMAZING at teaching and helping us understand why the material we learn matters and how its all connected. Every TA should learn from him. I also think he should be the lecturer, not Aleh Tsyvinski ",

            "\u00a0Professor Tsyvinski was a fabulous professor and William Hawkins was an excellent resource and course director. They made the concepts engaging and more easy to understand. The structure of the 2 midterm exams and 2 weekly problem sets was effective in solidifying topics in my mind and allowing me to have continuous application. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the setup of the course. I'm a senior and the course was one of the most organized I've taken at Yale. Piazza was very helpful and response time was prompt. I liked the easy availability of files like practice tests, problem sets, and answers. The CANVAS quizzes were great ways to refresh your memory of the lecture, and then try again, and to ease you into the problem sets. I believe that there should be a scanning option for problem sets, as I was sick one day and could not manually submit. ",
            "\u00a0Its a very practical course that provides students with a solid understanding of the language and base theory behind macroeconomics. I feel I can now interpret more of the news and legislative action taken to address contemporary economic policy because of the language I gained exposure to in this course. The only weakness is that I wish there was more theory to learn; we got bogged down in a lot of data and all at times during which I was hoping to know more of the theoretical backing of present models.

            "\u00a0I would if they were looking for an intro macro course. No complaints. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Only for a major requirement. Better off just taking a trade or finance course out of interest. ",
            "\u00a0If you plan on doing econ or anything related to it then yes. An interesting course. Also Prof Tsyvinski is a great lecturer and is fun and engaging. They just revamped the course and it is really well structured. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This course is not too difficult and the lecture format is nice. Sections are helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to students who either want to major in economics or are interested in seeing if they might want to major in econ. I would strongly reccomend taking it with Dr. Hawkins. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah, for the usefulness associated with knowing the material, the work and effort demanded by the course is not unreasonably high. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think the information is important to know and the class is well taught ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend. I think that this is a good introductory course into macroeconomics. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, for any student going into economics or just looking to do an introductory course for fun, this class is well taught, engaging, and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I would, but would strongly recommend they pick which TA they have for section carefully. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, most people have this as a requirement but its also a good course for anybody to learn more about economics ",
            "\u00a0Yes if they wanted to major in economics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think every student should take intro Econ courses to gain a basic grasp of very important topics, regardless of the major you are pursuing. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in macroeconomics, yes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, as a good introduction to macroeconomic thinking. If you want to learn how things like externalities, wages, etc. should be considered on a market-wide level,  you'll like this class. ",
            "\u00a0Everyone who wants to study economics and haven't before would have to take the introductory macroeconomics course anyway; I would recommend although with slight changes in the way it is taught. ",
            "\u00a0It is a requirement but the professor is really great ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Definitely if it's taught by Tsyvinsky. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class. You learn a good amount of material, the workload is really quite manageable, and it's altogether interesting. It won't take up too much of your time and the material is interesting (at least if you find econ as a subject interesting then you'll like it). ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Take it. Workload is very low. One pset a week which took me about an hour a week to complete. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very well organized and the TFs/the head instructor is very proactive about helping and giving students materials to study. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only if the student is interested in economics because the class is very challenging and unless you have a TA that teaches well (both in section and at office hours) you will have to teach yourself the material, since the lectures arent very helpful, ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to other students who wish to establish a solid foundation of macroeconomic analysis. I am unsure if this class is representative of other higher level economics courses, but students can definitely get the feel of what macroeconomics in general looks like. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, its pretty interesting and not too hard ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I'd recommend it because it applies to the real world ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was not difficult but still interesting and handled genuinely useful material ",
            "\u00a0Yes; it provided a good foundation for thinking about macroeconomics ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is very useful to learn what this class teaches. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Great prof at TAs and lots of office hours ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course. You learn a lot, there is potential to do well, and the professors care about you. ",
            "\u00a0Probably would not recommend it unless you're taking it for your major. It's not actively bad, but you can find a better class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course is wonderful specifically because of Professor Tsyvinksi and William Hawkins. The information and basic curriculum of the class is pretty standard to anything you will get in an intro macro class, but it was overall engaging and enjoyable because of Professor Tsyvinski and William Hawkins engaging, applicable, and very accessible teaching styles. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. You'll really enjoy Professor Tsyvinski's \"lifehacks\" sprinkled amongst vital economic knowledge that everyone should know, like how the Fed works and how to predict a bull or bear economic cycle. We also learn to apply our knowledge to other majors. In the last lecture, Professor Tsyvinski taught us how to price carbon emissions depending on the severity the carbon cycle and how much we value the future. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, you need it for the major and its actually pretty useful for your day to day lives. Macro doesnt go too far beyond the basics so you really get to understand what real world economists and academics mean when formulating policy or in academic literature. You learn a lot and Aleh is awesome. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I think the topics touched upon are very relevant, work load is not too big so it is easy to balance this class with others. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it taught me much about the economy as a whole. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the class is not only useful, but Professor Tsyvinski also presents the information in really interesting ways that make it feel relevant and applicable to our lives. The class is definitely worth it! ",

            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This was a great introduction to macroeconomics, something I had never learned about before. The lecturer and team (William Hawkins, etc.) clearly worked very hard to make it an enjoyable and valuable class. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, I think it is a Yale staple ",
            "\u00a0I would say to try to avoid this course if you have any background in macroeconomics or have a strong math background. That being said you will still be missing a lot of interesting understanding into economic functioning and would need to replace this with some kind of literature. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It manages to teach the fundamentals of macro economics in an engaging way and one that makes you aware of your surroundings. ",
            "\u00a0If they arent an Econ major then maybe not.  This course wasnt easy and I dont know why youd take it if you werent majoring in Econ. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was very interesting and engaging, and I genuinely feel like a more educated and prepared citizen after taking it. ",
            "\u00a0It was a good basic introduction to Macroeconomics, but I think I would tell a friend to start with an intermediate level class but prepare thoroughly by watching videos and reading some intro macro texts ahead of time. ",
            "\u00a0Yep. A good way to be introduced to macro. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I think its overall a good course, even for non econ majors teaches so many fundamental things. ",
            "\u00a0Only if you need it as a prerequisite. ",
            "\u00a0If you're already interested in microeconomics and/or it is a requirement for your major then yes. ",
            "\u00a0I would still recommend the seminar version of this class to another student, but less so than for Microeconomics. "
