            "\u00a0I took this course because I wanted to think more about ethnography and anthropology (about a topic I'm interested in, too), and Prof. Ramos-Zayas delivered that. I think if you're generally curious about the Americas and its young people, this is a great course to take. I ended up doing most of the readings and the response paper the day before but the paper forced me to engage with the materials in a way I thought was effective. "
