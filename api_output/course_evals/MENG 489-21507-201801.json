            "\u00a0I learned the mechanical design process all the way from ideation to detailed design analysis and fabrication.  But more importantly I learned how to actually build things and put them together i.e. a lot of machine shop skills. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about designing devices. My group project had a LOT of small bits, which are themselves pretty easy to design. Making sure that all the bits fit together and have joining mechanisms was a real learning process, but I definitely got better at it throughout the semester. All the ABET stuff that they just throw in feels useless because most of the teaching staff acts like it's useless and its never discussed again (patent law, corporate whatevers, etc), but it could be interesting if those things are actually interesting to you.

            "\u00a0I learned how Gantt charts work ",
            "\u00a0Intense amount of practical mechanical engineering design. Especially the ordering process and iterative design. ",
            "\u00a0This course focused on the design process and ensuring that students very thoroughly followed through with said process. It is one of the few design courses in the major, but it allowed for ample opportunity to design and build a physical, tangible prototype. I gained loads more experience in the machine shop and became more familiar with the concept of designing for manufacturing. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Glenn is honestly the biggest weakness of this course. He has great insight but when he is the adviser to the project his guidance almost always brings you further away from your goal. Also this year the way that the split the students into groups just seemed not to have the students interest in mind. Seventy-5 percent of the class did not get the project of their choice, not that any of the projects were interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I feel as though more machine shop training and experience prior to this class would be beneficial to the major as a whole and would make the production of the prototype of a higher quality. ",
            "\u00a0This course had little to no strengths. It needs to be a year-long course beginning in the fall. There needs to be more of a choice with regards to projects. Focus less on the write-ups because they were a complete waste of time and we were often so busy catering our time to things we had to include in the write-up that never helped us one bit. Let us choose our own project, none of these were interesting and I hated working on it. ",
            "\u00a0Weakness: undergrad classes did not fully prepare me for this class, therefore I lacked machining and fabrication experience ",
            "\u00a0Too many assignments and too structured, we spent the majority of the semester thinking about and analyzing our problem and not enough actually CADing and building our prototype.  Less emphasis on ideation and analysis and more on modeling and building. ",
            "\u00a0This year there were five people actively involved in teaching the course: Aaron Dollar, Beth Bennett, Glenn Weston-Murphy, and TAs: Hong Ji Min and Neil Bajaj. The people that were handling all the logistic work were Beth and Ji Min (shocker: women end up told to do administrative work and not engineering). There was never a real explanation for this that was offered or that I could find and it was really disheartening. I don't think that professors owe their students explanations for their division of labor necessarily, but they do have a responsibility to not recreate typical bad situations. Recreating bad engineering/STEM dynamics is definitely a weakness of this course. \r\n\r\nA strength of this course is in the collective suffering at the end of the semester that really brings the class together. Also the teaching staff were SUPER available to us and helpful throughout the whole course. \r\n\r\nAnother weakness was that most of the deliverables didn't actually help us in any way with the thing we were supposed to be building, and they took a lot of time. We could have spent a fraction of that time talking with the teaching team who ended up telling us what to do anyway - most of the deliverables were for designs that were discarded once we tried to order materials. ",
            "\u00a0Well, for one, the class is sexist. \r\n\r\nThere was one male and one female professor and a male and female TA, honestly, pretty good gender ratios for this program. But the women spent all the time doing the grading and logistics while the men were allowed to work on the actual engineering aspects of the class. That's absurd and frankly sexist. Beth Bennett is an amazing engineer and I wanted to get to learn from her and instead the only time we spent working together was when she gave back homework or sent emails saying she couldn't open our assignments. \r\n\r\nThis is no way to end an engineering degree as a woman. ",
            "\u00a0The course has so many tiny assignments. I guess it's good for not worrying about 40% of your grade in the last two weeks, but the little thigns sometimes are  hard to track and get in the way of actually designing your project. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course would be more effective if it were a year long project; one semester felt too fast for the demands of the course.  Additionally, the course would be better if people got to choose a project they were interested in doing rather than having pre-selected clients. ",
            "\u00a0The worst thing about this course is that it makes us do stuff we have never done before. It's like trying to take 3 classes at once and then also build things. Honestly, I wish we had more time to build something that was more cool. This should be a year long course so we can design something that has more utility. ",
            "\u00a0I believe this course had too many assignmentsnot that I did not want to do a lot of work but because the multiple assignments got in the way of working on the overall project for this mechanical design course. I found that our team was focusing time and effort on deliverables, weekly reports, lab notebook checks, and peer evaluations that we did not make as much progress as we could on the overall project as a whole. I understand that understanding the concepts behind the various deliverables is important, but a lengthy assignment on each while still managing a full courseload was too much. I also believe the fact that the instructors and teaching fellows kept giving us feedback on changing our design while we were half-way through the course proved ineffective for our team to make concrete decisions and prototype early. ",
            "\u00a0There were so many deliverables that seemed to hardly relate to our design; we were required to put in a ton of work figuring out certain failure modes, analyses, etc, yet much of the work never resurfaced in our actual design. The workload was pretty high throughout the semester, but we had a difficult time procuring desired materials, which caused the end of the semester to be packed with work. The teaching staff (Glenn, Aaron, Beth) was very supportive and dedicated loads of their time to ensuring that we had the advice and counsel that we needed. "

        [
            "\u00a0Honestly, considered dropping ABET while taking this course but then I realized I need this credit to graduate. I think Beth should have a greater role beyond grading, because I can honestly say Aaron Dollar could not give a single (expletive) about this class. Glenn was not of much help either. If you take this class do it because you have to. DO NOT TAKE IT IF YOU ARE NOT ABET. ",
            "\u00a0I would never recommend this class. Do you need this for your ABET degree? I would consider dropping ABET unless this course was changed. I learned absolutely nothing except how to BS stuff. The projects were all sub-par at best and I have never seen such a large group of students hate their lives so much while taking a course. There is one student of the 20 or so who enjoyed this class. I have been through some bad classes but this may have topped them off. We were given a bunch of green environmental type projects that were extremely uninteresting. Not only this, we were given barely any time to actually work on them. One semester is far from long enough to complete an engineering project and learn the design process. Biggest waste of time. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it, but I recommend taking other design/prototyping classes before taking this one ",
            "\u00a0If you're looking at this class you're probably ABET which means you have to take it.  Honestly it's going to be an L no matter who teaches it, it's a lot of work and takes up a lot of time so take it with a light course load.  All the technical staff and advisors just argue with each other and never agree on any concrete advice for your projects so don't count on them being a whole lot of help. ",
            "\u00a0Don't take this course unless you're ABET because it's just way too much work. In the last two weeks before our project was supposed to be complete, I think I spent ~60 hours in the classroom/shop trying to get it all together. I'm fairly sure the two other people in my group did as well. Most of the work throughout the semester doesn't even help with the project, so it's necessarily back-loaded (and not just my group procrastinating). Good luck! PS Beth and Glenn are great! Ask them for help always and you'll get it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, you get a better picture of being a mechanical engineer in the profession.\r\nGlenn Weston Murphy  is amazing. ",
            "\u00a0It's MechE senior project, you don't have a choice! ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend this course to a student who is deeply interested in Mechanical Engineering and willing to put in a lot of time to bring a neat project to fruition. It is a difficult course to take during one's final semester at Yale, so be wary of your schedule when taking this course. "
