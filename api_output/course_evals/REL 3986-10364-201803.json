            "\u00a0Energetic and engaging. He has created a safe environment for the students in this group. His wealth of experience is remarkable and relevant. ",
            "\u00a0Alison is the best. She has helped us create community in our practicum section so I feel truly supported by my group. I can't think of any weaknesses. I'm so glad I ended up with such a great facilitator! ",
            "\u00a0Katie treats the members of her section like children. The time spent together is not only vaguely disrespectful but also a waste. Nothing is learned; nothing is gained. ",
            "\u00a0Very friendly, calm presence, welcoming. Not so great at keeping us organized and on track for the syllabus. We never really actually did anything of what we were supposed to. Not that that was a huge problem - our practicum was a great place to relax and reflect on our weeks each week, including Supervised Ministry but also life in general. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: warm, gentle, kind, generous, understanding\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: a little unorganized ",
            "\u00a0Alison was a fantastic facilitator who got us through a rough fall in the world and at Yale. She shepherded us in a truly pastoral way and made showing up for a 4-5:30 pm class on a Friday not miserable. I do wish we'd discussed our sites more. ",
            "\u00a0Tracy created a warm environment. She was relaxed and accepting, and seems to care about our experiences. I really enjoyed the dynamics of our group. ",
            "\u00a0Rev. Mathis is wonderful. He facilitated our times in a really meaningful way and I thoroughly enjoyed the time. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed Tracy. She encouraged good conversation. Sometimes, she made faces when people said things as if she was judging the things just said. ",
            "\u00a0Tracy created a comfortable environment for our reflection group. ",
            "\u00a0He is a kind and spiritually sensitive leader with a talent for facilitating discussion. The section leader makes or breaks the practicum group (and the school portion of this internship class). Hes excellent and has a sense of what actually matters. ",
            "\u00a0I do not find any weaknesses of Rev. Bailey. He is really approachable and friendly person. And he also has a really deep knowledge and social justice issues related to philanthropy. His insight brought me to have a huge transition from ethics to distributive justice. And I am hoping to make my answers on ethics in philanthropy next semester under his guidance. ",
            "\u00a0Tracy is incredibly knowledgeable about both the New Haven area where many of our sites are, and also the challenges of ministry. I am grateful for the perspective she brings to our work, and her thoughtful and attentive engagement with our reflections. She helps us to identify important patterns and challenges in the work, and it seems clear she is willing to advocate for us and help us see when things are sub-optimal, or not how something in our site should be going. ",
            "\u00a0Bill was a great facilitator of conversation and he sought to bridge our practicum learning with our site experiences. By the semester's midpoint, he largely abandoned all pretense of following the (confusing) practicum assignments and we spent most of our time in conversation about our experiences and learning - which is truly what we wanted in the first place!\r\n\r\nMy site is in a non-church settings and sometimes I felt Bill couldn't relate to non-church contexts, since it seems he has only worked in congregations. It didn't seriously impact my experience in the group, but I struggled at times to explain the dynamics to him and other members of the group. ",
            "\u00a0I think her great strength is that she is a positive and supportive presence.  She was able to create an open environment where we could share and be open with each other. ",
            "\u00a0Sheppard is so kind, and always helps me to take a deep breath and listen to what's around me. I feel very grounded in our group. He is very supportive and appropriately critical when we are having difficulties. He handles our experiences with great care and his pastoral presence is very strong. I really appreciate how he is able to bring in concrete examples of challenges from his own experiences as well. ",
            "\u00a0He listened carefully, gave timely and appropriate feedback, and lead the group in discussion. ",
            "\u00a0He is such a strong and lovely pastoral presence. He was so good at facilitating discussion while giving us space to make our own observations and draw our own conclusions. I felt like he and my entire group genuinely cared about my experiences and my flourishing. Shepard is amazing. e ",
            "\u00a0Alison has no weaknesses! ",
            "\u00a0Katie's strengths are in her energy and enthusiasm. She is bring, friendly, and genuinely cares about us and our success, and I am grateful for that. Katie's weaknesses are that sometimes in the sake of raising the energy and enthusiasm in the room, she can neglect the pastoral need to let people who are having a bad day simply have a bad day. Practicum on the whole has improved dramatically from the rocky start we had, and I am looking forward to the spring semester. ",
            "\u00a0Katie was great at creating a safe and supportive evnvironment for fostering peer reflection and discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Alison has the great ability to listen. As students, assuming future roles where listening is critical, it was refreshing to not only see this skill so effectively modeled, but to actually be listened to and affirmed was priceless. Alison made us (her students) feel like we and our concerns mattered.  In addition, she was very profession and knowledgeable  about the course and the various vocations we listed. I have enjoyed this class and have learned many concepts, skills, perspectives and negotiation techniques. "
