            "\u00a0I developed many valuable skills by taking this course, such as oscilloscope-operating skills, experience with thermocouples, and the proper way to perform bomb calorimetry. I learned a great deal of new material, such as the relation between the speed of sound in a gas and its heat capacity ratio, the logic behind how NMR works, and how to build an electrical circuit. ",
            "\u00a0Obviously, the most central skills gained were the ability to quantitatively analyze data and synthesize lots of experimental information to obtain theoretically relevant values for chemical processes. Familiarization with many of the practical aspects of physical chemistry research, including NMR, calorimetry, etc., as well as an introduction to simple computer programming, was also informative. One large personal insight was the way in which very interesting quantities from p-chem theory could be approached obliquely or counterintuitively from relatively simple physical measurements. (E.g., going from the speed of sound to heat capacity ratio, or using bomb calorimetry of CDDT to find the resonance energy of benzene.) ",
            "\u00a0This course should be renamed \"How to use Excel and Propagate Error in Physical Chemistry.\" You learn how to take measurements and make pretty graphs out of them with lots of error propagation and lots of unnecessary writing in the process. You don't really learn anything new outside of P-Chem 1 and P-Chem 2 or in any advanced-level chemistry courses, but I suppose if you'd like to learn how to write long, sophisticated lab reports on a few minute topics in physical chemistry then it is helpful in that sense. ",
            "\u00a0Analysis of (huge) amounts of data. Laboratory skills relevant to physical chemists and chemists in general who want to do wet lab work. Theory behind all of this. Excruciating details of how the equipment works. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of patience in this class. Labs take a long time and lab reports take a very long time to write. It was also neat to learn about different pieces of lab equipment and it was interesting to do the experiments, although some were a tad boring. ",
            "\u00a0I learned lab techniques such as constructing a circuit, using gas cylinders/regulator, using a vacuum pump and bomb calorimetry. I also learned how to perform rigorous data analysis, write a basic computer program and pull on my last bit of will power when the rest of my motivation or interest vanished. ",
            "\u00a0I feel like I learned both a lot and nothing at all from this course. This course was highly repetitive, tedious, and quite frankly idiotic. So many things had no point to them, and grading rubrics for lab reports were completely nonsensical. You could completely understand a lab and still do poorly on a lab report if you did not put exactly what Vaccaro was looking for, which of course he does not disclose. This class took up way too much time and stress. Although I did enjoy much of the course material, it made little difference because the demands of the course were so insane. ",

            "\u00a0This class taught me a lot of skills in a short period of time. First and foremost, I became more proficient at taking precise data of a variety of types. I also got better at analyzing lots of data, doing considerable error analysis, and generally using excel. I got better at thinking critically about results and describing concisely the theory behind experiments. Also, I got a lot better at doing a ton of work, and having a ton of work to do all the time.

            "\u00a0Strengths: This course taught me more than any other course I have taken at Yale. It teaches both a great deal of content and valuable lab skills. Lectures are very clear and well-organized.\r\nWeaknesses: The lab reports seem more like drills on statistics than actual lab reports at times. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course include the very organized nature of Professor Vaccaro's lecture notes, handouts, etc. However, at certain points this begins to feel like an information overload that makes it less hard to figure out which are the most salient details. The underlying theory and the experience in the lab is generally rewarding and intellectually stimulating, although that is balanced out by the drudgery of the work outside of the classroom and lab. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Learn how to use Excel, how to propagate error, how to write long lab reports and write like a true scientist. The teaching fellows were pretty good at explaining things and they help you when you get lost on an experiment. Lectures on Fridays with Vaccaro were really well-taught; he actually explains the concepts well and derives anything you need to show. You pick up a few useful equations in the process that you might not otherwise encounter.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lab reports are unnecessarily long to the point that you feel like Vaccaro makes them drawn-out just to keep the reputation of the class as \"one of the hardest at Yale.\" You don't really learn much new chemistry, just how to manipulate some data with error bars and write lots of pages to answer the questions at hand. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: We learn a lot, many of the skills are useful.  \r\n\r\nWeakness: The sheer amount of time it takes to do the unbelievable amount of work required by this class. It's actually inhuman. Even if you start ahead of time, the work never ends. You submit the lab reports not because of the deadline but because at some point, you just have to give up. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that the labs are fairly easy to carry out, the TAs are helpful, and Friday lectures are taught well. The cons are that there is not much guidance in writing lab reports and sometimes you don't know exactly what to put into your lab report resulting in stupid points being missed. The lab reports take a range of 35 - 70 hours to write and getting a mediocre grade after a lot of hard and unguided work is though to deal with. The course could be improved if the instructions for reports included EXACTLY what the graders want. I always had all the information but sometimes didn't put everything in because it seemed trivial or unnecessary. The course could also be improved by having shorter lab reports because they are so long. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a lot of work and I believe that one could learn 90-95% as much with about half the work. The labs for the most part are interesting and relevant. I believe they reinforced things from pchem 1 and a bit from pchem 2 and I really enjoyed learning new lab skills. However, the lab reports are graded in a manner where the TAs (who are great) look for places to mark you down instead of places to give you points. There's an example lab report but not really, a real example for an actual lab (maybe not one done in class) would be more useful. Better yet, a rubric. It's not very clear what's being graded and so I think part of the reason the reports are so awful is that students throw in every possible thing they can think of because what will be graded? It's unclear. What sample calculations are required? It's unclear and safer to spend 10 hours typing up absolutely everything. The calculations required were often repetitive and of course in science you have to do multiple runs of things, however maybe cutting back on this would help. Because each run requires calculations, plots and analysis and this adds up. This is especially annoying when one discovers a mistake (as one does while learning) but then has to redo everything. The lectures were helpful but sometimes a review from pchem 1. They were super organized, only suggestion would be to put the lecture slides online because the printed packets are black and white. The final was challenging but fair and studying for it reinforced concepts I had learned. ",
            "\u00a0Everyone knows this course is horrible, Vaccaro knows the obvious ways it could be improved but does nothing to do so. ",
            "\u00a0This course is an incredible amount of work, simple as that. One of the weakest areas is the disconnect between what is actually done in lab for an experiment and the written reports that are completed. Although there is ample support provided and an abundance of background information given in course packets and the weekly lectures, you can still feel totally lost and hopeless. ",
            "\u00a0The course was well-designed for learning. The lab reports were long, but they did require more deep engagement with the underlying theory than any other laboratory course I've taken. I felt like I learned a lot. ",
            "\u00a0While I did learn a lot from this class, I would have learned the same amount with fewer hours spent on the class in terms of trials per experiment or pages per report. It was very inconsiderate of the amount of work assigned/expected of each student and of that fact that this was not the only class we were taking. The hours put into lab (we often went over the allotted 4 hours) simply to conduct multiple trials of the same experiment is a waste of everyone's time and resources, from the students' to the TAs'. I understand the need for multiple trials but class data can be compiled rather than having the same group conduct the same experiment multiple times. There's nothing to be learned from turning a knob multiple times. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very thorough. All labs required thorough understanding of the underlying theory and methods, and data had to be taken carefully. Furthermore, Prof. Vaccaro's handouts and lectures were very impressive in their attention to detail, clarity, and informativeness. Despite how impressive the course was, I do think that it required too much work from the students. The lab reports were entirely the issue (I know this has been repeated by generations of students). Each report took a minimum of 20 hours and a maximum of 70 hours to complete, owing to the numerous components that were required (ie data analysis, figure making, pertinent background, discussion of results, figure presentation and formatting). All of these components are required in a formal lab report and I do think I got much better at thinking like a scientist; however, the amount of work required was unreasonable for a student that has other classes and commitments. This class took a toll on my mental and physical health. I am not a procrastinator and yet there were times, especially when it came to the final two labs, where I was hardly able to eat proper meals, certainly did not have time to do exercise of any kind, slept little, and had a very dark outlook on things. I think the best way to make this overall very informative course more manageable is to eliminate some of the material that was not directly relate to physical chemistry. Most notably, electronics, while important for physical chemists, are not totally crucial for understanding physical chemical phenomena (I'm sure Prof. Vaccaro would disagree, but I think if something is to be reduced, it's that). Yes, the oscilloscope an function generators are used in several labs; however, their usage is very simple. Perhaps the electronics lab could be shortened such that the oscilloscope and function generator are introduced, but additional topics such as voltage integrators/differentiators, analog circuits, and digital circuits are left out. These topics only really came up formally on the final. Every once in a while, something related to these topics was mentioned in the context of other labs (ie passing NMR signal through a low-pass filter), but using this information did not require a deep understanding of the electronics (simply repeating was said in the packet was sufficient). By cutting the electronics lab to one day, it would be possible to have the first five labs reasonably due before Thanksgiving break (or at the very latest, the 5th one could be due right after break). That would provide enough time for doing the final report without pushing every other commitment to the side during the busy final few weeks of class.\r\n\r\nA much simpler improvement could be to change the order of the reports. The last two labs are by far the longest and they come at the busiest time of the year. If they were not back-to-back, students would have a little bit of time to breath. As the calorimetry report is a full report, it could be kept in the final lab slot. The NMR lab could be moved to the perhaps the third slot. I understand that structure usually comes after thermodynamics, but this is just a suggestion purely designed to reduce pressure. ",
            "\u00a0The amount of work is ridiculous. Honestly, it takes away from learning about physical chemistry. The material actually was interesting, but it could not be fully appreciated because the labs took such a long time. The reports are so long that you start to dislike the subject. The only saving grace is that the TA's are wonderful. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: It is more math-heavy than first semester PChem, which I liked. The lab reports, though long, taught me a lot about PChem that I normally wouldn't learn in pchem lecture itself. The grading was also very fair and TAs know the large amount of work this class has. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Still don't understand why electronics was such a big part of the course. And of course, lab reports were wayyyy too long. But I guess at this point that's just the class. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0If you are not interested in chemistry, do not take this course. The amount of effort required would be too much.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in chemistry, take it. I took this course concurrently with the first-semester physical chemistry lecture, and honestly, I learned more from the lab.\r\n\r\nWarning: do not procrastinate with this course. If you start your lab reports two weeks in advance, you will be fine. If you start your lab reports two days before the due date, even if you devote all your time for those two days to the report, it will not be enough time. ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend 330L if you are definitely a chemistry major pursuing a B.S. I also wouldn't advise taking it before the sophomore year or taking it just out of curiosity or interest. While Professor Vaccaro is engaging, cares about his students, and executes the course well, it is simply too much of a drain on one's energy for me to recommend it unless it is required. ",
            "\u00a0Only take this if you're a chemistry major or seriously enjoy writing lab reports. ",
            "\u00a0Would I \"recommend\" this class? I mean, if you're taking it, you have literally no choice. ",
            "\u00a0If you're not a chemistry major, don't take this class. If you are, then you have to and that sucks. Lab reports are a pain and as awful as they say they are. Lab reports take anywhere from 35 - 70 hours to write with about 45 hours being the average time it takes to write one. Start reports as soon as you can. Use fall and Thanksgiving break to write reports and you'll be thankful for it when you get back. Labs themselves aren't bad but can be very long. They usually end after 5:00 pm. Friday lectures are actually pleasant and are well taught. The final is a written exam and is difficult. It encompasses everything in the course and can be over the tiniest detail. ",
            "\u00a0The amount of work for this class is likely to make you spontaneously combust but jokes on you because if you do that, be prepared to calculate your own enthalpy of combustion. Absolutely don't take this class if you don't have to because you could learn almost as much with a lot less work. However, if you have to take it (in which case you are probably looking at course reviews for entertainment, solace or to somehow prepare yourself), then be comforted by the fact that the material is actually really interesting and you will learn. You'll meet other students in your major and you'll also have a good professor and TAs to help you. You'll put in the work but you'll also get a lot out of it. ",
            "\u00a0Only take this if you have to. I wouldn't wish this workload upon my worst enemy. ",
            "\u00a0As a Chemistry major, you don't have a choice. Good luck. Otherwise, I absolutely would not recommend this class if physical chemistry is not a topic you're extremely comfortable with or if you'd like to have time to sleep, eat, and/or socialize. This class single-handedly made this semester the hardest one yet in terms of academics, the workload, and the amount of stress and anxiety it has caused me. It constantly felt as though I was putting all my hours into this class and didn't have enough time to work on my other assignments for other classes, let alone sleep, eat or socialize. ",
            "\u00a0No. ",
            "\u00a0If you're taking this course, chances are you're required to take it. You've certainly heard rumors about this course's workload. You probably have that older chemistry major friend that keeps telling you about how work-intensive it is. You've probably read the scathing reviews. This was the case for me and I did not believe that it could be so bad. I am not a big procrastinator, but even still the workload was incredible. The course starts out quickly as expected with a three-week electronics unit. This section is fast and conceptually difficult, and because of that the report takes what seems like a while at the time. After this first section, all of the other units are directly related to physical chemistry. Each lab is very thorough and interesting. Professor Vacarro puts so much effort into this class. Taking data is usually simple and kind of fun. The labs are entirely what is so hard and time-consuming about this class. When you start the second lab, which is the first \"real\" lab (even though it's abbreviated), it might not seem too difficult. But it will takes longer than expected. And from there the labs only get longer and longer. For me each lab took ~20-70 hours. There are 6 labs and I turned in a total of 263 pages. Some turned in more and others less. The theory behind each lab is interesting and it's rewarding to work through exactly how everything works. But once I got over the initial aha of figuring out why I did what I did in lab and started to explain things on paper, I still had to spend the numerous hours doing all of the other components of the lab. Each lab required lots of data and error analysis, so be prepared to use a lot of excel. The worst part of each lab was figure and table preparation and especially formatting. There are also so many figures, each of which requires precise placement and captions. You will also have to include appendices to describe how you did calculations and other important theory that didn't fit in the text. Overall, there are a lot of parts to each lab and even when you think you are close to being done you still have a long way to go because of endless formatting. The first four labs are tough but you will get through them. It really gets hard with the final two. Make sure to do as much work on the fifth lab as you can over Thanksgiving break because you will need practically all of the rest of the semester to finish these labs. ",
            "\u00a0No way. Only take this class if you have no other choice. You will be miserable, you will start to dislike chemistry and start to question yourself. You will pull more all nighters than is reasonably healthy and probably knock a few years off your life. Hope you don't enjoy having free time or having friends, because you will not have time for that. Hope you don't like sleeping either. It is honestly just miserable. The labs are unnecessarily long and just annoying. The material is not that intellectually hard, it just takes forever, and no matter how long you spend on them, you always feel as if you wish you had more time to work on it. I feel bad that you have to take this class, but it's the same every year and they don't change anything about it, so good luck, you'll get through it. Also, learn to except a lower standard of health, because that will be your new reality. ",
            "\u00a0RUN AS FAR AWAY AS YOU CAN CHILD! No but honestly, take AT MOST four classes the semester you take this. Regardless of how smart you are, this class will take up many many hours a week. Be smart with your late days in the beginning, because come reading week you will need all of those for the last two reports. If you like math, this course has a large amount of derivations that aren't exactly necessary but kinda cool if you love that stuff. Go to the lectures. They help with the reports. The lab itself is not hard apart from electronics (I still don't know how any of that stuff works), but as you have heard, the reports are very grueling. Regardless, you have my thoughts and prayers this semester because this course is not fun and you won't sleep ever. "
