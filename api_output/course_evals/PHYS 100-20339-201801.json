            "\u00a0Very little. It was a lot of basic physics and thermodynamics. Hard to learn in class. ",
            "\u00a0You learn a lot about energy usage in the US and some of the math/formulas required for calculating energy usage. ",
            "\u00a0The first part of the course covers the science behind energy (like what is energy, units, heat engines, fossil fuels and combustion reactions, etc.). I thought that the ideas in this part of the course never really went above a high-school science level. A very substantial portion of the homework was mostly unit conversions, and I didnt feel like I got an intuitive understanding of many of the major topics covered. It really is a survey course.\r\n\r\nThe second half covers how energy is produced and consumed on the source and sector side. This part I thought was pretty interesting, especially Julie Paquettes lectures on the built environment and how she tries to make Yale buildings more efficient. We also got to visit the power plant and Kroon hall. There wasn't really a focus on energy policy. "

            "\u00a0I took this class knowing that it had bad reviews because I hoped to gain a sense of community with the other Energy Studies scholars, but having boring lectures every day did nothing to help with this. I also took it expecting the project to be a fun way to work with new partners and to workshop each other's ideas. Even though we had to submit project proposals the week before spring break in march, we only really were forced to work on it the last week of class, which made the entire process too rushed and not fun. This class was so boring, not at all engaging, and the content could be learned in 4 lectures or less. ",
            "\u00a0I thoroughly enjoyed the alternative problem sets and the group project. Professor Oristaglio is one of the best professors I've had. Weaknesses included a very tough midterm where you had to use a very basic and user-unfriendly calculator. ",
            "\u00a0Final Exam. Without a final exam no student will bother to go to lectures\r\nIt just makes half of the semester useless because we only had the project to work on which is unrelated to lectures. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Talking about yale buildings\r\nWeaknesses: Everything before that\r\n\r\nPlease don't spend so much time on the lead up to the interesting stuff (spend more time on the intersection of energy and society) ",
            "\u00a0The class was much too Yale-focused for my taste. I wish more of the examples and case studies were not Yale-affiliated so that I got a better sense of the energy use of non-academic/non-Yale environments. ",
            "\u00a0I believe the course should be better structured to keep students engagement throughout the entire semester. Although a group research project is a good way to introduce us to Energy Studies (the main goal of the course), we currently have 50% of our grade set for it. Because lectures are not very relevant to the project, students are not motivated to keep attending. I think assigning more problem sets (the bi-weekly system works fine, but it should be throughout the entire semester instead of just the first half), choosing between a final paper and a final project, setting a final exam, and reducing the number of guest lectures and giving more in class time for the project of more lectures related to the syllabus are ways to approach this issue and improve the course. ",
            "\u00a0Really disorganized in terms of delivery of material. Best part of course was the final project time and putting together a poster and all but teaching wise it was pretty scattered and the midterm WAS HORRIBLE. We should've been able to use our own calculators, but instead we had to use these horrible, dumb-downed devices that stood in our way even when we knew how to do the problems. It was also way too long and no expectation was set up in how to answer the questions (how much detail). Additionally the review session made it seem like it was going to be super easy. ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Paquette gave amazing lectures! ",
            "\u00a0I think the guest speakers were really interesting, and maybe they have one of those lectures earlier on. I think that sometimes the rotating lecturer between the 3 professors can be distracting if they switch mid class, but otherwise, it makes every class a bit different which is nice. The midterm exam was frustrating first because the calculators we were given were limited, making the questions with computation hard. Some of the questions were about minor facts we learned as well, so maybe ask us more about the bigger points. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting class. The midterm was definitely a weakness though. We were not given nearly enough time for the length of the exam and we were expected to make complex calculations on very rudimentary calculators. ",
            "\u00a0I really hated the classroom it was in -- made me tired because it was too large for our class size and was therefore less engaging of us. Also, class should be 50 minutes rather than 75 because I could give my full attention then (since it's the afternoon and people are getting tired). \r\nI really liked the speakers and field trips, and wish there were actually more field trips during class time. Also, the first half had p sets that were impossible if you didn't attend office hours. I would have liked to cover more related material in class that would have helped me understand, because they were interesting just confusing (but TAs were great). ",
            "\u00a0Interesting guest lectures and general topics. TAs were very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the material and interest of the lecturers, weaknesses is a little bit disorganized ",
            "\u00a0I thought the final project was interesting and a great way to allow students to pursue their own interests in the field, but I wish that they had been initiated earlier in the semester, i.e. having the outline deadline a little bit earlier or having group topics finalized earlier, so that groups could get started on their projects earlier. It felt a little rushed at the end of the semester, and I feel like I didn't get to do as much as I would have liked with the project due to time constraints. ",
            "\u00a0This whole course was very poorly planned. The midterm had material on it that the Professor Prober told the class would not be on the midterm. He also would not let us use scientific calculators to do division with numbers larger than 10^18. The problem sets were worded and developed very poorly and even the TAs didnt understand how to help us with some of the questions. The lectures themselves were not engaging. ",
            "\u00a0The idea that Energy Studies has a gateway course is interesting, but this class isn't. The lectures were often unstimulating, despite the best efforts of our professors. The tours and freedom of the final project were very cool, though. ",
            "\u00a0The course material was interesting. However I have serious issue with how it was assessed and by how Daniel Prober taught the class. \r\n\r\nFor example, the midterm has numerous issues. Firstly, there was 2-3 lines worth of space to answer long questions that asked for a comprehensive answer. The test was far too long for the time allowed (if decent answers were expected), and many were extremely vague and could have multiple correct answers. To make matter worse, we were given office calculators that only went up to 8 digits. Most of the figures required long calculations with digits upwards of 10+ digits, making it near impossible to get accurate answers. The project and the essay had very minimal guidelines, with the exception of a few practice essays online. These too, were misleading, since they were all 1500-2500 words long, but 6 days before the essay was due an email was sent out (also in the middle of finals period) saying that it should be 4000 words long . Again, no guideline was given to what they wanted us to write about. The feedback received on our projects from Daniel Prober was also extremely confusing and not constructive whatsoever. He would only talk about what small details he wanted us to add (which we did), even though it had nothing to do with the big picture of our project. To contrast, Michael Oristaglio gave constructive and helpful feedback by commented on  problems we might face with our project as a whole and offering solutions to overcome them. \r\n\r\nDuring actual lessons, Daniel Prober would once again focus very heavily one odd details that were not useful whatsoever when learning new concepts. I found him very hard to listen to and couldn't derive anything useful from his lessons. Oristaglio's lessons were much better, since he taught what was actually important and didn't include all the vast amounts of irrelevant details that made Prober's lessons impossible to follow. \r\n\r\nIn general I would strongly recommend not taking this class (or any class) that is taught by Daniel Prober. If this class is offered again in the future, only take it if Michael Oristaglio is running it. I believe this class would've engaged me and been excellent if Michael had run this course alone. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were generally alright. The homeworks and test were fair and not too difficult, and they hosted a review session before which was helpful. \r\n\r\nI also wish we had talked more about current technological problems that the energy industry faces in depth. For example, I would have really enjoyed a more detailed discussion on smart grids. \r\n\r\nThe instructions and feedback we received for the final paper/project was awful. This was during the last month of the class, when we really didnt have any assignments other than working on the project/paper. We were told many times that each group would be given an advisor, but we never received one. We sent an outline to Professor Oristaglio about a month in advance, he said he liked it, so we started doing research on it. Then the day before the first draft of the poster was due, Prof. Prober decided to tell us that our project had been done before and we should do something completely different. The subsequent feedback we received was very limited and unhelpful. We also werent told at all what the professors wanted to see for the final paper, and never received any feedback/grades for either the project or the paper, both of which were worth combined 50% of our grade in the class.

            "\u00a0No. The class is still so poorly organized, even for energy studies students. I would not recommend it because the professors don't do enough to engage the students with each other and the course materials. The three psets at the beginning of the course were too easy and not helpful to learn the material. Please do not take this course! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend to another student. Do it for a new type of class that is front-end heavy with a more project focused second half. The opportunity to hear from city officials, Casey Pickett (head of Yale Carbon Charge) is unique and not to be missed. ",

            "\u00a0Not unless you have to take it. The topic is interesting and the professors all mean very well, but an entire semester of this class was sad. After the first few classes attendance was sparse, even though they tried to implement an attendance policy. ",

            "\u00a0Take this class if you want to be an energy studies scholar, if not, then probably dont. Its not very well organized, and the final project is a lot more work than youd expect, especially since the professors dont give much direction at all. There are more interesting science classes to take, and also more gutty science classes to take than this one! "
