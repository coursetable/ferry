            "\u00a0Improved Chinese knowledge\r\n\r\nIn particular, speaking and listening were enhanced a lot, but writing and reading also made significant improvements. ",
            "\u00a0I significantly broadened my range of vocabulary/sentence structures in Chinese, and now am able to speak at a much more refined level, past just basic conversation. I also have a deeper understanding of Chinese culture and customs. ",
            "\u00a0My Chinese skills really increased, especially my speaking, writing, and reading skills. Beyond the language, I learned a lot about the culture as well, and I am really motivated to apply for the Light Fellowship as well. ",
            "\u00a0Since this class is meant for heritage speakers, it developed my Chinese reading and writing skills in particular, but also gave us every day exposure and practice to speaking and listening. This course especially expanded my vocabulary, knowledge of sentence structures, and understanding of Chinese culture. ",
            "\u00a0Greater mastery of vocabulary, speaking, writing, and pronunciation of Chinese. ",
            "\u00a0My Chinese speaking, writing, and reading all improved a lot this term. This may be especially true for me, as my Chinese has been rusty since last taking it my sophomore year in high school. But the daily Chinese homework and Wang laoshi's serious engagement in every single class really forces your Chinese to improve a lot. We not only learned practical words for everyday life, but also some more advanced or literary language as well. ",
            "\u00a0I really feel like I improved on all aspects of my Chinese. In particular, I learned the most in terms of vocabulary, proper grammatical structure, writing, and reading. Nonetheless, I also feel like this course provided me with a lot of practice to improve my speaking and listening capabilities. Outside of the language component, I also developed some insights into Chinese culture as well. For instance, my class got to visit the Yale Art Gallery and learn about the history of Chinese pottery and artifacts. ",
            "\u00a0All aspects of my Chinese improved tenfold. ",
            "\u00a0This class surprisingly increased my fluency in Chinese over the short course of a semester, which is evident in both my improved essay-writing skills, reading comprehension, and ability to communicate with my parents in the language. Not only that, but I think the class also helped emphasize and put into perspective the importance and influence of Chinese culture in my life; since this course is on the heritage track, I think that was a pleasant surprise. ",
            "\u00a0How to read, write, and speak various Mandarin terms, grammar structures, and expressions (chengyu); how to speak Mandarin in a more impromptu way ",

            "\u00a0The strengths of the course is that it provides a very interactive setting, so if you want to gain a lot out of the course, it is definitely easy to do so. Another big strength is having homework basically everyday, which forces you to learn a lot.\r\n\r\nFor improvements, I think rather than more dictation, it would be helpful to have more homework that focused on sentence construction and correct usage of vocabulary terms/sentence structures. ",
            "\u00a0A major strength of this course is its small class size. It allows for bonding within the class, and makes the class much more enjoyable overall. I also enjoyed the structure of how it was taught - having a lesson each week with vocab. The consistent structure meant that I knew what to expect, and the content of the lessons was also engaging! ",
            "\u00a0I think the class was very well taught, and Professor Wang did a wonderful job keeping the class engaged. This was by far the best Chinese class I have taken. ",
            "\u00a0As a language course it was inevitably very engaging, since it demanded practice in speaking. Overall, I thought this course was well taught and had a lot of relevant information. The professor also made sure to keep the spirit lively and the class itself interesting by showing us movies and running interesting classes, such as class debates.\r\n\r\nIn terms of improvement, I think it would be more effective if the class were smaller. We had about 16 people, which didn't allow us to have the individual attention that would've been ideal for a class like this. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Wang Laoshi is the best Chinese teacher I have had. She is very good at explaining grammar structures and when to use them. We also have a variety of opportunities to practice and apply the skills learned in class through essays, presentations, and even a museum tour.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: your experience will be entirely based upon the people in your section. Luckily, everyone in my section was friendly and all actively participate in class. ",
            "\u00a0Depending on your personal opinion, something really distinct about this level 5 class is that it meets every day. I personally saw it as a strength, since it has allowed my Chinese to improve a lot more than I would have thought. But the class's and professor's engagement with the material really created a conducive learning environment. And through the daily homework assignments and reasonably heavy workload, my section of CHNS152 became extremely close, and some of my best friends at Yale have been formed through the class. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course would lie in how it is taught. Since the class is entirely taught in Chinese, we have the opportunity to practice the Chinese that we have learned each day. Also, I feel like the structure of the class is particularly conducive to learning Chinese because students are incentivized to study and learn the vocabulary and sentence structures outside of class as homework, and afterwards, we work together as a class to review and go over any parts that would otherwise be confusing. This is not a weakness necessarily, but it is a large time commitment, especially if students are going into the class with limited Chinese experience but are heritage speakers. It is a really strong course that does effectively elevate our Chinese language abilities though. ",
            "\u00a0Very engaging, but a ton of work (which is understandable given that it's 1.5 credits). ",
            "\u00a0I think as is, the course was very well structured to facilitate learning, one of the most important being that it is a daily class. I think the amount of homework and projects are just enough to make sure the class is still challenging. However, I think the video dub and museum presentation project could have been more structured because they did come up a little suddenly and were were very pressed for time to finish it (esp. the video one). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - I think I learned a lot of Mandarin and improved greatly. We go through all the new terms in great depth so I have a much better understanding of how to use the vocabulary.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - I think my grammar was not very good, so I did not always speak up in class to say an example sentence because I wasn't sure how to use the phrases with the correct grammar. I wish there was explanation of some of the simpler grammar to make sure the foundations were correct. Also, I wish the class wasn't on science hill because it is a little far to go to every day. ",
            "\u00a0For better or worse, this is a chinese course, so it's always going to feel a little bit like a grind as you slog through the characters.  I don't know if there's any way to fix that. "

            "\u00a0Yes! It's great if you want to improve your Chinese (although relative to your other classes it might seem like a lot more work). ",
            "\u00a0I would! You come out of this class with significant improvement in your Chinese, and with a fantastic group of friends. Wang Laoshi is also one of the kindest, most genuine professors ever. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to heritage speakers. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to another student because this class accomplishes what it sets out to do: improve your skills in Chinese listening, speaking, reading, and writing.  Although there is a lot of work on the daily basis, it is very rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to improve your Chinese beyond the conversational level, by all means take this class! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to another student, especially if they really want their Chinese to improve. ",
            "\u00a0This is a really great class if you want to seriously improve your Chinese. Also, it is a great way to develop close ties with other Chinese students. If possible, I recommend even leaving some time after this class (don't schedule another class directly after). A lot of the interaction with classmates continues after the class is over, and I know it is a good bonding experience. Also, take this with Prof. Wang. She is an incredible teacher that not only makes the class fun, but she is seriously concerned with how her students are doing. \r\n\r\nIf you want to prepare your Chinese or simply expand on your current abilities, this course will really get you results. I guarantee that your writing and reading abilities will be especially advanced. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This course is organized extremely well, and the students in the class become so close outside of class. ",
            "\u00a0If you are Chinese-American, please take it. It will change your life, you will appreciate your heritage so much more. Also Wang Laoshi is amazing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Wang Laoshi includes a variety of new Chinese words and terms, and also uses varied methods of practicing the new terms (homework assignments, in class discussion, debates, essays, etc.). I think my Chinese has improved so much in just one semester, and I am looking forward to CHNS 153! ",
