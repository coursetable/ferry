CS474 does a way better job of teaching many of these concepts through problem sets. ",

That can be frustrating if you actually want to take much away from the class -- I felt that the psets did not facilitate learning very much -- they were either too simplified to actually make us learn the material, or they were complicated in a way that had almost nothing to do with the material.

The 2nd half of the semester the course structure felt super rushed though (PSETs due every week instead of every 1.5-2 weeks), so I'd recommend placing another PSET before the midterm to evenly distribute the workload.

",

I thought the psets and grading were very reasonable and lecture was always really good and interesting. \r\nThe room for improvement would be more office hours and more clarity in the answers that TAs specifically made on piazza\r\nAdditionally, I feel like the final was a bit of a curveball. We were told that it would be similar to the midterm but it had a very different style of questions. I was also surprised by some of the questions because they didn't seem like things we covered deeply in class. I ended up studying what I thought was most emphasized but that was bad. I think a practice exam would be extremely helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Scaz is a great lecturer. Spent a ton of time on search though, perhaps doesn't need as much focus going forward. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- Broad coverage. I learned a _lot_ about different techniques used in AI and feel prepared and excited to jump into more advanced treatments of specific applications.\r\n- Well-taught. While there was a mountain of material to cover, Scaz did a great job of distilling the most important points and emphasizing those, making exams and problem sets very fair relative to the topics discussed in class. I was free to explore the nitty-gritty details on my own if I wanted, but spending 10 hours a week reading a textbook was not required for success in the course.\r\n- Shorter, more frequent class meetings. I really enjoyed the MWF 50 minute lecture structure, compared to the typical MW/TTh 75 minute lecture structure of most CS classes at Yale. For one, it allowed for a more natural cover of a wide range of topics. For another, it kept me focused and attentive and consistently thinking about the material.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- There are too many students in this course relative to the teaching staff. One simple way to improve on this is is to make 223 a prerequisite, as this course requires solid knowledge of data structures and basic programming.\r\n- The content was, at times, a bit too high-level. While I recognize that a survey course doesn't allow for much time to explore any of the topics in detail, I felt coddled on some of the problem sets relative to my experiences in other CS classes at Yale.\r\n- There was no small-scale environment to discuss weighty course material, especially for the topics covered in the last couple of weeks. I would have greatly appreciated a discussion section component of the course, if only for those two weeks, to be able to talk about these topics with my peers in a more intimate environment. Alternatively, the class could be made much smaller, but it would be mildly unfair to students to cap enrollment in such a desired subject area. ",
            "\u00a0I think it's a really fun course with interesting psets and lectures, but sometimes I did wish the homework assignments were proofread a little bit more. There were often typos/vague language that were only clarified if you happened to check piazza or ask in person. ",
            "\u00a0It covers relevant topics. However, it is far too broad and provides no knowledge on the insights as to how any of the AI technology works. I have learned about many technologies and came out with absolutely no idea how to implement them. I would not mind the course being harder, if the psets were more than writing just 5 lines of code into an already complete assignment. ",
            "\u00a0Scaz is a great lecturer. He made lectures enjoyable and engaging, and super organized. He also made great problem sets which built off of what we learned in lecture AND challenged us to really learn something from them.  Problem sets were manageable and fair. The course could have benefited from more office hours and ULAs/TAs. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Scaz is a great lecturer, very clear when teaching material and not hard to reach via Piazza or email. Some TAs were also good resources.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Office hours for AI were high in demand yet not offered for a long time. Each TA only worked one hour-long shift and each day was a max of 3 shifts. ",

            "\u00a0Scaz is a very engaging lecturer, but there is a lot of material trying to be covered.  I feel like I didn't learn a whole lot from most of the assignments, and the exams were lowkey brutal. ",
            "\u00a0This is a survey in one of the broadest fields extant in computer science; it is understandably difficult to cover everything in a satisfactory manner. I think it would be much improved with a focus on the latter half of the semester (as taught this year) with more in-depth assignments. ",
            "\u00a0I wish there were more levels of this class. I came from a heavy linear algebra background, and found myself wishing that I could have done deeper psets that involved actual math. Scaz explained the need to keep the prerequisites for the course minimal was the cause of this, and I understand that, but still wish Yale had more varied & deeper CS electives. ",
            "\u00a0This class was taught survey style, so it gave me a lot of insights into different areas of AI. On the other hand, because it was a survey course, we were not able to learn about anything in an in depth manner. I liked the survey style overall because it showed me bits and pieces, and now I know which specific classes I want to take in the future. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: one of the best courses in the CS department, problem sets are so fun because you are applying and building real AI systems (with a bit of help of course), and Scaz is one of the best, most passionate and well-spoken professors in the department. He has deep knowledge of AI, and I definitely recommend this class. Weaknesses: it may not be offered again because there is a lack of staffing in CS department, which would be an absolute bummer. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: The lecturer (Scaz) was very clear and engaging. \r\nWeaknesses: The homework assignments were duplicated from other CS courses. This means students from those courses learned less, and students who are not yet initiated have to spend much more time. The final exam was very difficult and it tested many obscure concepts. ",
            "\u00a0The course is a good overview course but I think it could benefit from making CS223 an official prereq and going somewhat deeper into certain topics. There are a lot of psets for a CS course but most of them take under 3 hours to complete which means that you don't learn much. I did enjoy the guest lecturers and being able to use a cheat sheet for the tests was super helpful since there were a lot of facts covered. Also making this class twice a week instead of three times a week would improve it. ",
            "\u00a0The topics that are covered are very broad, and I liked how the lectures had slides that were very well-made. It was clear that Scaz is an expert in this field, and that he was trying to give us as good of an overview as possible. That being said, the problem sets were more simple than I would've liked, and I felt like I was just following instructions on the psets rather than actually learning and solving problems. It seems as though a course that was labelled as CS470 would have delved deeper into the material. I would've liked a pset that allowed us to learn more about neural networks, or something that allowed us to implement qlearning for a real problem rather than just plugging in the equation. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Scaz is a fantastic lecturer. He is incredibly engaging and funny, and he clearly wants his class to succeed. The exams themselves are incredibly fair (I'd say on the easier side), so don't be too stressed.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course is way too broad. We cover a topic a week, and problem sets touch on only a few subtopics of each topic. I'm not saying that breadth is a bad thing, but I feel like I wouldn't be able to implement most of AI techniques we learned this semester. In addition, the reading is completely useless. The textbook goes in significantly more depth than Scaz' lectures (so much so that I've taken another class based on just 1 or 2 chapters in the book). Scaz will also say the exam can test anything from lecture and the reading, but I personally did not do any of the readings and still knew everything on both exams. ",

            "\u00a0Its a survey course, though I liked it a lot. The problem sets made us practice and implement the most important concepts from lecture, and in lecture we were exposed to a ton of content. Some of the later psets were easy which is nice, but maybe a bit too easy and would have been nice to have to practice harder material a bit more. ",
            "\u00a0Covers a lot, and not very in depth, but the problem sets aren't super great for learning the things that are covered on the exams. ",
            "\u00a0Scaz gave fascinating and clear lectures that kept things interesting and gave great introduction to the major topics in AI. However, in addition to the pset schedule getting very rushed, the psets felt poorly constructed from past assignments or different courses, and there wasnt enough help available via office hours or piazza.

            "\u00a0Strengths: I thought Scaz was an excellent professor: very engaging lectures and he did a great job in balancing the course content between concepts and techniques and applications. The ULAs were also super helpful. The psets were well-designed to introduce us to applications of what we learned in class, often in very interesting domains. Weaknesses: the psets did vary greatly in difficulty, starting out quite difficult and then becoming easier, to the point of being almost *too* easy; at the end I didn't feel as if I were actually learning the technique but rather just copying code from the spec. The specs themselves were often confusingly worded and ambiguous. Overall though, one of my favorite classes at Yale! ",

            "\u00a0I think the strengths are that it is a really engaging class (w/ Scaz as prof.) - lectures were always very interesting and fun to attend. I personally would've wanted to spend a little more time on the math side of some of the algorithms (really getting an understanding of how exactly everything is happening), but I get that it would be less accessible if it did (so it's definitely a trade-off). ",
            "\u00a0This class was extremely well organized and administered, especially given the large size of the class. The lectures were fascinating and well put together, and Scaz did a great job of showing both the effectiveness and problems of each topic. I would have liked there to be more office hours or more individual feedback! ",
            "\u00a0It definitely covered very interesting content! Problem sets were also fun and interesting and make you really think about the technologies you were leaning about. Professor taught incredibly well. Course support was also well structures with the office hours, TAs and the Piazza. The guest lectures were also cool. Overall great course, wouldn't really change anything. ",
            "\u00a0The course contains really interesting topics and a lot of the ones covered give a great idea of how the technology actually works. However, the assignments lacked depth (even for a survey course). ",

This class quickly became an exercise in understanding the starter code implementations than actually understanding the concepts at hand, which was extremely disappointing. This course was also understaffed, although this might be a departmental problem more so than a course specific problem. \r\n\r\nA strength of this course was that Scaz is a great lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Very digestible and accessible to all students. Topics were extremely interesting and definitely helped me to learn more about AI.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: By nature of being a survey course, the class did not have time to go into many of the details. So, I do not feel like I know enough to actually implement many of the AI techniques we talked about. ",
            "\u00a0Scaz is a great lecturer. Definitely one of the best of the CS department. I thought that the psets were not the best. Some of them were a bit too easy and made it hard to internalize the material. Others had guidelines that weren't too clear and had grading guidelines that were not too clear. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is definitely Scaz - he is one of the few great CS lecturers in the department and you feel extremely engaged in class. The weakness is that at least this semester, there was too much overlap with the Intelligent Robotics class, and it felt like there was a lot more in the field of AI that we could have covered. ",
            "\u00a0I wish we could have gone a lot deeper into some of the topics, especially the machine learning units. A lot of the psets felt very surface level, but did a good job at helping me understand the big picture underlying concepts. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures and slides are great and programming assignments are interesting. However, I felt like we were spoon-fed most of the time because the psets were very hand-holding and could be completed without much understanding. The midterm also relied a lot more on knowledge than on understanding. I would love the course if it went more into the theory and math behind concepts e.g. backpropagation. ",

            "\u00a0I think this course would have been improved if it was not at 10:30 am or three days a week. I thoroughly enjoyed every lecture that I attended, however if the lectures had been at 11:35 or in the afternoon I probably would have attended more of them. ",
            "\u00a0I felt that the coding was often too straightforward for some of the assignments, and that the steps of the algorithms that we had to implement were too obvious and did not leave much for us to reason through and figure out. That being said, I thought the problem sets were all extremely interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the broadness of the course is definitely a strength. This may only be desirable on hindsight but I felt like there could have been fewer problem sets but more comprehensive, such that we have more experience in putting together things like neural nets. I felt a good example of a pset was the generic algorithm, because we basically had to write that from scratch. (Kind of) ",
            "\u00a0Big strength: Scaz is a great professor. His lectures are clear, and he also clearly cares about his students. I'm also glad the course got to cover such a breadth of material. Weaknesses? I do wish the material had been more heavily weighted towards more recent techniques, developments, and societal issues; in general, it felt like each topic was given roughly equal time. I think this is less of a weakness with the class, though, and more of a weakness with the department: the CS dept, and Yale at-large, is sorely lacking in its range of AI/ML offerings and professors; I wish this course didn't have to try to cram everything relevant to AI (from technical skills to history to practical applications, etc) into one single semester. One other, smaller weakness: oftentimes, the psets covering more complicated concepts would come with an existing codebase, and problems were more \"fill-in-the-blank 'YOUR CODE HERE'\" style. Although it was really nice /not/ having to create such large codebases from scratch, oftentimes I found the structural/algorithmic setups to be unintuitive, inefficient, or otherwise difficult-to-make-sense-of given the way we had learned concepts in lecture. I wish more efforts were made to (1) align pset methods with those taught in lecture, (2) better document why the codebases are designed as they are. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n- Professor was an amazing lecturer.\r\n- The problem sets are reasonable and reinforce the material well without excess tedium. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Not enough ULA/support staff. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were amazing, really. Problem sets were not hard but still you could actually learn with them. ",
            "\u00a0This course does not properly teach us how we can write our own artificial intelligence algorithms. The biggest thing that you learn is how to read python code and fill in left out pieces. It would have been better if we could have coded ai algorithms from scratch. They also fail to grade to a standard that reflects students' hard work because the pset grades don't reflect that; instead they reflect the knowledge that some students already have of where to look for the proper pseudocode in the book or the advice of other students who know something that they learned at office hours and nowhere else. ",
            "\u00a0Scaz is a good lecturer and the material is interesting. Exams were difficult and kind of hard to prepare for. Material is really broad and if you took Intelligent Robotics or NLP it was a lot of repeated material. ",
            "\u00a0The material was interesting and we got a good overview of the different areas in AI. But at the same time, we brushed over some off the topics super quickly and for some of the psets that didn't involve coding it seemed like we were doing very surface-level work. I understand that it's not possible to go in depth into every topic in a survey course, but I felt very very unsatisfied with the way we learnt some of the topics. Scaz is a great instructor and did his best to show us the most interesting things. The TAs were also amazing, putting in several extra hours to help us, but like with most CS classes, getting help in office hours was close to impossible. The final was pretty bad and just had so so much material. Overall though, I felt like the class was super interesting and I learnt a bunch of really cool stuff! ",
            "\u00a0The weaknesses of this course are that I feel like the problem sets did not facilitate my learning or understanding of the course material. The psets were not hard and didn't take much time, but the exams were confusing and often felt like they tested information that was a needle in the haystack of the 30+ lecture slides. Lectures were good and engaging; however, they were very broad and covered so much material that it was extremely hard to gauge what we would be tested on and in what format. "

Know though that Scaz teaches the course at a high-level but expects you to learn all low-level content: while we gloss over algorithms in class, you still need to implement them thoroughly on PSETs, and you still need to know details of techniques (i.e. convolution) for exams.

Scaz does a great job of helping you to navigate the mess of topics though, keeping your eyes focused on the big picture rather than the minutiae. Note that this course mostly skims over the most difficult technical aspects of AI, so if you're looking for something that will really challenge your linear algebra or Python knowledge, this course is not for you. Regardless, I found it a great way to explore a vast portion of the AI \"toolbox\" and try my hand at implementing some simple code to put it into action.
