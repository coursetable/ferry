            "\u00a0I learned how incredible Asian American literature can be. I learned how it is changing, amorphous, and awesome. It made me proud to be an Asian American. ",
            "\u00a0I read a lot of books by Asian American writers ",
            "\u00a0I think I learned to approach literature in a more structured, rigorous way. I learned a lot about the genealogy of the Asian American literary tradition, and I found our archival work very engaging. ",
            "\u00a0This course offered a wonderful selection of various Asian American texts, pulling from the more canonical Asian American novels to the more recent. It prompted me to think more deeply about what identifies something as an Asian American text and the central themes of each text. Discussions were really wonderful, and I really enjoyed listening to insights that classmates brought to the table! ",
            "\u00a0So much! Gained knowledge of the AsAm canon, ",
            "\u00a0How to read critically and think more abstractly, draw connections between theory and literature and different schools of thought ",
            "\u00a0Asian American Lit. really grew me as a person. Through this class, I learned so much more about navigating and communicating Asian American subjectivity, reading and evaluating literary criticism, grappling with difficult texts, and researching/writing an extensive final paper. I really think that this experience - the syllabus, communication with Prof. Xiang, the insights of my classmates - broadened my worldview. Beyond articulating a tradition of Asian American literature, this class also gave me so much exposure to critical theory. I know that I've become a more learned close-reader and writer through Asian American Lit! ",
            "\u00a0This class opened my eyes to a completely new way of reading literature, and to a dense menagerie of new types of literature to read and look out for. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: The syllabus, Sunny is an incredible seminar professor.\r\nWeaknesses: The work load is high, but I mean, it's a senior seminar. High work load was expected and warranted. ",
            "\u00a0sometimes I felt thematically lost like I wasn't fully sure of the connection between the books we were reading ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nSunny is a phenomenal instructor; she's very engaging, rigorous, and supportive.\r\nThe novels on the syllabus are really excellent, and meeting with YZ Chin was wonderful.\r\nI really enjoyed keywords posts--it felt like a useful method for thinking through texts.\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nA lot of white students made a number of racist remarks, which we just kind of left unaddressed. I don't know if there was a venue where they were being addressed, but it was not in class (which might not have been the most appropriate), and I found that really frustrating, since it created an atmosphere of implicit consent.\r\nIt was a big class, and that made it challenging to have a coherent discussion.\r\nSome people dominated discussion outsizedly. It was disappointing not to be able to hear from others in the room. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the variety of texts that the course curated. I also really loved student discussion. ",
            "\u00a0We read incredible books and had challenging but engaging discussions, and most importantly Prof. Xiang built an encouraging and supportive environment! ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus is so dynamic and so compelling! Professor Xiang is also beyond kind - she is very approachable, very thoughtful, very generous with her time and energy, and very knowledgeable. Office hours with Prof. Xiang were so rewarding. The class is challenging, but with Prof. Xiang's help, it is a manageable growing experience! Also, the contributions of fellow students are a huge strength of the course. I learned as much from my peers as from the literature itself. ",
            "\u00a0I believe placing the single long paper at the end of the semester poses a difficulty for students who want to stay fully engaged with reading pieces towards the end of the semester. It also makes it difficult to write on literature placed towards the end of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I found the keyword assignments each week were incredibly helpful in grounding our heavy reading assignments, but especially in preparing us for productive class discussions since we were able to know what each of us were thinking about the text before coming into class! \r\nHowever, these assignments each week were incredibly different than the final essay, and if you haven't written many long essays before, it would be helpful to start earlier than suggested on the syllabus and reach out for guidance as necessary! ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are the diversity of its syllabus in terms of authorship, style, genre, length, and subject matter and the brilliance of Professor Xiang. Its main weakness, if it can be said to have any, is that a semester is too short to find a satisfactory answer any of the major overarching questions that structure the course. ",
            "\u00a0The material covered was incredible, and Sunny is excellent. "

            "\u00a0I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS COURSE! Sunny is a wonderful professor--she will challenge your thinking, and she will treat you and your ideas with respect and kindness. The syllabus was really fun--the books were challenging, but I mean, that's kinda the point. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to escape reading the same old white guys, take this course. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to students. I think the composition of the class has a large impact on the experience one has in the class, but Sunny is a phenomenal scholar, and anyone would be lucky to study with her. ",
            "\u00a0Yes; the subject matter and readings are diverse and really interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Sunny is wonderful and encouraging as a professor, the fellow students were great and really invested in discussion. Also, the texts were really engaging! Take the class for a really wonderful introduction into thinking more in depth about Asian American literature and the politics! ",
            "\u00a0Without a doubt! Professor Xiang is an incredible teacher. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The readings are really enjoyable- even the critical essays! Getting to know Prof. Xiang and share space/time with thoughtful, smart students who are committed to the class has been such a privilege. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! The syllabus is incredible, the professor is incredible, the interested students are incredible, the writing practice is incredible! all around incredible! ",
            "\u00a0Take this class, even if you are not an English major. Actually, take this class ESPECIALLY if you are not an English major. Also, take this class whether or not you identify as Asian or Asian American. With Ethnicity, Race, and Migration under such attack from the Yale Administration, you owe it to yourself to support such programs wherever and however possible, and if you can take a truly fun, engaging, and intellectually stimulating course in the process, you should. Professor Xiang is a genius, the syllabus is really, really cool, and you are guaranteed to learn something new, even if you think you knew a lot about this subject already. ",
            "\u00a0I cannot emphasize how brilliant and competent Professor Xiang is. The course was a joy to take because of how much she pushed us within our respective interests. She would listen to our points during seminar and put them in conversation with one another to create new overarching frameworks.  I cannot stress how fulfilling this course was. ",
            "\u00a0Would absolutely recommend as an English major senior seminar. Sunny is excellentI would take anything she taughtand the readings are amazing. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! There are few classes in the English major with an Asian American bent "
