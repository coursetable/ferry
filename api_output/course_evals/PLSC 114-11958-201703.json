            "\u00a0The course is well structured, and Professor Landemore clearly wanted everyone to learn. The first half of the class involved a lot of in class discussions, which were painful and essentially useless given that college freshman have limited experience and insight into these topics, but after doing a midterm feedback, she limited those and began really diving into some of the most engaging ideas in the course.\r\n\r\nShe did a good job at making this not a class in politics, but a class in philosophy, which was one my main worries going in.\r\n\r\nOne weakness was relating authors well to each other, for instance, relating Rousseau to the Federalists is a very interesting topic but was only scratched at the surface level. ",
            "\u00a0A Political Philosophy survey course at Yale University should incorporate non-Western texts!!! It would enrich the experience for everyone if voices from myriad philosophical traditions were brought together in conversation. It needlessly narrows our perspectives to read only Western authors. Many of the Western authors we read were interesting; however, these authors' treatment of issues of race and gender ranged from inadequate to appalling. In what I'm guessing is a minor improvement over previous years, we did read W.E.B. Du Bois and Hannah Arendt at the end of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0The course is strong in how it manages to bring a variety of perspectives together, but at times, I felt like the lectures could be a bit dry or disorganized. ",
            "\u00a0The strength and weakness of this course is in its breadth. We covered so much, but it was often too hard to think too long about a book because we had to move on to the next one. I think it would be best to try to cut one or two authors, so that we can spend a little longer on some of the authors that had a heavier emphasis in the course, such as Rousseau and Tocqueville.\r\nMoreover, I found that the preparation for the final was unreasonable. We were given thirteen essay prompts and had to prepare for all of them. I would much rather have had a topic to study, such as freedom and democracy, and then come to the final without knowing the prompts. Instead, it felt like I was supposed to spend tens of hours writing 13 essays, memorizing them, and then regurgitating them on the final. The actual final was not too bad, but again, it just felt like I was regurgitating what I had already learned. Otherwise, I would have preferred a longer, term paper, such as a 10 pager comparing two authors about a specific topic. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are the materials. The lesson plan itself has a lot of potential, but the execution is poor on almost every front. To begin with, we try to tackle too much in too little a time. This complaint will sound like that of a lazy undergraduate, but I would prefer more REAL work that allows us to engage with the material than hollow skimmings of some of the greatest pieces of literature, political philosophy and thought. As a result, must people did not read. When we did read, it was so unguided it felt almost futile. Lectures helped very little, and they lagged in any sort of staunch analysis aside from a brief overview. The teacher clearly knew her information and cared about it, but the curriculum as well as her philosophy that we should be \"thrown in\" to every text doomed her class from the start. Discussion sections were one of the few bright spots, aside from the actual readings. My TF, Naomi, was not always the most outwardly helpful, but she would always assist students when in need. She obviously cared about our understanding of the material and wanted us to love the works as much as she did, which I appreciated. ",
            "\u00a0Terrible structure, and barely any feedback for improvement ",
            "\u00a0I got a lot out of having a small section (6 people) because it required us to be engaged in the texts and the course. Also, if something wasn't clear going into section, the intimacy of the group led to our lack of understanding being addressed before the end of the section. However, in my opinion many of the texts we read brought up few relevant points but were highly challenging to read. Because of this, the course would have been more effective if we read more 20th or 21st century texts. ",
            "\u00a0The TAs of this course were certainly a strength because of how knowledgeable they were and also because of how involved Professor Landemore asked them to be in this class. Professor's Landemore's lectures were also a strength because although we were given a lot to read for a class, those lectures really focused on the essential points of larger readings. I always left class with a better understanding of the readings than when I started. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis course certainly did cover a lot of material and sometimes I wished we were assigned a little more filtered version of these important points than having to read large passages of books that we only talked about for specific chapters. ",
            "\u00a0Really good selection of material, some well known, but others not, which allows you to get a broader conception of the field at large. Pace was good and reading was substantial, but not overbearing. Lectures could have provided a little more analysis, though. ",
            "\u00a0The sections are great for discussing in more detail and professor landemore does a good job of giving the readings context and discussing their main points in class. \r\n\r\n\r\nI thought that there could have been more comparative (between authors) work throughout the semeseter ",
            "\u00a0I think the strength of the class are the books and the discussion sections. The books really help us understand how the ideas behind the current system of government in America developed over time. ",

            "\u00a0Good layout for writing section. ",
            "\u00a0Readings were important, but Prof. Landemore could have selected better excerpts as sometimes huge parts seemed irrelevant to the question she wanted us to think about. Sections were great, but lectures were not particularly interesting or helpful for the type of writing and ideas we were expected to generate. ",

            "\u00a0This course provides a great in-depth introduction to the philosophical teachings that every student should know to help them understand the formation of modern politics. There is a lot of material to cover and it seems overbearing at times, but this is just in the nature of the course and should not necessarily be considered a weakness. The course covers not only politics and philosophy, but sociology as well, allowing students to better identify with and become more interested in the material. ",

            "\u00a0The course is an /intro/ the political philosophy, and it delivers to that name. It truly is an introductory course that gives you exposure to all of these important texts, but the course moves to fast and covers so much that other than reading the texts on your own, your greatest analytical moments happen in section, which is only 50 minutes a week. The lectures are great for cultural context and understanding main themes, but it is hard to fully feel like you understand and have engaged enough with an author or text, because you quickly have to move on. ",
            "\u00a0This class is really well done! The lectures go over the important aspects of all the readings, and then section is used to synthesize your own views and hear others on the texts. Readings are heavy, but they of course have to be. Improvements? Maybe less in class discussion (because that's what sections are for!). ",

            "\u00a0I felt like not having access to lecture notes in the beginning of the class did not help me, and I often was too busy trying to scramble to get things down that I couldn't really synthesize my thoughts. I also felt that in-class discussions were scattered, and I did not benefit any greater from them than I would have if that time had been spent instead listening to the lecture. ",

It is a very good survey course for providing you with the basic analytical skills necessary for further studies in political philosophy and also introduces you to the core texts within this subject. \r\n\r\nHowever, the reading load is quite heavy and the pace of the course means that often there is not enough time to really explore all the thinkers equally and to extract as much as possible from each text. Especially in section, it would be helpful to have more time to debate the questions at hand. ",

A weakness is that sometimes the lectures varied in their relevance to the reading or were skewed towards one opinion. Also, people relied on summaries of the texts from the lectures instead of actually doing the readings themselves. I think that the discussion sections were another strength of this course because they allowed us to read the text more closely and hear different opinions. ",

However, the pace of the course means that a lot of the learning falls on the student and there is not necessarily a lot of support, especially for the student who does not have a lot of prior experience with writing about philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I thought it was an effective overview of  political thinking. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, for any student in political science or philosophy this course provides a great overview of important political themes throughout history ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely!! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it more highly with a professor other than Landemore. She's not horrible, but not super engaging. ",
            "\u00a0No if it is still taught by Professor Landemore. The lectures were disappointing, especially the first few ones (on the ancients like plato and socrates), albeit it got slightly better at the end. The texts on the list are absolutely wonderful, and I appreciate that Professor Landemore chose them intentionally, but I felt that the lectures (which was the main way that we were introduced to the text) hardly did them justice. There was so much knowledge to be mined from them, but hardly any of that I obtained through this course. I often found the official lessons so lacking that I mostly relied on myself, classmates or other classes that covered the same texts. Because of that, I think that if you are looking for an intellectual challenge, a course with this professor is not really the place to get it. Unless you are lucky enough to find good classmates AND a good teaching fellow (choose wisely). Only a few lectures I found good, which were conducted by teaching assistants. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to another student because I think it gives a very good and important introduction to the philosophy that can help explain human nature and our current governmental institutions. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if they are willing to do many readings. "
