            "\u00a0I learnt how to write lab reports to a whole new level - including all specific sections such as intro, materials/methods, results and discussion. I learnt a lot of the basic lab techniques which will definitely help me in my senior research. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about lots of introductory methods in bio research. How to read a blot, how to use a dissecting scope. \r\nAlso learned to develop high standards for scientific writing (making professional-looking figures, using all the necessary sections). \r\nAlso got experience working with a broad array of live model organisms (bacteria, C. elegans, Tetrahymena, Drosophila, Zebrafish). Can't say I learned a ton about each organism, but definitely a little bit about each which was cool. ",
            "\u00a0In this class we learned the basics of biological research with model organisms, which are an important to all types of research. ",

            "\u00a0Lab reports were very long and time consuming but it was a great course overall ",
            "\u00a0The main strengths of this course were that it improved the quality of my scientific writing and also taught me a lot about lab techniques.\r\n\r\nThere were two main weaknesses. One was that I often did not feel equipped to fully complete some of the lab reports given the amount we were taught during the lab section. This made the class often feel overwhelming and stressful, since I had to hash a lot of the material out on my own while writing the lab reports. \r\n\r\nThe other weakness was that lab sections often felt very inefficient (as if the 4-hour lab time were being purposefully filled up). Once someone came in and gave us a 90 minute demonstration about how to do a chi-square analysis, which was clearly too long, and which didn't end up being helpful for our lab report. And in other sections, it felt like we got only 1-2 hours of real work done during a 4 hour session. I would have appreciated just being directed to do specific things and then leaving earlier. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very well organized and fun to learn and take. ",
            "\u00a0This is a beginner lab that is good at teaching a lot of lab basics to then work in any sort of biological research lab afterward, however, sometimes the lab was unnecessarily long. "

            "\u00a0Definitely - although the lab reports were time consuming they are very rewarding ",
            "\u00a0If you need a standalone bio lab, this is pretty interesting. A lot of work for a half credit, as each of the lab reports can take up to 10 hours to write (at least for someone like me, who had no prior bio lab experience, it took this long). And there were 5-6 such lab reports over the semester. But you also learn a lot. Definitely added to my stress a bit, so would only recommend if you're not otherwise doing a very intense schedule. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because it is a good introduction to biological research. Highly recommend to students who have never done research before and are looking to do it. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, was my favorite lab class that I have taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0It's alright if you need a lab to graduate or if you need to learn about model organisms. "
