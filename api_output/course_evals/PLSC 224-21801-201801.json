            "\u00a0The course long paper was fantastic. It really forced me to think about something over a long period of time in a way I have never been able to do before.\r\n\r\nLecture readings, meh. I honestly stopped doing them after the first one, and didn't think they were necessary to the course.\r\n\r\nI think the discussion is important, but the professor read his notes at the beginning of the class and we could discuss off of that. I think it'd be more effective if the readings were optional, but each week there was required work on your paper -- like one week you're required to office hours it or bring it to a tutor, another week you're supposed to put together an outline and share it with a peer and discuss for at least twenty minutes.\r\n\r\nOr maybe each week you workshop it with a different peer outside of class and have to submit notes.\r\n\r\nI dunno. The punctuated deadlines was good but still didn't make me look at the paper each week in a way I think would have been helpful. But that might also have been too much examination of one topic.\r\n\r\nAlso, it was really demoralizing that other students kept dropping the class. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the forum-style of the class was great where we could openly make comments on the reading. I also really liked how each class member was able to give constructive feedback on people's papers! ",

            "\u00a0If you're interesting in writing a semester long paper, go for it. If you're looking for an easy writing credit, look elsewhere.\r\n\r\nYou don't have to be a good writer, but you do have to be extremely passionate in what you're learning and willing to put the effort in to transform your crappy paper into something you can at least not be ashamed of.\r\n\r\nThe professor will make you feel ashamed that you wrote crap. But that's okay, because though it sounds like he's tearing you apart in class, he's actually making you think about what's wrong with your paper. And you'll remember it, because he attacked it in class so harshly. But then you'll figure out how to fix it, and he'll still tear your writing apart in the next step of the writing process, but it'll be about something else you did wrong.\r\n\r\nIt sounds terrifying, and the first time he rips apart your work, it is terrifying. But he's actually incredibly nice and forgiving as long as you turn your stuff in no more than a few hours late. And everybody in the class understands he rips everyone's stuff apart so it's not embarrassing.\r\n\r\nI guess what I'm saying is that this is not the class for students with thin skin. You need to be able to take criticism. A lot. With force.\r\n\r\nHe will take something you've invested several hours into and he will rip it to shreds in front of the entire class without letting you defend it. He will interrupt you as you say something wrong and say the right thing.\r\n\r\nBut then he'll direct you in the general direction of the tape dispenser so you can tape the shreds of your paper back together into something.\r\n\r\nWhich he will rip apart again, and again, and again.\r\n\r\nAnd then finally you'll have something you're proud of.\r\n\r\nAnd he'll rip it apart because it's crap -- you're proud of crap.\r\n\r\nBut then that last final time, you'll have something you're proud of, that he finds acceptable, and it all ends up alright in the end. Your paper will be fine. Your grade will be fine. You'll have learned something about yourself, your writing, and a crap ton about your topic and the political leadership issues you investigate.\r\n\r\nI took this class for the easy writing credit. I stayed for the brutal yet honest (though sometimes hard to initially understand) feedback. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is not a very stressful class and is a great seminar to flesh out ideas about leadership and effective strategies regarding leading others. ",
