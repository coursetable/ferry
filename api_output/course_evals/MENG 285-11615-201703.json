            "\u00a0Insight into the reasons behind materials behaving the way they do. ",
            "\u00a0We went over the basic properties of metals, ceramics, and polymers, the three main categories of materials. We discussed reactions, crystal structures, phase diagrams, and learned about different material properties. ",
            "\u00a0Material sciences is about using the atomic properties of materials to explain the characteristics of such materials (metals, ceramics, polymers) in terms of their strength, ductility, corrosiveness, (ability to mix with other materials) and more. After learning about the properties of materials you can then analyze what type of materials would be optimal/best for building certain structures. ",
            "\u00a0You learn a lot about materials, structures, etc. Some of the material overlaps with mechanical design (like stress strain curves and materials working) and strength and def (stress strain curve), but there is a whole lot more you learn. It's a lot of material and a class I hadn't really wanted to take, but I see the value in knowing this stuff, as it helps you design better. ",
            "\u00a0This is a classic introductory course with a lot of different subjects. ",
            "\u00a0VERY basic knowledge of material science. A lot of basic stuff ",
            "\u00a0This class is a great introduction to materials science. We started at the quantum level looking at electron orbitals and ended up being able to explain nearly all properties of materials and why they act the way they do. I learned a lot from this class and found it to be very informative. ",
            "\u00a0This class provided a good overview of how quantum mechanics, atomic structure, bonding, and micro structure cause materials to have various properties. I feel that I have learned a great deal about how these characteristics affect materials physical and chemical properties. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting class but lectures were very slow and hard to learn from. ",
            "\u00a0Learned basic material science concepts ",
            "\u00a0We learned about metals, ceramics, and polymers, their properties and why these properties occur.  Though at first, this felt like a rehash of what we covered in genchem last year, the second half of the course especially was very interesting and seems quite applicable to my engineering interests. ",
            "\u00a0You're probably taking this course because you have to but it's actually really interesting material. The professor clearly knows a lot about it and is an expert in materials science so his enthusiasm makes dry lectures more interesting. ",
            "\u00a0everything from material classes to the atomic level. ",
            "\u00a0Materials science gave a basic overview of the three classes of materialsmetals, ceramics, and polymerswith almost the whole semester focused on metals. We discussed bonds, crystal structures, dislocations, stress/strain diagrams, phase diagrams, and corrosion, among other topics. It's kinda like softcore chemistry. There's a focus on intuition about how something will behave. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about how macro-scale properties of materials stem from their unique internal structures and chemical characteristics. It was insightful to learn and think about why certain materials behave the way they do, and how microstructures determine material properties and affect the design of mechanical systems. ",

            "\u00a0The course has interesting material but it isn't taught very well. Lectures are based on slides and so there is a lot of talking but not much discussion student-wise or many examples. It could be improved by being more engaging - interacting more with the students and asking questions rather than speaking the whole time. It would also help to make sure everyone knows what certain things mean in lecture - oftentimes, certain concepts such as some from thermodynamics aren't explained but are central to the lecture. ",
            "\u00a0The material of the course was good but it could be dry at times. You really have to be interested in the topic or simply dedicated to putting in the time to understand how all the different elements of the subject tie in together if you can't pay attention in class. ",
            "\u00a0This class has psets done in partners, so as long as you have a good partner who helps you out, the workload is pretty low key and manageable. They grade very harshly on the homeworks, which ultimately are a large part of the final grade according to the syllabus, and the grading there doesn't match up with the midterm/final. I said the same thing and got 4 points less credit on the midterm than I did on the homework, which doesn't really make sense. I heard Jan will give points back, but TAs definitely won't and will even discourage you going to the teacher to get points back, as 'they don't like when students try to get points' according to the TAs. I think grading needs to be more uniform across everything we turn in. ",
            "\u00a0It is a fun class, but the lectures could be more engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Janne is awesome! The course is not very demanding, but gives good understanding of mat sci ",
            "\u00a0The course was well structured and the problem sets did a good job of engaging us with the material. The only thing I found annoying about the course was the arbitrary grading by the TAs which put a lot of stress on the final exam. ",
            "\u00a0The topics covered in class were mostly interesting and seemed relevant to the field of materials science. The lectures, however, nearly always strayed to a place where it was hard to follow what was going on, or see relevance to where we started. The psets consistently asked questions that had not even been mentioned in class in passing. We had only one midterm, and the questions on it were largely identical to a pset we had turned in that day which many people struggled with, so we got no real feedback before the exam. The grading seemed sporadic at best, with same answers getting different grades between students. ",
            "\u00a0Overall this course was very good. I just wish there had been more on polymers, ceramics, and non mechanical properties, though I understand that its harder to draw conclusions with these topics; they're not as clear cut as metals. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated that lecture slides were posted online.  Lectures themselves were ok, but they were way to slow (especially for that time in the afternoon).  I liked the qualitative focus on the midterm and final- preparation was less memorizing random formulas and more trying to fully understand.\r\n\r\nA big problem with the course was the ridiculous homework grading.  Comments were snarky and extremely anal. For example, there were times I would take an example of something directly from the textbook and would lose points (and get a really condescending comment) because the TF didn't recognize it. Sarcastic comments would be less annoying if there weren't grading mistakes!  When you lose points because the TF didn't like how you drew a line or whatever, it becomes a lot harder to figure out which mistakes you made that were actually important.\r\n\r\nAlso, office hours were just individuals asking questions about the hw, and the time and place was never really posted in a clear place on canvas. ",
            "\u00a0More support to understand the material. Psets were very easy to finish but not much feedback on them. ",
            "\u00a0Very fair, good textbook ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nIf you're willing to self-learn, you can learn a lot\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nYou learn nothing in the classroom. Also, the part where this class has no formal prerequisites is a complete lie. The BlueBook says, \"Prerequisites: elementary calculus and background in basic mechanics (deformation, Hooke's law) and structure of atoms (orbitals, periodic table)\" I'm sorry, but none of that prepares you for the prerequisite knowledge on Gibbs Free Energy, Thermodynamics, and Electrochemistry that this class expects you to have. \r\n\r\nIt's full of seniors who are Mech E and Chem E majors who know all the stuff from before and hence take it as a gut class. The professor seems to acknowledge this too, and teaches the class accordingly (Or rather, he doesn't). The final exam was geared towards Chem E topics, which is why all of them knew everything. As a non-senior Mech E person, I felt pretty cheated by this class. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the lectures and generally found them helpful.  The problem sets did not seem to relate to the lectures, however.  I went through them by combining knowledge found in the book (usually different from class) with information found online.  I found both the lectures and the problem sets useful, though I would have liked to see them relate to each other more. ",
            "\u00a0Partner problem sets were really weird, so maybe that should change and we should just do homework individually. ",
            "\u00a0rather unorganized, no one ever knows what to expect on the exams ",
            "\u00a0This course is strong in that the syllabus covers the right amount of material, and it doesn't feel too rushed or too slow. That said, we could spend a little less time on metals so we'd have more time to go over ceramics and polymers. The partner problem sets worked out pretty well for me, and I think the exams were pretty well-placed.\r\n\r\nThe prof. promises that the exams won't require you to learn equations (and does not provide an equation sheet) so both tests ended up being a bunch of writing questions on a particular set of conceptual questions that weren't even explained that well in class. I wished the tests had used an equation sheet and included a few more problems like the homework, or the existing exams would have been okay if Jan's explanations had been clearer in class.\r\n\r\nI also had a very hard time understanding phase diagrams and Gibbs Free Energy from the lectures. Please try to make these lectures clearer, and go over how to draw Gibbs Energy curves before assigning them for homework. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: not too fast paced, jan cares about the students, relatively interesting material that is more theoretical in nature than quantitative. \r\n\r\n\r\nweaknesses: class can be a bit slow moving at times, wide variety of backgrounds, the fact that is it more qualitative means that sometimes it is unclear what the instructor is looking for on exams, homework ",
            "\u00a0The course could be improved by making the lectures more structured. If the lectures more closely followed the syllabus and were better defined the topics they covered, the class would be stronger. Furthermore, receiving better feedback on our assignments and having clearer lecture notes would be very helpful. I really enjoyed how competent and passionate Professor Schroers was in our class. ",
            "\u00a0The material was interesting but some of the more advanced topics would be easier to understand if I had a background in thermo. ",
            "\u00a0The professor was nice but the class was far too disorganized. ",
            "\u00a0Overall a useful course for me, but I thought the material could have used more depth.  While some of this is simply because this is an introductory course in materials science, perhaps skipping some of the basic chemistry components and taking the time to delve deeper into bonding and structure analysis and phase relations, etc. would be more valuable. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of this course was that we got a very nice overview of materials science. I especially liked how the course was structured, with each topic building on the previous one, and it was nice seeing how the different topics were related to practical applications in engineering and design. I think the main way that the course could be improved is that the lectures could have been more focused. In a given lecture, we talked about a lot of different stuff, so it was sometimes hard to figure out what concepts were important. I also wish discussion sections were used to go over material from lecture, rater than just an opportunity to ask questions like you would in office hours. Although I appreciated being able to ask questions on what I was confused about, I think it would have been more helpful if the sections were more structured. ",
            "\u00a0the strength of this course was the relatively small class size, it made it possible for us to occasionally work in groups to answer questions and go over information, however we were paired up for homework and my partner left me out to dry every week and maybe responded once to my texts or emails.

            "\u00a0Pretty helpful in terms of knowing how to design things well. Manageable workload, as you do homeworks with a partner. Definitely do all the homeworks, though, and understand them, as that's a good prediction of what is on exams. ",

I also appreciated that it wasn't excessively difficult in terms of workload, unlike a lot of other MechE classes. That said, I found the lectures to be frequently unengaging and felt like the course material could have been taught a lot better. All in all, though, not a bad class, and Jan is a kind prof. ",
            "\u00a0You're probably taking this because you're MechE anyways, but don't worry too much about this one. Workload isn't too high and the midterm is fair. Be warned though, the material from the end sneaks up on you and the final is pretty hard. ",
