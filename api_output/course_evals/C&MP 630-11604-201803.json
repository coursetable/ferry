Given that it is a year-long endeavour, the benefit of writing these assignments probably does not increase with increasing iterations of the same exercise. Maybe a rotation with another kind of exercise might be beneficial. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were the content and professors engagements, the weaknesses were really just style the second half of the course going around the table and having each student talk. More round table rapid fire talking would be better. ",

I would like to have a bit more of a focus on methods, especially as someone who has never used cellular methods in the past. I felt a little bit like I was in over my head at certain points, because a lot of methods that were assumed to be widely understood by everyone were completely unfamiliar to me. ",
