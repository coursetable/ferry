            "\u00a0It is nice that each week is about the same pace because the material is broken up well. Perhaps more time could be allotted to declensions and certain verb formation rules at the start, since these were new to me and it gets easier to deal once accustomed. Also, perhaps it is unavoidable given the aims of the course, but the vocabulary is clearly oriented towards reading the epics. However, it also means that a lot of basic words like numbers and certain verbs are missing. "
