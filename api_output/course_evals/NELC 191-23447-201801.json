            "\u00a0This course has a wonderful, immersive professor who is so talented and knowledgeable!  The only weakness for this course was that the course packet was expensive and ultimately not needed; however, it did serve as a great supplement to course material.  Additionally, the course's name (Ancient Ships) should be updated to reflect the fact that this is a primarily a course about ancient civilizations, and only its intersection with ships. ",

            "\u00a0I was attracted to the idea of a seminar, but the huge enrollment meant it got switched to a lecture with much less engagement that initially expected. After a couple weeks, the vast majority of the group stopped showing up, meaning we had a lecture hall with only a dozen or so kids, but still couldnt participate in the sorts of discussions I hoped to have.

The assignments are very open-ended and give a great deal of freedom. Finally, the class is low-work and low-stress. The main weakness of the course was that it was not about ships. Most lectures had a extremely tenuous connection to ships, and most of the time was spent discussing ancient artwork. Additionally, I was very disappointed by the guest lecture about maritime law; it lacked cohesion and clarity. ",

The workload for this course is very manageable and would be a great 5th course.  This course has my highest recommendation! ",

I took them seriously and it was reflected in my grades. I don't think most people that take this course actually have an interest in ancient ships lol but I do so I thought the papers were fun to write.

If someone is simply looking for a fun, not-too-intensive course, then I would highly recommend it. ",
