            "\u00a0This course provides a great overview of astronomy from the viewpoint of relativity. I learned a lot about the universe. ",
            "\u00a0This is a highly engaging course. We got to learn the physics of relativity and also reflect on the historical and social aspect of the theories and experiments. ",
            "\u00a0I learned different mathematical and theoretical applications of astronomy and relativity. I appreciated the balance between plug and chug equation problems and the more real life/applied aspects of scientific philosophical theories and theoretical astrophysics. While the material can at times be tough, it's approachable for almost everyone given that effort is put in. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the theories of Special and General Relativity and developments in relativistic astrophysics in the past century.  The course taught me how to apply my knowledge of these theories to relativistic situations. ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge of special and general relativity, love of black holes ",
            "\u00a0Both qualitative and quantitative understanding of basic principles of relativity and astronomy. "

            "\u00a0The course has a very logical progression. As a stem major, I preferred the first 2/3 of the course as it was more physics based. The last third was more philosophy heavy. ",
            "\u00a0This course is perfect for people who want a little of both worlds, the science and the humanity within the field of relativity. Professor Bailyn is very knowledgeable and is always ready to answer your question! ",
            "\u00a0i think although professor Bailyn put a lot of effort to make the course more intro-level friendly, theres still much disconnection if youre not coming from a science background. Its hard to make sense of the subjects in a larger context or have the level of expertise that can bring commentary which is often expected from the psets. i enjoyed the class mostly and would want to be able to do it better but its impossible if youre taking 4 other classes and this is not your major. I think especially mathematical concepts should be explained better. There were times when the ULAs didnt know how professor Bailyn did something and they were like yeah we dont know we do it this way. I think the teaching definitely could be improved. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Bailyn is incredibly smart and kind. His lectures are great and you can tell that he really wants you to learn and will go at your pace or make extra time for you if you need it. The course has a good amount of office hours especially with the ULAs. I recommend going at least once before the weekly problem set is due, even if you feel pretty comfortable or you feel entirely lost. They're grading it and can tell you exactly what to focus on.\r\n\r\nIt's also helpful that the quizzes and final are open book. They're all pretty fair. The only improvement I might suggest is easing a little bit on some of the problem set materials - a few of the questions were a bit too difficult for what we went over in class. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course were its material and the professors knowledge of the subject. Its weakness was the lecture format, which became unengaging for such a small class. ",
            "\u00a0ULAs are a wonderful recourse and the professor is really passionate about the material ",
            "\u00a0The course is designed for non-physics majors who are deeply interested in physics. It incorporates discussions about how science interacts with the social environment, which is very enlightening in unexpected ways. However, I personally find it rather challenging to answer those non-quantitative questions. The rubrics could be explained in greater detail. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely. This is by far the best course I have taken outside of my major. The level is simple enough to be easy to manage with no background, but still challenging enough to be interesting and stimulating. I would definitely take a continuation of this course if it was offered. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Prof. Bailyn is a good man, who cares very much about his students. He is truly passionate about the subject matter. The course itself is well organized, and not too demanding, so you can focus on enjoying the material. Quizzes aren't too hard if you've been keeping up with the HWs. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would! It is a course for both science and humanity people. ",
            "\u00a0I'd definitely recommend this course to a student interested in astronomy or physics that is willing to show up to class and put some work in. It is not overly intense, but you will have to keep up in order to prevent feeling lost. That being said, the topics are incredibly interesting and are well worth it. Professor Bailyn is kind, has cool lectures, and is such a dad (in the best way). ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course only to students that are interested in the course material. It is not a gut, but it doesnt go in-depth enough to be part of a real hard science field. ",
            "\u00a0I took this class for the QR credit but it ended up being one of my favorite classes this semester. I definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested in space and the universe without a strong calculus background. Im ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It has been a great source of intellectual challenge and joy to me. Wondering about the stars and the universe is both humbling and empowering. "
