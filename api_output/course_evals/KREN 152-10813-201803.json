            "\u00a0I learned a lot of Korean speaking, reading, writing and listening skills. I also learned a lot about Korean culture. ",
            "\u00a0I learned vocabulary, writing skills, speaking skills, spelling rules, and historical lessons. I also learned how to express myself more fully in the the Korean language. Through this class, I was also able to reflect on my life and process important happenings. ",
            "\u00a0I significantly improved my writing, gained a more natural fluency in my speaking, and got to interact with and think about parts of Korean culture that I have never before had the chance to think about. ",
            "\u00a0I learned not just new grammar and vocabulary but also about culture and life in Korea. I learned a lot about Korean work life and culture through watching Misaeng, and we spent a lot of time discussing real-life problems and issues both in Korea and just in society in general, which I thought was very cool and not often spoken about in many language classes. I improved my vocabulary, speaking, and writing skills greatly. ",
            "\u00a0I took the course to polish my knowledge of Korean grammar and conversational skills. Not only did I gain ample experience in doing so via in-class debates and reading responses, but I was also able to become more engaged in Korean contemporary culture. ",
            "\u00a0Korean L5 gives students a chance to practice and improve on oral and written skills in Korean, but also provides the opportunity to learn more about the nuances and intricacies of Korean culture. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much Korean!! ",
            "\u00a0How to speak and write Korean with more advanced vocabulary and smooth transitions ",
            "\u00a0I improved in my speaking, writing, and reading comprehension skills in Korean. Of these my speaking skills improved greatly through our in-class debates/discussions on various topics! ",
            "\u00a0I was able to hone my writing and speaking skills by taking this class and was exposed to various academics terms that I wouldnt have known without taking Korean as a language class here at Yale. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Lee-Smith was wonderful. She genuinely cared for all her students. She was always very enthusiastic.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This is definitely no fault of the professor. I love her. But structurally, the class is not as conducive to learning as it could've been. The students in this class are all at different levels. I honestly belonged in L4, but since L4 is not offered in the fall, Professor Lee-Smith told me I could take L5. But a class that was really catered for someone at my speaking, writing, and reading level would've been so much more helpful. I'm disappointed but not surprised at the lack of Korean classes offered at Yale. Seriously, only 1 L5 class? Chinese and Japanese both offer multiple L5 classes, at multiple levels. The class was also quite big for a language class - 15 students, which is the largest one I've taken since coming to Yale. And I've taken 5 language courses since coming to Yale! I hope Yale will hire more teachers and give more funding to the Korean language department in the future. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: fun, engaging, low-stress environment\r\nWeaknesses: none! ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this class was that it was very flexible and student interest driven. Through the Socio-Cultural Literary Project, Misaeng, I was able to learn about modern Korean culture and draw connections to American culture. This was highly valuable. Furthermore, the in-class debates were fruitful, prompted deeper thinking, and challenged me to express myself in Korean.\r\n\r\nA weakness of this class was that it was unstructured at many points in the semester. We were required to order a textbook and workbook, but never used them. I felt as if the vocabulary could have been reinforced more--or maybe a greater focus on a subset of vocabulary words that the instructor most wants us to learn. ",
            "\u00a0The course is pretty evenly spaced and the workload is manageable. It incorporates many different aspects of language learning. The only thing that could be improved is the syllabus  I didn't end up relying on it much but I wish that it had guided me more in terms of specific assignments rather than just the general content of what we were learning. The gap in the skill levels of students in the class was big, but I suppose that can't really be helped. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The discussion was always very fun and insightful, and the atmosphere of the class was always so welcoming and joyful. Despite coming from so many different backgrounds and levels of experience, Professor Lee was able to foster unity and help everyone improve. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The Misaeng project did take up at least 2-3 hours per week because we had to watch 2 episodes a week, but I really enjoyed it and learned a lot. ",
            "\u00a0A definite strength of this course was the instructor, Angela Lee-Smith's, personal engagement with every student. We were all given opportunities to express our opinions and personal experiences, thus practice our Korean, through prompts and discussions. A weakness was that the vocabulary could have been more fleshed out. We were given weekly quizzes for vocab, but we were never prompted to use the new vocabulary beyond the quizzes. A midterm quiz or a writing prompt that requires the use of 5+ new vocabulary words could help with this. ",
            "\u00a0The course is engaging and yet not extremely burdensome or stressful. The workload is really quite manageable, and most of the time taken for the class is on watching Korean drama (which can often be an excuse to relax while also being productive). There is not much I would change to the course -- it's a great way to keep up with/learn more Korean! ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Lee is excellent. She is so enthusiastic. There is a lot of busy-work, but I guess that can't really be helped in a language class because you need to practice more to get better. Weakness: sometimes I wasn't sure what the purpose of some activities were. I'm sure I could guess now, but it would be helpful to have Prof Lee explain why something that doesn't seem that important to do is actually really helpful! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: flexibility, the professor, connection among students ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very discussion based- class felt personal and that facilitated language learning and my eagerness to learn, lots of speaking practice, teacher graded all assignments personally and gave feedback on mistakes and encouraged us to fix them so i was able to correct my simple grammar mistakes\r\nWeaknesses: felt like vocab or grammar could have been emphasized more; vocab words weren't reviewed/brought up in casual conversation after learning them for just a week or so so i didn't retain them ",
            "\u00a0There wasnt any weakness in the class! It was fun exciting and educational all at the same time! "

            "\u00a0Yes! It was my favorite class this semester, and I also learned so much. ",
            "\u00a0KREN 152 is a must-take for any Korean speakers at Yale College. This was the first class in college where I purely, genuinely wanted to learn--not for the grade. Truly . ",
            "\u00a0I would. If you are a heritage student, this course is great in helping you reconnect with where you are in your language skills. The book-learning is great but this course emphasizes all the components of language learning that can't be taught through a book: cultural immersion, advanced speaking, a community of learners, etc. It's a kind of learning you can't get in a lot of classes at Yale and an overall great experience. I would highly recommend it to balance out your schedule. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Prof Lee-Smith is super nice and the course material has been very helpful. If you have a strong background in Korean the workload wouldnt be a problem at all. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Completely. I love Professor Lee! She is amazing and loves her students very much and cares greatly for each individual student. Also, though L5 Korean is a bit more workload-wise, I loved my class and the classroom atmosphere because we really get to discuss high-level topics and use the language to interact. You should definitely take this class for Professor Lee, for the people, and to learn and improve your Korean of course! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to both heritage and non-heritage students who have a desire to learn Korean. The class is at once comfortable and intellectually stimulating. I definitely noticed improvements in my speaking, writing, and even texting skills as I progressed through the course. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would -- really manageable workload, get to meet some great people, and get to practice/learn more Korean. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are dedicated to improving your language skills! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it truly feels like a comfortable environment to be vulnerable in individual weaknesses and strength ",
            "\u00a0yes definitely!!! even if to get to know professor lee-smith, i would definitely definitely recommend ",
            "\u00a0Yes I totally would especially to students who have only learned Korean in a non-academic setting. "
