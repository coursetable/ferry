            "\u00a0I learned a ton. Studio really pushes you to try new things every day and never stop learning. I became a better designer by taking this class and got some good practice with Adobe Creative Suite, Rhino and hand-drawing. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to create spaces and think about architectural ideas and theories and explore them visually. I really was able to push myself creatively, and I learned how change, form, biome and material influences architecture and design. ",
            "\u00a0I became more confident in pursuing my own the niches of my own interests academically, and how to sort through ideas to create a digestible project. It was a class more about knowing one's one work style than anything else. It could also be titled, Ways of Seeing. Anything I learned was from my own explorations, and was specific to my own interests, but it was all carefully monitored by the TFs and Trattie. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a good intro to studio style classes. We really learned how to think about space in so many different contexts and definitions. We were able to produce so much exploratory work and really refine our ideas. I definitely learned how to express my ideas through drawings and models. ",
            "\u00a0This course has given us a first introduction to creative architectural thinking. Thanks to this class, we were taught to process space, and other architectural concepts through various exercises and lenses. ",
            "\u00a0I learned abstract ways to think about design, space, and the ways we experience these things. I also learned a bit more about using 3D modeling programs and machinery in the shop. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to explore in every sense of the word - with materials, with ways of thinking and solving problems, with collaboration - its a great course for experimentation. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This is a terrific course in almost every way. I wish it had more technical architecture, but also felt like the fact that the projects were open ended meant that even with limited abilities we could really shine. ",
            "\u00a0It was so good the syllabus was engaging and abstract in all the right ways, and I felt like I had the space to find my own voice in my work. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths was that each student was really able to push themselves creatively. I felt like I really had the room to explore what I was interested in, and could tailor each of the projects to my specific interests. I also thought the individual attention from the professor and the TAs was incredibly helpful. Sometimes the course was frustrating as we worked on projects, but I think that's just the nature of studying architecture. It also felt, because we were getting so much feedback on our progress, that I was being pulled in different directions sometimes which became confusing. ",
            "\u00a0The course is strong as a personal journey. It was also exciting to become more invested in my classmates' work. \r\n\r\nIn the assignments, the deliverables often felt designed to overwork the students. This may have been intentional, forcing us to create good and bad work, but often it felt unclear how much each investment each assignment asked for. ",
            "\u00a0I think the format of the TFs was kinda confusing. Often I didn't know who I should be talking to about my project so I think that could be streamlined. It was helpful to talk to all of them, but there wasn't really an order to it. One of the things I found most frustrating about the course was the time limit during reviews. I understand that this was a big class and everyone needed to time to explain their work, but I often found that presenting in pairs meant that the two students got different amounts of attention from the critics. I don't know if there really is a solution for this. Also, I think it would be good to give a hard cap on how long students should talk for because often students would ramble a bit and hearing the reviewers talk is definitely more important. In the beginning, everything happens really fast, which was good for experimenting quickly. I also really liked the format of our midterm project because it was a great chance to grow our ideas. ",
            "\u00a0The course was strong in the sense that each student was given special attention, and an opportunity to progress tremendously. The project-based structure enabled us to focus and deepen our thoughts with each exercise. ",
            "\u00a0This course is great because it allows you to be very creative and flexible and pursue ideas you are passionate about. However, at times it felt a little too open-ended, and it often felt more like an art class than an architecture class (not a bad thing if that's what you're into). There is not much training in computer programs, so if you wish to do 3D modeling, you must learn on your own time. ",
            "\u00a0Trattie and our TAs welcomed any and all ideas for our projects but always pushed us to really think about the *why* and the *how* of our concepts, helping us develop them to the fullest potential - they were wonderful. My only negative was that critiques often didnt stick to the schedule, leaving those at the end to present without many people to listen and with less time than others, but it is ever thus with studio. "

        [
            "\u00a0Yes, but only if you want to spend the time on it. This isn't a course that you get as much out of if you don't really push yourself. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course highly to someone who is interested in architectural ideas, visual exploration and the field of architecture. If you're taking this class you already are majoring in architecture, but anyways, I loved the course and its freedom. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend junior studio to anyone who has the opportunity to take it, especially with Trattie. ",
            "\u00a0If you're taking this you're an architecture major, so you have no choice. But it's very worthwhile, and you will get out of it what you put in. It allows you to think very creatively and abstractly if you choose to pursue those ways of thinking. ",
            "\u00a0Youre likely taking this because its a prereq, but still would recommend! ",
            "\u00a0If you're in this course it's because you're an architecture major and you have to be. But if Trattie is teaching you will be very glad you are. You will probably be confused and a little irritated when you see that you will be drawing peppers, sea creatures, and logs, but the creative freedom this course provides helps every student develop their own design sensibility incredibly well and quickly. Just go with the flow and listen to what Trattie has to say, you won't regret it. Erin was also an incredible TF and is the reason I survived this semester. ",
            "\u00a0You're gonna have to take it as a major! My main point of advice would be not to take it too seriously-- use the course as a time to explore your own creative voice and style, and always push the boundaries of the assignment. "
