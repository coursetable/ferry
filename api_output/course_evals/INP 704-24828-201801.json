            "\u00a0Caroline was great. Her lectures tended to be very straight forward. That was not the same for Alvero. \r\n\r\nIn general, the course can be greatly improved in a number of ways:\r\n1) Understand that we are neuroscience Ph.D. students and actually know basic things about the brain. There was a lot of dumbing down of the material which was not only unhelpful, but quite insulting.\r\n2) There was a lot of overlap in lectures between foundations of systems neuro and this course. It would be great if the professors could coordinate. \r\n3) Have shorter lectures/no lectures and leave more time for anatomy.\r\nI enjoyed the last section wherein we had to read a paper and relate it to the brain. I felt that was way more on par with the level of course we deserve. \r\n\r\nLastly, the final class which was supposed to be fly neuroanatomy had ZERO neuroanatomy and was just a tour of some of the fly labs. While this was marginally interesting, it was also a waste of time. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: there is a lecture section as well as a lab section\r\nWeaknesses: It was hard to engage with the material. Part of it was that the expectations of the class were not laid out at the beginning of the semester. Anatomy is memorization based by nature, and with classes meeting so infrequently/with no extra class work, it was hard to retain information. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Interactive learning, great instructors \r\nWeaknesses: The lectures were quite extensive and a bit repetitive. It would have been better if there was more time for hands on activities. "

            "\u00a0If you want to learn detailed neuroanatomy, this course will not be very helpful. If you want an overview of main systems of the brain and to be able to see these structure in real brain tissue, this class might be appropriate. Improvements could be made to make the class more engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This course is great if you need review on neuroanatomy concepts. "
