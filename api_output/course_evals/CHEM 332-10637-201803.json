Then twice more in grad school. That's when you realize you've kind of gotten it wrong all those other times, but NOW you get it.\" \r\n\r\nDon't expect to come out of this course knowing everything about gases, thermodynamic relations, phases, equilibrium, and kinetics.

You will cover ideal gas theory which transitions into thermodynamics, on which you will spend most of the semester. This includes but is not limited to the three fundamental laws of thermodynamics and their manipulations for different environmental conditions (isothermal, adiabatic, etc). You will develop relations for work and entropy. This will inform the study of solution chemistry, electrochemistry, equilibria and kinetics. ",

For instance, instead of thinking of matter in broad terms like solids, liquids, and gases, it's cool to get a little exposure to the underlying molecular/atomic motions and interactions. Super cool stuff. ",

            "\u00a0This course is not that hard (do not lets its reputation scare you!). The lectures are not that helpful because they seem so simple. The psets are not that long and good. Section was helpful because it gave you problems that were comparable to the ones on the exams. The exams were unexpectedly hard, but the curve is really in your favor. Prof. Schmuddy has wonderful intentions, but his lectures are sort of frantic and confusing. He is very fair and kind. ",
            "\u00a0The textbook was good. The lectures were slow yet slightly confusing. The problem sets were short and did not reflect the style of exam questions. More practice problems would have been good. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strength is professor follows the same path as the book so it is easy to learn the material because if you dont understand something its easy to find in the book and relearn it. ",
            "\u00a0The course could be improved by selecting a textbook that did not dilute the important information as much. ",
            "\u00a0Problem sets were due weekly, worth only 5%, and not very representative of the test questions themselves. Section was helpful only if you had a grasp on the material before hand, as a worksheet was provided and simply done together on the board. The text book is very necessary in this class (and I would recommend getting the correct edition - as the previous edition had several typos in formulas that resulted in a lot of wasted time trying to figure out). Prof is good about explaining the concepts enough using examples and deriving equations, but reading the textbook is necessary for background material and understanding the concepts more conceptually. ",
            "\u00a0This is a good course. Professor Schmuttenmaer can be a little unorganized, and will fall well behind the syllabus. But in general, the material is engaging as a continuation of Chem163/167. Very little of what we covered felt like it was much more advanced or outside the scope of material introduced by Professor Zilm in 167. To this end, the course in integral in solidifying the foundation of basic physical chemistry for any chem, engineering, or other physical sciences major. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very well-taught and well-organized.  My only improvement would be to make midterm exams a bit shorter.  They are extremely long for the difficulty.  I feel that a lot of students found their only problem to be time, and not mastery of the material. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the Fermi questions, I think practicing those on every pset gives you a pretty good sense of the logic needed to make estimations/approximations (a pretty useful skill). \r\n\r\nI think the course could be improved by going a little faster, I feel like we didn't learn a ton of stuff and I would've liked to! ",
            "\u00a0The course was way too slow. I honestly found my gen chem 2 course more challenging and rigorous than this class. If I am going to spend a semester of my time studying something, I want to either learn something new or at least gain appreciable detail in the study of something old. I did neither this semester. I think the best way to improve this class would be to recognize that most of the students already have a solid grip on the much of the material, pick up the pace. Too much time was spent on PV=nRT, what a partial derivative is, and so on... ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that Schmuttenmaer is a very fair professor, and his tests are very fair and representative of the homework/practice problems. If you read the textbook, you can do very well in the course even if you didn't understand one of the lectures. Sometimes Schmuttenmaer's lectures are a bit disorganized, making it hard to follow, but, overall, I think the course was fairly decent. ",

            "\u00a0The class followed the book very closely, which is a big plus for when you're lost on a concept. Sometimes the proofs to the concepts could be made more explicit in class. ",
            "\u00a0The first half of the semester was really fun - lots of demonstrations and interesting examples. Prof. Schmuttenmeyer was energetic and explained topics clearly, though often only after direct questions. The last part of the course was more dry, maybe because of the rush to finish the syllabus. ",
            "\u00a0In general, the exams were a bit weird--they tested material that we briefly covered or random tangents that the professor mentioned in class. ",
            "\u00a0The course could be more organized, and the tests could better reflect the material that we went over in class. ",
            "\u00a0I wish that we had gone over some basic example problems in class instead of only learning theory/derivations. ",
            "\u00a0I don't think that section was as useful as it could have been, I feel like the TAs didn't really know what they were doing at times. The professor also didn't seem to know what he was doing sometimes. Overall, this was quite a confusing course. ",
            "\u00a0Great overview of Thermodynamics, I like the book being used - its very clear and presents the information super well (contrasting with the book my Thermo class was using which was terrible). Professor Schmuttenmaer was super enthusiastic and a very sympathetic professor. I think the material should be gone through faster so we get through the entire curriculum though which would happen with better organization. ",
            "\u00a0I guess I just wasn't sure how to do better. I studied hard, knew the material, went to section. Yet never managed to get above 90 in the exams. I am very disappointed. ",

He offers ample previous practice exams and finals, making it easy to see the style of questions 4. The TFs made worksheets that were similar to exam questions and strong  enough to actually be useful\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: 1. Professor wasted a lot of time in class failing with demonstraction and we fell very behind. We spent 2 classes on electrochemistry and 3 classes on kinetics. We didn't get to photoredox or any other stuff. That's ridiculous, especially given kinetics and photoredox are amongst the most important subjects for organic and inorganic chemists. 2. The homework doesn't really reflect the exams, given they are from the book and thus very, very mathematical. 3. The book doesn't entire reflect what he emphasizes in class 4. Exams were too easy or too hard and thus the averages were always awkward, making it tough to know your placement in a class. 4. ",

",
            "\u00a0Its a pretty bad course overall. Im not sure. The strengths were the TAs. The weakness was that nobody could really answer your questions, sometimes information was presented incorrectly, etc. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that this course can somewhat be self-taught by following the textbook, to which the course material flows quite well with. It is also a fun and engaging course thanks to Prof. Schmuttenmaer. On the downside, the lessons and derivations were sometimes disjointed due to time, which was a function of the demos and videos we see (not that I'm complaining). "

Cramming the night before an exam does not really work, as exam questions require critical thinking about integrating different concepts. Classes build off the previous class, so understanding the material as it is taught is the only way to not actually get lost in lecture. ",
            "\u00a0If you're taking this course, you likely have to. But all things considered I enjoyed this course. The pace and expectations were reasonable. Exams are often time pressured and Professor Schmuttenmaer has a habit of putting quirky questions, somewhat out of left field. But all in all you'll walk out of Chem332a with an appreciable understanding of chemical thermodynamics,  a foundation to the physical sciences. ",

I came into the class expecting it to be one of my favorites because I'm a chem nerd, but I was rather disappointed by the content of the class. The material we covered was really just gen-chem for marginally more complex systems. That being said, if you do have to take this class, you will be relieved to hear that the material isn't that challenging despite its boring nature. ",
            "\u00a0No. Unless you have to take it, take the physics class for thermodynamics. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to another student. There are very few chemistry professors who will write tests as fairly as Schmuttenmaer will. Be warned about a few things before entering this class. This class is very deceptive in the sense that you can float through the semester not really paying attention and then all of a sudden bomb a test if you don't prepare well for it. It doesn't require an insane amount of preparation, but you should still prepare decently well (hint: read the textbook, which is very clear and concise on everything taught). There are three groups of people taking the class. The first is the MB&B majors who are taking this over the other CHEM 328 (which is taught poorly from what I understand); these people seemed to have no interest in the class and seemed a bit frazzled. The second group of people are the chemistry majors. They want to enjoy the class, but most of them are terrorized by p chem lab and are completely deceased when it comes to CHEM 332. In fact, many chem majors don't come to lecture at all becuase they are so preoccupied with p chem lab. Be warned: this class becomes meaningless while taking p chem lab because all of your time will be focused there; many chem majors received lower grades than they wanted/expected because they just didn't have the time to devote to this class. The third group of people are the chemical engineering kids. These are the MOST ANNOYING group of people I have probably ever witnessed in a class. All of the Chem E kids have already learned a vast majority of the material from other courses, and they are extremely arrogant and disrespectful to the TAs and Schmuttenmaer frequently (talking loudly in class, correcting Schmuttenmaer when he makes a small mistake and snickering about it, acting like they know more than the TAs, etc). They are all (not all, but most) annoying twats who need to learn to be respectful (particularly @the group of sophomore boys). Everyone else in the class was visibly annoyed by the Chem E kids during lecture/section. Schmuttenmaer is a very nice man, and I enjoyed him as a professor. He is quite humorous if you are awake enough to go to class at 9am. Other students are quite harsh towards Schmuttenmaer, which confuses me a bit, because they clearly have not experienced many other (poorly) taught STEM courses at Yale in order to realize that Schmuttenmaer is pretty decent. ",
            "\u00a0If you are a chemE or chemistry major, you are required to take this course, so I suggest that you read ahead in the textbook if possible during the semester to be familiar with the material before you see it in class.  If this course is not required for your major, I don't really see why you would take this course, as there are more interesting (and probably easier) science credit awarding courses, but if you happen to love physical chemistry, then godspeed. ",
            "\u00a0Only if it is required for the major. Supposed better than CHEM 328 (the biological applications version). But the lectures are pretty not useful, so be prepared to do a lot of self-studying from the textbook. ",

            "\u00a0NO and not with schmuttenmaer. honestly i only have terrible things to say about this lecture with this prof. he has absolutely no idea how to teach and going to lectures was the biggest waste of time EVER. i cannot recommend that you dont take this class with him. honestly exams were hogwash!  like you wont learn anything i would give this course a 0 if i could ",

            "\u00a0Obviously if you're reading this you already know you have to take it soooooooooo. Pchem the class, on its own, is honestly not that bad. Schmutty is super entertaining and will have lots of fun demonstrations and he knows what he's talking about. The real problem with the class is doing it with all your other classes. This is definitely a class that you have to buy the book for -- an older edition will be fine -- but you really will benefit a lot from seeing how the book explains things over the way Schmutty does. the problem with this is that actually reading the book takes a solid chunk of time and the psets will take a decent bit of time too, except you will not have any time this semester if you are in pchem lab. The hardest part about this class is needing to devote a reasonable amount of time to it to succeed but having negative time because of writing pchem lab reports. ",

If you're just trying to get this out of the way and you're a bio major who doesn't like chem, take the other class. If you're interested in the material/willing to maybe do worse, then this is worth it. Also  if you took freshman orgo sit yourself down and have a serious discussion with your soul about if you actually remember gen chem because I was so sure I did and did not, in fact, remember much gen chem and it kicked my ASS before I got that cleared up ",
