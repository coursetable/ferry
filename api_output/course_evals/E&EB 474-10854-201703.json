            "\u00a0I learned how to use new programs to analyze data, and how to integrate information collected over several years. I sharpened my analytical skills and critical thinking. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me to further develop my lab skills as well as developing my own project. This involved understanding the long process of submitting and editing proposals, experimental design, interpreting preliminary results, etc. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the research process from the proposal stage, performing experimental work, analyzing data, and writing a research paper. I learned skills such as Polymerize Chain Reaction, an extraction procedure, and how to use statistical software on allele sizes to determine population structure. Beyond the specific skills I acquired in the course, I also had exposure to problem-solving techniques and proper laboratory techniques. ",
            "\u00a0Through this research, I learned how to perform many lab procedures including DNA extraction, gel electrophoresis, and polymerase chain reaction; laboratory protocol; phylogenetic methods; data management; and scientific writing. ",
            "\u00a0I practiced lab skills that I had learned in this lab over the summer, involving preparing and staining embryo samples, and learned about more imaging techniques that we started using this semester. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about data collection, morphology, how to gain information from research papers, CT Scanning, rendering software and more. "

            "\u00a0It really depends on your specific research. Mine ended up running long for external reasons and this made it really tough to get through reading/finals period, but this was very specific to my process. Great support from faculty, and you get close with your profs! ",
            "\u00a0I was very grateful to have a lot of first-hand experience and perform most of the experimental procedures independently. I was able to ask for help and receive it and great feedback when necessary. I loved having a lot of flexibility in choosing when to come in to work on my project. However, one area of improvement could be to actually track the number of hours spent working in the lab. Because of the flexibility, I found myself staying longer than 10-12 hours a week and would end up staying 15+ hours which became stressful especially when I had a lot to do with other work and classes. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this class are that it provides undergraduates an opportunity to do full-fledged research independently in a lab setting. It's only weakness is that it's sometimes difficult to maintain a regular schedule for lab hours, but it usually doesn't end up being a problem. ",
            "\u00a0No weaknesses, this was one of the most rewarding classes I took this semester. It was really nice to be responsible for my own learning/project and see how far I could advance the work. "

            "\u00a0If you are interested in research, absolutely! It is a very specific type of learning and work though! If you love it, you love it. If you don't, it would be a long semester. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to a student wishing to gain experience working in a lab. They need to be willing to put in a lot of work both inside and outside of the lab. ",
            "\u00a0This is an excellent opportunity, and one of the coolest things about being a Yale student. I'm an English major, but I had the opportunity to do research that will probably lead to the description of a new species of fish! It's an amazing opportunity. ",
            "\u00a0If you have the opportunity to do research for credit, absolutely take it! There will likely be periods of confusion, or your software wont work, or you wont have enough background info to proceed, but its all part of the process. In a way, research for credit helped me learn how to learn when I went a few weeks with technical difficulties. I spent a lot of time going through the internet and becoming more familiar with my software and finding other ways to be productive. Although delving into my research was really rewarding, I definitely dont think thats the extent of what there is to be gained. \r\nAlso, if you want to do E&EB research, but arent sure who to work with, Prof. Sargis is one of the most hard working, patient and kind people Ive ever met. If you have the opportunity to work with him you should absolutely take it. "
