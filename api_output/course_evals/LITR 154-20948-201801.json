            "\u00a0I had never read the Bible before taking this course, and I really did not know anything about it. After a few months of intensive study with Prof. Brisman, I feel fairly well versed in it. I can scarcely believe that only last January, I could not have explained the difference between the Torah, the Hebrew Bible, and the Old Testament. \r\n\r\nProf. Brisman put a great deal of emphasis on the structure and composition of the Bible: how, when, and by whom each book was composed. We learned the Documentary Hypothesis, which proposes that the first five books of the Bible (the Pentateuch/Torah) were composed by four authors: J, E, P, and D. We investigated the origin of the similarities between the Synoptic Gospels (Mark, Matthew and Luke), and found that Matthew and Luke likely share two sources: an early version of Mark, and the unknown Q. I think this historical information was absolutely critical to our study of the Bible as a literature. Whether we were interpreting a parable of Jesus or a pericope from the Pentateuch, we were able to put the piece in its historical context, and to separate the viewpoints of different authors.\r\n\r\nProf. Brisman's Some Matters of Form was incredibly useful in improving my writing. As evidence, I have managed to write this entire course evaluation without using \"quote\" as a noun or \"reference\" as a verb. \r\n\r\nFinally, I gained familiarity with a many lines from Shakespeare (especially King Lear), which perhaps will serve as useful quotations if I want to impress a first date. I also learned several humorous anecdotes from Prof. Brisman's life, which will probably be less useful for this purpose but were very enjoyable nonetheless. ",
            "\u00a0Through taking this course, I gained the ability to read Biblical texts with a new attention to detail, taking into consideration aspects such as authorship, intent, and historical and geographical context. This allowed me to gain a greater insight into how the Bible was composed and the different goals the various authors may have had in mind. ",
            "\u00a0We investigated the multiplicity of voices and narratives in the Bible through comparative close readings. The course encouraged us to grasp various interpretations of fundamental ethical questions, to appreciate a diversity of opinions while sharpening our own perspective on Biblical narratives. On a more literary note, the class allowed us to dig into the creation of figurative language, which Prof. Brisman pointed to in our studies of both Testaments. ",
            "\u00a0In examining the multi-vocality of the Bible that makes it literature, this course made me realize how it applies to today's contexts and why people reference it in and outside of a religious context. I spent time working on strategies for close-reading, considered  differences in translation, and examined multiple layers of moral meanings when doing literary analysis. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to analyze the Bible for multivocality, interrogate the authorship and sources of passages, and consider different arguments for the meaning and authorship of pericopes. ",
            "\u00a0This course changed the way that I read the Bible. As a collection of literature, the Bible is a whole new text! "

            "\u00a0This is a wonderful course. Prof. Brisman is knowledgeable and dedicated, and in nearly fifty years he has polished this course until it gleamed. I learned a great deal from him, and he improved my writing substantially. The small class size meant that each of us received ample attention and feedback. I very much enjoyed his anecdotes and the analogies he drew to other literature and current events.\r\n\r\nI really cannot think of too much to improve. I would have liked to read a little more of the passages from the Old Testament that are most frequently quoted in the New (First Isaiah and a few of the Minor Prophets). Perhaps we could have had a class on these, and explored the differences. I appreciated that we did this for Second Isaiah 40:3 (\"A voice of one calling, 'In the wilderness prepare the way for the Lord'\" vs. \"A voice of one calling in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way for the Lord'\"). Also, I think it would be nice if Prof. Brisman gave us a theme on which to focus for each reading, so that we might pick up on some of the passages that he highlights in class. ",
            "\u00a0This was one of my absolute favorite courses at Yale. Each class brought great lectures as well as ample opportunity to participate in the seminar aspect of the course. Professor Brisman always gave highly constructive and insightful feedback both in response to classroom discussions and written assignments. The only real weakness is that I wish there were a couple more small writing assignments throughout the semester so as to give students more opportunity to practice. ",
            "\u00a0The discussions are as thought-provoking as the writing assignments. The class dynamic encourages students to explore the dialogues between (and within) the texts, to learn to step away from preconceived biases. ",
            "\u00a0I found this course interesting and engaging. Professor Brisman led excellent discussions in class and offered plenty of feedback on essays. His essay preferences are rather idiosyncratic, some might even say dated, but I found that writing without a thesis helped me to consider different arguments and counterarguments. In terms of weaknesses, nothing sticks out in my mind. ",
            "\u00a0This course did a good job of providing a sampling of texts from the Bible, but it seems that some of the texts left out could have been necessary for the full picture of the Bible to be discussed in class. "

            "\u00a0The Bible as a Literature is a wonderful course. Prof. Brisman has taught it for nearly 50 years, and his mastery of the Bible is second to none. He knows Hebrew and Greek, which gives you a window into the original text that you can't get just by reading the translation.\r\n\r\nThis class will teach you all about the Bible-its history, its composition, and how to read it as \"a literature\" rather than as a book, or even a collection of books. As an atheist who was entirely unfamiliar with it, I never could have imagined that the Bible is every bit as complex and fascinating as Greek mythology or American literature. I was also taken aback by how many elements of our culture are rooted in the Bible-literature, art, music, and politics, and society.\r\n\r\nProf. Brisman is a kind and wonderful professor who cares deeply about his students. We all had a lot of individual attention from him, and I met with him before I wrote every essay. Just as Jesus relates the Gospel through parables, Prof. Brisman explains the Bible by using analogies to literature, politics (he is definitely not a Trump supporter), and his own life-often humorous, sometimes sad, but always open, honest and kind. \r\n\r\nThis class will also definitely improve your writing. Prof. Brisman is a bit strict: at the beginning of the class, he presented us with a seven-page document entitled \"Some Matters of Form\", which has a list of mistakes to avoid (did you know that \"reference\" isn't a verb)? He also encourages you to write an essay that explores a topic without being confined to a single thesis statement. It was challenging, but I found it incredibly valuable to learn to write in a new way. \r\n\r\nIf you're unsure whether this course will be a good fit for you, come to the first class-Prof. Brisman teaches a real lesson, so you will get a good idea of what it is like. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student. No matter one's religious background or lack thereof, it is important to gain an understanding of texts that have been highly influential to society. This course allowed me to gain a new perspective on works I had been familiar with for quite a while but had never actually analyzed. This course is highly engaging and helps provide you with the tools to analyze literature in general in a more thoughtful manner. ",
            "\u00a0Let's put it this way: if you care at all about ethics, literature, diversity, tolerance, or history, this class is for you. All voices are heard in seminar discussions. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student, whether or not you have had previous exposure to the Bible. Work load-wise, it's not too heavy between readings and a few papers distributed throughout the semester. I will say that as my first literature class at Yale, I had a significant learning curve in doing close-readings and struggled to get to a satisfactory level of analysis in essays examining a single passage or comparing multiple passages. If you try to soak up as much as possible in the class discussions though, you will easily come away with new appreciations for the Bible's complexities that are relevant beyond simply a religious context. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student if they are interested in the Bible and want to improve their writing. ",
            "\u00a0This is course is a great deal of reading, but the small seminar allows for really good debate and discussion. Highly recommend to anyone with any level of prior experience with the Bible. (be that none or extensive) "
