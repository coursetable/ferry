            "\u00a0the class encouraged taking a close look at literary texts and discussion about the historical context that could produce them.  I enjoyed thinking about the complicated relationships between people groups in the ancient world ",
            "\u00a0This was a wonderful course which should be A REQUIREMENT for every Divinity school student. This looks at how Judaism and Christianity were much more closely intertwined, on a spectrum, than what is commonly understood. This course shows the depth of the human connection and elucidates a higher truth: We are all brothers and sisters. How can a divinity school expect a student to understand what it means to be a Christian without first truly understanding who Jesus was, and the tradition in which he was born and followed so closely? Quite frankly, I think YDS needs to do a much better job at interfaith understanding. I believe studying divinity at Yale calls for classes like these--classes that demand greater critical thought and more depth and breadth. It's the 21st century, and we need this understanding now more than ever! It's time for all of us to step up. "

            "\u00a0I go back and forth on this, but I think it would have been helpful to have primary texts assigned in advance. Personally, this helps me to think more deeply about the text and come to opinions regarding critical issues. At times I think we sacrificed depth because we read the material for the first time in class. \r\n\r\nI appreciated the breadth of the materials we covered, especially regarding eastern Christianity! ",
            "\u00a0I think it might be helpful talk a bit more about genre and how that affects the texts we read, and also about the methodologies scholarship uses to try to understand and situate the historical context of the literature- and the strengths and weaknesses of such approaches.  \r\n\r\nThe class is genuinely interesting and engaging and encourages both the background of the texts and close literary reading of the texts. ",
            "\u00a0Just keep doing your research. There is so much knowledge to mine. You're bringing to light a deeper truth. "

            "\u00a0Yes, I would.  it allows the opportunity at a specific topic in a lot of different literature from different time periods, and I found course interesting for its interest in an area of scholarship that is growing.  Also, the attention to current scholarship that is offering new perspectives is great. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I would require it for every YDS student. Every divinity student should have a much greater understanding of Christianity by studying its ancient ties with Judaism and how it grew out of that--and in what ways and why. MORE FOCUS ON ALL OF OUR COMMONALITIES AND LESS ON THE DIFFERENCES. IT'S WHAT THE WHOLE WORLD NEEDS RIGHT NOW. The sad truth is, YDS is behind the times and most of its student population. This does not bode well. "
