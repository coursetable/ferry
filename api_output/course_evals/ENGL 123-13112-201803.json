            "\u00a0I feel like my writing improved dramatically during this course. I'd never taken a creative writing course before, but I could not have asked for a better experience. The class workshops were immensely helpful, and I feel like I have a better understanding of character, style, form, and really everything. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to put my ideas onto paper, and about techniques I could apply to my own writing. I learned to read fiction, poetry, and drama for craft and was exposed to many great writers. ",
            "\u00a0A wonderful survey of basic creative writing genres. I'm primarily a poet so it was great to get a chance to experiment with other forms in a safe and supportive space. ",
            "\u00a0I learned everything from literary analysis to refining the craft of my writing. ",
            "\u00a0I got better at close reading, gained a better understanding of the wide variety of types of creative writing, and improved my revision skills. ",
            "\u00a0This course covered creative writing with three units: fiction, poetry, and drama. We learned by reading works within each genre and then writing several pieces within each. In particular, we wrote a short story for fiction, several different kinds of poems, such as slant poems, ekphrastic poems, prose poems, and ode poems, for poetry, and a dramatic scene or a short one-act play for drama. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about writing in the three areas of focus--short story, poetry, and drama. ",
            "\u00a0I practiced creative writings in many different styles, most of which I had never tried before. I also learned how to revise my own creative writing, and how to help other people revise theirs. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: Good readings, fast paced, productive workshops and class activities, nice balance of structured and freeform assignments, broad spectrum of topics. \r\nWeaknesses: none really. ",
            "\u00a0It would be great to have more workshops, but I understand that time doesnt permit. ",
            "\u00a0Emily is a queen! So fun and engaging and gives very specific feedback that really gets to the heart of the writing. My only wish is that the class included creative nonfiction as well. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a great introduction to all different kinds of creative writing. It could be improved by deeper discussions on fewer works. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely loved this course. I personally had not had much experience with creative writing prior to taking this course, so this was an entirely new experience for me. I have grown so much as a writer and as a person through this class, and I am so grateful for this opportunity to write creatively; it was so freeing. I also really enjoyed exploring the different genres. I particularly loved the guest lectures we had; they often reminded me why I was interested in creative writing in the first place, in this expression of humanity on the page. In particular, Terrance Hayes' lecture was probably the turning point for me in terms of realizing and really understanding what it is to write and how to approach writing. I also loved Lynda Paul's lecture and Deborah Margolin's lecture. They blew me away. They were so moving and inspiring. I left those lectures entirely speechless and just absolutely in love with writing.\r\n\r\nIn terms of weaknesses, I think the only thing is that it would be great to have some more structured lessons regarding writing techniques. I think it was really cool to use class to discuss the readings we had for the different genres, but I think having some additional direction in terms of writing would be great. Also, as a side note, as a suggestion to Yale in general, I think creative writing courses should count as a WR credit because creative writing is indeed writing, and it is just as important to be able to write creatively as it is to write academically. ",
            "\u00a0The purpose of the course is a brief overview in all three sections. It felt like a time crunch, but that couldn't have been avoided due to the aims of the course. Perhaps a policy could have been put in place to allow a student to skip one of the exercises during the course to allow more attention to the final portfolio--a short break during one of the weeks of the student's choice. This would have eased stress levels for me. ",
            "\u00a0This was an extremely enjoyable course. The readings were interesting and the assignments were creatively challenging in the best way, helping me expand my creative toolbox and experiment in writing styles I had never before tried. The in-class exercises were fun and inspiring. I appreciated that it was a small seminar  it enabled me to share my writing in the compulsory workshop without feeling absolutely terrified. \r\n\r\nWhile I enjoyed the laid-back, comfortable atmosphere in the class, I think it contributed to a lack of participation. I appreciated the fact that students could contribute as much or as little as they wanted to the class discussions, but I often felt like I didn't know the other people in my class because they never spoke. We never introduced ourselves to each other after the first day, and I went through the majority of the semester without knowing everyone's name. I think a greater sense of camaraderie could be created between the students in the class. I think the class should be a vehicle for making new friends in the writing world, people to whom we can go when we want a thirtieth pair of editing eyes. I don't feel, after finishing the semester, that I have made many new creative writer friends. "

            "\u00a0Can't recommend more highly to anyone interested in creative writing. Know though that you will get the whole spectrum: fiction, poetry, and drama. Don't expect to only focus on one. ",
            "\u00a0This was my favorite course of the semester! Professor Skillings is really wonderful, so take the class with her if you can. I feel like Intro Creative Writing offers a lot of opportunity to explore and grow as a writer, and Professor Skillings gave invaluable feedback. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a joy! ",
            "\u00a0I think every Yale student should take this course. It makes you think, and it feels incredible to develop a portfolio of works youve made. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Great for literally anyone, from someone who has never taking a writing class to experienced creative writers looking to hone their craft in another workshop opportunity. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to EVERY single Yale student. The class is not difficult and the readings are very relevant and enjoyable. I am a STEM major and I loved this course! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone who wants a good taste of the possibilities in creative writing. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Creative writing is so incredibly important. For me, it helped me grow not only as a student but also as a person. ",
            "\u00a0I recommend to people seeking in introduction in the three areas of focus. Be willing to produce quickly and not be overly precious with your work. You won't be able to produce your best work ever--there simply isn't enough time. But you can get a good introduction to creative writing in general. ",
            "\u00a0I would! This class is a fantastic introduction to the creative writing world. It opened my eyes to the plethora of possible creative writing styles through engaging and diverse readings, and similarly diverse writing prompts. It also helped me learn to edit my creative writing, something I had never done prior to taking this class. "
