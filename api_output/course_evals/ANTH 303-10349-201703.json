            "\u00a0This class was brilliant -- it really helped my ethnographic research skills in a very practical, tangible way. It also pushed me to think more about the role of an anthropologist, and about my own positionality. ",
            "\u00a0This course was fantastic, and a great class to take if you are gearing up to do an ethnography based thesis. This course reaches you how to critically engage with the human subject, and provides you with texts that allow for you to critically think about your positionally and the impact you have on the research you are conducting. This class additionally allows for you to explore different types of ethnography, including visual, textual, participant, etc. ",
            "\u00a0How research is conducted and what role does ethnography play in field work. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a really great way to learn practical aspects of anthropological field methods. The readings gave good examples of what other anthropologists have done, which we could then apply ourselves in the weekly assignments. I learned a lot about observation, how to interview, and ways to look at objects, images, or aspects of culture analytically. ",
            "\u00a0I have a good hold on all of the anthropological methods covered in the course now. ",
            "\u00a0Abstract concepts in anthropology ",
            "\u00a0Understanding of fundamental ethnographic methods and the potential ethical issues and limitations surrounding them. An opening into what studying anthropology is like! ",
            "\u00a0I learned how malleable ethnography can be and was able to understand through the assignments how difficult and rewarding it is to delve deeper into cultural aspects that become taken for granted. Learning about anthropology and reading the analysis and connections real-world ethnographers make has changed the way I view things and allows me to draw connections between different aspects of society. "

            "\u00a0This class was excellent. The only possible improvement I can think of would be to use more modern ethnographies? But we read a lot of modern ones anyway and that's just a personal preference. ",
            "\u00a0I think a weakness of this class was that a lot of students in it just didn't seem that interested in the material, which made for really slow discussions. Maybe it's not fair to say people weren't interested, but class engagement was low which makes seminars really difficult to be excited about. I feel like I learned a lot during class, but perhaps the class should be structured in a way that encourages more engagement //collaboration. I really enjoyed class periods where we were split up into groups and asked to discuss the readings, perhaps more time dedicated to small groups could help facilitate larger group discussion. ",
            "\u00a0The class discussions were frustratingly disorganized. While the field method assignments seemed good in theory, in practice they were not very helpful for anthropology students who have done many of the same research exercises in more introductory classes. It would have been more interesting if we were all able to devise a research project and stick with that research project throughout the whole course, implementing different methods week-by-week to put them into practice. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strength comes from the combinations of readings and assignments. I found all the readings to be very interesting and very applicable, and were different from many of the other readings I had done for anthropology classes, and gave interesting perspectives on different anthropological research methods. The assignments worked well with the readings, allowing us to apply many of the things we read about, and were both enjoyable and very practical.\r\n\r\nI think one weakness was in the discussions during class. I feel that the professor often asked questions that were either too obvious or were looking for some specific answer that none of the students knew, and few were willing to guess so we often sat in silence. Part of the problem could have been the dynamic of the students in the class, or the way we were arranged around one very long thin table (I didn't find that to be very conducive to discussion), but I rarely felt that I learned something new from our discussions. It seemed to be better when we were divided up into smaller groups, or there was some sort of activity that divided the two hour block, so diversifying the ways we learned and discussed could help with that. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly I thought it was a really excellent course, I liked the distribution of work and got good feedback. ",
            "\u00a0Discussions often became too abstract and the professor did not correct the direction. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this was a great course. The readings for each week were well-organized and the discussions interesting. Professor Erami and Bhoomika, our TA, were both wonderful  I really enjoyed hearing their personal experiences with ethnographic research and seeing how the issues and considerations we discussed in class were reflected in those experiences. I thought there was a good balance between their contributions and student input to the discussions. The one thing I would've liked to see was more discussion of each of our assignments after we completed them. I think it would have helped to consolidate what we learned about the advantages and limitations of each method on its own and to hear some of the interesting projects our classmates were working on. ",
            "\u00a0The course had great readings and the workload was always manageable and engaging. I also like how the discussion and assignments were more concentrated on allowing us as students to form our own ideas of how ethnography should be practiced and made us realize how individualized it can truly be. I cannot think of any weaknesses because I really liked how Erami structured the class and assignments and I like how she let us make the discussion what we would get the most from. "

            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely, if you are in any major that requires you to think about ethnography and people's lived experiences. ",
            "\u00a0yes ",
            "\u00a0I was really disappointed by Field Methods. While Professor Erami is wonderful and accommodating with the assignments, the class discussions were frustratingly disorganized, unproductive, and meandering. Most of the class was often unengaged due to the lack of structure in both the conversations and the syllabus. If you've taken Introduction to Cultural Anthropology before, the field method assignments will feel very repetitive to you. I was hoping to leave with a more robust understanding of the anthropological methods, but left underwhelmed. Much of our class discussions tackled the theoretical and ethical components of field methods, but if you've taken other advanced anthropology seminars where you read ethnographies and talk about their methodologies, again a lot of the discussions in Field Methods will feel repetitive and boring. This is a decent class to take if you've had no prior exposure to field methods in anthropology, but if you're a junior or senior in anthro, keep your expectations low. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I think taking this course is necessary for anyone who is interested in Anthropology or plan to conduct fieldwork. Before students start their Anthropological research, this course helps them to think through different issues regarding Anthropological work and possible situations they are going to face once they start their work in the field. Very good organization and creative teaching. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this if you are planning to do any sort of ethnographic research (such as for a senior thesis) or if you just want to learn more about the practicalities of anthropology research. The readings are really interesting and provide good perspectives, and the weekly assignments are a great way to practice doing research and get feedback. Even though it's a writing credit, the workload isn't really that bad - the weekly assignments are very manageable, and often really enjoyable, and there is a short final presentation instead of a paper. The discussions weren't that great, but I think that what I learned from the readings and assignments was enough to make this class worth taking. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Absolutely. ",
            "\u00a0I'd definitely recommend this course! As a non-anthro major, I've always had an interest in reading ethnographic works but have never really known about the methods underlying ethnographic research, and this course was a good introduction to field methods and the issues and limitations surrounding them. It'd probably be helpful for anyone doing some kind of qualitative research on people and cultures. Professor Erami is great, and the readings and discussion are very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Would recommend if there is any interest in ethnography or if anthro major. Erami was a wonderful instructor, readings were relevant and insightful, and assignments were fun and challenging and encourage you to engage with your world in a new way. ",
            "\u00a0Would not recommend unless required or you have a particular research topic in mind. Doing the mini projects just for the sake of doing them was unfulfilling. "
