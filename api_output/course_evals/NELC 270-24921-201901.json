            "\u00a0I learned a myriad of skills from this course, among them how to think critically about art in a greater context. Every aspect of this course was amazing and  Sultan is an incredible teacher. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent class, learned how to think about art and the Middle East. Amazing instructor taught me so much about life in general as well, which you rarely get from Yale profs. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a good background of art from the Middle East (1920s to today). More importantly, this background was developed through the lens of a different topic every week such as gender, totalitarianism, architecture, film and so on. On top of that, Sultan's knowledge and connection to the real-life  art market made it possible to understand a little more how that market works and even interact with artists. ",
            "\u00a0This was a really good course that taught me how to better evaluate artwork in general. It was also interesting to see how a lot of the political affairs of the middle east at different points in the 20th century translated onto the canvas. ",
            "\u00a0Art analysis, politics, history, and a general understanding of how the world works. This course was deeply enlightening and taught me a lot about the Middle East, a region of the world my previous studies had only superficially covered. ",
            "\u00a0This course had two central strengths. The first was a thorough and meaningful presentation of an overview of middle eastern art, an area and region woefully overlooked in academic art history. The second was the presentation of the topic area as alive and evolving, as an ongoing and vibrant cultural conversation. ",
            "\u00a0The course covered an overview of modern art developments in the Middle East, starting from its origins and ending with the present. We learnt how to analyze a variety of art forms, how to place them in context, and the major trends underway in modern art in the region. ",
            "\u00a0Through this course, I gained an insight into a comprehensive history of Middle Eastern politics, and Modern Art. "

            "\u00a0The class is so well structured and Sultan engages with the material and the students in a way that makes me excited to learn. This class weakness is that it only meets once a week. It could easily meet twice a week so as to begin to do justice to all the material and all the knowledge Sultan has to share. ",
            "\u00a0Sultan went out of his way to ensure that we bonded both as a class and with the topics that we were discussing. His engagement with the material also made this class incredible. ",
            "\u00a0The course was well-planned and executed to facilitate student learning. Maybe there could be just 1 day of presentations at the end so we get to have another class, but otherwise excellent and wonderful. It is such a shame he won't be here next year. Yale should have done a better job keeping him here! ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of this course is definitely Sultan's passion for teaching the material. His level of engagement in the classed kept everyone's attention as we went through the course. The only weakness that I found is that one and a half hours is not enough to cover the material for the course. If the course was longer we could have had even richer class discussions and conversations. ",
            "\u00a0Sultan is one of the best lecturers Ive ever had and his background isnt even in academia. Sultan made this course engaging and interesting, and was very responsive to students. ",
            "\u00a0The course is incredibly well taughtSultan's passion and engagement are unparalleled. The course would benefit from increasing the number of artworks considered and reviewed; this is not to say that the political link does not serve an interesting and engaging purpose, but rather that this link should serve a background role while the work comes more to the forefront. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The syllabus was well designed, and Prof. Sultan was an energetic, approachable, inspiring and humorous professor. He made sure to have extensive office hours, organize field trips and dinners, and both make sure every student felt comfortable and could place their trust in him. He has extensive knowledge of the art scene in the Middle East, being a pioneering and well-connected collector himself, and leveraged this for us to connect us to artists and show us art that would otherwise be very accessible.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course often felt like it did not go too deep beyond the surface, and I felt the intellectual rigor of the course could be increased. Asking for reading responses, for example, would make sure students came prepared to class and were ready to discuss the readings to more depth. As lovely as Sultan was, his ever-present jovial nature meant that students might have taken the class easily. ",
            "\u00a0This course works well as a seminar, with a small and diverse class of students from the Political Science, Middle Eastern Studies, and Art History majors. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely! This could easily be the best class I have taken at Yale. I engaged with material and concepts that I otherwise would not have exposure to. I learned to see the Middle East through a lens that is often ignored: arts and culture. ",
            "\u00a0Without a doubt. This was one of my favorite classes of my entire Yale experience and I only wish other students could take it. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend it, but Sultan is not here next year so try to meet with him or talk to him, which I think he might be open to. Yale definitely should have given him anything he wanted to make him stay, it is such a shame that he is leaving. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, Sultan's expertise on the topic of Middle Eastern Art is unique given his passion for it through his art foundation. As such, I doubt that this course could have been delivered at the same level by someone else. On top of that, Sultan is a very kind lecturer who is invested in the learning and improvement of each student in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. The course was very interesting, though most of that was because of the energy that Sultan brought to things. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course without reservation. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If the topic interests you, go ahead! As usual, though, you will make out of the course what you wish, and will have to put in conscious extra effort to go beyond what is expected. Otherwise, you might end the semester feeling you have only gained a surface knowledge of the topic (which, given its breadth, is not really such a bad thing!) ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would. ",
            "\u00a0This was one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. "
