            "\u00a0From the readings I gained a sense of the critical reception of nineteenth-century American poetrywho has been read, who has been forgotten, whose reception has been dynamic, etc.and also how scholars and critics have variously defined poetry since the nineteenth century. I gained a sense of who is doing good work in the field and thus who to look for if/when I do further work in the area, and also a feel for what sort of questions are being asked. I gained more experience using internet archives and how I could use them in doing my own research. ",
            "\u00a0When I considered enrolling in this course, I was hoping to improve my ability to engage critically with poetry and increase my exposure to Emily Dickinson's and Walt Whitman's work. Although the course did not focus primarily on Whitman and Dickinson after all but instead endeavored to put them in context with several other less canonical nineteenth-century poets, I acquired a greater appreciation for the way that poetry was valued during the period as well as the complex sociopolitical world that these poems tried to clarify. In addition, I used the assignments to find my own interests within the material, practice different writing styles, and build an argument over the course of an entire semester that resulted in my final essay. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to better work through histories of print technologies and printed editions of the same text. "

            "\u00a0I had been looking forward to a little more Whitman and Dickinson, but the other readings did help situate them in their contexts, so I'm not mad about that.\r\n\r\nA thing that I found to be phenomenal was the means of assessment. The first assigned essay was especially greatcreative and also extremely practical, helping us think of how we would actually be asked to approach the texts as professors and critics and challenge us to write in a different register than that which grad school otherwise requires.\r\n\r\nAnother strength was that, generally, the assigned reading on the average weak was manageable. Seminars can be less effective when the volume of reading is too high, so I was grateful for Prof. Warner's planning. A couple of times I felt like we were expected to have read things that hadn't been on the syllabus or available online, but that could've just been me overlooking something. ",
            "\u00a0The best aspects of this course turned out to be its breadth of information, contexts, and poets. The first writing assignment was especially useful because it forced me to write intelligently without making an explicit argument. This assignment pushed me to reconsider the way I structure my language around argumentation. The course's weaknesses mostly appeared in its syllabus which, even after the class was informed that the course would not be solely about Whitman and Dickinson, seemed unbalanced because there was a single class given to Dickinson's poetry as well as another class that pushed together most of the other women poets worthy of attention. In addition, aside from Frances Ellen Watkins Harper and Paul Laurence Dunbar, the course did not feature works by any people of color which was most apparent during the class that focused on American Indian poetry. These issues could be improved by reconsidering the categories of poetry for each class to incorporate more women and people of color throughout the syllabus and explicitly discussing those identities in the class discussion. ",
            "\u00a0The course could be made more relevant to the broader 19th-century American context and more inclusive for all students. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this was a great introduction to nineteenth century poetry, most of which I was unfamiliar with--I wish we had spent more than one week on Dickinson, however! "

        [
            "\u00a0Yes, for all of the reasons above and below. ",
            "\u00a0If a student is interested in nineteenth-century literature or American poetry generally, I would highly recommend this class for its breadth and Professor Warner's depth of knowledge. If a student does not have specific interest in either of those areas, I would not recommend this class. I would also warn against this class, or at least this iteration, if a student is interested in women poets during the nineteenth-century or if one wishes to study Walt Whitman or Emily Dickinson closely. ",
            "\u00a0No. The course is good if you have a standing interest in the topics that the professor has, but quickly tires otherwise. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class. It was a helpful introduction to a field that is understudied and that can be difficult to learn on one's own. The course also serves as a useful introduction to recent debates around historical poetics. "
