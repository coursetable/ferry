            "\u00a0A lot of close reading analysis skills. ",
            "\u00a0I developed my critical analysis skills in regards to both television and literature. I also learned more about race, black culture, and media in general. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the history of black expression and culture, how to think critically about contemporary black art, and fundamental discrepancies between the projection of American society and its ideals and the starkly different reality that actually exists. ",
            "\u00a0Blackness and how it is portrayed in the media. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest analytic tool developed in this course was the identification and analysis of forms of dramatization particularly apparent in Black literary and filmic cannons. It is incredibly important to understand the ontological differences in the way in which art produced by Black peoples is crafted and operates, and this was a key feature of the analyses and discussions in the course. "

            "\u00a0It was just very long, but I also have a short attention span. Interesting material though. ",
            "\u00a0In this seminar I was able to improve on articulating my ideas to an intimate group of people. I also was able to work on my writing and close reading abilities. ",
            "\u00a0This is an incredible course - it teaches critical analysis and delves deep into the mechanics of Atlanta in order to find deeper truths about American society and see reflections in previous forms of black art/ other facets of black culture. My only problem with the course was the lack of feedback I received on my essays, ",
            "\u00a0Weakness: there was an unclear plan of what we would do. \r\nStrength: It was a great class ",
            "\u00a0The major strength of the course was the way in which the reading materials were organized to guide the course and discussions through the key ideas with which Professor Bradley wanted to engage. Much of the course's insights came, not from merely analyzing the titular series Atlanta with critical film tools but from analyzing the series with critical race theory and in relation to a comparable literature. In this regard the curation of the course was particularly precise and thorough. \r\n\r\nThe main weakness was the dis-organization of the Beineke which led to technical issues that cut into class time. The course itself, had no weaknesses in my opinion. "

            "\u00a0Yes it was really interesting material and Rizvana Bradley is great, she really grows on you. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class especially if you are a fan of the show and Donald Glover. The class historicizes a lot of the issue shown on the show such as black precarity, black vernacular tradition, racial performativity etc. Taking this class has expanded my knowledge on many black authors such as WEB Du Bois and Amiri Baraka and the class has heightened my appreciation for the show. ",
            "\u00a0This course made me think in ways I hadn't before, so I really appreciated that. Would recommend. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend this course. It was very interesting and engaging; I thoroughly enjoyed it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, overwhelmingly so. I almost think that taking this class should be a requirement - Professor Bradley is teaching the stuff that really matters, what makes students into not only good critical thinkers, but also good citizens. I cannot recommend this class highly enough. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course in particular for its implementation of seminal critical race theory texts in relation to contemporary art. The course at once critically engaged with these works which are oft overlooked in the broader context of academia, and placed them in conversation with popular art of today and the past, giving students what effectively amounted to case studies in critical analyses of Black art.
