            "\u00a0Through this course, I learned a lot about how materials such as statistics, which was sometimes viewed as boring, can be conveyed and taught in an extremely interesting and engaging way. Prof. Gee did a very good job in preparing detailed section plans and constantly communicating with all the TFs about how to best deliver the course materials to the students. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the organization of course materials, Prof. Gee also provided very valuable feedback on how to better engage the students and create a positive classroom environment. I felt much more confident about leading sections as the semester progressed and even started looking forward to teaching sections! ",
            "\u00a0I developed skills in teaching and explaining statistical concepts, following a lesson plan, lecturing, and engaging students in course material. I also learned how to reflect and incorporate feedback into my lessons to help my students better learn the material. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me to become a better teacher. In addition to gaining classroom experience by teaching sections, the feedback and mentorship I received from Professor Gee was very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I certainly gained improved teaching skills through this course, both within the context of the weekly meetings and discussions as well as through the feedback provided to me on my teaching by Professor Gee. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a much more in-depth understanding of the organization and administration required to teach (or support) a large undergraduate survey course like PSYC 200. Dr. Gee was very available and helpful in thinking through teaching issues that came up throughout the semester and provided general feedback and guidelines around grading, teaching section, and holding office hours. ",
            "\u00a0This was my first substantive teaching experience so I gained a lot of useful, hands-on experience in teaching. Overall, I developed a much better sense of how to conduct a lecture and all of the planning and organizing that entails. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: the course is organized in a very clear and informative way. Prof. Gee and other TFs (especially Emily Cohodes) were extremely helpful and very responsive to the problems/questions I encountered during teaching. It was such a great experience to work with them! \r\n\r\nWeakness: N/A ",
            "\u00a0This course was very instrumental in helping me grow as an instructor and statistician. It was particularly helpful to be observed by the instructor of the course and get feedback for how to improve. Additionally, the midterm feedback helped me to improve my teaching to make the lab section a better experience for my students. I was able to use the feedback both from Professor Gee and from the students to adapt my lesson plans and make the experience better for my students. This was also a great way for me to learn through the process of reflecting on my teaching style and seeing where there were gaps in my instruction and the students learning. Two little ways the course could be improved is by providing TFs with the rubrics for HW sooner and by having clear expectations for the students in regards to APA format from the beginning of the course so that TFs know what issues to look for and/or deduct points for. It was difficult at times to answer students questions on the HW when I had not seen the rubric yet. I also think it would be beneficial to make it clear to students that just because they have seen a certain style in a journal does not mean it is APA format. Journals take APA formatted manuscripts and re-format them to their standards. When I was an undergrad this confused me because I would try to copy what journals did and get confused when it was incorrect. I think the same was true for many students in this course. Although the purpose of this class is stats and not APA, I think explaining this clearly to students would be beneficial because I saw a lot of variety in student's submissions. That said, I did not attend lecture (because we were not required to) and this could have been covered and some students didn't go to lecture and thus missed out and made errors on their submissions. ",
            "\u00a0Some teaching tools presented at the beginning of the course could be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strength of this course is that it provides a tangible output for a very challenging, engaging, and time-consuming TF assignment.  I think this is a fantastic model to develop because it allows us as TFs to get credit on our transcripts for the time and energy we put into this course (which is substantial).  It also allows for a more structured environment to get feedback on our teaching skills and to discuss pedagogical issues within a weekly meeting.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I think could be improved in this course might be to make the workload a bit more consistent from week to week.  This is a challenge for a course where the workload of the teaching fellows is dependent on what the students are learning each week, but it would be helpful for time management and coordination to have a better sense of what the workload would be each week. ",
            "\u00a0It was very helpful to have a structured, weekly time to meet and discuss grading and teaching plans for the upcoming week and Dr. Gee allowed us some unstructured time to ask general questions, etc. It would be nice to include even more unstructured time for general questions or if Dr. Gee could work in a mini teaching plan to some of the meetings (e.g., on how to present difficult concepts, take questions, or teach to multiple skill levels in the course). It was also great to have Dr. Gee attend one of my sections to get feedback this way. ",
            "\u00a0In terms of strengths, the course we were TFing (stats) was very well organized, so there were few (if any) times where it wasn't clear what was expected of students in regard to what content needed to be covered in lecture. Also, the meeting to go over our supervised lecture was also very helpful.\r\n\r\nFor weaknesses, there weren't really any major ones in my opinion. I think it may have been helpful to find some time to practice teaching skills (or get more concrete advice about strategies for conducting our lab sections) before we actually got started with teaching, so we didn't go into our first sections completely \"cold.\" \r\n\r\nMy main issue isn't actually a problem with the course, itself, but with the structuring of the TF assignments. I think, given the workload, this course should be worth more than one TF credit. I suppose that the fact that we get this course credit is valuable, but I would have preferred that we have the option for this being a two credit TF assignment, since the increased workload really interfered with my other obligations (e.g., research, departmental requirements, etc). "

            "\u00a0Yes. I think any grad student interested in learning how to teach a stats course or just teaching in general should TF for this class. It is unique in that it's the only class where the TFs really get to interact with the students face-to-face regularly and the way Prof. Gee prepared the course materials is very helpful. It was a great experience! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend TFing stats to other students. It was a great opportunity for me to learn and grow. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course is helpful for gaining hands on teaching experience and feedback. ",
            "\u00a0For other graduate students also interested in teaching, I would absolutely recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend taking this course/signing up to be a teaching fellow for PSYC 200 as it is a great experience to be able to teach sections independently and to have supervised instruction from Dr. Gee. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. In fact, I think a course like this would be good for all students, since we don't really get much teaching experience. "
