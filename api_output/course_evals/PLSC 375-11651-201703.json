            "\u00a0The course provides a thorough history of populism well (both conceptually and in terms of events), so Im definitely walking away from this course feeling like I have a strong overall grasp of the topic. ",
            "\u00a0In-depth knowledge of populism in its various forms around the world ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of practical analytical skills regarding analyzing speeches and texts and drawing conclusions from the results. My skills interpreting the meaning and purpose behind language use were improved. I also gained a lot of knowledge about the populism definitional debate, and particularly enjoyed learning about latin american populism. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the different conceptions and understandings of populisms from scholars around the world. I also learned how to identify populism when I see it. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a really valuable opportunity to apply a very commonly used but seldom understood term (populism) to countless  situations, regions, and periods. I learned so much about constructing a strict definition and applying it to case studies to determine applicability. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think critically about the arguments presented in the readings, and to challenge my preexisting assumptions about many political science concepts. "

        [
            "\u00a0The professor put an excessive amount of in-class focus on summarizing the readings (sometimes, more than 3/4 of the class would be summary). While this was nice on days I hadnt gotten around to the readings, it made it difficult to feel like any contribution you made to discussion was meaningful, and I dont feel like Im walking away with much insight beyond what the authors wrote or what the professor thinks.\r\nProfessor also had a habit of directly responding to opinion-based points that students said rather than opening up their points to broader discussion. While it was awesome having my thoughts challenged by an expert, it contributed to that feeling of a lack of conversation in class. I feel it wouldve been better if he only engaged us this way in his office hours. ",
            "\u00a0All-around fantastic course ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the way the course explores populism across temporal and geographic boundaries. I would prefer an another week on Latin American populism (replacing one of the weeks on U.S. populism), but that's a personal preference and not a course weakness. ",
            "\u00a0The course has great reading material, and a good progression through a definitional discussion, american populism, latin american, european, and greek populism, and then a methodological workshop. I think possibly one week fewer on american historical populism and instead one more week on contemporary populism could make it better. Also, the conversation in the seminars could sometimes die, however that isn't a fault of the course or the professor. The final weeks and their discussion of populism and how it interacts with democracy could definitely be explained better and made more digestible. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very good because the idea of populism had real world applications, especially with Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders. There were also opportunities to look at speeches and identify populism within them, which I appreciated it. This course could have been drastically improved, however, by having readings that were not as dense or complicated. I felt like I could not understand many of the readings and that, at a certain point, the readings were all the same because little differed between the understandings of populism. ",
            "\u00a0I would like to have some more background on the regions we study. It would be helpful to have that context when trying to understand the nature of the place's populism. The course provided some of it, but more would be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the course, however, would enjoy having more interacting political simulations such as the one conducted after the middle of the semester in class. It made the material more tangible and understandable. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely -- any student interested in politics, history, social trends. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend taking this course! It's one of the few courses at Yale that links theory with practical examples. The fact that the entire course is centered around a topic that is relevant and to which most students are exposed almost daily through the news/media makes it super interesting and Prof. Aslanidis' knowledge and teaching style make the course super worth taking. I loved it! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. I think I gained really important information, mostly from the readings. I now understand populism much better and can better analyze the term's increasing use in today's world. However, I think it could benefit from some more confident and interesting seminar discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Take the class to understand the strong influence of populism in the political world around you. ",
            "\u00a0I would! Populism is in vogue right now, thanks to Brexit, Trump 2016, and what's happening throughout Europe. This class goes deeper than a survey course, however, really making you engage with the various facets of populism. You also learn a lot more about liberal democracy. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, despite it being more challenging than the other classes I am currently taking, it pushed me to really deconstruct the way I look at social science concepts and be more open to unconventional opinions. ",
            "\u00a0Yes in that the content was interesting and the readings were challenging. However, the class is graded quite difficultly, and there is not much feedback outside of the midterm paper comments. "
