            "\u00a0A basic understanding of the principles of life history, which is a nice organizing framework for explaining many topics in ecology and evolutionary biology. The class covers how organisms maximize inclusive fitness in response to environmental conditions and physiological or genetic constraints. More generally, it also helps develop a knowledge of how to work with scientific literature and how to make and convey sensible scientific arguments. ",
            "\u00a0I learned all about life history evolution- a fascinating field that I was not previously acquainted with- and also learned a lot about how to approach scientific papers and theoretical debates in evolutionary biology. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to read and engage deeply with complicated scientific papers, even those that I had initially despaired of understanding. I learned to think graphically, numerically, and in words about scientific topics. I gained insight into the relationship between life history and the other topics in evolution and ecology that I have studied until now. "

            "\u00a0The format of the course is very good -- I appreciated having discussion questions before each class to help set the direction of the class for that day. I also appreciated the focus on the primary literature so that we got to see examples of the concepts we were learning about, and I liked that the class emphasizes engaging with the material rather than memorizing it. (Additionally, it was very nice to be able to take a biology seminar. Even though there are pretty few seminar classes in sciences, it was a very good way to convey the material.) The one change I would consider proposing is a slower pace -- it was sometimes disappointing to leave a topic before we had fully discussed it -- but I understand that the class was taught this way so that we could cover all of the material. ",
            "\u00a0I have no complaints about how this course was taught. Its strengths lay in its very small class size, the dedication of all the students to the work, and Professor Stearns's wonderful teaching philosophy. The written question responses, while time-consuming, forced us to engage with the material before class, which led to incredibly productive discussions during class time. The many steps in the paper-writing process and the several revisions left me with an end product I am proud of, and I feel like I learned a huge amount. I never felt like any of the work I did for this class was busy work: it all felt worthwhile. "

            "\u00a0Yes, definitely. It's hard and time-consuming, so it's probably a good choice if possible to take it when you have a semester where your other classes are not as difficult. But if you are interested in ecology and evolution, have taken the prerequisites, and have a good math background going into the class, it's worth the investment. It provides a firm grasp of several important principles in evolution and ecology; and it also improves your ability to read scientific literature, evaluate the evidence presented, make reasonable biology arguments, and convey them effectively in writing, all of which are most likely helpful skills both in the academic world and outside it. ",
            "\u00a0This is easily the best course I have taken at Yale, and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone interested in ecology, evolution, etc. Some people have said \"don't take this course unless you are passionate about life history.\" I disagree. I knew hardly anything about life history before I took this course, and I certainly didn't think I was passionate about it, so had I heeded that advice, I would have missed out on an incredible course. This course is very time consuming, and you will get the most out of it if you prioritize it. Take the time to write thoughtful responses to the papers. When you've thought and thought and thought about a question so much that your mind hurts, and you still can't crack it, don't give upthink some more, and write down what you figure out. Constantly pushing through the difficulty and believing in my own critical abilities is how I got through this course, and it was worth every minute. Ask questions in classProfessor Stearns is deeply invested in students' learning, and will take time to answer the questions, over and over if necessary, until you understand. Pick a paper topic you are passionate about, and if you find yourself with one you aren't passionate about, become passionate about it. Dive into it, read all there is to read, and devote yourself to the paper. It's worth ityou'll enjoy the process of writing the paper, instead of dreading it, and you'll come away with a piece of work you can really be proud of.\r\n\r\nI'm an EEB major, but I don't think you have to be to take this class, as long as you understand that it's an upper-level EEB seminar and you have the enthusiasm to engage with the material. This course exposed me to foundational papers in many sub-fields of life history evolution, and there's no better professor to take it with than the founder of the field. Of course, some topics were more interesting than others, but I increased my understanding across the board. What I read in this class has helped me to pinpoint which particular topics I find most interesting. I will carry this knowledge, of the material and of myself, forward into graduate school and beyond.\r\n\r\nOne more thing: if you take this class, absolutely take Professor Stearns up on his invitation to have lunch after class! We had some great discussions, and he is very friendly, supportive, and helpful. Professor Stearns is one of the few professors I've had who acknowledges the psychological concerns of his students. He reassured us of our intelligence and aptitude and let us know that he held all of us to a high standard: he believed in us even on days when we didn't believe in ourselves. I was never made to feel that I had asked a stupid question. Coming from someone so highly placed in the field, that level of support and respect was extremely valuable to building my confidence. "
