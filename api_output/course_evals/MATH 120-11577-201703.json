            "\u00a0While I enjoyed learning techniques for solving problems requiring multivariate calculus, the greatest appreciation I developed through this course was for elegance and rigor in explanations.  Writing out my solutions has improved my ability to write clear/unambiguous explanations conciselya skill that has proven useful in other courses and academic endeavors as well. ",

            "\u00a0Multivariable calculus and the various theorems needed for physics ",
            "\u00a0I learned about applying calculus to functions of multiple variables. These concepts will likely be helpful in future physics and engineering courses. Additionally, it was interesting to learn about the various path and surface integrals and what they mean. ",
            "\u00a0I certainly learned the necessary skills for how to properly study for a college level math exam. I also honed my time management skills in completing the psets. Furthermore, I really felt like I came away, having a deep understanding of the concepts taught. ",
            "\u00a0This course significantly broadened my understanding of multivariable and vector calculus.  This course was especially helpful because it focused on the subtleties of the material.  I also learned how to study well from taking this course. ",
            "\u00a0Other than the courses content, I developed critical thinking by learning how to apply functions in context. Through conceptual multiple choice questions, I lerarned not only to plug and chug but also to thoroughly understand what each functions importance was. ",
            "\u00a0Seems to mostly have applications in physics. Would definitely look elsewhere for a math class if physics doesn't appeal to you. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the fundamentals of multi-variable calculus, which should serve me well in a number of possible different majors and fields in the future. ",

            "\u00a0I had to learn how to distribute the work throughout the week, because it was a lot to learn all at once. I also had to learn how important it was to stay on top of the work, especially conceptually, because it was far too much to try to catch up on before a midterm or final. ",
            "\u00a0You will definitely learn a LOT about calculus in this course! ",
            "\u00a0I gained study skills in terms of learning how to structure my problem-solving practice to  more deeply learn the material after sitting through lectures. I also gained an understanding of multi variable calculus, but I felt like my conceptual understanding suffered when we focused on more formulaic problems and didn't deeply explore proofs for our theorems. ",
            "\u00a0There need to be two levels of this class. 70% of the kids have taken multi before. As somebody who did not have access to this course in high school, it was an uneven playing field. As good as a teacher as Miki was, it does not make up for being curved against kids who have taken this class before. ",
            "\u00a0I honed my quantitative and analytical skills while learning how to evaluate line integrals and surface integrals with multiple techniques. I gained problem solving skills and insight to new mathematical properties and ideas and conceptualizations in the practical world. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: good teachers, good tutors ",
            "\u00a0There are many resources to help students prepare for exams and keep up with the course. However, different professors have drastically different ways of explaining key concepts, so attending reviews for exams can actually cause unnecessary confusion. ",
            "\u00a0The content of the course is strong and well developed; I very much appreciated the detailed derivations we walked through for each concept we discussed (much more gratifying than simply accepting formulae on faith).  Having more class time to cover the content may be beneficial. ",
            "\u00a0The class moves very quickly, and there are clearly a lot of students who have taken multivariable calculus before, so it's easy to fall behind. I think this course would benefit from a discussion section. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: weekly psets reinforce learning, high availability of peer tutor office hours, a lot of review sessions before the final exam\r\n\r\nWeakness: Lecture was not engaging because professor goes over material too quickly and does not give students time to think about/ try solving problems before she gives you the solution. Most of the peer tutors, except Calvin Schwartzberg, don't know the material well enough. Exams are graded very harshly and there is hardly any curve. ",
            "\u00a0The course is well-taught and the problem sets are a great opportunity to solidify skills. One suggestion I would have would be to increase the weight of problem sets from 10% to something like 20%. The sheer volume of problem sets that had to be completed feels like more than 10%. ",
            "\u00a0I think the curriculum of the course is very good. One critique I have is the amount of computation. For example, setting up a triple integral, was very challenging and fun to figure out. However, we were then left to solve it, which could leave us with a page of seemingly mindless computations. One thing that perhaps could be cool, would be integrating this class with a computer science class, where the students could be challenged to write computer programs to solve the long computations after setting up the integrals. ",
            "\u00a0It is excellent how much material this course covers, but I wish there was a way to do more problems in small groups in class.  This was very helpful towards the end of the semester, but it would have helped at the beginning as well.  Perhaps there were several not quite essential examples that could have been skipped in class or given to the students to attempt on their own. ",
            "\u00a0Some strengths are that the review sessions really helped to tie every concept together, especially with the flowcharts that Sudesh and Miki made. I also really loved Mikis teaching style, because even though it went by pretty quickly, she gave a lot of examples and explained concepts in multiple ways that made it easier to understand. One weakness would probably be that there was not enough time for students to work out problems on their own during class. However, this was only so probably because there was so much material to cover in such a short amount of time. To improve this, perhaps give students practice problems before every class and have a perhaps 5-10 period at the beginning of class going over these problems. That way, students can know if they are on track before doing the problem sets. ",
            "\u00a0The course does a good job of offering comprehensive review sessions and study materials for tests. However, I think the tests are focused on not messing up on difficult integration rather than focusing on understanding the material itself. The majority of the points awarded are for correctly doing integrals, not necessarily setting them up. ",
            "\u00a0This course could be improved by reevaluating the course syllabus so that less information is taught. It could also be improved by requiring sections to meet three times a week instead of twice. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course should be taught with more of a mission to really try to connect the dots. The concepts were taught well, but the relationship between them and the big picture view of the information was not made very clear, at least to me. I think that would enormously improve the course. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course could be improved if the problem sets were structured differently.  If they work more focused on the exam content, or the questions the teacher want us to know how to solve, it would be much more useful.  That way maybe they could count for more and take a bit of weight away from the final. ",
            "\u00a0The class moves very quickly, and it is easy to become confused early on and have a hard time catching up. I think the course could benefit from meeting three times a week rather than just two, and from working through problems in small groups in class sometimes rather than just lecturing. There were lots of opportunities to ask questions every day in lecture though which was very helpful in a class with such a quick pace. ",
            "\u00a0Miki is great-- really supportive, clear, and accessible to her students-- and in general the structures for getting help (office hours and the peer tutor office hours) are very well organized and helpful. I just didn't find this class as exciting and creative or engaging as math can be. ",
            "\u00a0Make two levels of this course ",
            "\u00a0I think that grading is a little confusing but I think Miki is an amazing teacher. ",
            "\u00a0The information is presented in bulk and without much check-in of the students' understanding. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course was the teacher, Miki Havlickova. She explained everything so beautifully and made very complex, difficult topics so easy to understand. She is an amazing instructor and an inspiring woman in math. \r\n\r\nThere was no weakness in this course in my opinion. ",
            "\u00a0I would prefer if the final exam counted for less than 40% of the final grade, and more importance were shifted to the midterms. It would help with stress levels to be working at a more or less constant level throughout the semester, rather than freaking out at the end about a single test. "

            "\u00a0Yes; this course is very interesting and well planned-out ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in learning multivariate calculus, this course is challenging and rewarding.  If you invest in learning the material, this course is very worthwhile. ",
            "\u00a0If it is a prereq to your classes, then yes take it, but do not have high expectations of getting a good grade. if you don't have to, don't take it because you will be competing with people who have already taken multivariable calculus before in high school ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student for sure (especially if he or she can get Miki). The course was a great way to start my freshman year and was very manageable and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think I learned a tremendous amount. Again, my only complaint was the amount of computation during some of the homeworks. Other than that, I think the class prepared me very well for the next level courses. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to another student because it is a great way to thoroughly learn multivariable and vector calculus.  Even if you think you already know this material, this course is an excellent way to deepen your understanding and tie up any loose ends. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The problem sets are a little challenging at times, but if you have a good group of people to work on them with, they are not that bad. Miki made the course worthwhile, so definitely try to take it with her if you can! ",
            "\u00a0PLEASE do not take this class unless it is a requirement for your major! Tests are stressful (and worth 90% of your grade) and grading is very stiff. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it only insofar as they need to take multi-variable calculus at some point. The course is not the most interesting or fun, so I think other math classes or classes in other subjects are better if a student is looking for a more stimulating and engaging class. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course is definitely geared toward students who enjoy math and are driven enough to handle the rigor. It's not for the faint of heart. I took this class during my first semester of my first year, and I realize that it was a bit too much for me to handle. I did, however, come to the realization that I do not in fact want to major in math, and I do not regret taking the course. Just be aware when entering that the course is fast-paced. If you can, take it with Miki! She's an excellent instructor. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if they really enjoy math, and are ready to devote time to it. It is not a course you can coast through, and it is very necessary to stay on top of all of the work. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it only if it is a requirement or you really really love math.  It is not easy! ",
            "\u00a0This class is very hard, so I wouldn't take it unless you need to. However, you will learn a lot throughout the semester, and it is a prerequisite for many majors. ",
            "\u00a0If you need it for your major, yes, and take advantages of all the resources that the course offers. If not, no-- it might unfairly disillusion you with math as being something creative and awesome. ",
            "\u00a0Take it if there two levels. Otherwise take ENAS 151 ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course because it provides the student with a set of theorems and techniques that are very useful in terms of multivariable calculus. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I definitely would! If you are lucky enough to receive to Miki as your instructor, cherish the time you have with her because she makes you love math, even when it gets difficult. I learned so much in this class, and it was an exciting journey. I definitely feel that I have grown tremendously as a math student and as a student in general through this class. "
