As far as midterms, I thought the first one was incredibly unfair because it required knowledge of law regarding book-sellers, which was not covered in the course. Even if they did not grade on what we talked about with the book-sellers, it was hard to write comparisons to doctors when I knew nothing to compare to. I studied a lot but could not show what I learned due to the nature of the question. ",

Sections also complimented lecture, and we learned about the core concepts, and then had the space to ask questions, discuss and share our thoughts. Overall the class was well constructed, and there was always a place to ask questions. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly, everything about this class was good except for the EXAMS. If you're not good at regurgitating massive amounts of information in the form of two essays in 50 minutes, I'm sorry but you WILL struggle in this class, because I was in that exact place this semester. The TAs grade on an unforgiving curve (20% As, 20% A-s, etc.) in a class where the majority of the students have a good grasp on the content (since it's not conceptually difficult to understand). In practice, what that ends up meaning is that there are students who have a fairly good grasp on the content who consistently get B+s on the exams because they forgot to mention a couple things here and there in their exam, whereas other students do well by filling up entire bluebooks with every word that came out of Professor Latham's mouth over the course of the semester. I am of the opinion that the type of \"learning\" this testing style encourages is neither valuable nor fair. Hopefully, something will be done to at least balance out the heavy emphasis on fact regurgitation in this class (e.g. by having one midterm and one paper for the class rather than 2 midterms). All that aside, though, Professor Latham was a great lecturer and the TAs were super nice and fun to be around. I would just personally recommend you take this class Credit/D/Fail if you can, as the grading could be quite frustrating at times. ",

I don't know how the many TFs didn't notice anything :/ But anyways, great course where I learned a lot and loved Prof. Latham's engaging teaching style. I also think I lucked out with my section, though I do wish there was some standardization across them.

The exams were very fair and reasonable, and the weekly reading response was also quite simple.  The weakest part of my experience was the weekly section.  I often felt like my section was overwhelmed by what one or two students had to say, and my TA did not know how to guide the discussion to prevent that from happening. ",

I would often not realize that 50 minutes had gone by and suddenly class was over. Professor Latham does a great job, and I looked forward to going to the lectures each week. I'd say something that could be improved slightly is just the fact that the readings really aren't necessary to do well in sections or the midterms/final.

I felt like we learned enough to learn that we didn't know enough.  There were times when I felt that I wanted to make a particular argument, only to find that I didn't have the knowledge to do so.  I felt like my TF wanted us to challenge some of the claims Professor Latham presented, particularly historical interpretations of the Constitution (such as the privacy/due process argument concerning the Fourteenth Amendment), but we just didn't have the capacity to do so in an actually original and interesting way.  I think that if the course covered topics in some more depth, particularly providing some information (either though readings or in the lecture) about how to make ethical and legal arguments, these discussions could have been more interesting.  I also wish that exams were more straightforward.  The first midterm, in particular, I felt asked certain questions implicitly that could have just been asked explicitly.  It was often hard to know what answer was being sought, and it wasn't really the point of the exam to have us guess -- it was more to have us just to explain what we knew. ",

However, I felt as though I didn't really need to show up to class in order to do well on the exams and understand the material. From speaking to other students, it seems as though a lot of the richness of the class came from the course readings. However, considering that exams only covered materials from lecture and my section leader never had us discuss the reading materials, I never felt incentivized to do any of the readings. I think this course could be improved by incentivizing the reading materials. Also, Latham could easily move at a faster pace within lectures and dive into more material without the class becoming in any way burdensome. A lot of lecture was spent rehashing and reviewing. Sometimes Latham would talk about current events  that didn't feel particularly relevant to the course material. By streamlining lectures and going more in depth, the class could be really compelling and intellectually challenging. ",

Further, it was not difficult to learn a lot, understand the material well, and succeed in the class if you put an effort into each of those areas. ",

The only weakness would be that the grading system is very odd because there are only three grades and only letter grades are given, so there is no way to really understand where you stand in the class or numerically evaluate your performance on the tests. It can also be hard to identify why you got a certain grade for that reason. I would also maybe recommend providing slides of some kind (not because Professor Latham needs them--just for the benefit of the students). ",

",
            "\u00a0Professor Latham is a superb lecturer: captivating, reflective, and intellectually curious. Absolutely no qualms with the lectures. On the other hand, sections were somewhat painful, with many not contributing and TAs not necessarily knowing how to facilitate class discussion. Grading seemed opaque and subjective. There definitely needs to be more standardization and care when training TAs. Below, I noted that I am neutral on whether the course facilitated student learning. I selected this option as I think the lectures absolutely did, but sections really fell short. ",

            "\u00a0This is a very typical lecture course in that you are completely responsible for how you perform in the course and for how much you get out of it -- there is absolutely nothing and no one holding you accountable.   I never did the readings (I dont think many people did) and honestly, it would have been a waste of time.  While the casebook is great and very interesting, there are quite a few readings assigned and it is not necessary to do them since the lecture covers everything that you need to know. Additionally, Professor Latham only wants you to know the really important Supreme Court cases which he will name in class (if he does not name them, you can always google them later).  Section is also very laidback and the background knowledge you need for it will be covered in lecture.  Another thing is that there is no way to know how you are doing in the course until you get back your midterm scores.  Perhaps having the weekly reading responses graded or getting some feedback on them would be helpful (and would cut away at the huge 50% that the final counts for).  And finally, having more practice questions distributed before tests would be extremely helpful as we walked into midterms barely knowing what the questions would be like. ",

My only real complaint about the course, is that the format does not induce investment and engagement with the material. I wish that there had been a project or a paper that would have required some amount of engagement with the readings, or at least encouraged critical thinking and discussions. Other than that, I thought it was quite thought-provoking. ",

The main weakness of the course is that I found the midterms to be rather harshly graded. It seems that what was asked of the students was a brain dump on the page rather than a thoughtful analysis. I would prefer for future midterms to focus more on legal analysis rather than regurgitation of facts. ",

The class itself was also fairly easy -- I never read the textbook besides the few cases I had to read for section (which on average required like 5 pages of reading and a short response). I did take really detailed notes in lecture though which helped a lot, def think this is more of a lecture > textbook class if you had to choose one.

Besides that, much of the reading is unnecessary because Latham covers it all in lecture. If you go to lecture, it is interesting and easy to pay attention and take notes.

            "\u00a0You MUST take this class. You are missing out if you do not take it. You should have serious fomo if you don't take this class. It is worth it. The lectures are incredible and fascinating. So engaging. Never a dull moment. The topics are so relevant to the world. Every major will benefit from this class. ",

            "\u00a0Yes!! This course was amazing. I learned so much about the US healthcare system (as well as foreign countries) and general medical/business knowledge. The best part of the class was section - the discussions were really interesting, especially because we had so many different points of view at the table. ",
            "\u00a0yes ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend the course to another student, if only for the lectures, which were spectacular.  Professor Latham is an amazing speaker, and his lectures were always so well-put-together (all the more impressive because he didn't seem to refer to any notes).  My discussion section was a little disappointing -- I wanted to be challenged more in our discussions, but they were rather lukewarm.  Still, simply because of the lectures, I learned a lot on a subject that is increasingly important as technology advances and our political situation (d)evolves. ",
            "\u00a0Yes it was very interesting and I learend a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Its a really good classvery well taught. You should definitely take it if you have even a passing interest in bioethics. The tests arent badjust remember the cases and one they relate to each other in building up public health law and youll be fine. The lectures are really interesting as well so dont skip. ",

            "\u00a0YES. Take this class. Honestly, the material is so interesting, and Latham is a star. It isn't as gutty as some make it out to be, but just take really good notes and attend class (no need to read the book really) and you should be fine. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is super interesting and you learn new things and new ways of looking at legal issues within the medical field. The professor really knows how to keep students attention. ",
            "\u00a0You better either show up to class or do the readings, otherwise you're screwed. Also pray you get a good TA. Can be a great class, but have also heard it can be traumatic. ",

            "\u00a0I wouldn't likely recommend this course to another student. I kind of regret taking this class, to be honest. I didn't really learn anything and didn't feel challenged. I assume many people take this class for an easy grade. There are many other ways to boost your GPA and better courses that have light grading scales and are more engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. It is a lot of fun and not too difficult. The workload is manageable and the exams are easy if you pay attention in lecture. ",

            "\u00a0Absolutely! Bioethics & the Law is popular for a reason its interesting, not too much work, and both lecture and section are productive. Lots of students in the class are pre-law or pre-med, but you can honestly find every type of Yale student in this class. Just be warned: if you take the class feeling like youre entitled to an A just because its an easy class, you may be disappointed. Just missing one small law on a midterm, or not effectively refuting all parts of a new law could result in an A- instead of an A. Theres not much buffer or curve, so tiny mistakes are hard to recover from to get an A. I would recommend taking as many notes as you can during lecture. ",

            "\u00a0YES great class! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course. It is not only important for someone going into law or medicine, but also research. Additionally, it is good for any inhabitant of the US to take such a course, because it informs them of their basic rights. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course, particularly if a student is looking to learn about the American health care system and the way it deals with patients. It was very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",

Normally I would answer this question such as \"I would recommend this course to anyone interested in...\" \"neuroscience,\" or \"learning German,\" or \"attending medical school.\" However, this is the first course I've taken which I would truly recommend to any student. The material is relevant to anyone who wants to be informed on important matters, many of which may apply to himself or herself or a family member at some point n their life, and to anyone who wishes to be an informed voter. Further, it is a very fair class in which it is easy to succeed and learn a lot. ",

I took this class for a grade and I take thorough notes by hand so I would spend every lecture furiously trying to keep up with Professor Latham, and so often I just wanted to stop and listen and really get to absorb/enjoy the lecture. ",

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to another student! If you have any interest in how science/medicine affects people's legal rights and decisions, or if you just want to better understand important current events, then this class is for you. Bioethics and law is a very crucial topic to understand for life, no matter what kind of student you are. Latham does an incredible job of explaining the concepts in a very accessible and interesting manner. Please take this class!! ",

            "\u00a0YES. Professor Latham's lectures are insanely fascinating: he combines a traditional ethical understanding of medicine with a genuine curiosity around new technologies and how they fit in in the broader scheme of bioethics. The topics are very thought-provoking: abortion debates, organ allocation, gene editing, assisted suicide, etc. These are crucial moral conversations you would want to have with a close friend, yet Professor Latham synthesizes them in a wonderfully intellectual and systematic manner. Do watch out for TAs: there's a lot of variation, with some having very little work outside of class, and some a ton. Grade seems to depend too much on TA's discretion. Other than that, a fantastic class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! ",

            "\u00a0Yes! The lectures in this class were consistently fun to attend, and I found our weekly sections to be engaging and thought-provoking. It's also cool to learn about bioethics, a field that's often in the news but infrequently discussed in academic settings. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. It's pretty low workload - there are three exams and weekly reading responses that are graded on completeness, and once a week hour-long section. Prof. Latham is a great lecturer and the material is very interesting, and he covers a broad range of topics. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much from this class and most of the lectures were very interesting. You learn about a lot of topics: organ donation, abortion, end of life care, stem cell research, assisted reproduction, intellectual property, and public health. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to learn anything interesting during your time here at Yale, definitely take this course.  The topics are already interesting but Professor Latham is also a fantastic and very entertaining lecturer which made taking Bioethics and Law that much better.  I can honestly say that this was my favorite course this semester (and one of my all-time favorite courses that I have taken).  Again, the information is extremely compelling and very applicable.  If you are pre-med, this course will give you a new perspective on your future career but if not, it is still a good course to take.  Do yourself a favor and just shop the course.  That being said, if you do take the course, know that it is NOT a gut.  The midterms are actually challenging (the final is even harder) and you do have to thoroughly know the course material (have the supreme court cases memorized and mention as many as you can in the tests).  It is also very hard not to slack since it is a huge lecture class and there is no accountability, but you can get away with just studying the week there is a midterm and not doing much in between.  As long as you go to lecture (Professor Latham covers everything that is important) and prepare well for the tests, this course is not too much work and you will walk away having learned learn tons of interesting stuff! ",

            "\u00a0I would because I felt like I gained a lot out of it and a lot of practical knowledge about important topics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I think people with many different interests/backgrounds can gain a lot of insight from this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is a course that is not too challenging and does not have a huge workload but is very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0It's very interesting, and going to lecture feels like going to a show of some sort. You really don't have to do all of the readings to have a full understanding of the material, the lectures and sections are that good. If you're only concerned about getting an A, then perhaps don't take it since it's kind of hard to know what they want in an essay. Otherwise, such an engaging class, my favorite all year! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I think this is a fun, interesting, easy course with valuable material and an engaging lecture. ",

            "\u00a0I would highly recommend Bioethics and Law.  Especially for people interested in medicine or law, the topics that we discuss are very interesting and controversial.  This gives us good opportunities to try to explain our opinions or attempt to see the argument from another point of view. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because it was interesting and explained a lot of relevant bioethics issues that continue to evolve.  It's especially helpful to students who are planning to do any kind of research with human subjects in any field. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, you will learn a lot about particular issues that are always controversial. It is important to have a basic understanding on some of these issues and makes you think about each issue in depth. "
