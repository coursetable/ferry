            "\u00a0I feel like a developed a very solid foundation in thermodynamics and stat mech. The material is pretty different from other physics courses so I think I learned a lot of new problem solving techniques as well. ",
            "\u00a0The cool and frightening thing about thermo and stat mech is the sheer range of physical phenomena that they can be applied to: neutron stars, heat engines, the formation of raindrops, quantum gases. From Einstein: \"A theory is the more impressive the greater the simplicity of its premises, the more different kinds of things it relates, and the more extended its area of applicability. Therefore the deep impression that classical thermodynamics made upon me. It is the only physical theory of universal content which I am convinced will never be overthrown, within the framework of applicability of its basic concepts.\" ",
            "\u00a0I dont know if there is really a section on this survey to write what I want to write about this class, so Ill just write it here:\r\n\r\nThis class is the hardest class I have ever taken. No question. Nothing else comes close. It was not uncommon for me to work from 2pm to 4am with nothing but a dinner break on a problem set that I had already spent a significant amount of time on. This class made me lose sleep and time that I would normally spend on other things. Sometimes I really hated this class.\r\n\r\nBut some wonderful things came out of this class. I learnt about a subject of which I have had little exposure to, learning a lot about many important subjects in physics in the process.\r\n\r\nI learnt about the magic conch and all of the secrets it beholds. I learnt about how to do a legendary transformation.\r\n\r\nI learnt that Professor Navon (who is really cool) watches Rick and Morty.\r\n\r\nI learnt how intelligent, creative, and generally awesome my peers in the physics major are. I am glad that many of us will be in the same classes next semester, and cannot wait to spend more time with them all.\r\n\r\nSo I suppose that's what I learnt. Now for some practical advice.\r\n\r\nThere are two things I wish I had done differently. I wish I had reviewed the notes from each lecture that day and read up on concepts I didnt understand instead of just attempting the problem sets without reviewing. I wish that I had gone to Professor Navons office hours. I wish that I had sometimes cared a little less about grades and just submitted an incorrect problem set.\r\n\r\nThis class is tough. If you plan on taking it, make sure that your semester isnt too full and that you will have time to sleep lots and time to do whatever makes you feel relaxed. If you can avoid it, dont take this with another intensely quantitative class. ",
            "\u00a0This course covers a lot of material. In reality, it may be better suited to be split up over multiple semesters. The first half covers thermodynamics, but the speed in which the course moves and the length of the p sets prevents you from being able to understand the intricacies and beauty of the math and theory that you are learning. The second half is incredibly interesting and explains thermodynamic postulates through the fundamental theory of statistical mechanics. We covered topics from heat transfer and engines to introductory solid-state physics to exotic topics like black hole formation and Bose-Einstein condensation. ",
            "\u00a0This course covered a very large amount of material in both thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. This class did really help me further develop my problem solving skills and gave me a new perspective on physics. Statistical mechanics, which is relevant in essentially all fields of physics, was particularly exciting to learn. It gives you a new way to think about physical phenomena. During the semester, I was also taking Artificial Intelligence and a biological modeling class, and it was really interesting to see how we used Information Theory for physical purposes and then how statistical mechanics can be used to explain certain biological phenomena. ",
            "\u00a0Phys 420 covers a ton of material, basically a crash course in everything thermodynamics, plus stat mech as well. It really teaches you how to juggle several different textbooks; lecture material and psets were taken from both Callen and Schroeder, as well as some other sources...it could sometimes be tricky to track down where a certain derivation, equation, or example came from, particularly when the notation varied pretty wildly between sources. ",
            "\u00a0A great introduction to thermodynamics and and statistical mechanics, as the course description would have you believe. ",
            "\u00a0This course covered a huge amount of material in one semester, but gave a solid and fairly in-depth overview of thermodynamics as well as topics in stat mech. Really intense, but gained a lot from the class. ",
            "\u00a0This class covers a lot of information concerning the basic stuff of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics.  We learned everything from basic theory to complex phenomena such as Bose Einstein condensation. ",
            "\u00a0Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics was a very insightful course for understanding how the physics we know applies to macroscopic systems.  It gives a way of applying a broad understanding of physics to problems of higher complexity.  Taking this course gives me the understanding to learn how to apply the techniques and perspective learned in this course to a broader class of problems. ",
            "\u00a0Learned thermodynamic principles and the statistical mechanical foundations that supported thermodynamic results. Also learned a substantial amount of relevant mathematics. ",
            "\u00a0I learned all about thermodynamics and statistical mechanics from this class. My favorite insights were when we covered a concept I'd learned previously in high school chemistry or physics, because so many of the facts we were told to just \"take for granted\" then are now explained by thermo and stat mech. ",
            "\u00a0We extensively covered many topics in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0There was quite a lot of homework, but I realize now this was essential for learning the very challenging material. I liked how we did a wide range of problems on the homework, from very formal derivations to explicit calculations and even one problem on processing experimental data. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: fascinating material; in general there is not too much math to get in the way of the physical concepts; \r\nWeakness: This should be two classes! I want to know more thermodynamics and statistical dynamics. I get how they play off of each other, but I feel like each section was cut short just before we got to the really cool stuff. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the amount of material covered, cool examples, office hours. this class also has a strong sense of solidarity and commiseration that is appreciated in trying times (aka the night before the pset's due). Weaknesses: the amount of material covered, concepts are hard to follow at times. ",
            "\u00a0This course is such a difficult one to have issues with, as it is essentially two courses compressed into one. On the one hand, I want to make sure that I am learning at least the essentials of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. On the other hand, it would have been great if I could have gotten more sleep. I suppose my biggest suggestion would be to have the physics department offer this course as a two course sequence instead of a one course one?\r\n\r\nI also think that there should be at least two TAs for this course. It's a lot of work for one TA (took a long time to get problem sets back), and it would be very very useful to have more than one TA office hours. ",
            "\u00a0Problem sets and exams are too long. This course should be two courses. There is not enough time in one semester to adequately cover thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. The Yale physics department is hurting its students by keeping this class as a one semester course. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is that the material is extremely applicable, interesting, and profound; however, because the course is so condensed there is not enough time to absorb all of the material and its applications. Instead, you spend the entire semester feeling lost. I did not get the chance to truly appreciate and enjoy the course until I had a week to study it before the final. While some people might blame Professor Navon's teaching, I do not think it was his fault. He is given the near impossible task of teaching all of the material in one semester and does the best he can to be accommodating. ",
            "\u00a0Many of us in the major agree that this class should be split into two separate classes, a thermodynamics course and a statistical mechanics course. We cover a lot of material, but I also felt like we could have gone in a lot more depth in many areas. For example, we only spent three classes on quantum statistics, and I think that many of us would have loved to go into more depth on the topic. \r\n\r\nThat being said, the course as it is is still very strong. I thought that the problem sets, while long, were necessary if were to go so quickly through the material. The exams were really long, both the midterm and the final, but I think that for the most part, the problem sets prepared us well for them. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that it's a pretty comprehensive overview, a lot of information is packed in there. The weakness is the same-- often we went so quickly through the material that I felt I barely learned it or didn't understand how topics related/connected...the psets coveredan overwhelming number of topics and took years to finish. That being said, it was also nice to be exposed to so much information (if only to realize how much there is to learn...geez) ",
            "\u00a0This course was a TON of work and VERY difficult but ultimately very rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0The course provides a solid foundation for both thermodynamics and stat mech, but moves too quickly in trying to cover both thoroughly in one semester. ",
            "\u00a0While this course involves very interesting material, it is simply too much. Flying through thermodynamics I found myself completely lost at times and repeatedly had to read through the books to relearn topics we had very quickly glazed over in class. The same is true for statistical mechanics. I believe that every student in the class would agree with me that this course should be split into two: one semester of thermodynamics and one of statistical mechanics to avoid problems like this. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course is that we have covered a great amount of material and learned the subjects throughly with the problem sets.  A weakness might be that the time required for the course was more than expected by the student.  It could be better to have the students know a range of time they might expect to spend on the course per week. ",
            "\u00a0Very difficult course. The problem sets took very long, especially the first half of thermodynamics. You learn a lot about the material, but it is easy to get behind in the class. The class time being at 9 am on science hill also made it difficult to focus after staying up late. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, this is a very strong course. We covered a lot of material, but because it was taught very effectively and the problem sets were a thorough overview of the material, I felt like I could keep up. I also really appreciated the generous, holistic grading of the exams: small algebraic mistakes were barely penalized at all. One nitpicky improvement I'd suggest is to simplify the homework drop policy. I'm not sure if there's some specific purpose to this semester's policy that I missed, but I think I'd rather have a system where the N lowest homework grades are dropped to calculate your final homework average (regardless of how many homeworks you completed). ",
            "\u00a0One of the biggest issues is just that the course covers too much material, to the point of being arguably unreasonable. Coming to the final exam fully prepared for any question was almost impossible. I also think that the large amount of material caused a lot of undue stress which shifted the focus away from what was actual being taught towards worries over grades/what was testable. That being said, I think the class mostly flowed in a logical way and lectures built upon each other in a way that reinforced what we'd done. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This course is a ton of work, but you should take it. Statistical mechanics is awesome and if you want to continue with physics in the future you have to learn it. The exams were really hard, but Nir is a fair grader. Definitely worth the struggle. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course! Even for quantitatively minded non-physics majors, this course is well worth it. The material finally bridges the gap between the underlying laws governing single bodies (classical mechanics, intro  quantum) and the complex world around us. My favorite physics class so far. Also, Professor Navon is a great lecturer. This is the only 9am class that I've been able to focus through all semester. He draws material from multiple textbook, which is normally a huge red flag, but what he presented was miraculously better than the constituent books. My lecture notes actually covered all the relevant material for hw. Be warned though, homework is challenging. That said, hw is also a lot of fun, so it really comes down to what percentage of your week you like to spend on psets. Finally, the tests... they were hard; probably the hardest I have taken outside of a math class. Don't let this discourage you though, as Professor Navon doesn't expect you to get all the questions, and said he wouldn't go crazy taking off points. ",
            "\u00a0Ideally, thermodynamics and statistical mechanics would be a two-semester sequence, because there's more than enough material to go around. But ideal gases don't exist, and we're left to deal with the van der waals case. 420 is a lot of work, although the  pset workload is frontloaded in the semester: i spent over 12 hours a week on thermo psets and roughly 8 hours a week on stat mech. The exams are also long and extremely difficult. \r\n\r\nThat being said, 420 is an essential course in the physics major, so it may be better to grit your teeth and get through it sooner rather than later. ",
            "\u00a0I wouldnt recommend taking this course unless you have to. It is certainly interesting, but it is a lot to voluntarily put on your plate. ",
            "\u00a0Exceptionally useful, but the workload is excessive. If Nir teaches this again, just read Callen. During a break, just read the whole book. Problem sets can be done in 2 days if its the only thing you work on. I had no social life because of this class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course only if the structure is changed. If it remains Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics, just know that you are getting yourself into an extremely challenging semester and will not have a lot of time for other classes because of all the time you spend on p sets and understanding the material. In my opinion it is the hardest class in the intensive physics major by far. ",
            "\u00a0The class is pretty difficult and the psets are very long, but the material is incredibly interesting, particularly when you get to the stat mech part of the course. You have to put a lot of work in to keep up and understand what's going on, but you really come out with a new perspective on physics. \r\n\r\nAlso, make sure you have access to the Callen textbook, which is wayyyy more useful than Schroeder, and be prepared for some really long exams. ",
            "\u00a0Physics majors, ya gotta take this. Just make sure you plan your schedule well so you set aside enough time to slog through these psets every week. ",
            "\u00a0Aside from the fact that it is required for intensive majors, I would recommend the course but would warn that the course moves extremely quickly and covers lots of material each class. ",
            "\u00a0So heres the thing: this was the single most difficult course in the intensive physics major for me. You have to take it if you are going the intensive track, but I definitely recommend that you take it during a semester with a very light schedule in other classes. Also, make sure that you have friends taking the course at the same time for sure! If you do not have to take the course, make sure you are prepared for extremely long problem sets that will often take you a significant amount of time to figure out the insight behind the physics of the problem. You will learn a lot, but you will absolutely work for it. ",
            "\u00a0This course might be the most insightful course that you will take in the undergraduate physics curriculum.  Students should expect to spend longer durations of time on problem sets than other physics classes. ",
            "\u00a0This course is extremely difficult, and I would only recommend taking it for the intensive physics major or if you already have a decent background in thermodynamics or stat mech. It is a pretty heavy workload and be prepared to sink in a lot of time into this class. ",
            "\u00a0YES, I'd strongly recommend this course -- especially with Nir. Thermo was my favorite physics course at Yale by a pretty large margin. While problem sets for other physics classes felt like Mathematica bashing, these problems sets were nuanced, challenging, and conceptually difficult. This class takes a fair amount of time, but it's very, very worth. ",
            "\u00a0Hardest course I've ever taken. ",
            "\u00a0Almost everyone who considers taking this course will be doing so as a requirement for the physics major but if you're don't have to take this course and are just interested in the material I would be wary. The grading was fairly generous, however you will still have to keep track of a lot of difficult material and complete lengthy problem sets. The exams were also some of the most difficult exams I have ever taken and require substantial preparation. I would only take this class as an option if I was up for a challenge. "
