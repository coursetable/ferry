            "\u00a0Developed my understanding of Buddhism, all the realms located in the Buddhist cosmology, and it helped me appreciate Buddhist art. ",

            "\u00a0A lot of emphasis on the 'art and architecture' and I think that more emphasis on the religious aspect would have been better to contextualize art and make it more interesting ",
            "\u00a0I liked how it was organized, really interesting material ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were dry and didn't contribute to how I did on evaluations ",

            "\u00a0The course was great! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The course was interesting and the course load was very manageable. Professor Yiengpruksawan (Mimi) is incredibly knowledgable about the topic and deeply cares about her students' education. The fact that many of the pictures used on the lecture slides were taken by Mimi herself testifies to how experienced she is with Buddhist visual tradition and practice.\r\nWeaknesses: At the beginning of the semester, some of the readings were hard to access or find. Eventually the TFs starting making PDF scans of the readings, which really helped. ",
            "\u00a0The class was fun and well organized ",
            "\u00a0This course is well structured between Mimi's lectures and the TA's sections. However, I would have liked more online resources. Many of the course readings were only accessible from books on reserve in the library. This made it difficult to complete them. Additionally, much of the lecture was parallel to or repeating the readings rather than incorporating them in an engaging way. ",
            "\u00a0honestly great class. Cool lectures. Mimi's super knowledgeable ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very comprehensive, fair exams\r\nWeaknesses: should emphasize Buddhist philosophy more, architecture should be explained in terms of its philosophical underpinnings rather than just having the structure described "

I feel like I'm able to appreciate Buddhist art a lot more and learned the basics of the different tradition without feeling overwhelmed by the class. Highly recommend! ",

As an art history major, I would say you should take this class if you are very interested in the subject matter, but if you are looking for a more general art history experience, I think there are some better intro classes.

There was a 3 page essay and then a final 10 page paper, as well as 2 midterms where we had to memorize around 70 art pieces for each one, including artist, time period, date, material, and place of origin-- it was not easy! Mimi was a great lecturer and the TA's seemed genuinely engaged with the class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this to any student who is interested in art history. It was unlike any other art history course I've taken, and it opened my eyes to the diversity of visual expression within a religion context. ",
