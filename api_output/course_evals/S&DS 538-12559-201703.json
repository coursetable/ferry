In terms of strengths, the professor and TFs provided us with so many resources to succeed (course notes, problem sets, multiple sections each week, extra practice problems and practice exams, etc. etc.). The topics were organized thoughtfully and built well on one another. The examples were fun and engaging, as was class. Can't think of any improvements. ",

I felt that most of the problems were difficult to the point that it was difficult to connect them to the material we covered in lecture. Alternatively, adding optional drills to the curriculum might solve this problem. ",

Applied science students will encounter probability (and all of the course concepts) time and time again, and this class helps you ground yourself in a real understanding that I didn't realize could even exist... As someone coming from a weaker quantitative background, and still able to survive in this class, I'd recommend this class to people of all levels as an effort worth undertaking. ",
