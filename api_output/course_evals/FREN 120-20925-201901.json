Also, the classes are spent WAY more on the videos than 110 which is kind of annoying since we were learning so much grammar. We would spend 5 minutes re watching the same 10 seconds of the video or having technical difficulties but only 30 seconds talking about important grammatical concepts. Our section also had much worse grades than other sections so keep that in mind. ",

            "\u00a0If you are on the French track, might as well take it. I would not say I would \"recommend\" it, but then again if you are taking this class it is probably to just get through your language requirement or because you actually want to/need to learn French. ",
            "\u00a0The course was worth taking, but I had a difficult time finding common ground with my instructor. ",
