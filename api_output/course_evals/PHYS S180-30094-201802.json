            "\u00a0The fundamentals of calculus based physics, conceptually and applying that knowledge to potential real-world scenarios ",
            "\u00a0I learnt about how to think in physics terms. I really appreciated trying to understand the material and the first 11 chapters of the textbook. I was used to plugging in numbers and trying to make them work in equations, but I am now starting to appreciate using symbols (like G, m, a, etc) to figure out what to do, then plug in numbers at the end and I think that might be a helpful approach in future. ",
            "\u00a0I strengthened my ability to tackle problems quantitatively and overcame my fear of physics. ",

        [
            "\u00a0The course was well taught, the professor would go through a lot of practice problems which was helpful. I do with the professor would sometime give students the chance to solve the problems he would go over before showing how to do it on the board because I feel like this would be more helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Good teaching ",
            "\u00a0This was a really decent introductory physics class. I think the sections could be improved, especially in the first part of the course. However, it was useful to go through problems. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The real life application was apparent.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish the content was more involved and utilized more of what we learned in regards to calculus. I learned the concepts of calculus based physics but there was so little calculus that it didn't even feel like it was calculus based. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course is good as it is. I think it was good to have P-sets due every week and think the midterms were well spaced-out. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are large amount of problems used to show learned concepts, and lots of time given to review harder ideas, as well as easily-understood lectures. Weaknesses are in that problems are described and solved without a lot of student input. An improvement could be that discussions have problems solved by the students which are then talked about. ",
            "\u00a0This course does a superb job introducing students to all the course material taught during the academic calendar year, but, by virtue of being a summer course, prevents students from taking time to appreciate the nuances of some concepts. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses--no acknowledgment of varying levels of physics experience before coming in. There were people in the class that have taken physics before, which I feel detracted from the learning experience of others who haven't, as the professor sometimes assumed we knew something because others were knowledgable about it. ",

            "\u00a0I took this class as a pre-med requirement. I think it is pretty good in terms of thinking with a physics mindset and can help aid your understanding of biological and chemical processes. Thus said, I'd say do it if you need to or just want to be exposed to another science-y way of thinking. For me, it was helpful to read before the class, especially since the summer course is relatively fast-paced. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in applying mathematics. ",
