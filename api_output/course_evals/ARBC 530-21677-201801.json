            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend it to another student who is interested in Arabic and Islamic studies because it is not only highly instructive in the classical Arabic  grammar and culture but also a lot of fun, thanks to Prof. Shawkat Toorawa's dynamic and energetic performance during the whole session.
