            "\u00a0This course provided an overview of fish biology and ecology, as well as the role fish play in our lives and our roles in their lives. It was very interesting and very interdisciplinary. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about fish and how most of tetrapod evolution can be traced back to these fantastic aquatic creatures. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a deep understanding about fish taxonomy and diversity! ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about fish! ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about fish anatomy, ecology, economics (fisheries), and the evolutionary importance of fish (tetrapodization). Also was exposed to a great amount of fish diversity in this course ",
            "\u00a0Drastic improvement in my ability to recognize fish and by the end a mild understanding of the tools that fish regularly use to survive. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The strength of this course was in its emphasis on the interdisciplinary nature of fish. Also, it was great at exposing us to fish diversity and the \"so what?\" of ichthyology as a field. The only weakness was that the course felt a bit redundant at times, and we didn't learn about nearly as many explicit kinds of fish as I was hoping to. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Harrington's lecture style and slides were definitely a highlight  never before have I seen such engaging slides (especially in a science course). One weakness of the course may lie in the overall structure and organization  it seemed like the teleost fishes were skimmed over at the end of the course. ",
            "\u00a0This class could be improved for students that aren't already familiar with evolutionary biology. A vocabulary list or something like that would have been helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Very interesting and engaging course. Both material and instructor were great! ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were engaging, the use of videos and other visual aids was enhancing and not distracting. Dr. Harrington is an engaging lecturer who is clearly passionate about his field and passes on that excitement to the students ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Harrington for sure, he was brilliant and fun and captivating. \r\nGreatest strength of the class was that it was super fun to go to and overall very enjoyable. \r\n\r\nPowerpoint slides were sometimes confusing, when going back to study for the test there was so much information and I had trouble distinguishing names of families and species, etc. ",
            "\u00a0I drastically preferred the portions of the course that focused on extant species, as well as extinct species that seemed relevant to organ systems development. It would be nice if the class focused a bit more on a topic opposed to being as spread out. "

        [
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the course. While you do need to know the material in depth for the exams, the course was overall pretty low-stress, and fish are actually really interesting! ",
            "\u00a0I would most definitely recommend this course. It has been one of my favorite courses at Yale. Rich was great at facilitating a community and making the course engaging. Also, the course is very interdisciplinary, the most interdisciplinary of all the organismal diversity courses, and thus has appeal for STEM and non-STEM majors alike. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Ichthyology is super fun (the videos are awesome) and Professor Harrington's love for fish is contagious. With only three midterms, a quiz, and a short paper, the workload isn't too bad, as well. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was a lot of fun ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely! If you're interested in fish, take it. If you need a science credit, take it. If you just wanna take a fun class, take it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think it's a well taught, relatively straightforward course that does exactly what it promises. Prof. Harrington is perfect for the role and it was an enjoyable experience. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - take it, it's fun and if you have any interest in snorkeling, fishing, or the ocean this is a great class to take. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this class, it was extremely fun and interesting, and Professor Harrington is definitely my favorite professor that I have encountered in my time at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course if you have the time. This class made me excited about fish, which I really wasn't expecting when I enrolled. I had never been fishing before, nor had I any knowledge related to fish prior to this course, but at this point studying more ichthyology sounds pretty nice. "
