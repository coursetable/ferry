I think it could have been helpful to have some type of visual material to complement the lecture series. It can be tricky for some to sit for 2 + hours without anything to look at. Maybe a digitized version of the matrix? I actually liked filling it out by hand... maybe provide a digitized one for reference after the class to have handy? It was really important stuff and in this day and age a piece of paper is just not going to stick around. ",

Would have appreciated more involvement of developing country perspectives during the final mock debate module, as well as a bit more insight into other countries' negotiation tactics.
