            "\u00a0Strong knowledge of Latin literature of the Republican and Early Augustan age. Ability to read Latin text at high speed, ability to close-read texts, ability to think of Latin authors and frame within a broader literary-historical narrative. ",
            "\u00a0This class served to prepare students for graduate qualifying exams and to impart an understanding, both general and specific, of the history and themes of Latin literature (from Livius Andronikos to Ovid). It necessitated learning how to read and process Latin quickly. The survey format of the course allowed more in-depth consideration of literary history and various genre traditions within Latin literature, as well as of the individual authors and the stylistics/themes of their works. ",
            "\u00a0My Latin reading skills improved enormously, as well as my knowledge of the arc of Latin literature and history. This course was extremely helpful for my career as a classicist. ",
            "\u00a0My Latin improved significantly.  I also gained a much better understanding of the development of Latin literature as a whole. ",
            "\u00a0A strong sense for the major trends and themes in the history of Latin literature.\r\n\r\nSuperb introduction to the resources for reading Latin, especially for the texts we covered on the syllabus.\r\n\r\nAn excellent model for how to teach a course of this nature. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: the amount of texts read,  the variety in genres, thinking in terms of 'literary history', the fact in class we do not waste time translating the text in circles but we rather look at the text and discuss the issues being brought up: I definitely learned more this way. The grouping of texts by genres. I found really useful read all the didactic and the lyric in sequence. I would suggest grouping also Sallust and Livy (maybe) in the same week(s)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: NA ",
            "\u00a0The format of the course--allowing us to prepare translation on our own and having on-Canvas evaluations, while focusing on discussing larger themes and working with literary analysis of the text in-class--was very effective and helpful. It really gave the survey a sense of cohesion and a way of thinking about these texts in relation to one another, which was very clarifying especially when the amount of Latin to read was overwhelming. The examinations reflected this balance extremely well, too, staggered between translation and literary analysis. The extra hour was useful also for really narrowing in on a particular text. ",
            "\u00a0The secondary readings were sometimes too obtuse. But generally there was a very good balance between reading, discussing, and lecturing. ",
            "\u00a0I cannot think of a way this course could be improved. ",
            "\u00a0This course was excellently organized. "

            "\u00a0Yes, definitely, and I would advise the DUS in Classics to keeping recommending this class to the undergraduate students intending to pursue Classics as a major. They have been a crucial part of this class. ",
            "\u00a0Very much, as long as they had sufficient Latin to do the reading each week. ",
            "\u00a0This course was incredibly important for my development as a student. I would recommend it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, without a doubt! "
