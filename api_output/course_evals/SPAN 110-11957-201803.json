            "\u00a0This course definitely expanded my Spanish vocabulary and gave me a much better understanding of Spanish grammar. I now have a working knowledge of a few verb tenses and other key grammatical elements. I feel like I could partake in a simple Spanish conversation after this course. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the basics of Spanish vocabulary and grammar. ",
            "\u00a0Ability to speak and write Spanish at an elementary level. ",
            "\u00a0Basic Spanish ",
            "\u00a0I learned a basic understanding of Spanish in the present and preterite tense. ",
            "\u00a0Basic understanding of Spanish, better ability to listen and speak. ",
            "\u00a0I learned many words, conjugations, and cultural lessons about Spanish and Spanish speaking countries. "

            "\u00a0Overall, I would say this course is very well designed. It's not too difficult for those who have never taken Spanish before. Because the material becomes increasingly difficult, it encourages students to retain the knowledge they've already learned, which I think is important for any language class. The only criticism I have of the course is that I think there could be a few more listening and speaking exercises throughout it, but really, that's about it. ",
            "\u00a0The professor was amazing. He showed such an interest in the subject that all of the students were engaged. The expectations were clearly posted and homework helped us practice what we were learning. Also, the tests were an accurate reflection of the information that was presented. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were the individual focus on each student, the practice activities in class, and laid-back yet productive class environment. ",
            "\u00a0Use of the workbook was minimal. I wish that it could be uploaded to Canvas instead of having to purchase it at Tyco. ",
            "\u00a0The compositions leave some room for improvement. You can keep it very basic and fill up the page with grammar you already know, but I think docking for trying to figure out grammar we havent learned yet should be kept to a minimum. I dont think its a huge problem though because we got corrections for the first two papers. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\nThe grammar was taught in a good order.  \r\n\r\nImprovements: \r\nThe online homework was difficult to complete as it marked us off for mistakes that we could not know (for example: complicated names or spellings). "

            "\u00a0Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. First of all, Spanish is just a very practical language to know. Beyond that, as long as you keep up with the material (and the class moves at a manageable pace), you should be able to hold a basic conversation or write a basic, short composition in Spanish with relative ease by the end of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to anyone who has an interest in Spanish. It did move a little quickly, but it was still manageable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, you learn a lot in just one semester. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It moves pretty quickly and is a lot of work if you have no prior experience in the language, but its a good class. ",
            "\u00a0I would most definitely recommend this course to anyone who is wanting to learn Spanish.  It was well organized and I learned much more than I could have predicted. "
