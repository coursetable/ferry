            "\u00a0I learned to question the governmental system that we are under by exploring how others have questioned them. ",

            "\u00a0I was able to understand the different philosophies that make and nullify the different laws in the country. I was also able to see how the laws have changed over time. I was able to develop argumentative skills in the class. ",

            "\u00a0This political science course incorporated a lot of philosophical works and social science reports. Readings these helped me gain a lot more significantly good insights into the criminal justice system in the US. Reading and discussing about those materials not only improved my critical reading skill but also boosted my analytical skill for difficult materials. "

            "\u00a0The strengths of the course were the vastly interesting readings that we were given. The weaknesses of the course were that it could have been a bit more discussion-based, but maybe the size of the class was prohibiting it. ",
            "\u00a0weakness would be participation time management and my strength was the interest i had towards the course ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is that you will be able to see how the country has changed. You will have the opportunity to read much about court cases and philosophies. You will need a lot of engagement with your teacher and your peers. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- Teaching method, quality of reading material\r\nWeakness- Very short period of time to complete assignments ",
            "\u00a0The course is very material-driven. We read the materials assigned and discuss about them in class. Even though the materials are a lot and definitely take a lot of time in class to talk about, I still hope that the class could be more engaging by incorporating some other materials or small activities.

            "\u00a0Yes. The course helped me begin thinking deeply into many controversial matter abortion, discrimination, etc to ultimately have a argument based opinion on the matter. The debate the course creates is very intuitive and helps you conclude and synthesize even more on the matters discussed. ",

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student because it is a great way to know upon which philosophies the laws are based upon. It is also very interesting to hear the other reasonings other students have. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would. The seminar style is very useful for this course. It engages all students and creates an atmosphere conducive to discussion and argument. Dr. Hacker-Cordon takes advantage of this atmosphere with his taechig style. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This definitely is a highly thought-provoking course. And I am sure every thoughtful person will love it. "
