It was a sort of survey course of the many facet of reproductive biology, and I developed a newfound interest in human biology that I had never explored previously. I feel like I have developed new understandings of such a wide variety of biological processes, and while the survey nature of the course precludes depth into some topics, I feel that we were able to still get somewhat deep into some areas, and the broad nature allows me to then study selected concepts further through other coursework or on my own. This was my favorite course of the semester! ",

            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are that experts in each field are brought in to talk to students about topics they are extremely well-versed in. This brought variety and knowledge of the latest research to the course and I appreciated it.\r\nThe strength is directly related to the weakness of this course: it often felt disjointed -- there was no connection between one lecture and the next, making it hard to follow sometimes. It could be improved if there was more coordination between the professors who teach each topic to make sure none is covered twice and nothing important is skipped.\r\nAlso, I thought Prof Lubna Pal was extremely disrespectful to students who asked questions. The way she taught was extremely confusing and ineffective. ",
            "\u00a0Though I enjoyed learning from a variety of clinicians, the lectures as a whole sometimes felt disjointed. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: many different experts in particular subjects, rotation of profs makes it feel fresh every time, slides are posted so you can focus on understanding rather than copying words down\r\nweakness: many profs also means slight inconsistencies in lecturing (some would rush through material too fast for you to write any extra info down, while others took their time and went way over the end of the class, which sucks for people who have a class right after) ",

            "\u00a0The class was pretty relaxed and not a lot of work, but I still felt that I learned a lot and got a lot out of it. However, the quality of the lecturers ranged considerably and many of them were poor speakers and not very engaging. I also wished that there was a bit less overlap in some of the lectures. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: You learn so much in the course, but it isn't stressful because there aren't that many assignments.  Also because most lectures are done by guest speakers, mostly OB/GYNs from the Med School, they are often experts in the topic they present and have conducted research on it themselves.\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the lecturers seemed to be so focused on the scientific aspects and data on various aspects of reproduction that they lost sight of the social factors at play. ",
            "\u00a0I like that all the different lecturers are given apparently the same instructions on how to structure their presentations- with clear pages referring to the topics about to be presented and overall summaries at the end of every lecture. ",

            "\u00a0Strength: coolest content, great lectures who were experts and involved in the Med School, felt like taking a Medical school course\r\n\r\nWeakness: The correct lecture slides were not always posted on Canvas before the actual lecture. Disconnect between lecturers and course instructors/TAs, MCDB majors had to attend journal club discussions but not sure if these factor into the overall grade? ",

            "\u00a0This course could be improved by removing some of the redundancy. Since all of the lecturers were (in a way) \"guest\" lecturers, they often repeated what we had already learned without realizing it. That said, I really enjoyed hearing from a variety of professors and doctors about their work. Everyone was a specialist in his or her field of study, and it showed. ",
            "\u00a0Some of the lectures were really strong. Others were unengaging and dull. Select guest lecturers with more care? ",
            "\u00a0Since there is a different lecturer every time (which I think is great) sometimes the exams did a poor job of reflecting what we learned in the lectures ",
            "\u00a0The variety of professors are both a strength and a weakness. Some of them are super strong and engaging... some not so much. For me it really worked and kept things interesting, but some others might not enjoy this format. ",
            "\u00a0A strength is that the TAs were very helpful. A weakness was that it was a bit disorganized, in terms of that the slides posted online didn't match the ones in lecture, and similar concepts were repeated many times. More detailed explorations on fewer topics could have been helpful, or coordination between lecturers. ",

            "\u00a0Weaknesses - confusing with overlap between lectures\r\nEverything else was great ",
            "\u00a0Lectures too disjointed, weird not having 1 main professor, felt like some lecturers didn't know what we had learned before so we sometimes relearned some things, some lecture slides were kind of unorganized, hard to adjust to teaching styles of so many different lecturers ",
            "\u00a0Some lecturers were great and others were terrible. I think its cool to have different people come in, but make sure theyre not constantly repeating the same material. Also maybe reevaluate the quality of different lecturers. \r\n\r\nThere was occasionally reference to marriage and some gender stereotypes that I think have no place in a biology course. But overall it did this less than some other biology courses Ive taken ",
            "\u00a0get rid of it ",
            "\u00a0Overall strong course. Perhaps have the lecturer place more clear emphasis on broader themes that are relevant for the exam. Sometimes presentations were excessively detailed and difficult to conceptualize. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include the addressing of the most important reproductive biology concepts and the different perspectives of the lecturers. Weaknesses included constantly repeated information and posted powerpoints not being the same as the lecturers' presentations. ",
            "\u00a0Quality of test questions was poor. For each test, there were several questions that had to be removed from the final tally due to excessive confusion. Many questions were vague and ambiguous, requiring the TFs to clarify them to the whole lecture during exam periods. ",
            "\u00a0The course is slightly disorganized and the lecturers vary in quality, from excellent to pretty subpar. Overall though, the material is interesting and the course is not rigorous in the slightest (essentially zero work outside of exam studying). The exams are fifty multiple choice and a few short answer questions and while easy, the questions are sometimes ambiguous and test irrelevant minute details that are of little importance to the overall subject matter. The exams were more like high school memorization/regurgitation multiple choice tests that failed to assess real conceptual understanding and critical thinking and unlike any other college-level biology assessment that I've taken. ",
            "\u00a0Having three non-cumulative exams and no final was a major plus. The course material was always quite interesting, but the guest lecturers greatly varied in their teaching style, which often made it difficult to take copious lecture notes. Also, the slides tended to be very long, so it would be helpful if lecturers could mention what would be best to focus on when preparing for the exam. ",
            "\u00a0I think having a different lecturer was interesting, but it would be nice if they communicated among each other so that they knew what we had already been taught. For example, some lecturers just repeated things we already knew, or brought up things we were yet to learn. ",
            "\u00a0The survey nature of the course allows students to find areas that speak to them in a huge field of specialties. Additionally, the introduction to such as wide range of faculty members allows students to contact faculty specializing in areas they find particularly interesting. I did so, and I was even able to shadow the faculty member in the lab/clinic and see the concepts from class come to life! Some of the professors are more engaging than others, and sometimes the information from one lecture would contradict information from another, but aside from maybe filtering out some of the less engaging lecturers and syncing up the content a bit better, I think the course has little to improve upon! ",
            "\u00a0A bit disorganized, but overall a pretty good class. ",
            "\u00a0The material is very interesting, but the exams are really unfair. You never know what to expect. Also, having different lectures is difficult because some days there were powerpoints and some other days they were not. Exams were mostly based on the powerpoints, which sometimes were not fully covered. ",
            "\u00a0Other assignments to help grade students, a lot to just rely on multiple choice. ",
            "\u00a0Every lecture is essentially taught by a guest lecturer who is a practicing specialist in that field -- which is both a strength and a weakness of the class. On the one hand, it's really cool that you're being taught by people who really know their shit, but on the other, the course overall is a bit disjointed. There is often a lot of overlap between lectures because they don't know what other lecturers have covered. It would help if the professor or TA went through the guest lecture notes beforehand and let them know what has already been covered, and to what extent. Yeah, it would be extra work on their part but what else are they doing? "

It's definitely not the most entertaining class to sit through, but the workload is incredibly low and the tests are easy. I learned a fair amount from preparing for the tests even though the lectures were not super engaging and not very well integrated (all guest lectures w/ huge range in quality). ",

It is one of the only MCDB courses structured in this way, and that alone makes it worth taking.\r\n\r\nThe evaluations are very fair, given the sheer amount of material you are expected to master. It is definitely not a gut, but it is also structured in such a way that non-majors can benefit from the SC credit. There are major and non-major discussion sections (the latter being optional), and the staff have a genuine desire to see everyone master the material.\r\n\r\nTaking this course was truly a great experience.

Great class for casually learning about human reproduction (especially about the female reproductive system) from a series of different lecturers. ",

But some of the questions were very very specific and required you to know specific statistics that didn't always seem very pertinent or essential to your understanding of the material. But personally, I found it to be too disorganized and the lecturers were either hit or miss in how engaging they were, and I don't feel like I am walking away with a ton of knowledge. "
