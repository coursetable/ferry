Through the course assignments, I improved my critical thinking, my writing and reading skills, as well as my communication skills when presenting and participating in class discussions. I really enjoyed working in my final paper and class exercise because I had the opportunity to explore very interesting topics. ",

This class gives plenty of time to explore the idea of resilience, allowing students to explore it in many different contexts. It really helped me articulate the meaning of resilience, especially compared to other concepts such as sustainability, risk, and vulnerability. Students each brought different experiences and interests to the class, which helped me broaden my understanding of resilience in different places and contexts. I now feel extremely comfortable talking about the meaning of resilience, how it differs from place to place, and how to approach finding solutions to resilience challenges. ",

I didn't really grasp what the main points were from the first part of the class and felt like I didn't learn much because it was so theory-based (on multiple theories) and not much of the beginning part of the class was built in real-life examples/situations. I ended up learning more from my classmates about a lot of different subject matters but nothing extremely granular which would have been helpful ",

The knowledge given during the first part of the class was extremely dense and although we were told that this type theory  was needed, did not have a relevant effect on me as a student. Many concepts delivered on papers easily evaporated later in the semester. ",

            "\u00a0I enjoyed the class very much and it aligned with my expectations pretty good. Something that I was not expecting was to focus on theory and concepts during the first half of the semester. I thought the full course would demonstrate those concepts by applying them in practical cases. ",

            "\u00a0I was disappointed that this course was not more applied. The first half of the semester was dedicated to theoretical models for systems thinking, which I felt could have been condensed into one or two classes. The class was advertised as being about applying theories of resiliency thinking to real case studies, but we did almost none of that. The weekly skype calls with guest speakers were useful, but the only real introduction we got to how these theories are applied in the policy world. I was honestly pretty disappointed in this course. ",
            "\u00a0It aligned very well! Some students were frustrated with the amount of theory that was covered in the first half of the class, but the class description clearly states that there is a strong focus on theory.

            "\u00a0^ see above\r\n\r\nLess theory based in the beginning. If there will be theory, try to pick a few really strong points that you really want us to understand and stick with those. I just felt like the lectures were a little bit scattered and I had trouble understanding what I needed to get from those lectures even though I paid very close attention.\r\n\r\nLess meeting times --> we met with the professor to go over our final project outlines but the professor had not even read the outlines. We took time out of our busy schedules to meet and the advice that was given to us was the same advice that was given to most other groups, which made the meeting time something that could have been done in class. The end of the class seemed a little sloppy. We used to have three sections to the class: student presentations, practitioners presentation, and Alark's presentation. After a while, he stopped presenting and we would either get out early or presentations would run over time. It felt like the professor just had too many commitments and that this class was not a top priority for him. Also there was too much student presentation, I wanted to learn more from the professor than my fellow students. He is a real practitioner but I never fully learned lessons from him in the field at a granular level. I wanted to learn more about his experiences rather than theory, which is something I can learn on my own time by reading through papers. He also barely graded anything I think? So I really don't feel like I got much feedback from him or learned from him in that way. Also what was the point of the midterm brief? I learned nothing from that assignment honestly. ",
            "\u00a0A major weakness is the focus on the definition of resilience. It was theoretical but not in a good sense, it wasn't like Nieztche or Kant, just debating definitions of a single word. I found the readings dry and the student presentations didn't align with guest lectures. I also didn't learn anything that can be applied to real world work. ",
            "\u00a0Strength is that it was a small class - would love for less time of student presentations and more time of activities and/or interfacing with the speakers. ",
            "\u00a0Regarding strenghts, I will mention the guest lecturers. Most of them conveyed clear messages and lines of thinking.\r\nWeakness: I was expecting more inputs from the instructor regarding theory and practice of the resilience terminology. I consider more a facilitator than a professor. I was expecting the latter.\r\nDuring presentation, we needed curation support from the instructor. I felt that some reading papers were dull/nor engaging or posed controversial ideas that triggers more interest.\r\nLack of proper feedback: the feedback received on the final project left me with the impression that the instructor did not read the deliverable before hand for giving us a more robust feedback.\r\nOthers: The One Page Memo, I never understood the role of that homework within our learning process. We did not have a proper feed back from the Instructor on HOW to make an effective memo, good/bad practices on writing memos. ",
            "\u00a0The course was more theoretical than expected. It vastly improves with the guest lectures and student presentations. You will learn a lot from the other students in this class and the success of the course very much depends on having engaged classmates. \r\n\r\nOne way to improve the course would be to have clearer feedback from the professor about our final projects, sooner in the semester. ",
            "\u00a0The course is extremely interesting and necessary for FES. It is a unique course where resilience can be deeply analyzed with a systems approach. The topic is so complex that it can be approached from so many aspects it is difficult to say what is the best one. Here are some of my comments on how to make the best out of such a wonderful class.\r\n\r\nThe first half of the semester was very heavy on theory, some of the readings were repetitive and there could have been more group discussions. \r\n\r\nThe second half of the semester was very student driven. This had both pros and cons.  We got to learn from our peers and cover a wide variety of topics. However, we did not go into depth into any of the topics, and given that resilience is such a complex issue it seemed to me we that were barely scratching the surface on many of the issues.\r\n\r\nIt was great to meet the invited lecturers who had different careers since this allowed us to become aware of all the potential jobs that exist related to resilience.\r\n\r\nThe reading responses were due Friday nights and this was very inconvenient, since it was very difficult to be able to do the readings from Tuesday (and some days even Wednesday) to Friday considering we also had other activities and commitments for other classes during the week. It would have been better to have more time to organize our readings.\r\n\r\nBuilding on another systems thinking course, a potential approach to make the analysis more focused and less scattered could be for the students to take on the analysis of a particular context/country/region/project for the second half of the semester and each week dive into a particular topic such as water/food/gender etc. In my view it is interesting to see how the concepts apply to projects and policies. And with this evaluate a resilience problem from all the angles, and with a systems perspective. Alternatively, we could have evaluated cases of resilience projects or resilient practices and cases of \"maladaptation\" or policies that did not view the entire system and made the system more vulnerable (sort of lessons learned).\r\n\r\nOverall, I believe everyone in the class had an impressive experience and it would have been very valuable to be able to have longer discussions on the readings.  I would have appreciated more in-class discussion since I prefer this type of exchange in comparison to the readings and response system.\r\n\r\nRegarding the one-page midterm, the description of the assignment was minimal and very broad. The objective was unclear and the guidance on what was expected was poor. Regarding the final paper, it would have been helpful to receive more guidance or feedback on the proposal and the analysis. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Applying theories of resilience to different important themes (climate change, disaster response, food production, etc).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Despite emphasis on small class size and use of application process to choose breadth of student backgrounds to foster discussion, very little time each lecture was given to student discussion. Although the class was only 20-25 people, I did not feel like I knew my classmates by the end of the semester because we mostly spent each week listening to Alark or a guest speaker lecture. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strength was the student engagement - from the weekly forum to our in-class openness to new ideas to the student-led presentations, I so enjoyed learning from and challenging one another.  The key weakness of the course was the lack of feedback on our final paper, which seems to be lumped work-wise toward the end of the semester with less feedback than our group (at least) had hoped for with the outline in October. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- Most of the readings are interesting and useful \r\n- The presentation of guest speakers \r\n- The second part of the course is student-led \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- The class is too long, I recommend having 2 sessions per week instead of 1 very long-session, especially considering that the class has a heavy load of presentations. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: discussion of definitions of resilience. Practical applications, guest speakers. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: overlapping readings. Could have used even more practical applications, ",
            "\u00a0The strength was that it gave me a critical lens on how to consider buzzword terms such as \"resiliency\" and I became more familiar discussing the language used by intergovernmental organizations. \r\n\r\nThe weakness was in the instruction, which was disorganized and scattered, and the heavy emphasis on theoretical concepts with little connection to practical application. There was also almost no discussion time in a course filled with individuals who had a wealth of knowledge on the subject, which was highly disappointing, especially for a three hour class. It would be great if the theory could be limited to the first two classes, and student discussion wasn't forgone every time the instructor lost track of time. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength is that this class allows for plenty of time to think about a very complicated concept. We explored it in depth, through theoretical papers and models, practical examples, and papers and projects that added further analysis. Students have plenty of freedom to talk about examples and places that interest them. While there is a focus on developing countries, there is plenty of space to talk about the US and other developed countries as well. Class discussions and final papers provide time for further reflections of topics of individual interest. I think this flexibility really helped students coming from different backgrounds learn what they wanted to related to resiliency. ",
            "\u00a0Too much lecture heavy in theory, more time could have been given to the discussions ",
            "\u00a0The guest lecturers added value to each session. \r\nThe structure of weekly responses to readings and to class mates was informative and kept us engaged in material. I enjoyed learning about everyones experiences through student led class discussions also. We were given the freedom to talk about these topics through our own lens. \r\n\r\nIn terms of weaknesses, there was no real feedback given on deliverables or class discussions/presentations etc. "

            "\u00a0Be prepared for last minute changes and a lot of theory in the beginning and then a considerate workload after the midpoint of the class. ",
            "\u00a0This course sounds amazing on paper, but it's not. I would said it's almost identical to the SDG Goals and Implementation course, but it has a small section on complex adaptive systems. ",

            "\u00a0The class covers very important topic areas and is pretty well organized, but the first half of the class is very theoretical and sort of all melds together. I wish the theory could have been shortened to make more time for additional guest lectures and student-led presentations. ",

            "\u00a0I highly recommend taking this course, but be prepare to do a lot of homework. I really liked that the course help me to improve my critical thinking  and communication skills. ",
            "\u00a0If you are looking for a theoretical course on systems thinking you might find this useful. If you want to learn about applied solutions to resiliency in the developing world, this course is likely not for you. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great class to take whether you are new to resilience or have experience working in it. While it is focused on developing countries, there is plenty of space to talk about the US and other developed countries. The class gives you plenty of time to explore resilience in depth, and in the context of certain places or examples you are interested in. It is a great balance between theory and practice. Be prepared for lots of theory in the first half, but the second half balances it nicely with a practical focus. It is a great class! ",
