            "\u00a0I think the range of content was very well thought out and structured nicely. The lecture notes provided were extremely helpful, but sometimes I felt that they didn't exactly match up with homework problems or the workshop questions. \r\nAlso, the quizzes were sometimes difficult having just learned the material and sometimes was not on material learned the last lecture so sometimes I felt that I didn't know how I should be preparing for them. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the amount of help that you can receive. It's really up to how much work you put in. There's help everywhere.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not really any weaknesses. It's math.... ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - review sessions, midterms accurately repressed what we learned, lecture notes, ITZIAR \r\nWeaknesses - section not very helpful, quizzes too hard, final too long and hard ",
            "\u00a0I think workshops are unecessary. ",
            "\u00a0Going over homework should be emphasized more. Homework should also relate to more of the material taught in class. How the class is taught with the packets made for you is perfect way to teach in my opinion. Quizzes for spring semester were way harder and should be easier. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: instruster was great. Her notes allowed for a great understand of the concepts.  Office hours helped a ton and gave me a deeper understanding\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: test preparation. Tests contain very few questions from class and are difficult to understand from the info given in class. I often found pieces of questions to be random and more complicated then what learned in class making it difficult to do well on them ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are definitely the teacher and her lecture notes, she and they were extremely helpful ",
            "\u00a0Strength: This course effectively teaches students Calculus 1 and how to use in real-world contexts.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Problem Sets, Quizzes, ULA Office Hours\r\nThe quizzes in this class are much more difficult compared to the practice problems we do in class. In Math 110, you can ace the quizzes so long as you go over the lectures and the problem-types within them. But the quizzes are just plain unfair. I did very poorly on all the quizzes despite spending a lot of extra time reviewing class material and practicing problems. You cannot expect students to solve an exam-level problem in 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nThe office hours for MATH 111, unlike MATH 110, were very frustrating to deal with. ULA Office Hours only run Monday-Thursday when last semester they ran every day of the week. I understand that these office hours should be held on days when a decent number of students show up. However, this prevents people from completing problem sets early if they have a conflict. There were many times when I grinded psets out last-minute simply because no one was available at night on Fridays or Saturdays.\r\n\r\nThe problems sets themselves also need to be looked at. The question numbers and sections must be posted ahead of time so responsible students can complete them early. Also, there must be a Canvas notification sent to all students immediately after the problem sets are released. That way, students looking to get ahead in the class can do so without waiting a few days to start. Additionally, students who work in groups have a significant advantage over students working alone. The class is dominated by athletes and none of them wanted to work on psets with me. To make matters worse, the non-athletes that I asked did not want to work with me either. I recommend that the Professors randomly organize study groups at the beginning of the semester to give students a support network if they want it. "

            "\u00a0Yes. As someone who didn't have a strong pre-calculus, calculus background coming into the class, this was a great class that integrated concepts from both and combined them in a way in which they facilitate each other. I learned a lot through this course and gained confidence in myself as I felt that i was lagging behind other Yale students because my high school's math department was not well developed. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, you should know this concept of breaking stuff down. ",
            "\u00a0yes - it's a nice way to learn calc at a manageable pace. I liked the amount of resources available to study for exam. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course because it gets you to a very decent basic math level. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, students looking to become engineers should take. Ones who struggled in high school with calculus should take too. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, with this teacher ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this course if you plan on pursuing a STEM Major and have not taken Calculus in high school. Other than that, don't waste your time. "
