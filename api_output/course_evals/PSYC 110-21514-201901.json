However, there were serious problems with the content taught in the class, both in terms of its accuracy and its relevance. In terms of the former, it must be noted that psychology is a scientific field like every other, and its legitimacy is totally compromised when the conclusions of the discipline are contorted to gel with whatever positions are politically, socially, or culturally dominant. We must determine first determine what is true and subsequently revise our folk conceptions of human behavior to accord with this true, not the other way around. I fear that this class did not do this effectively. In controversial topics where psychological science has nonetheless generated pretty clear conclusions (the nature of intelligence, gender differences as a product of culture or nature, etc.), this class did an inadequate job of sticking to the science in spite of what is politically hip. This is by no means easy to do, but it certainly must be done nevertheless if a scientific discipline is to take itself seriously. Additionally, this class seemed to have something of an identity crisis in deciding whether it was an Intro Psych class or a generic version of Laurie Santos's \"Psychology and the Good Life.\" In trying to be both, it never quite became either. \r\n\r\nAll too often, when the class should have been learning the basic foundations of the psychological discipline, we were too busy being told that sleep is good, stress is bad, and that studying social phenomena with a gender binary renders the information of the study \"outdated.\" The opportunity cost of teaching this information is high.

Also, at times the lectures are completely disconnected from the textbook chapters we are supposed to read with the lectures so it can be a little disjointed and make retention of the textbook knowledge much more difficult.

This makes learning in class more of a challenge because connections are only being made mainly through the textbook. Of course, having the textbook reinforce lectures is expected, but having the occasional rushed, disjointed lecture does not make lectures seem very necessary other than for taking specific facts that could be found in the slides. Most lectures were fine in how things were explained in details, so again, this mainly applies to certain lecture days that felt rushed. ",

However, because it was an introductory class, I felt that we didnt really go into enough detail for any of the topics. The conclusions of some of the studies we learned about seemed very overarching and without enough specifics to know the conditions under which they are actually true. Also, sometimes the lectures moved WAY TOO FAST, and it was impossible to keep up.

Are we able to think critically about implicit bias, about the broken window theory and connect it to our lives at Yale, New Haven and the world around us? or are we just puppets who need to fit out the right bubbles? I figured out the formula for this class early on. the exams were very predictable and honestly boring and lazy on the part of the instructors.  Why not test us like the intellectuals that we are instead of teaching us to memorize random words and meanings? Teach us to think critically about Yale and the world, our future depends on it. ",

Marvin Chun was an amazing lecturer who had an infectious passion for the subjects that he was teaching. The guest lecturers were also a very interesting aspect of this course, as they brought in different viewpoints and talked about various issues from the standpoint of a specialist. The breadth and depth of topics that the course covered allowed for a comprehensive, yet interesting introduction to psychology. For me, the experimental part of the course seemed somewhat unnecessary. Specifically, I believe that this part of the course did not offer a substantial understanding of the reasons behind the experiments or the specific nature of the experimental setups. I did not feel that I learned from participating in these experiments. Rather, I felt as a subject that was \"used\" for the purpose of research without that actually adding to my learning within the spectrum of the course. Furthermore, the papers may at times have seemed disjointed from the topics that were covered in lecture, and the fact that we had no clear outline of how to write a paper in psychology within lecture, certainly created this environment of ambiguity when it came to the assignments. I acknowledge that an outline for how to structure a paper was available to us online; however, that does not compare with an overview from the instructor during lecture. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was well organized in the logistical sense. The relationship between the Professor, TFs, classroom participation (PollEV), and the lab participation process was all very smooth. However, the curriculum was not very well organized. It was unclear how the topics in each lecture related to each other, and there was not a clear central theme to the class. Also, it was incredibly difficult to know how to study for the exams, as there was a lot of information from the textbook that was tested but not taught in class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: fun interactive in-class polls to demonstrate key psych concepts, lectures based on empirical evidence/studies that augment textbook material\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes lecture material was not organized in a clear and logical manner, which I guess is a result of not following the book "

It is, however, a bit more work that you might expect, just because textbook readings were a lot.

The material is mostly really interesting, and Professor Chun makes it relevant to our everyday lives; people want to come to lecture. The readings take, on average, 2-3 hours per week, so it's not that much work. There are three 2-3 page papers and 3 midterms. There is a fair amount of memorization to do for each test, but it's definitely doable; overall, it's a relatively low workload class. ",

            "\u00a0I really wanted to love this class. However, it didn't meet my (admittedly lofty) expectations for a number of reasons. First, the lectures. I was expecting to be blown away. On the first day of class, Prof. Chun teased us with a lineup of all of the superstar faculty we'd be getting guest lectures from that semester, from Laurie Santos to Peter Salovey. And on the days we didn't get guest lecturers, we'd have to settle for a world-renowned neuropsychologist and the dean of Yale College. However, the guest lectures varied wildly in quality. It was almost absurd. Some of them were phenomenal. Salovey's, in particular, was the best lecture I've ever watched in my entire life. Others were snore-inducing. In the middle of this wide, wide spectrum was Prof. Chun. Although he was a good lecturer, it became clear over the course of the semester that his decanal duties were affecting the quality of his lectures. In fact, he admitted it, saying, \"It doesn't feel like it used to,\" and then blaming it the slides that he posted before class. Sorry, honey, it's not the slides, it's you. Regardless, it was overwhelmingly apparent that he cared about us and wanted us to be wow-ed by psychology. Which brings me to the assessments. I don't think the assessments were reflective of the spirit of the class at all. The exams were all about memorizing studies and vocabulary terms, which is fine, but is that really what Prof. Chun wanted us to take away from the class? A bunch of vocabulary terms that we'd forget as soon as we walked out of the exam room door? I doubt it. Finally, the order of the lectures really needs to be revamped. Save Salovey and Santos for last. I feel like we hit the best of the class a month in and the rest of it was just a slog. ",

It's also just a very interesting subject that is relevant to everyday life, so I would recommend that everyone take into psych. We had three short papers this semester (500-800 words) that were focused on a topic and research based so the more you engage with research the higher grade you would get. The lab requirement was the biggest nuisance - you essentially had to attend/participate in 5 hour-long studies throughout the semester.

It was a great experience, and I learned so much about a subject I had never been interested in before. This class actually made me reconsider my MCDB major... It was great. Please take it. 10/10 would recommend. ",

It will definitely help if you have some psychology background because the class is curved. If grades may stress you out, then this is a great class to credit/D/fail because the lectures are wonderful but the tests and grading system can be a source of stress. ",
            "\u00a0Would definitely recommend. I always looked forward to going to lecture. Material was always interesting, lots of awesome guest lecturers, and Marvin Chun was great at tying what we learned in class to current events. The class is kinda like reading Snapple caps for a semester ",

Work involves 3 short paper assignments, 3 exams--it's nice that they aren't cumulative--and the requirement of gaining 5 credits by either participating in or observing psychology studies, or writing supplementary papers.

Its nothing you didnt know before really, its just more stuff of the same basic Psych info weve learned a thousand times, Stanford prison experiment, amygdala and Pavlov. ",

Psychology can be applied to your daily life all the time, and it is also just cool to understand peoples minds and behaviors.

            "\u00a0Nope! This course taught me virtually nothing, it was just a platform for Dean Chun to spew his own views and opinions. I hardly studied for the third midterm and just picked the most \"PC\" answers for the multiple choice and got above the average... ridiculous. ",

I had some inkling that I might be interested in the mind, but after taking this class, I realized I definitely am. So, for anyone who is on the edge or hesitant about taking it, I think they should definitely go for it. ",

I feel that this course provides students with a very interesting, holistic, and comprehensive understanding of psychology, while it is fundamentally enjoyable and interesting in every sense. The instructor is amazing and he does a great job in making sure that the core theme of the course (that we are all psychologists and that psychology is relatable) is constantly underlined and outlined in lectures. There are always interesting examples that are used to frame specific psychological principles, something that adds to the interest that the course elicits. ",
            "\u00a0I don't know. I will be taking cognitive science next year, and based on what I've heard I wouldn't recommend this class to anyone who is on the cognitive science track because it covers many of the same topics as intro to Cog Sci, but to a more shallow depth. ",
