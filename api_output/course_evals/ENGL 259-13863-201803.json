            "\u00a0Character development, world building, dialogue, written timing, and others. \r\n\r\nOverall, a great skill set class when it comes to YA writing and content. ",
            "\u00a0You develop your own plot for a YA novel and write the first few chapters. This was a unique and challenging experience as far writing classes at Yale goes as you spend a lot of time developing one project. The readings were excellent and ranged from The Golden Compass to the Hunger Games.  The best part of class  was the workshops, pechakucha (story idea presentations),  and discussions of the readings: it was great to hear the classes thoughts and learn about experience other people's stories. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write better fiction, especially in regard to pacing, dialogue, and voice. I also learned how to actually write a couple chapters of a book, make suggestions for others' writing, and revise my own work. ",
            "\u00a0So much about writing. Practical stuff. Deadlines. How to make a plot move. Jake is a fountain of writing information and advice and its all really to the point and matter of fact and thats important. ",
            "\u00a0Got to practice writing for Young Adults and reading a lot of YA Fic. ",
            "\u00a0In this course, I developed my ability to create a well-crafted narrative arc and explore a world through creative writing. Additionally, the course focuses on studying and deconstructing narrative techniques used by successful YA authors through a series of text studies. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I come from a more technical writing background which I've worked for years to develop a strong skill set for. This course was a great overview, but could use some deeper technical dives - a week on JUST character development; a week on JUST dialogue; etc. And it would be great to study, say for instance, dialogue from a plethora of writers, even outside of YA, to formulate a better understanding of the literary skills as a whole. ",
            "\u00a0There are a lot of strengths, including the office hours, discussions, readings, pechakucha and workshop format. For weaknesses-- the syllabus was very teen-male POV heavy, especially at the beginning \"Voice\" section-- I'm sure there are awesome books that could be added that can showcase female voices.  Furthermore, it would be nice if assignments were not due on Sunday at 1pm. I also think there could be a bigger turnaround window for providing chapter feedback, as less than 24 hours to read three stories complete and complete thoughtful feedback responses is a lot for people who have stuff to do on Sunday. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- Super fun and welcoming environment. Students from all different backgrounds and majors were able to come together and help each other with their writing. I loved reading other students' stories and hearing their thoughts on my story. I had basically never done creative writing before the course but it ended up being totally fine. Jake Halpern is a super cool guy. He bought us coffee every week and was available for office hours each week to discuss our stories. The class was amazing and I was always excited to go even though it was at 9:25 on a Monday.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- None that I can think of. At first I was weirded out that Jake had office hours at Maison Mathis but it was actually totally fine once I went. You don't have to buy anything there. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: it was very engaging and everyone genuinely cared about their projects. Jake Halpern is an enthusiastic instructor and discussion leader. Level of investment was high. \r\n\r\nWays it could be improved: honing the reading list and sharpening book discussions so that readings always feel worthwhile. ",
            "\u00a0This course was extremely fun and entertaining. It was very cool to get to write and read young adult fiction while also learning about what elements make up a good story. ",
            "\u00a0The format of the course is great. Its a good balance of discussing published YA books and student work. I think I learned some strategies to be a better creative writer. Office hours were very helpful too and Jake helped us get our thoughts in order and bounce around ideas for our final work. \r\nThat said, the selection of books was not great. I dont think we were reading the best quality YA that we could. Hatchet, for example, is not a particularly good book and yet we spent half a class discussing it. The books were primarily targeted to a male YA audience and almost all of them had male main characters. It was a shame because there is so much good YA out there and we didnt read much of it.\r\nI also think that our assignments were too short. At the end of the class, we turned in 5000 words of a YA novel and it was quite limiting. We couldnt really get into a story with so little space to do it. ",
            "\u00a0Great readings and well structured classes. Even 9:25 couldnt make the class boring/a pain to get to/dull. It was a good size class and I definitely felt like I had Jakes full attention, as I think everyone did. Assignments were well balanced and interesting but not overwhelming. ",
            "\u00a0I think reading a book a week was really great and I think Jake is great at giving feedback, and his exercises help in the development of ideas and story. ",
            "\u00a0The professor has a very firm grasp of plot and world building. Expect to expand upon those skills throughout the course.\r\nAdditionally, your work is consistently workshopped and peer reviewed in a healthy, open environment that encourages creativity and risk taking in your work.\r\n\r\nThe amount you get out of the course corresponds directly to the amount of preparation you put in. The workshop setting rewards those who do their readings and put time into their chapters and revisions. However, if you don't put in the required work and come to class with less than your best effort, you won't be making full use of the opportunities this course provides. Luckily, the professor and coursework is fun and it is easy to get immersed in the work. "

            "\u00a0Yes - for anyone interested in creative writing, or an interest in YA literature, this course is excellent. I really enjoyed it, and Professor Halpern as a teacher. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It is so much fun, Jake is really funny and nice, you get to read some incredible YA books, the discussions are great, and you develop your own novel. What's not to like? ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Truly a joy and one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. You don't need to have experience with creative writing to take this class, but if you already have a creative writing background you will still learn a lot. The books we get to read for this class are also really fun, and the class discussions are interesting. Take it!! ",
            "\u00a0Yes I really recommend this course. It was so funthe class got close and everyone genuinely cared about their stories and helping to improve/hone everyone else's, even to the point that we often forgot we only needed to write two chapters for the course requirements. I looked forward to this class each week, which was a feat for a Monday 9:25 course. Oh, and Jake brought everyone coffee every week. He also had us over to his house at the end of the course to celebrate, which was lovely.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I'd be wary of is the group you take this with. Our crew was awesome, but if the students taking this aren't into it or getting along, it might not be as great as this was. \r\n\r\nOh, and we went on a small field trip the first day of class (!) ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to anyone. We had a diverse group of students from all different majors and everyone enjoyed the class. It is low pressure and fun, but you also learn a lot and sort of get to re-live your childhood. ",
            "\u00a0Its a great course and very enjoyable. While theres a lot of reading and commenting on classmates work every week, none of the assignments are particularly onerous if you enjoy writing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Even if you dont write, you should try and take this. But especially if you are interested in writing - Jake is a gem and youll be lucky to have him in your professional life. Theres so much to get out of this class - its always different, exciting, and entertaining. Where else can you have opinions about kids books that are actually taken seriously? And where else can you come up with a crazy idea that turns into a real first and second chapter of what could be a real book? You should really really really take this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yep, I thought it was a ton of fun and I'd definitely recommend it and I appreciate the enforced opportunity to write. ",
            "\u00a0Strongly encourage. It was an absolutely fantastic experience. A pleasure to be in class, and extremely useful if you are interested in YA Writing. "
