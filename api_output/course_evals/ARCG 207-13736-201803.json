            "\u00a0I learned how to make 3D models of objects using AgiSoft Photoscan. I learned about fraud, forgery, and major international issues in cultural heritage. I learned about the decision making process in a museum, and the factors conservators should take into consideration when planning an exhibition. I think of this course as \"museum studies.\" ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the general methods and considerations of preservation through specific examples. ",
            "\u00a0This course opened my eyes to a new side of Art History that I had never considered before - the preservation and conservation of cultural heritage, whether that be a painting, a building, a style of art, a piece of social history, etc. We learned about the relationship between tangible and intangible cultural heritage and how to preserve and promote both. More than any specific details, this course taught me to see the bigger picture of how art or other pieces of a specific culture can represent the heart and soul of a group of people, rather than just looking at the brushstrokes on an oil painting or the carving of a Roman column. ",
            "\u00a0Exposed to many different topics within cultural heritage ",
            "\u00a0I've always been interested in issues concerning cultural heritage but this class showed me so many new angles that I didn't realize exist. It was a mind-opening experience! ",
            "\u00a0I gained an appreciation for cultural heritage outside of my own, Western, American heritage. This course introduced me to new ideas and concepts of art and value. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the various aspects of preserving cultural heritage, from the technical details to the societal decisions. I was particularly fascinated by the guest lecture on art crime and the scientific methods of detecting forgeries. ",
            "\u00a0I learned what cultural heritage was and a lot of the terminology involved with preservation efforts. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about different methods for preserving cultural heritage, ranging from physical conservation to digital preservation. I learned about increasing public access to information, fakes and forgeries, and aspects of museum curation relating to object preservation. "

            "\u00a0The professor is a huge strength of this course, Stefan is amazing! He has had so many experiences within the cultural heritage community and is an extremely accomplished conservator. It was wonderful to hear about his work from him. The guest lecturers were also a highlight, some were more engaging than others, but the variety of topics they spoke on was really interesting and enjoyable to listen to. The final project was a big highlight, you had a lot of freedom to do something really neat. The museum game was fun too. ",
            "\u00a0The class is really interesting and engaging -- the guest lectures are incredible and Professor Simon is a really good lecturer. My only issue is that I had some trouble coming up with a final paper topic to fit the guidelines, because I didn't feel like we had learned any tangible skills with which to analyze a situation by the time of the proposal. ",
            "\u00a0I loved that we had lectures from both Prof Simon and from people all around the world who were experts in their various fields of preserving cultural heritage, such as art detectives, museum directors, art conservators, and many others. The course didn't have a lot of work outside of class other than reflecting on the lectures, so we were just able to enjoy the information and discussion rather than stress about it. It was a little difficult sometimes because many of the guest lecturers visited over skype from around the globe, but since this was also one of the best parts of the class, it is easy to forgive the technical difficulties. ",
            "\u00a0This course was one of my favorites at Yale. I got to hear from not only our incredible professor but also from experts around the world. It was a great privilege to be able to have all those incredible people talk live to us. Professor Simon has the best connections! ",
            "\u00a0The course's main strength is Professor Simon and his long career of engagement with the preservation community. The many, incredible guest lecturers he was able to bring to speak to us were outstanding and a real privilege. We were able to hear from experts in so many diverse fields the course really was unlike any other I've taken at Yale. The one weakness of the course is that the content is disparate week to week and the final project is very open-ended. The course could be improved by adding more structure to the arc of material covered. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the guest lectures every seminar. They were interesting and gave real-life insight into people working in various fields of heritage preservation. The course could be supplemented by a more concrete course structure, readings, and material outside of just guest lectures though. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting lectures and guest lecturers but I the class had little organization so I didnt learn that much - just a lot of specific information from lectures. ",
            "\u00a0I really loved the fact that there were so many different professors who came in (either physically or skyped) to speak to us about their area of expertise.  This course was very different from other seminars that I've taken at Yale in this respect. I think that I would have liked to expand the topics included in this course to include combatting cultural genocide of ethnic minorities, and I would have liked to branch out more to include more examples of non-Euro-centric examples of preservation. I loved the day that we spoke about modern engagements of cultural heritage in Mexico and was curious about how other non-European countries are engaging their cultural heritage today through modern art and methods.

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in museums. This is a really wonderful course to learn more about curation and modern issues in the cultural heritage world. I wouldn't think of this as sustainable preservation, think of it as \"museum studies.\" If listening to lectures from various people affiliated with the art world and conservation is interesting to you, take it. (Lectures on stone conservation, frauds and forgery, forgotten massacres & collective memory). This course really runs the gamut in terms of topics and the quality of the guest lecturers varies, but they are all eminent in their fields, and Stefan is so fun! It is a low work load course, but you can make the final what you choose of it. The final project is a great opportunity to learn some new skills and dig into something new. ",
            "\u00a0The class is super interesting -- every class is basically half guest lecture from a really interesting person in the field and half lecture on general techniques/considerations from the professor. It's pretty low workload except for a 10-15 page paper at the end, and only meets once a week. Except for the paper, it honestly sorta feels like you're auditing a class, or attending a series of guest lectures. Really really interesting, really low workload. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course! Prof Simon provides a very relaxed and fun environment. There is not very much work, so you're just able to enjoy the class and engage with the information. It was so interesting, especially coming from an Art History background, to see this other side of museums, art, and culture that I had never really understood before. We heard from so many experts in their various areas of preserving cultural heritage from all around the world, which was absolutely incredible. If you're looking for an arts-oriented Anthropology class, definitely take this. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely recommend! Prof Simon is really wonderful, enthusiastic, and knowledgeable. The class is really chill and fun while also very engaging and interesting. The professor brings in a guest speaker every week either online or in person, so you get to hear directly from people involved in the field. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to everyone. You will learn so much about art crimes, how to deal with cultural heritage and why all this matters. Everything is super relevant and Professor Simon is probably the best person to talk about this, in the world. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. It is a great primer if you are interested in working in a museum or in the fields of archeology, sustainability, or cultural preservation. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course! It covers a fascinating and niche subject that's incredibly relevant to society today! ",
            "\u00a0It was an interesting class and I got to research something I was interested in for the final paper. Take the class for low work but the lecture is long and hard to get through sometimes (there is also a participation grade). ",
            "\u00a0I think that this course is a good introduction to cultural heritage preservation and museum curation. I had no previous archeology experience and found it very easy to follow this course and learn from Professor Simon and the guest speakers. ",
            "\u00a0I woke up every Friday at 8:30AM for this class and never once fell asleep. Brilliant material and superb teaching. My friends were tired of hearing me say the word \"heritage\" by the end of this semester. Overall a stunning course, would recommend to anyone. "
