            "\u00a0I learned more about art through the forms of words and pictures. Additionally, I learned about how to make my own compositions and projects in meaningful ways to demonstrate my knowledge of the topics. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the vocabulary when speaking about art and about what thought goes into a good art piece. ",
            "\u00a0Because of this class I developed a new appreciation for abstract art, I learned the importance of contextualizing pieces and the techniques you can use to incorporate language and text into an art work. ",
            "\u00a0I developed the ability to discuss artwork in an open classroom setting. Originally, I felt challenged to share my thoughts on art, but after this class, I feel as though I've gained the confidence to make and talk about art. ",
            "\u00a0This course really challenged me to think differently and creatively about different prompts. ",
            "\u00a0Through this course, I developed the ability to see art and, to a certain extent, the entire world in a very different way. I was a hardcore STEM student, and I appreciated art only from afar. This class taught me to look at things with a finer eye for detail and nuance than I ever did in the past. I began to appreciate smaller details in life, and sometimes, it became nice to simply look at the world around me with a wandering eye, taking it all in. I also developed a stronger vocabulary for discussing works of art in general, and I felt like I could have a fairly intellectual conversation about a piece by the end of the course. Obviously, a good deal of the course also dealt with producing art, and I grew from novice doodler to semi-pro doodler by the end of the course. A person with any level of artistic experience could grow immensely by taking this class. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to look at art -- this class was a great starter to understand the ways to understand or engage with a work of art. While I'm not even close to fully understanding the basic concepts or fundamentals of art, I learned about the ways that artists use colour, pop culture, words, lines of sight (or any number of things) in their work. I also really loved this class because it required weekly assignments, and the deadline forced me to just create, which was incredibly important because I learned that a work evolves and changes its form when you get started on it. It was a really empowering to be able to create things and to think about how to represent/evoke certain feelings without being crippled or fixated by your lack of technical capabilities. ",
            "\u00a0W&P was one of the most unique courses I've taken at Yale so far. It's a really chill and laid-back class in which you can really bring in so many perspectives talking about so many different things. We have really interesting (and sometimes confusing) readings; one of the most memorable ones was Susan Sontag's writing about the extent of the power of graphic imagery to what extend does it desensitize us and to what extent does it motivate us to action? One of the many interesting discussions we had. Additionally, I learned how to articulate my thoughts and process of creating when presenting my art project each week. ",
            "\u00a0How to make creative projects that effectively use both words and pictures and analysis of the graphic novel and other art forms. I feel that I learned to really look at art. ",
            "\u00a0I felt that I learned about a basic framework of discussing and writing about art. As the course went along, I began to feel more confident in my ability to synthesize information and communicate ideas regarding artwork. The overall topic of words and pictures was a subject area to focus on while developing aforementioned skills. I also gained some abilities in the process of developing artwork. Although my skills in the area of creation did not improve as much as the other ones, I still found that I could take a lot away from the class. ",
            "\u00a0Through this class I was able to gain a better insight towards the connection between words and pictures, specifically with how they work together beyond simply having \"good\" words and \"good\" pictures. Both words and pictures need to work in harmony in such a way that they successfully convey the ideas of the artist. I also read many comics, so the portion of the class where we focused on them was particularly enjoyable. "

            "\u00a0The professor for this course is amazingly kind and generous when it comes to giving clear feedback that is helpful for the students. The class got very close together and the professor made this feel like a genuinely close and caring classroom. Additionally, the projects were very fun to complete and interesting as well.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness I would say is that I feel like it would be easier to have it 3 days a week for less time rather than 2 days a week for a long time. ",
            "\u00a0The professor really enjoyed the material which made everyone really engaged. The assignments where fun and made us think and learn about our topics of interest and create a good culture between classmates. We all got  to critique and discuss these assignments which was a great learning experience. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this course was very strong in welcoming new artists and giving us the tools and resources to develop the craft. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I loved this course  it was a wonderful mixture of creative critique, discussion, and just plain fun. Found the guest speaker as well as the field trip really eye-opening and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0This course pushes students to think creatively and the readings are generally very well matched with weekly assignments; however 2 hours was too long for discussions and too short for art critiques. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Readings and discussions are mostly relevant to the assignments, lots of feedback on any assignment (both from peers and from the instructor), room to explore any area of art that you want to, great field trips to NY museums and the Beinecke Library\r\nWeaknesses: Very few :) discussions can go on tangents, but this is a minor issue ",
            "\u00a0I think the brilliant part of the course was how consistently it made you produce and reflect on your art. While most of the class were not trained artists, it was amazing to see the amount of thought and effort (and genuine insight) that goes into producing various pieces, and really affirming to be able to create. The open-ended assignments helped to develop our ideas, and Professor Rodman was great about giving feedback and encouragement in the group critiques. I also really loved the readings, because I thought that they gave a great background for understanding art and for developing different ways/styles that a work can engage you. However, I would have appreciated a structure (or at least a thinking framework) that drew together the earlier readings and our exploration of graphic novels - while both were very interesting, it was a little more difficult to draw the connections between what felt like two disparate parts of the course. I would also have loved to have more time to discuss the graphic novels/comics - one thing I found talking to my classmates was that everyone was really enthusiastic about understanding more about graphic novels, and I thought that it would have been great to think about why they are so popular today, and to better understand how the process of storytelling and art comes together. As it is, though, I still absolutely loved the course, I'm just not entirely sure that it is what I thought I signed up for. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths field trip to New York! Really cool and chill professor! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses two hours twice a week felt overwhelming at times. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the readings, which were always engaging and opened my eyes to new perspectives on how to look at art. I would have appreciated greater emphasis on analysis and less on our creative project submissions. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the class were the flexible structure of the seminar and the professor. The course was well-divided between critiques, discussions, presentations, lectures, and field trips. The diversity in how information was presented really allowed us to learn the most amount of material in a short amount of time. It also ensured that students did not get bored easily. Prof. Rodman was also phenomenal; he was well-spoken and friendly. He understand the artistic level of each student and their background well enough to individually communicate with them and attempt to develop their skills. ",
            "\u00a0Projects are amazing. Up to you to decide how much work you want to put in. What you put in, you receive back. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of this class comes from the discussion, which is at its best when all students participate. The only weakness I can think of is the connection of some of the assignments to what we discussed. Although it only happened once or twice, I still believe we would have benefited having those assignments more closely linked to what we discussed on those particular weeks. "

            "\u00a0This course is an amazing freshman seminar and I would completely recommend this to any first-year. This course was fun and engaging and a very fun way to fulfill the humanities requirement, even for students not that interested in the humanities. ",
            "\u00a0I would really recommend this to anyone who has never taken an art class before because it's a great space to improve and think in a different way that you would in your other courses. ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course to another student especially if they are inexperienced in art and they are interested in exploring the field. This class provided wonderful field trip opportunities and served as a welcome break from the monotony of traditional studying. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! I absolutely loved this course. Halsey is an amazing and kind professor, and I loved seeing the heart everyone in my class put into their projects. If youre looking for a nice creative outlet with a wonderful professor and a class with low stress for the semester, I highly recommend this class. Even if youre not thinking of art as a major or wouldnt consider yourself artsy (I personally only doodled for fun before this class and am most probably going to be a STEM major), this class is very welcoming, engaging, and fun. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course for students who are looking to explore art as well as those who want to think about the relationship between words and images in artwork. \r\n\r\nDisclaimer that I would say the intellectual challenge and workload of the course is pretty high, but the professor grades you based on effort and involvement in class, so as long as you do the readings and put time and thought into your weekly assignments, you're good to go. ",
            "\u00a0I would! And if you get the chance to take it with professor Rodman, you should. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course because the workload is not too intense, and the payoff is huge. I found the assignments to be very therapeutic, and I genuinely enjoyed completing all of them. There is a good deal of satisfaction as well that comes from creating something that you can keep and hang up in your room forever. If you have never taken an art class, this class will definitely give you a new perspective on appreciating and producing art. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to explore their creative side/who wants to make and art (not just the focus on developing technique, but starting from a place of expression) in a non-intimidating and judgmental environment. With that said, this course took a lot more time than I expected --  the weekly art assignments could amount to 5-6 hours of work at a go. While I'm sure you could get it done in less time, the process of planning and executing something could still be tiring, especially on such a regular basis. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Looking for a fun first-year seminar that requires a different set of lenses and working process (i.e. creating a zine vs doing the usual readings or psets)? Choose this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It was one of the highlights of my semester. It is engaging, fun, and a great creative outlet. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, this class is great for students with limited experience in visual art. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It truly gives you the opportunity to try so many different media. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. It is a very class, and I enjoyed every assignment and discussion. I also really enjoyed taking a look at the work done by my classmates. "
