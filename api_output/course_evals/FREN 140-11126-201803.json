            "\u00a0Learned more French in this course than I have in my entire life. Among the skills I gained: the ability to understand and critically interpret French Literature, the ability to synthesize individual ideas and write about them, the ability to describe Francophone culture and cultural differences, new tenses, and grammatical skills in French. ",
            "\u00a0I continued to hone and refine my knowledge of French grammar, and I continued to expand my vocabulary. Some new grammar concepts that we learn are \"faire causatif,\" \"pronoms relatifs,\" and how to write \"discours indirect.\" We read multiple shorts stories in addition to two novels, Symphonie Pastorale and Sac de Billes. Overall, I found that my French reading speed improved considerably over the course of the semester. Even though some of the short stories that we read at the beginning of the semester were difficult to understand, by the end of the semester, I found them much easier when I returned to them for review. ",
            "\u00a0Strengthened pre-existing grammar skills, allowed me to learn to read better, and to write better in French. ",

            "\u00a0Very interesting course. Course work was clearly effective: if you do the work, you will improve in the relevant areas. Enjoyable class that teaches you a lot via multiple forms (movies, books, etc).\r\n\r\nOne improvement may be to introduce a bit of lighthearted literature: it seemed that all of our stories/books were centered on rather dark topics. From my personal point of view, including a few \"happy\" stories might be nice (but not necessary). ",
            "\u00a0Some of the recordings for the listening portions of our homework were too outdated. They were difficult to hear because of all of the background noise and the poor audio quality. In addition, the rdactions we wrote had no real rubric, so grading always seemed arbitrary. It would've been nice if Professor Koundi helped us by not just pointing out where we made mistakes in our writing, but by showing us how to better catch those mistakes before turning in our work. The rdactions always just ended up feeling like you were shooting in the dark and hoping that you didn't make as many mistakes as last time.\r\n\r\nI don't know if this is quite a weakness, but a lot of the stories we read in class were sad; many were focused around ideas like exile, suicide, death or mourning. I'm not sure if this is because that's just what Francophone literature is like, but some weeks, such heavy subject matter could be a lot to deal with.\r\n\r\nIn terms of strengths, your French will no doubt improve if you put in the work. Sometimes I wonder if such a high workload is really necessary to reap those rewards though... ",
            "\u00a0I love how small the course is. It is great to have round table discussions. We are tested quite often which is somewhat annoying; however, I see why it is beneficial. ",
            "\u00a0The professor was good at engaging everyone in the conversation and explaining grammar, but some aspects of the work were not clearly explained, and the more difficult grammatical structures were not given enough time to be understood. I thought it would be have been better/fairer to put more emphasis on writing/ have the written assignments make up more of the grade because I spent just as much time on these as on the grammar homework. "

            "\u00a0Yes. Not only does this course re-enforce the notion that French is an absolutely beautiful language that everyone should learn, but it also was just a fun addition to the day. Yes, it has a heavy workload, and meets every day. However, this makes it all the more effective at doing its job and improving your ability in French. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to improve your French, this course will do that. Just be ready to work. It's about the same amount of work as L3. In every French class I've taken at Yale, my peers have had a positive presence in class, which certainly helps when you feel discouraged after muddling through so much homework every week. ",
            "\u00a0If you took AP French in high school, this class will be very similar. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially if they have struggled with grammar/ nitty gritty parts of learning French. "
