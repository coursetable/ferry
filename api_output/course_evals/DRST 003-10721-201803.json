            "\u00a0I learned how to exercise rigorous logic and evaluate claims empirically, even if they were different from my pre-existing beliefs. ",
            "\u00a0I developed knowledge of the philosophers, but did not receive much guidance in how to writing a philosophy paper properly. ",
            "\u00a0Writing a philosophical analysis paper, which involves a close reading of the argument and then documenting the steps made by the author. By rewriting the argument, you become acutely aware of what the premises and conclusions were, and the steps, as well as the jumps made. You also get better at constructing your own arguments, and noticing where there might be jumps that you need to explain. ",
            "\u00a0The most important skill I developed by taking this course was learning to question what I read. Before, I often just read to attain a basic understanding of what the author was trying to say; now, I read more critically, questioning various assumptions and trying to test out the soundness of the arguments as I go along. ",
            "\u00a0The ability to closely read an argument and critically evaluate the argument, while presenting possible counter-claims and also embodying the mindset of the philosopher to better understand their position and arguments. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt how to think, more than anything. Reading various philosophical texts helped me see how different philosophers proposed arguments and counter arguments, and the ability to respond to them. It also made me reevaluate my opinion of a few of the ideas they speak about - if life really is inexplicable, what a soul's existence means for the body, what emotions can mean for us. I know we sacrificed content in terms of depth, but there's no end to the hours we can spend discussing these philosophers. The sheer scope of reading we had to do just showed us several perspectives; I have never done philosophy before but it was everything I expected - it was a wonderful course! ",

            "\u00a0It was a good overview of ancient and medieval western philosophy, but Im not sure so much time needed to be spent on Plato and Aristotle. Later philosophers felt rushed as a consequence. ",
            "\u00a0More structure so that we spend good amount of time on each work; due to the extensive nature of philosophy, it is nonetheless inevitable to spend extensive time discussing big works (i.e. Aristotle) and then having to rush Anselm or Maimonides. But having more detailed schedules on what will be exactly discussed during each session would be helpful! ",
            "\u00a0I understand the necessity of studying the authors that we did, but the course load was often difficult to keep up with at times. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are the small seminar size and the amount of time that all the readings cover, but I feel I could have gotten more out of the readings if we spent more time talking about them and had not rushed through everything so quickly. ",
            "\u00a0Though this course is notorious for requiring too much reading, this isn't really a problem. Most people don't actually do all the reading, and the professors even suggest that one does not need to do all the reading. But this system does expose you to a lot of ideas really quickly, and shows you how very important ideas sometimes are expressed over many pages. It acquaints you with the world of the intellectual discourse and gives you the tools necessary to take part in it. ",
            "\u00a0I think it did a very good job at balancing a heavy reading load and still ensuring that the students understood the material. The main component of this was the discussion sections, which were often great ways to confirm or ask the professor about ideas you had trouble with. In terms of potential improvement, I don't really have anything to say about the structure of the class. Perhaps adding in a couple of the Platonic dialogues like the Timaeus or Symposium would have been helpful since I often saw those referenced in later texts. ",
            "\u00a0The course does a very good job at covering some of the biggest questions in philosophy through the lens of several different philosophies. However, because of the pace of the program, there isn't enough time to do an in-depth assessment of each philosopher's views on certain things. ",
            "\u00a0The course at times felt too much like a lecture course instead of a discussion-based seminar. This is a problem with DS as a whole, but the readings were too long with not enough time to complete them fully and engage with the text in a non-superficial way. ",
            "\u00a0The weakness is that of all DS courses: too much material for not enough time. Hard to change without radically changing the program's structure. That being said, this was sometimes a strength. (If you don't like Lucretius, you worry: it'll only last a day.) The course's greatest strength is also that of all DS courses: small, seminar-style discussion of primary texts. You do, in the end, get what you sign up for. ",
            "\u00a0If I remember correctly, our professor seemed to talk more during discussions of the second half of the semester, rather than discussion being dominated by classmates. I love student-based discussion, but the majority of us had never done philosophy before, and I didn't feel like it was helping us all until he clarified. To remedy that, I wish we had had a how-to-read-philosophy bit so that we all had a general sense of the thinking skill. I feel that wishing the instructor had talked more is symptomatic of lacking pretty base level understanding, because in my other classes, in subjects I was more familiar with, the same students and style of open instruction was pretty satisfying.\r\nAlso, I do wish it wasn't underground.

            "\u00a0Yes, I would. It gave me a good basis in my understanding of ancient philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0I would reccomend this course to another student, but perhaps with another more experienced professor in Directed Studies. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely. DS Philosophy is an amazing experience. The exposure to a wide range of texts and ideas greatly expands your horizons within months of getting to Yale. The seminar setting allows for high level intellectual discussion, participation and encourages you to synthesize ideas. The frequent paper writing is quite a workload, but your writing definitely improves over the semester as you get a feeling for writing a philosophy paper. It also helps you to better organize your thoughts, and forces you to closely evaluate the argument being made. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anybody who is seriously interested in learning about the basic tenets of philosophical analysis and thought. Anybody who is uncommitted or uninterested would be miserable: there is a lot of reading and the professor expects you to have closely read the texts and formulate objections or questions. That being said, for an introduction, there is no better option. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!!! I know DS has a lot of cons, but its sheer breadth and the connections it facilitates between the three disciplines is unparalleled. I loved philosophy because of most of the reasons I mentioned, about how it made me think and reconsider some of my own beliefs, but also because doing it in conjunction with Literature and H&P helped me see the vast influence philosophers have had on several writers and intellectuals. ",
            "\u00a0As if you had a choice! (Yes.) ",
            "\u00a0I would, with the warning that one might want to prepare themselves a bit for a world of logic and argumentation. I'd say that they should not relinquish their awareness of literary style and rhetoric, or anything, but that those skills aren't perfectly suited to the angle of philosophy, and that new skills would be necessary.
