I learned a lot about how to develop a management plan for a client, which in my case was for wildlife conservation. We conducted a biophysical assessment, for which I learned how to identify understory plants, overstory plants, and soils. I learned how to read a landscape. I learned how to conduct a deed survey, a social assessment, and craft a land use history timeline for the property. We made management recommendations. And along the way, we learned and utilized many other skills that are too many to list. ",

A few things that stand out are how to learn the history of a landscape from multiple perspectives and contexts, how to tailor an inventory to the goals at hand, and how to reconcile various values/objectives/histories with each other into a comprehensive plan. The process of writing a management plan like this was really intensive and helped me gain so many skills that I'll use later on. ",

I also gained a strong baseline to develop my skills independently to assess other properties in with different biophysical and historical context. ",
            "\u00a0Many and they would escape the full scope of this evaluation. In short, I pretty much learnt everything I had set out myself to learn in terms of the many components of a land management plan, particularly in what relates to how social approaches interrelate to ecological contexts in the field. I wish there was more time for local dendrology, which is crammed-up at the beginning of the course (it could be spread out or even given little by little from day one), but even so I feel I really learnt my own, particularly in terms of families and invasives. It was an accomplishment. Also in terms learning the fundamentals of forest health assessment and of applying lessons from the Practice of Silviculture class to this one, it is really, really, outstandingit almost comes across as seamlessly integrated. While useful, the forestry knowledge was a bit too much biased on the forestry side, but that's what it is and I am proud to have learnt the basics about that tooas a natural resource manager I feel as if I did acquire a baseline to understand many management issues and to effectively communicate with other professionals in the field--particularly foresters. At all this, the course excels and pretty much met all of my expectations. ",

In addition to learning like a semester's worth of information on geology, soils, deeds, land use history, plant species, site assessments, silviculture, etc etc. in the first ~1.5 months of the class, I also strengthened skills in working with land owners, collecting and analyzing data, creating maps and figures, and compiling a large document, among many many other skills and insights.

That said, I thought I would have a lot of opportunities to learn new skills, but when push came to shove, I ended up strengthening skills I already had instead of spending time to learn new ones. Having each group member do things they already knew how to do was more efficient than having us learn new skills given the time crunch of the course. "

            "\u00a0I wished that the bio assessment and sampling methodology lectures were provided way before students begin to visit their property. A lot of students were unaware of how to measure for understory and canopy, so giving a lecture about it before would have been very helpful. I also wished that the work load was a bit less. ",

            "\u00a0I am pretty sure that this is the most challenging course at FES, but it is likewise the most rewarding. I am so thankful that I took this class. The only thing I can think of to improve the class, pick a site closer to New Haven (once the Quiet Corner mission is completed, of course). ",
            "\u00a0The course prepares you to be a professional forester or conservation planner, which itself is invaluable. However, the means to the end was, in my opinion, more challenging than it needed to be.  I (and many others agree) that this course should be broken down into two semesters. The course materials, knowledge, and skills were too compacted into a short amount of time, such that at times, we would learn the skills and knowledge after it was too latewe had passed that stage of the assessment or planning. For example, our deadline to submit our sampling design plan was October 10th, and we started conducting our sampling over the next two weeks. However, we did not learn about the pros and cons of variable-radius plots versus fixed-area plots until October 24th in the Data Analysis lecture. As someone who has never designed sampling methods for conducting a biophysical assessment, not having the skills to weigh my options between the fixed-area versus variable-radius plots was immensely frustrating.  As another example, a central component of our property's land use history was logging and managed wood lots. However, it wasn't until the very last day of being in the field for sampling that we learned how to identify stumps by species or genus... This skill would have added a lot of color to our land use history, had we had the skill at the start of our sampling... Finally, the compact nature of the course meant that students had to learn soil identification, plant identification, site classification, and stand delineation all within the span of three weeks. While this was an impressive feat and was necessary for conducting field sampling, the cramming nature of the course took away from our ability to fully absorb the content we were expected to learn. I felt less than fully prepared when launching into conducting our fieldwork, and a slower, more intentional pace would enable us to focus refine our skills before jumping to the next (or two or three).\r\n\r\nThis misalignment of timing between learning skills and knowledge and implementing those skills and knowledge (which often preceded the former or was subsequent to a hasty lesson that fails to go over all the necessary skills and considerations) was characteristic for this course. I strongly believe that this course would benefit from being taught over two semesters, to ensure that students have the necessary skills and knowledge needed to prepare them for their independent fieldwork. The course need not be evenly distributed in 3 unit increments, but perhaps learning about sampling methods, data analysis, and developing a sampling planor learning about the soil, geology, hydrology, and plant speciesa semester before could better prepare us for our fieldwork, relieve some of the intensity, and enable us to digest the content as we're conducting our assessments and recommendations. ",
            "\u00a0This management plan is a ton of work, but the class provided a good structure for getting it done. I appreciated having deadlines throughout the semester, because even though we were all still scrambling at the end, it could have been much worse. The main strength of this class is getting to work on a real property with real landowners to write a real plan that they can learn from. It's so great to get to know a place and its people to that extent, and to get to be part of their decision making.\r\n\r\nOne thing that could be changed is that the course doesn't provide much insight into the type of management plan that many of us might write in the future -- less elaborate and detailed than the ones we did for this class. I think it would have been helpful to have a small segment going over which components of what we did would be included in that type of plan, just so that we can contextualize the work of the class.\r\n\r\nAnother thing I might change is the structure of the exams at the beginning of the semester. I think a lot of us delayed starting work on our plans because the exams were so much work, and it would have been nice to integrate those a bit more somehow. ",
            "\u00a0It is great ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are: hands on experiences doing real forestry work. Weaknesses are: the actual lectures at times were not always helpful. ",
            "\u00a0It's an enormous workload and very time consuming. Prior knowledge of tree ID, silviculture, and GIS (at least map-making) would be very handy. ",
            "\u00a0Ironically, the main weakness of the course is also its main strength, which is that it tries to teach how to do a land management plan in just one semester (actually \"doing\" it in pretty much three month's time), while at the same time mixing together students with different backgrounds and expertisesome with advanced knowledge of the ecosystems and species of the context where the class is taught and the management plans are done. So, the time scope and the student composition are both the best and worst aspects of the course.\r\n\r\nIn terms of time scope, it seems rather ambitious to thoroughly study a place over just a few months, particularly in social or ethnographic terms. Rapid rural assessments in particular are increasingly linked to extractivist and colonial \"parachuting\" approaches to natural and human ecosystems, and so timing should be reassessed in those terms (I.e. by splitting the class into two 3-credit ones, see more below). Not that it cannot be done (although everyone carries on work on management plans beyond the semester), but looking back there are many drawbacks from cramming all 6 credits in a single semester while there's much to be gained from splitting the course in two (see more below).\r\n\r\nIn terms of student composition, I found it very, very enriching (to say the least) to have had the luck of being paired with experienced foresters (or foresters, which I am not). It provided continuous learning from my peers and I am sure that this went both ways in terms of other skill sets in which I had more experience and knowledge than they. However, as with the timing, there are two downsides to this. First, that it may well be that not every team had the same advantage. Second, that more experienced folk are unchallenged by reviewing stuff they already know (like local dendrology) and have few incentives to tackle new stuff (like social ecology). Moreover, in the case of Foresters, they find themselves doing quite a large amount of work for this not being a capstone for them. On the other hand, outsiders or those with different backgrounds find the experience challenging throughout. \r\n\r\nA way to go around this would be to have experienced folk arrive at the course with some sort of advance placement or to have them skip part of the course. They could be formally appointed as \"team forester\", skip part of the course credits (or do the course half-time) or otherwise spare them the lecture time, at the very least. This is just one idea, as how I would rally go around this would be to split the course in two: one would tackle general aspects of land management (or all those that apply regardless of context) and the second one would go into context-specific contents and to the actual production of the land management plan itself (and this one could be a four-credit course). The idea is two-fold: first you save some time to more experienced folk and second, you open the door to other teachers to offer the second part of the seminar in contexts other than the Quite Corner Initiative. \r\n\r\nThis second aspect addresses the most limiting aspect of the course, which is that being set in northeastern Connecticut, it greatly limits the scope of land management to a handful of goal variations among its real-life clients. There are also other management contexts in Connecticut that could well provide many different experiencesmostly coastal ecosystems and urban ecologythus splitting the course in two could cater to other instructors with a mindset  different to just forestry. My two cents. ",
            "\u00a0Different groups faced different challenges during the creation of their management plans, which the instructors dealt with fairly deftly. Perhaps a survey of past classes could be used to provide diverse timelines for students whose property owners have different objectives. ",
            "\u00a0I've debated all semester about how this class could be improved to take less of a toll on its students. I know that the workload is part of the right of passage of taking this class, but it really did come at a cost to my physical and mental health. For one, I think landowners and properties should be selected as potential projects with care, placing guidelines/restrictions on how much a landowner can ask of the (free) student (labor) and possibly how big the property is. Students can have very different semesters depending on who they work with, and it perhaps would be more reasonable to limit landowners to one or two key objectives/goals... as opposed to the ~10 that my landowner had, for a very large property. Secondly, I think it's worth considering making this course two semesters long. Logistically this could be difficult, but cramming so much in one semester limits the potential of this class. And apparently a lot of students are forced to make this class two semesters anyway, working on their management plans well into the spring semester but for no pay or course credit. This would give students more time to learn the fundamentals (instead of, for example, having to learn >100 plant species in a week). Alternatively, this course should have some strict prerequisites besides a seemingly meaningless application process. The strength of the class lies in its teaching team and the real-world experience it provides working with actual landowners. Despite the toll of this class, I learned a heck of a lot from it, and that truly is to the credit of Dr. Ashton and Jess Wikle, who clearly care a lot about their students and courses. "
