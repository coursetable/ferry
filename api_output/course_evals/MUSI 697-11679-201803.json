            "\u00a0A solid overview of the history of the complicated discipline that is ethnomusicology. The sessions in transcription also proved useful as a means of interrogating the practice while also exploring innovative approaches to the craft. "

            "\u00a0This course is generally well planned and organized. One thing that could be clearer is the prompts on writing assignments. ",
            "\u00a0This course had too many students, and too many readings for each week.  This felt like a year's worth of material crammed into one semester.  There were many interesting readings, but I felt we never really had time to address any of them fully.  Perhaps more interactive online assignments (like responses to readings on canvas) would help if the course retained this amount of material.  This would also encourage people who never participated in the discussion to voice their opinion. ",
            "\u00a0Strength of the course is serving a need for more diverse course offerings in music department, but syllabus could use some updating. The last couple weeks of the course had thematized readings (gender, recording technology), and organizing the readings from the first half of the course based on more explicit themes could also be helpful ",
            "\u00a0The course allowed you to gain a comprehensive survey of the field. The nature of of the exercises and the lectures also assisted in synthesizing this information ",
            "\u00a0Some of the early readings, while historically important, were heavy going. The more contemporary material was very interesting though ",
            "\u00a0Michael is a good teacher and does a solid job of making sure students know \"what they need to\" each session before launching into seminar discussion. Honestly, I think the class was too large, and probably should've been capped at a lower number of students. I don't mean to point fingers, but it should be said that a lot of social loafing was happening in the class. As a consequence, weekly discussion was awkward, with large silences and only a few people consistently contributing in class. "

            "\u00a0The material is fairly specific, but anyone who is interesting in diversifying their toolbox for thinking about musical methods historical must take this course ",
