            "\u00a0This course focused on close readings of philosophical texts on topics such as language, meaning, truth, etc. It covered a wide range of theories within Philosophy of Language that helped me, as a student, understand the different positions within the field. Professor Stanley also helped us question what kinds of things were at stake with the adoption of different theories. I felt the material was interesting and topical with regard to interpreting problems surrounding political speech today.\r\nIn terms of skills: close reading of philosophy, working on writing clear arguments on difficult texts, etc. ",
            "\u00a0I improved as a philosopher and writer over the course of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0This course was an excellent introduction to the philosophy of language. I developed a great working knowledge of a range of philosophers and concepts, as well as how to contextualize them in discussions. ",
            "\u00a0This is a useful survey course that covers introductory material about philosophy of language as well asa some of its advanced applications. ",
            "\u00a0So much! Metaphysics was my only prior experience with philosophy, so this was all new information. I enjoyed approaching questions of language and meaning through a philosophical lens and applying concepts from our readings to real-world examples, particularly in political speech. ",
            "\u00a0I'd like to stress that this is a PHILOSOPHY course more than anything else., and therefore I learned a lot about philosophy. I learned much from authors like Frege, Russell, Austin, Grice, etc. ",
            "\u00a0I grew in familiarity with modern philosophers of language, and gained helpful reflections and methods for evaluating political speech. The course also cultivated a keener hermeneutical sense, as I'm now better able to ask how words come to mean what they do in particular settings. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0While Professor Stanley is somewhat disorganized, he lead us through the philosophical texts through a balance of guiding questions/explanations and classroom discussion. I think his engagement with student questions and ideas really energized the class. He was also quite helpful in clarifying difficult topics up front and framing certain problems. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing professor but slightly disorganized ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: We covered a vast amount of material and I felt that I emerged with a comprehensive overview of the field. Weaknesses: I thought Professor Stanley could have been better prepared for certain lectures, e.g., Austin. I'm sure he has very deep knowledge of the material, so I would've expected a more coherent presentation of the course at times. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is the interplay between lecture and seminar style from Professor Stanley. I think it could be improved with a more direct focus on applying theory to political speech. ",
            "\u00a0I liked it. Would have liked wittgenstein ",
            "\u00a0The course has a good variety of width and depth. You can come out of it with a pretty comprehensive but also fairly substantial understanding of various fields within philosophy of language. ",
            "\u00a0Fascinating, varied reading list discussed thoroughly in class. Large volume of material, but we went into just the right amount of depth. ",
            "\u00a0Strength of this course is that you go over more philosophy of language in a semester than you typically would at other universities. But that's also a weakness because there's so much material that could be discussed, and yet we can't possibly discuss all of it. ",
            "\u00a0As someone new to analytic philosophy, I appreciated that this course blended presentation of early theories with consideration of current speech (such as in ethical arguments and American politics). Also as one new to the field, I found the pace of the class a bit disheartening at timesI would have appreciated a bit more time with some of the early texts that we considered. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course both to philosophy majors and all students alike. Any philosophy student should be acquainted both with the tools that philosophy of language deploys in examining philosophical issues, as well as the origins of analytic philosophy. Non-philosophy majors would get an excellent introduction to philosophical methodology and see the relevance of philosophy to practical issues, especially during our discussions of the role of language in contemporary politics. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to anyone looking for a leminar (lecture-seminar) overview of philosophy of language. Professor Stanley assigns interesting readings and is open to discussion on pretty much any aspect of them. ",
            "\u00a0yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Seize any opportunity to be in class with Professor Stanley! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it if you are interested in philosophy. It could be useful for a linguist depending on interests, but it really is meant more for philosophers than linguists. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, provided the student was interested in developing within the field of language philosophy. The class was well worth my time, but is oriented specifically within the fieldI originally anticipated that the class would provide more of an introductory \"history of philosophy of language questions,\" and while it did this to a degree, I found that the class presumed a familiarity with the kinds of questions it asked.
