            "\u00a0The material of the class was interesting and the progression through the topics was organized and made sense. The professor was encouraging and sensitive to feedback. More background on the major questions of the course and the vocabulary would have improved my comprehension of the readings. I also found that more than 75-100 pages of reading was too much to finish and fully understand. "

            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Franks is so kind and so good at explaining relevant issues. I thought this syllabus was really well designed such that the secondary reading really complimented the primary texts/each other. It was a fair amount of work, but if you're willing to put in the effort it's a really worthwhile class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you have a background in what the debate between teleology and mechanism is. The material is interesting and thorough, but I often found it complicated and wasnt sure which questions the readings were addressing. "
