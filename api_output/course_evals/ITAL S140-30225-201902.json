            "\u00a0Learned and mastered all of the new L3-L4 grammar and rules. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to speak, read, and write Italian at a much higher level, with more sophistication and fluidity than when I started. ",
            "\u00a0In this portion of the course, I began learning more complex rules of Italian grammar as well as how to use them. I was also given different types of assignments that gave me more freedom when it came to writing and thus allowed me to be more creative with my writing. I realized how much more complex Italian can get as well as the fact that even Italians struggle with some of the concepts learned in the course. This portion built on everything we had learned previously and helped polish our Italian. ",
            "\u00a0In this course, I developed all areas of Italian language acquisition: reading, writing, speaking, and listening.  I advanced from the late beginner stage of proficiency to an advanced stage, and I now feel confident that with continued study after the firm baseline provided by this course, I will be able to become fully fluent in Italian. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a deeper understanding of grammatical lessons we had covered before. Additionally, I further improved my conversational skills. ",

            "\u00a0strengths- interactive, engaging\r\nweaknesses-we could have done more in class practice with the grammar ",
            "\u00a0I loved how the course was set up. ",
            "\u00a0This course did a good job of keeping every student engaged with a variety of assignments, the best of which included daily discussions and individual presentations to engage in constant practice of the language. The professors also provided thorough feedback on written assignments that were completed weekly throughout the course, which was very helpful towards honing the understanding of the written language. Sometimes, however, the difficulty of the course and its formal assessments turned my focus too much towards the formalism of the language and how memorizing rules and terms would get me ahead on the assessment, instead of continuing to inspire my natural love of the language through a better understanding of the \"feel\" of the use and grammar of the language. ",
            "\u00a0This courses principal weakness was in large part tied to uncontrollable factors: the size of the class and the level of engagement demonstrated by the students.  As one who actively sought opportunities to push the advancement of my learning of Italian inside and outside the classroom, I found the course to be rather easy, and while I understand the impossibility of a course progressing at a rate comfortably tailored to the needs of each individual student, I cant help but consider this a weakness.  With fewer classmates or with classmates who shared my eagerness to learn, far more could have been accomplished.  Instead of being forced to review multiple times the same grammar topics to ensure understanding, we could have read authentic Italian news articles and other texts to facilitate advanced group discussions about pertinent topics.  Instead of frustratingly wasting time waiting for comprehension and slow answers to verbal prompts, we could have covered more detailed examples or listened to presentations on specific ideas, such as Sandros work with Dante.  I truly do understand that these issues in large part could not be helped and are not inherent to the structure of the course.  In reflecting upon my experience this summer, however, these are the areas that I realized were left with the greatest room for improvement.\r\n\r\nThe strength of the course was the engagement and patience of the two instructors.  I benefitted greatly from Sandros and Giovannis respective teaching styles, and I actually think it was more effective to have two different instructors than a single perspective guiding the classs language development.  I admired their patience and ability to explain and clarify almost completely in Italian, and I am grateful for the work they put in to quickly bring us students clear, instructive feedback and to engage us in dialogue outside the specified class time about ideas interesting to both us and them.  \r\n\r\nThis course could be improved by limiting its enrollment.  This change would allow for more concentrated attention on individual students and eliminate the need to encourage participation from each member of a large group, thereby freeing up time for longer or deeper discussions, more focused activities, and prolonged direct interaction between students and the instructors. ",
            "\u00a0There should be more opportunities to interact with locals in order to better understand the culture and practice my Italian with Italians. There should also be cultural activities to really engage with the culture, like opportunities to take cooking classes and things like that. ",
            "\u00a0No weaknesses - interesting and engaging course. ",
            "\u00a0Exams definitely got tougher when you didn't have reviews the day before ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the way in which the professors handled class participation as it forced me to actually pay attention and be engaged during class hours. I enjoyed talking exercises but I felt like they were sometimes too long when we had to hear each person speak. I think that the midterm oral evaluation about our trip to Rome was not very useful, as we had to listen to everyone repeat pretty similar stories and it was very long. The workbook was useful and I enjoyed the format of the class itself. The midterm was difficult and we also never received clear feedback or grades for our final presentations. "

            "\u00a0yes, it was a good language class ",
            "\u00a0Of course! I learned so much while having such a good time. ",
            "\u00a0Would highly recommend! ",
            "\u00a0I would warn another student that this is a tough course, with a high density of assignments and stringent expectations for tests and assessments that will make the language feel exceptionally frustrating at points. With that said, by the time one is finished with the course, they will have grown an incredible amount in their fluency and sophistication for the language, and will be all the better off for it; it's surprising how much growth the students accrued over the course of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the course is extremely helpful and it provides students with the knowledge necessary to speak and write more proper Italian than most Italian people themselves if mastered. It is definitely a big step up from the first half, but it is very rewarding and both Sandro and Giovanni are extremely helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who seeks to develop all aspects of their Italian language skills and who has the motivation to pursue these studies outside the classroom as well.  The course on its own would benefit any student, but students would be far more likely to access its full instructive potential if they are passionate and enthusiastic about the language and their own improvement.
