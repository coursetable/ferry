            "\u00a0He is really good and an asset to have as a TF.  This was my second time with him in a course.` ",
            "\u00a0Jamie was a great T.F.  He was incredibly accessible outside class and very willing to help sort through lecture topics, assignments, and the questions that arose from both.  He was very patient with answering a multitude of emails and gave really helpful feedback on assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Jamie is extremely attentive to students and prepares well for discussion sections. He communicates well over Canvas and provides insightful comments in grading. Pedagogically, he asks good questions, and he provides background lectures which are very helpful. Excellent teacher. ",
            "\u00a0Great feedback on my papers, always available to help students parse the material and understand assignments. ",
            "\u00a0He was very approachable and helpful. ",
            "\u00a0- facilitated helpful review sessions\r\n- provided important references for further research\r\n- great comments on graded assignments ",
            "\u00a0He was accessible and very helpful in suggesting ways to approach papers. ",
            "\u00a0Jamie was an excellent TF. His knowledge of philosophy and the texts Professor Jennings was working with added depth and nuance every time I attended section. His feedback and questions on my papers, and the conversations we had in section were thoughtful and satisfying, and I felt taken seriously as an academic and a student. ",
            "\u00a0Jamie did a nice job making himself available to students and providing detailed feedback on all written assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Jamie was consistently available, thorough in his grading, and offered truly helpful criticism. ",
            "\u00a0Jamie was very open to meeting outside of class and organized optional section meetings every week, which were also very helpful. He was open to answering all questions and met each student at their level. His feedback on all assignments was clear and useful. ",
            "\u00a0I was only able to attend a few sections with Jamie but I very much valued the opportunity to work through the material.  Jamie was competent with the material and handled student questions well--directing us to relevant readings and offering, clarifying or reframing questions.  He listened well to comments and questions and respectfully worked through these questions alongside us.  \r\nThe time he spent reading through and commenting on our case studies and essays was also remarkable.  That he was the solo TA reading through so many essays and taking time to comment carefully and thoroughly on each essay reflects adept and disciplined care and competency. I was grateful for these comments. ",
            "\u00a0Jamie did a wonderful job as TF. He was knowledgeable, personable, and engaging. He made himself available for questions and discussion regularly, and as students requested. ",
            "\u00a0Jamie was very adept at guiding discussion in section while at the same time letting us do most of the work, which neither of my two other TFs this semester were able to achieve. Our optional section became my favorite time of the week because it truly felt collaborative and rigorous, and filled in the gaps of Dr. Jennings' exciting but personalized spin on the material. Jamie frequently helped us to grasp the historical and theological context of Dr. Jennings' lectures, without which I would have understood much less of the course. At the same time he helped us to develop and shape our own ideas and made space for critique of the texts, not just comprehension. ",
            "\u00a0Feedback on papers was clear, incisive, and helpful. Thanks for taking the time to attend thoughtfully to our papers! "
