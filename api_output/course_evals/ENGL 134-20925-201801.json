            "\u00a0I learned so much about creative writing in this class that has been helpful in other creative writing classes as well as academic writing this semester. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about narrative and structure. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to read works of fiction and examine and evaluate them for craft, finding the plot, round characters, and strong narratives. I also learned to apply to these concepts to my own writing and edit work with these ideas in mind. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the basic craft of a work of fiction and how to use that model to improve my own creative writing. I think the skills that I learned in this course will be applicable to a number of different forms of writing I'm interested in. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided a good overview of the basic points of story structure and the basic elements of craft. I found that the most valuable takeaways were in developing tangible, concrete strategies for improving my writing in very specific areas, such as characterization, conflict, and crafting events that move the plot forward in a thoughtful way. I also found the connection between the readings and class discussion to be very valuable in elucidating what, exactly, differentiates reading \"for craft\" from reading for literature. Taken in conjunction with literature classes, the difference becomes dramatic, and that was a novel idea for me. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a ton from this class about what makes for an effective short story. Professor Sexton's model for the skeleton of a good story was really helpful, and turned out not to be too formulaic at all, even though I was skeptical at first. This class taught me a lot about writing fiction, but it also caused me to think about reading in a new way --  what storytelling is, why we tell stories, and why stories are so important to us. As an English major, looking at our readings with an eye for craft rather than meaning was really new for me, and I think it was a really valuable skill to learn. ",
            "\u00a0I developed the ability to apply different economies to writing fiction ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read fiction stories for their craft instead of for their literary merit/analysis, which is what we usually do in a classic English class. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about story structure, round characters, plot development, dialogue, and other components of a good story. We also practiced all of these in our assignments and gave and received feedback on our writing. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The work is manageable but also so helpful. As we learned things in class, we practiced them in the homework. It really helped to reinforce the things we were learning. Having some smaller deadlines over the course of the final project would have been helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The workshop environment is very positive in this course, and the class structure facilitates good conversation. A greater focus on short stories, rather than novels (though the reading list as it stands is pretty fantastic), could help students working towards the final project. ",
            "\u00a0I think one strength of the course was the professor. Professor Sexton is extremely engaging and dedicated to making his students enjoy and learn from the material. We also read some excellent pieces of fiction. Even the less excellent ones were extremely illustrative for the particular element of craft that they were meant to show. I would have appreciated a little more focus on the application of these craft elements to our own writing. I think regular meetings with the professor to discuss our work might help us better learn the material. ",
            "\u00a0I wish that we had more long term projects to work on throughout the course of the semester. Although I enjoyed focusing in on one story, I wish that we had had more practice with generating longer form material. ",
            "\u00a0The reading list is a chief strength of this class. The assigned works were each well-chosen to exemplify whatever craft element we were focusing on, and were engaging reads in general. The discussions encouraged critical thinking as we worked as a group to figure out what worked well in the texts, and the established goals of the class facilitated participation from everyone. It was genuinely fun to do the readings, assignments, and class discussions. In my opinion, the part of the course that most needs improvement is the writing assignments. One quick way to improve this would be to incorporate some kind of in-class exercise each time class meets, just to practice one particular skill for a few minutes or even just to free-write and share a bit. I enjoyed the short assignments we had, but we didn't get feedback quickly enough to incorporate it and rarely had any kind of follow-up assignments. I actually think more assignments, or longer assignments, would have been to our benefit, as I found the rigor of the writing component to be lacking a bit. It would be great to have an opportunity for real feedback and revision sometime in the middle of the course, either with a shorter, introductory sort of workshop round for an assignment slightly more significant than the short ones (to get us prepared for the workshops at the end of the course, and so that we can support each other's progress over time), or with another assignment for which we receive feedback from the professor and get a chance to revise. The workshop was one of the most valuable parts of the course, so I think expanding those writing/revising parts--even to the loss of some reading/discussing parts--would be to everyone's benefit. ",
            "\u00a0I think the biggest strength of the course was the workshop component. I learned a ton from reading and critiquing other students' pieces, which helped me to make my own piece better. Professor Sexton did a great job of managing the workshop environment. I do wish that we'd had more time to read some of the books we read for this class -- reading Beloved or As I Lay Dying in one weekend was honestly pretty tough. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the wide variety of writing styles we were exposed to but I wish we did more writing ",
            "\u00a0I really loved the second half of this class, which is essentially a writer's workshop where we share our drafts and critique them as a class. Typically, two students will share their draft per class and everyone will share positive comments and constructive criticism. The first half of the class consists of reading different books, from classics like Sense and Sensibility to more modern works like Beloved, and discussing them through the lens of a certain \"craft\" element, such as narrative arc, perspective, or point of view. While I'm glad we got to read and talk about these books, I felt that the discussions were not always very fruitful, and sometimes it felt like we were saying the same things over and over again. I would've liked to see more professor-provided structure for these classes so we don't just talk in circles, or maybe in-class partner writing time for our short writing assignments each week. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a great blend of reading others' works and getting to write our own. The best part was definitely the last weeks at the end when we read and gave feedback on each other's work. While a lot of the class was focused on the basic components of story, it would have been fun if it had included a week on genre like how to write classic fantasy, romance, or sci-fi. "

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to any students that are new to creative writing and want to learn a lot about it in a friendly, low-stakes environment!. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you want to learn how to write a narrative, I would highly recommend this course. It's a good foundation for any writing, fiction or nonfiction, that you intend to pursue. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Very participation based but great intro to taking creative writing courses at Yale ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class. If you can, take it with Sexton. He's a really fun professor who is going to seriously help your writing. Be prepared to read at least a book a week and talk about them in class, but other than that there isn't too much work. At least it doesn't feel like it because the work is always fun. It's hard to get in, but if you do, Sexton does a great job putting together a class full of very diverse, talented people that will help you and challenge you along the way. You'll talk and share writing throughout the class. It's like book club, but with writing. It's been one of my favorite classes. Take it if you can. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because Adam Sexton creates such a personal and supportive class environment. I truly developed a greater appreciation for my classmates and for the creative writing process by the end of the semester largely because of his dedication to students. ",
            "\u00a0The course offered an interesting take on writing creatively.  It viewed fiction writing as a relatively formulaic mode of writing: conflict, plot, characterization, POV, etc. etc.  But, I think in taking this approach the course is rather stagnant in the way that students can go about their writing.  The conversations about other works of fiction remain on a rather basic level as they always must come back to these few themes, and it becomes, ironically, an uncreative discussion/conversation/writing approach in general.  This in turn reflects Professor Sexton's approach to the course, which was oftentimes tired, repetitious, and at times, it felt like he was simply going through the motions of teaching.  His advice seemed to come from the delineated and point-by-point perspective of a publisher rather than a creative writing professor. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course! The atmosphere in class is relaxed, candid, and humorous, with lots of opportunity to learn from classmates' widely different experiences and perspectives (especially because many people who take this class are non-English majors, yet have cultivated tastes for a lot of different kinds of fiction!) The writing assignments are thought-provoking and enjoyable, and the workload is not very intense. I considered the readings and assignments to be my \"homework dessert\" because it was fun enough to not really feel like work! It's a great class for people who don't have a lot of background in creative writing, because it really does get down to the story basics. With that said, people with a lot of experience writing fiction may not get too much out of it. The readings are good, and workshop is always beneficial, but some might find the actual course content to be somewhat rudimentary if they have any prior training in creative writing, and there is surprisingly little creative writing actually involved. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This was a really fun class, and I also learned a lot from it. I'll take a lot from this class with me as I read more fiction. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This is a great class to start with if you know absolutely nothing about fiction writing or are a fiction writing pro. I especially loved the weekly pass/fail writing exercises. Fiction writing should be about taking risks and Professor Sexton fully embraces this through the structure of his class. I have grown so much as a writer in this class and a lot of this is due to how accessible Professor Sexton made himself as an instructor. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in creative writing, but maybe not someone who is just looking for a different kind of English class. I think the people that I met in this class made it really fun and interesting, and it's amazing to be in a space twice a week with other writers who are passionate about the same thing as me. The content of the class is exactly what you would expect it to be--how to read fiction for craft--so its not exactly mind-blowing or life-changing. However, overall, this is a really fun class, and I loved ending my Mondays and Wednesdays talking about books and thinking about future stories to write. If that's your cup of tea, definitely take this class! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. Everyone can benefit from it whether they are a brand new writer or have been writing for a long time. We covered the basics of story structure, but it never seemed boring or basic, and learned a lot by writing and reading other's writing. It was a great blend of analyzing published works and creating our own. "
