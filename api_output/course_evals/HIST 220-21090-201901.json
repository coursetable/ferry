            "\u00a0Read documents critically. ",
            "\u00a0I'm Jewish, but realized that I know nearly nothing about the History of Judaism as a religion or about Jews as a people. So I decided to take this course, and I'm very glad I did. It was at the same time accessible to someone who hadn't studied Jews or Judaism before and also got deep into the cultural, religious, and political aspects of Modern Jewish History. Professor Sorkin is super knowledgeable about Jewish History and also History in general, and the way he thinks and structures lectures makes the class very engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Writing, Lots of really interesting and enlightening things about Jewish history, and some valuable lessons about time management. ",
            "\u00a0This class provides a really detailed and fascinating overview of modern Jewish history, starting in the 18th century up until today. The readings, a mixture of primary and secondary sources, give a very clear insight into different periods in Jewish history and the religious and cultural Jewish life at the time, as well as Jews' political and civil rights and roles. We also discussed specific figures in Jewish history and read autobiographical novels in order to Gert an insight into specific life stories in Jewish history. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to critically evaluate primary materials and build an understanding of history mostly through primary sources. I learned how to use of narratives to learn history. I learned to challenge the arguments of other historians and back up my opinions. Finally, my writing improved greatly. ",
            "\u00a0I learned an incredible amount about Jewish history and also just how to look at history in general. "

            "\u00a0Well-organized, interesting content. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are Professor Sorkin and his lectures. Every class was interesting and eye-opening. There's a lot of reading but it's worth it. ",
            "\u00a0Good class. Great content, great lectures. It'd be interesting to have exams but it makes sense I guess that the FACTS aren't as important as the KNOWLEDGE. ",
            "\u00a0The readings in this class are really interesting, the class discussions and Professor Sorkin's lectures are engaging, and I got both a broad overview of modern Jewish history and specific insights into certain events and people. There are a lot of papers throughout the semester, which can be stressful at times, but they are generally short and the overall workload is very manageable. ",
            "\u00a0The classes themselves were extremely interesting, and the readings were directly tied to what we were learning about. Any confusing parts of the readings would always be cleared up in class. "

            "\u00a0Yes. Very good introduction to modern Jewish culture. ",
            "\u00a0Great course great Professor. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I definitely would. The only thing I would say to someone thinking about taking the course is that I think most people in the class were Jewish. And it definitely helped to have at least a general awareness of certain Jewish customs. Not sure how it would be for someone who has had absolutely zero exposure to anything Jewish. It might actually be even more interesting, but also a bit more difficult. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it to any other student who is interested in history and/or Judaism. Also, Professor Sorkin brings chocolate to lecture. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this class. It provides both a broad overview of modern Jewish history and specific insights into certain historical events, famous people, and important cultural texts. We also read interesting classic novels by Philip Roth etc. The class discussions are fun and intellectually stimulating and the papers allow you to engage with and really understand the meaning of the primary sources. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this class to another student. I learned an incredible amount, and the classroom was engaging without being too overwhelming. There is an awful lot of reading and writing for the course, but the professor does what he can to make all of this manageable. "
