            "\u00a0It was useful to be in dialogue with other seniors in the major digging into their own projects through the semester. I think more guidance on what each of us ought to be doing individually to keep our projects moving forward even beyond the workshops would be usefuli.e., what we should have accomplished at a given point, or guidance on how we can set those goals for ourselves.

However, everyone comes to the class at very different stages of their thesis, and it can be difficult to figure out where exactly you should be in the process. ",
