Whether it is the priest at Christ Church or a curator at the Collection of Musical Instruments, I was able to learn something new and fascinating in each meeting. "

The material culture of an abstract concept such as music can seem bizarre without any context, but taking case studies of this in each meeting gave a new basis for understanding this concept. Our meetings took place at different locations each week, giving it a sort of field-trip course. We met at the Beinecke several times as well as the music library, the musical recordings collection, the musical instruments collection, Christ church, and a couple other places as well. ",
