Aaron is an engaging professor, and I loved that we began each class with a discussion of relevant current events. Overall, I learned a great deal, not to mention it was such a relief in the semester to have weeks where class was not held. I also didn't mind the extra class sessions at all. Overall, a great class! ",
            "\u00a0I think the instructor is the main strength; he is an expert in the field and so knowledgeable. I wish the class met more often, but I understand that Dr. Kesselheim's schedule could make that difficult. ",

            "\u00a0This course was a smaller discussion course which was nice, Dr. Kesselheim's lectures were interesting, current, and relevant and provided a good overview of the FDA and current FDA activities. It would have been nice to focus a few lectures on the \"Food\" in FDA instead of just drugs. ",

Might have been interesting to have students present during a week, or for part of a class to facilitate more discussion and engage those who are not as familiar with the law side of the FDA and public health.

This is my first course at the Law school and I really enjoy it! I learn a lot and love the reading assignments! "

I would recommend this course, even if you do not have a law background, to learn more about public health law and consider how your interests are related to the FDA and laws. ",
