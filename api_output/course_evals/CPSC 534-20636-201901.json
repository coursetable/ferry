The lectures were very rich with content, and we definitely got an intuition about many things. I liked that Dr. Yang helped though of us who did not have a strong networks background to learn from the ground up. It could probably be improved by adding a stronger framework for the class so that it was very clear what we were talking about, and how various parts fit together. Sometimes I was not sure how what we were learning fit into the larger picture. ",
