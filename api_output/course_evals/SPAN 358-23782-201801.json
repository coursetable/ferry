",

            "\u00a0I really loved this course. The readings were excellent and class was always super engaging. Really a tremendous Spanish seminar. One small suggestion would be to get to the more contemporary writers quicker. It felt like we could have spent a bit less time on Pals Matos and Guilln. ",
            "\u00a0Prof Anbal was such an engaging and interesting lecturer! ",

            "\u00a0It was a great course, so interesting and you learn so much not only Spanish but also about Caribbean literature. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided covered a lot of readings, which provided a comprehensive sampling of Caribbean literature. This course also required that we attend a charla, which was a really cool part of the course. The only weakness is that there was only one essay at the end with an emphasis on tests throughout the course. I wish that there were also essays as writing shorter essays throughout the semester helps me wrestle with the text. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student who was already fairly comfortable with their Spanish abilities. The readings would definitely have been difficult for someone who wasn't already fairly fluent. But other than that, I would recommend this to anyone. ",
