            "\u00a0I can identify characteristics of Romantic poetry and poets, and make connections to poetry in other eras. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to fulfill a particular requirement because it was a fun way to knock a requirement out. ",
            "\u00a0Yes: the Yale teaching of Romanticism has a long and rich history, and this course is a demanding but approachable introduction to that tradition. Professor Brisman also has a knack for guiding discussion by using analogies and questions that open up discussion to undergraduate and graduate students with various levels of familiarity with Romantic literature and criticism without in any way oversimplifying or trivializing the passages at issue. Most sessions left me with a series of local insights and a number of larger, urgent questions of broader import. Professor Brisman's feedback on written work is intellectually generous yet highly demanding. For the graduate students, the entire course, beyond its focus on how to read poems, is something of a masterclass in how one might teach poetry and lead literature seminars. "
