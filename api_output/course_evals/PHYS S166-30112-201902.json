            "\u00a0During this course, I learnt to connect theoretical Physics with real-life phenomena, which has been very helpful since, as I can easily relate lectures with the world around me. However, from this course I would highlight how it has helped me to work under pressure, developing my time-management and organizational skills. "

            "\u00a0Most of this semester consists of fun with electronics, but the light section toward the end is not so clearly taught, both in class and especially in the lab manual. If this section were improved, students would benefit by spending more time on relevant details concerning the experiment at hand. ",
            "\u00a0Pretty solid course, I really liked my TA and he made what was required extremely clear. ",
            "\u00a0Really, it was run perfectly. There is not much that I would change. ",
            "\u00a0The laboratory facilities, along with the equipment and the TAs are some of the strongest points of the course. If I had to pinpoint any weaknesses it would be how some information asked to be written in the lab handout was repetitive and sometimes even unnecessary. However, this happened only in one or two labs. "

            "\u00a0It is probably a bit boring to take as an \"interesting\" course. Would only do it as a pre-requisite, but in my opinion, it wasn't as horrible as other people seem to say. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to another student, because it helps develop a basic understanding of circuits, which I believe is incredibly important in any STEM discipline. ",
            "\u00a0It is too basic for physics majors but very easy ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because you do not only learn to interpret physic phenomena, but gain a lot of insights and skills that are really useful for other courses. "
