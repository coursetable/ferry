            "\u00a0I learned how to visually analyze feminist art and use a feminist gaze to think through space ",
            "\u00a0This is an incredible course. The art history department is long overdue for a grounding course such as this one that completely topples the way we usually approach the discipline. I have learned so much about the feminist and queer approach to art history that I now approach all art works in a new way. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about feminism and contemporary art, and how to try and comprehend and appreciate the two and their interactions. ",
            "\u00a0I had never taken a WGSS class before and knew relatively little about the history of second-wave feminism. I learned a great deal about it through this class in the most engaging way possible, looking at art of the time. It forced me to consider who is being left out of the dialogue, even as we are making steps to be more inclusive. ",
            "\u00a0I have learned valuable skills in art analysis. ",
            "\u00a0learned a ton about intersectional feminism, and the course was wonderfully organized ",
            "\u00a0Analyzing art ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about looking and understanding contemporary art from a feminist perspective. I definitely think Yale was lacking in courses on contemporary art and am really happy this was offered. ",
            "\u00a0I learned an incredible amount of feminist theory and history through the lens of art. This art history class was great because you learned about the art, but you also learn a lot about historical context. ",
            "\u00a0This course was one of my first art history classes, so it taught me a great deal about art history methods, such as visual analysis, and it illuminated a great deal about feminism and art as well as gender theory. ` ",
            "\u00a0Overview of contemporary feminist art, visual analysis skills. Intersectional and intergenerational approach to art history ",
            "\u00a0I was extremely excited by the way the class was organized and calculated. It was very different from other art history classes that I have taken at Yale in that theory was the main driver in the studies. Each object was accompanied by an in-depth discussion of the artist and their bios which helped contextualize each object. In addition, the professor's strong emphasis on the intersectionality of feminism and including every single aspect and kind of representation, was really important and relevant. ",
            "\u00a0I was exposed to a ton of new art that I never would have had a chance to learn about otherwise ",
            "\u00a0greater knowledge about feminism, contemporary art, and the intersections of the two! ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about how to analyze art and exhibits. My writing really improved. I also learned so much about feminist and art historical theory ",
            "\u00a0I gained a wide understanding of both 20th century feminist movements, the development of feminist art history, and the works of many feminist artists of the 20th and 21st centuries. ",
            "\u00a0This course encouraged me to develop my understanding of the American art historical canon of the 20th century past the traditional white cis straight men to include queer women of color. This course not only opened my eyes to the feminist art movements of the 1960s and 1970s in particular, but in doing so I learned about the relevant historical context and thus learned how to connect art and social justice. ",
            "\u00a0As someone who had not previously engaged with queer/feminist/critical race theory, I learned so so much in this class about these frameworks, reading many important texts (Gender Trouble, A Cyborg Manifesto, Traffic at the Crossroads, etc.) and gaining a fundamental understanding of their central questions/problems. The course also introduced me to many contemporary artists working with performance, installation, and mixed media, whom I would have never heard of outside the course. ",
            "\u00a0A better understanding of feminist texts in the context of contemporary art pieces. ",
            "\u00a0This class provided an engaging introduction to feminist theory and art. This course gave me new lenses through which to examine art and art history, and exposed me to new artists and artworks. "

            "\u00a0The global feminisms lecture readily takes a Western imperial gaze and didnt seem to speak with the critical literature on Western feminism and instead otherizes problems. For example, highlighting Malala Yousafzai and her fight for education elsewhere without acknowledging the inaccessibility of education for black and brown girls in the US. Just food for thought. \r\n\r\nPreface to Lecture 22 on Trumpism was really apprecaited\r\n\r\nThoughtful selection of material and its relevance on your students ",

            "\u00a0Strength is Pamela Lee for sure and the assignments are interesting. A weakness might be, if there was one, the lecture series accompanying the class. Some of it was inaccessible to an uninformed audience. ",
            "\u00a0This course covered a wide range of intersectional material that presented story of feminism thread through the art world. It also engrained issues of art and art theory as well as engaged an array of readings that focused specifically on class material and more broadly on topics of gender theory. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n-Engaging lectures\r\n-Enjoyed the additional lecture series and the field trip \r\n-Sections helped with understanding course material and practicing visual analysis skills\r\n\r\nImprovements:\r\n-Wasn't always sure how the primary source readings fit with the main topics - maybe make the links more clear or discuss more during sections ",
            "\u00a0The course was extremely organized. When we went into class there was always a sheet with all of the works and key terms of the lecture included. All of the papers and the final exam were extremely planned and organized in a way that encouraged progress and success, instead of just difficultly. I do not have any suggestions. ",

            "\u00a0Professor Lee was incredibly kind and generous with her knowledge. The assignments, readings, and lectures were strong, and I really enjoyed the midterm field trip. I do wish that we had been able to choose from a wider range of artworks for our first visual analysis paper. I also wish that we hadn't been forced to buy the textbooks, which were expensive and only contained a few readings over the whole semester. ",
            "\u00a0This course is amazing and so powerful. Simply put, there are few courses in the History of Art department at Yale that so explicitly interrogate and push back against the traditional understanding of the \"genius\" as white cis straight men. The class is extremely well-organized, handouts with relevant object information and terms/concepts are handed out at the beginning of each class, lots of feedback is provided on the two written assignments, and a finite list of objects is announced for the final exam. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Lee! The TFs! The division of assignments into two short papers and one exam, plus section participation!\r\nWeaknesses: I really think this course was great, and have very little to fault it for. If there was one small thing, I think that there could have been more standardization of the work required by the TFssome of them had us submit discussion questions, while others didn't. Given that the final exam focused so heavily on readings, it would be beneficial for the TFs to uniformly prioritize them in section preparation and discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Prof. Lee is a great lecturer and makes an effort to include artists not in the mainstream.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: We read some dense psychoanalytic texts, and I feel like there could have been more guidance, both in lecture and section, on understanding them. "

            "\u00a0Yes! Other art history classes lack the critical engagement of feminist/anti-imperial/anti-racist perspectives. This one offers an opening to those conversations. ",

            "\u00a0Yes! This is a great course if you want to be exposed to feminist history, theory, and art. You don't need prior art history experience, but it might help to have some knowledge of feminist history/terminology. Overall, it's an interesting course that will challenge you without an overwhelming workload. ",
            "\u00a0yes!!!! professor lee is great and so so so cool! i feel like i learned a lot about feminist theory and history, and the ways that it has affected contemporary art and art theory. would def recommend taking this course if you have any interest in art or feminism!!! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I perfectly integrated art history into larger conversations about feminism and showcased the ways that the two strains of thought influenced each other. ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend this course!! If you're interested in feminism or art, you will learn a lot and love it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!!! Would highly highly recommend this course to any student, not just history of art majors. This course encourages students to dive outside of the traditional comfort zone in the academic field of art history and teaches them about the historical context of 20th century feminist movements, which is so important for all students to understand. This course also teaches the basic skills and strategies for visual analysis of both a specific work of art as well as an installation/collection viewed on a field trip. The course also engages with works in the YUAG's collection, encouraging students to continue their own exploration of feminist art in Yale's museums. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student!! The material is compelling, the teaching is excellent, and you go on a fun trip to the city. Like, if you take one class at Yale, it should be this one :) ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Not as daunting as a literature WGSS course, and you get to look at cool art! ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to any student. "
