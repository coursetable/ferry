I certainly learned how to solve many different types of problems, but I don't think they really served to give me a physics background relevant to my biology career. This was neither a traditional mechanics course nor the full-fledged biophysics course that was advertised, and I thought the biology examples were shoehorned in rather awkwardly. This isn't to say the class wasn't interesting, but the topics we covered seemed a bit random and didn't cohere with one another -- I'm a champ at solving eigenvalues, but I don't really know how they work or why we use them.

            "\u00a0So physics was my entire life this semester, but overall I learned to enjoy it. The workload is obviously a lot -- Simon advertises 9 hour psets, but they were always much longer than that. 12-15 hours of pset per week was more accurate, for me anyway. I resented study hall at first, but I really came around to it and I now think it's one of the greatest strengths. If you have a group of friends in the class --  something I think is essential -- and given that the psets are too hard to solve on your own, it's great to have a collaborative space to come focus and learn and get help. I think most of my learning happened at study hall. I didn't always follow Simon's lectures, but I really, really admire his dedication. It's super unusual to have a professor not only learn your names, but also stay on campus with you late into the night to help you with your psets. Unlike certain intro professors, you can tell he really cares and wants you to succeed, and that goes a long way. The time commitment could be really frustrating, especially when the class didn't always make good on its promise to help us really understand concepts -- we were often told to \"not worry about\" certain confusions when they didn't prevent us from solving a problem. The midterms were both very fair, although the final was genuinely challenging, and I feel a bit blindsided -- given the sheer investment I put into the course, I was disappointed that I found the final so brutal, and I now have absolutely no idea how I did in this course despite having done well beforehand. That said, this is one of the better intro STEM classes at Yale, and I enjoyed it more than I expected. ",
            "\u00a0Great course, but the hardest final that I have ever taken (thought I was going to pass out). It is brutal but bearable when all your premed friends take this journey with you. Though that final... ",
            "\u00a0The psets are crazy long and take up so much time. But Simon is such a great teacher and there are so many resources to help. ",
            "\u00a0Simon is a nice guy and an OK lecturer, class environment is set up to work a lot with peers (group quizzes, etc.) Corrections on midterms is a good grading/learning mechanism. The material, however, is very all-over-the-place, often feels like you're doing stats or something else, not physics ",
            "\u00a0Overall it was a good supportive course with a good supportive community. The lectures were sometimes a bit disorganized and I couldn't tell what was relevant/important get a clear flow of ideas. Many (but not all) of the psets were also too long for a course that isn't the main focus of anyone's major, and took over a disproportionate amount of my time in the week. All the study halls and peer tutor hours were really helpful though and appreciated. ",
            "\u00a0Its strength is in collaboration. Between study halls, group quizzes, and pair share exercises, this course really encouraged us to work together and see the value in doing so. It would've been impossible to get through this course alone. The lectures could've been better--especially when we were learning so much from the psets, it often felt like lecture was disorganized, unengaging, rushed, and ultimately not that helpful when it came time to study for an exam. I wish that lecture focused more on key concepts and, say, working through problems in groups rather than extended derivations that never showed up again. ",
            "\u00a0The professors, TAs, and peer tutors are very helpful and put forth a lot of effort to help students learn. The study halls are a major key to surviving the course. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I thought this was a very fair course. However, I did find the final exam to be extremely harder than any of the other exams or problem sets that we completed in the class ",
            "\u00a0There are honestly not many ways in which this class can be improved. It is, without a doubt, one of the most difficult classes I've ever taken. However, because of the way the class is set up/the TAs/the Professor/the study halls, it's also one of my favorite. Had I taken this class when I was a first year, there's actually a very high chance I would have become a physics major. The material is very tough, but lectures and study halls are set up to help you understand everything. What I really loved about the course was that everyone who had a hand in facilitating it, from the Professor to the TAs really emphasized the importance of understanding the concepts behind what we were learning. This wasn't a plug and chug kind of class, even though it very easily could have been. Everyone went the extra mile to help us better understand not only what we were doing when we sat down to solve a problem, but why were were doing it. ",
            "\u00a0A strength is that Simon makes all the concepts we cover very applicable to the real world and there are lots of moments to appreciate how awesome physics reveals that the world is. A weakness is that the problem sets can be very stressful because most people need the help of a peer tutor or TA for at least half the questions and so office hours get quite crowded. I felt like I needed to develop a strategy for getting to the maximum number of the least busy office hours. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of the course is how it is designed for students to be successful. There was ample opportunity to interact with the professor, TAs, and other students, as well as to do well by staying engaged with the material on a weekly basis through quizzes and problem sets. The class could be improved by making even more opportunities for study hall sessions, as there is in PHYS 180. ",
            "\u00a0Weakness: Time consuming \r\nStrength: Many resources and ways to get help and have questions answered. Lots of support to ensure you understand concepts and do not fail. Also fanaticism professor that takes time to learn your name and get to know you outside of class, in study hall. ",
            "\u00a0Great professor. A lot of study hall and peer tutor hours available. Course and assignment structure. Exam corrections. \r\nWeakness: none! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Simon's kindness, approachability, and the quality of the modules. The course was really structured so that if you put in the work and the time, you will reap the benefits. Weaknesses: I felt that sometimes the study halls were chaotic and a fight for a TA or Simon's attention. I am not sure how to fix this, but I think that it definitely made me stressed when I did not need to be. I really loved all aspects of the course even though the material was so hard. ",
            "\u00a0This was the best pre-med/intro science lecture course I have ever taken at Yale. I took it for a requirement and it stands as one of my most positive learning experiences. ",
            "\u00a0loved study halls, loved the lack of student vs. student curve ",
            "\u00a0I like the community aspect of this course ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Extremely supportive network of people to look for guidance and help on every assignment and assessment. I found a warm community in PHYS170!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The workload often times was extremely high and difficult to manage. ",
            "\u00a0I think that while the amount of time spent in study halls on psets was pretty high, it was a great way to study for exams. I wish that TA hours were not during the day during classes or during sports practicing times because then I could have had more flexibility with when I could do my psets. Overall, I thought that the tests were very fair and that the information we learned was both interesting and relevant. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the best organized STEM class I've taken at Yale. So many resources to go to for help, very collaborative and welcoming environment, excellent professor (Simon), both midterms were fair and had corrections so you could gain back points, transparent grading system. Weaknesses: the final exam was written to trick people and be hard, which was not the most ideal. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course. Lectures are extremely informative, and information is presented in a way that students can follow easily, and extrapolate lessons from when completing their problem sets. Simon and the TFs are tremendously supportive, and there are practically endless office hours that students can access for support. The only criticism I have of the class was that sometimes the conceptual basis for the things we were learning could have been explained in more depth. In particular, I thought that the probability unit should have placed greater emphasis on establishing a foundational understanding of things like probability densities and probability distributions, since I felt like I knew how to use it, but didn't really know what it was. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The way that this course is set up facilitates learning. The many TA and peer tutor's office hours as well as the Study Halls were helpful in understanding pset problems and physics concepts. The course itself is also very receptive to student feedback, which I appreciate.\r\n\r\nWeakness: n/a ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of this course, in my opinion, was the study halls. Study hall is a fantastic way to get through the problem set with help from friends, peer tutors, and Simon! I think a weakness in this course was the TAs. They often seemed to be less helpful than the peer tutors to be completely honest. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: STUDY HALL. GO. IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE. IT'S THE ONLY WAY. Weaknesses: Lots of theoretical derivations during lecture that feel like a waste of time. Occasional, weird curveballs on exams that I still don't really understand. But overall, a very fair class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were that this class was collaboration-based, problem solving - centered, and that Simon was very invested in his students and in their success. ",
            "\u00a0The course has super helpful study halls three nights a week and the professor attends 2 of them. Without these, the assignments could not be done. They also improve learning because you are forced to do physics throughout the week. Though students hate them by the end, it's reason we are all able to do well in the course. Psets could definitely be shorter though. I'm all for learning, but it's excessive. ",
            "\u00a0This course, even though it was annoying at times, did teach me a lot. The professors and teaching staff were very dedicated and invested a lot of time and energy. Sometimes the problem sets required an excessive amount of work in the form of algebra or calculus, and took a lot of time even after the physics part was done. Also, the two hardest problem sets were the weeks of the midterms, which drained me beyond belief. I also did not vote because the midterm was on election night, which was my choice, but ideally should be changed in the future, since they require so much studying. ",
            "\u00a0the peer tutors and TA's were the best part. The modules simon writes are sometimes hard to pick a part what is important and what is not. That is a major weakness of this course because you can waste hours and hours studying topics that will never be tested just because they show up in the module. Make sure you focus your studying on topics he covers in class. Of course, the final was a living hell and is also a major weakness of the course. He asked us questions that were more complex and hard than we had ever seen before in any quiz or pset. ",
            "\u00a0you don't learn physics, just stats and chem. ",
            "\u00a0The study halls every week are one of the best parts of this course. It not only helps with psets and studying for exams, but also facilitates collaboration which is often lacking in large lectures. I really appreciate all the effort Simon puts into this class. Also the fact that Simon allows for exam regrades to regain 40% of lost points really points to how this class is facilitated to help students learn. This class is not like many other STEM ones that seem to be designed to ruin lives and it's really refreshing. ",
            "\u00a0Its explained really well with lots of opportunities to ask questions and get help ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that it is a fast moving course so there is a lot of material being covered in a short period of time. However, the professor tends to brush over the material and sometimes fails to explain it well to the students. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this class is that it provides hours and hours of time available to meet with professors, TAs, and peer tutors. The problem sets are ridiculously hard, but with the aid of the teachers, it is very doable and great in helping with overall understanding. ",
            "\u00a0I never thought I would be able to do physics until I took this class. I was genuinely shocked by the incredible amount of support  from Simons willingness to answer any and all questions in lecture, to the peer tutors amazing help during office hours, to the TAs warmth and helpfulness during study halls and review sessions and one on one meetings. Believe it or not, Simon and the rest of the 170 staff actually want you to do well and actually care about you, which is so, so different than any other premed class Ive been in! ",
            "\u00a0There are so many opportunities to learn the material. Aside from lecture, there is study hall three times a week, office hours with TAs, review sessions, and Simon will even meet with you one on one. ",
            "\u00a0Prof Mochrie is great. Awesome, even. The final? A hard kick in the butt. I think the average was a C, and this class is not curved. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend a lighter workload, even if the material is interesting. ",
            "\u00a0The course's biggest strength, I think, was the wide variety of support provided for the students. Maybe it could be nice if there were more materials available on the Canvas site, since though the extra review sessions were really helpful, not everyone could attend them. The weekly 10-point quizzes were a great method to learn the material in a low-stress way. I also liked the Poll Everywhere questions (rather than clickers). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: PSETS, Studyhall, TAs/Peer tutors, Simon Mochrie, Modules, fair exams\r\nWeaknesses: some things were tested that were not outright taught in class; you had to learn them from the psets/ by reading the modules ",
            "\u00a0I really loved the study halls, that helped a lot with the problem sets. ",
            "\u00a0The course was taught well. I think it was a fair class. ",
            "\u00a0The course is absolutely designed for student success. The Monday quizzes ensure that you stay on top of the material, but you can drop three of ten so they are not a source of stress. The problem sets are long and challenging, but this naturally brings students together to work on them in groups. This is further facilitated by study hall, another great part of the course. Study hall is offered three times a week in TEAL, in addition to TA and peer tutor office hours, which motivated me to start the problem sets early. Really, this class offers no shortage of resources to help its students succeed. Test corrections are offered on the two midterms, so you can get up to 40% of the points back, which made me actually learn from my mistakes. The weekly modules were much easier to learn from than a textbook (and Im glad I didnt have to carry the textbook around all the time).  Lastly, Simon Mochrie is an incredible professor, and really makes an effort to get to know students. Hes at study hall twice a week and is great at explaining concepts both in lecture and in small groups. A weakness of this class is that it aligns pretty poorly with the lab component (165L). However, I think the class really works as is, so I wouldnt change it necessarily to perfectly mirror the lab. I also think that a lot of students found that the time in lecture could have been used more constructively, because it was possible to do very well in the course without paying attention to the complicated derivatives in lecture.

Simon is a good instructor, and I've heard Adrianne is a good instructor too, and both courses are plenty difficult, so I think it comes down to personal preference. Personally, I'd lean towards whichever course your friends are taking. Either way, you are going to be spending a lot of time doing physics psets, and having friends there will make it so much better. ",

And we learned really cool biological and chemical applications that actually explain a lot of things I've learned in other science classes. ",

            "\u00a0Yes. If you need to take Physics, like bio, and don't like math, take this and NOT 180.  GO TO STUDY HALL. MAKE FRIENDS TO DO THE PSETS WITH. THEY ARE NOT THAT BAD IF YOU JUST DO THEM WITH A GROUP AND ESPECIALLY AT STUDY HALL WITH TA/PEER TUTOR HELP. GO. TO. STUDY HALLS. ALL OF THEM. I was absolutely dreading taking Physics, shopped 180 and was freaked out, ended up in 170 and not only having a super successful academic experience but making a ton of friends. I'm shocked to say this but it was actually one of my favorite class experiences I've had. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend this course of 180 because I think it was a little more supportive and relevant to other courses for non-physics majors. It was also more interesting material than just pure irrelevant physics. ",
            "\u00a0If you're taking this course, you probably are doing so because you have to. Definitely choose it over 180--even though we have more consistent busy work in 170 (psets and weekly quizzes as opposed to only psets), we spent fewer hours on it. Both courses get points back on exams, and as far as I can tell, our exams seemed much easier and geared toward people with a less confident math background. ",
            "\u00a0If you're taking this class because you think it's going to be easier than 180, pump your breaks. As far as I can tell, the workload in this class isn't any less than 180. Actually, in this case, experience with physics may work against you a little bit, because it's gonna be different from what you did in high school. If you're looking for a standard intro physics class, 180 is probably your best bet. However, if you're really into biology and you'd like to pretend you're just in a mathier than usual bio class, go for it! I personally found the material more interesting than standard intro physics and had a great time. ",
            "\u00a0I would suggest 170 to every student possible. I have never felt so encouraged in science class at Yale. This course is designed to make you succeed. ",
            "\u00a0100% would recommend over 180. 170 is hard, but if you put in the time and the effort, you will do well. Simon is an amazing professor, and there are so many TAs and peer tutors who are there to help support you and help you learn. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the class to another student but with a caveat... If you don't have to take it, you might not want to. In order for you to get a lot out of it, you're doing to have to put a lot of time into it. If you don't need to do that/have time to do that, the class will be pretty tough and unenjoyable. So take it if you have time and are genuinely interested in learning more about physics (cause you definitely will learn tons of physics), but maybe stay away if you're afraid it'll be too much time. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I think Id take it if I want to learn a less classical version of physics. If you want more of the physics youve seen in high school then I dont recommend this. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! It grew my brain and was an enjoyable learning experience ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course was a very good introduction for students who are fulfilling the physics requirement for a non-physics major. As someone who had taken physics in high school, this was a good step up without being intimidating. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the professor is a great guy who makes the topic interesting and funny, he will take time out of his day to teach concepts that may be a little difficult. Also the class is smaller than 180 meaning you get more attention. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I think it is especially helpful/ interesting for premed students. I really enjoyed the content and was happy that it didn't seem focused on irrelevant math concepts and equations. ",
            "\u00a0YES. I would definitely recommend this course to any student who needs to take physics and is oriented to pre-medical studies. 100%. Take it. Just take my word for it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you have to take physics as a pre-med student. I have no regrets at all about taking this course over PHYS180. I think this course is outstanding. The resources are incredible and the sense of community is unbeatable. I learned a lot, I made friends, and I enjoyed the class. The only drawback is that it is a LOT of time outside of class, but so is any other physics class. At least I was having fun during all that time. ",
            "\u00a0yes yes please take if you have to take a physics ",
            "\u00a0I'd still chose 170 or 180 any day but I just would never choose physics in general lmao ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would. It is a good option for the pre-med track, and it was overall an interesting course where I was challenged and learned a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Only if required for their major or pre med. would definitely recommend over phys 180 unless someone was planning on becoming a physics major. ",
            "\u00a0Take PHYS 170 if you're interested in biology or medicine because we learn so many interesting ways to model biological systems. Do not take this class if you want to learn about classical physics-- we did not learn about kinematics or rotation/torque. I'm fine with not learning that stuff especially since I learned that in high school so this was a fun opportunity to learn new topics in physics/biophysics. Also Simon is such a cool and dedicated professor so take this class for him and his dedicated teaching staff. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Especially for students with even the slightest interest in biophysics, this class was hands down incredible. Many students complain that it is a challenging courseand it is but Simon is incredibly supportive and structures his class to ensure student success. In short, you'll get out of it what you put in. It's not a course that is designed to be easy, but it is definitely a course that through continual practice, students can improve on and excel in. The content of this course is the most engaging in terms of any science class I have taken at Yale. Simon explores the physical underpinnings for common biological phenomenon, and you will be shocked by how perfectly the behavior of biosystems can be described and predicted by physics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course! I think the topics covered in the course were very interesting, especially the applications to biological concepts such as actin polymerization and infection rates. The study halls and office hours facilitated learning. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this if you are pre-med and need to take physics, but really don't \"like\" physics or want to take 180. If you put in the time to read through the module notes each week and go to study hall to do the psets, you will honestly do well in the course. Sometimes it felt like the biological applications were a bit of a stretch, but overall I found them interesting. ",
            "\u00a0If you need physics, it's a good option. I was torn between 170 and 180, and I am very happy with my decision to take 170. Though I can't speak for 180, I can say that in 170, the grading is extremely transparent, and the teaching staff really care about your success. Very fair class. You will do well if you put in the work on p-sets. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in biology, I would definitely recommend it over Phys180. I thought I was going to hate physics, but I actually ended up liking it. It is cool to learn about a topic in a biology class and then in this class learn about the physics behind it. ",
            "\u00a0Not if you don't have to take it. Though the course was good for learning and has a great professr, I doubt anyone wants to subject themselves to 9-12 hours of work each week. ",
            "\u00a0This is likely a requirement. Go to office hours, study hall, and the review sessions. Start the problem sets early, and identify the good teaching staff. It is much more work than it needs to be, but you learn a lot. ",
            "\u00a0No ",
            "\u00a0If you want a traditional AP physics style class, take 180. If you enjoy stats and like biology to a ridiculous extent, this class if for you. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Take this over 180 if you're pre-med. This class is pretty interesting in terms of concepts learned and its well structured. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student if they were willing to spend time in office hours and study halls to complete the very long Psets. My main issue is that I am a fairly independent worker, but for students looking for a group pset environment, this is a good course ",
            "\u00a0This is the best physics class to take ",
            "\u00a0I would because it requires you to focus and really grind out the work while also studying for the midterms. It is a difficult course that I feel needs to be taken. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This is the first STEM class that I have taken where I have been able to see the results of hard work paying off. The professor, TAs, and peer tutors are incredible. They really do want to see you succeed and I have enjoyed learning in this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. So much so over 180 track ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this class. The structure of the course forces you to repeatedly work on and discuss the material with your classmates and teaching assistants, which makes it easier to learn and recall the information we have learned. The grading is generous and makes sense. And, for those that dont like physics that much, the application of the concepts helps you apply and connect the information. ",
            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY. Having now taken 170, I would opt for 170 over 180 in a heartbeat. So much support & encouragement (Simon even makes an effort to know everyones names within the first few weeks of school!) ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I wouldnt take it unless you have to, but taking it really wasnt as bad as I thought it would be! ",
            "\u00a0The amount of study halls you need to attend is almost ridiculous, I had to sacrifice some extracurriculars to make these. ",
            "\u00a0You're probably only taking it because it's required for your major or for pre-med. However, I would recommend 170 or 180. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah, I would recommend! I think as long as you attend class, go to study halls, and get to know your TA (so you're comfortable asking them questions), you'll do fine. There is so much classroom support. I was kind of scared because I figured other students would have had a better physics background than me, but it really didn't matter because 1.) the topics were applied in new ways, and 2.) asking questions was super encouraged. ",
            "\u00a0I am so glad that I chose 170 over 180. For any premed/biology major trying to decide between 170 and 180, I definitely recommend taking 170. Simon is a professor that truly cares about his students. The exams and quizzes are extremely fair and you can do midterm corrections to get back 40% of your lost points. The psets are sometimes difficult, but going to the study halls helps a lot. There are a myriad of resources for this class that are designed to help everyone succeed. The grading was clear and transparent from the start. All in all, phys 170 was probably one of the best STEM classes I've taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0yes! If you are pre-med take this ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Take this class if you're pre-med and deciding between 170 and 180. Your life and semester will be do much better. Especially, if you're not fantastic at math or skeptical about physics. Don't listen to pre-meds trying to tell you to take 180! Simon is a great teacher and the class environment is so welcoming. ",
            "\u00a0If you love physics or need it for pre-med ",
            "\u00a0If you have to take physics and want a bio background it is legitimately interesting for that purpose. If you don't care about biology take 180 ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. PHYS 170 is a perfect fit if you are interested in the life sciences. Be warned: its very non-traditional. This class has made me love physics and genuinely appreciate how physical processes form the basis of life. Its a very conceptual class, especially compared to PHYS 180. "
