            "\u00a0I honestly feel like I got very little out of this lab. The physical concepts are mostly redundant to someone who has taken PHYS 200/201 or 260/261. Since the experiment guides are often somewhat inscrutable, it's difficult to figure out what you're supposed to do in the lab ahead of time. Therefore, I was often too busy asking the TF questions to learn anything about experimental setup or design, since I was worried about finishing the labs within 3 hours. PHYS 205 introduced a formal lab report this semester, but provided very little explanation aside from links to 5 papers for Nobel Prize winning research. Grading is incredibly variable between sections, which is very frustrating for the student, even if the grade distribution is normalized at the end. ",

By working with single lab partners for about 5 hours (including time spent outside of class) per lab, may cooperation skills improved. My attention to detail improved, but not much because my lab notebooks were sloppy for the sake of finishing labs on time. I also got significantly better at completing tasks, which is a skill that my other classes certainly do not help with. They are more about thought while this hands on class gave me practical skills. ",
            "\u00a0The main insight I developed from taking this course was an understanding of error propagation; beforehand, I had no idea that there was a general formula for calculating error propagation, and I'm sure knowing that formula and knowing how to use it will serve me well.

            "\u00a0Strengths: teaching uncertainty measurement and introducing new types of lab equipment. The gyroscope was cool.\r\nWeaknesses: Most of the labs were simply following instructions. There were few instances where I felt like I was intellectually stimulated. I did not learn much physics, and I feel like the lab was not a good representation as to how physics is actually done. ",
            "\u00a0This class did teach well how to collect data. I was often very excited by how well our data fit predictions. However, it did not explicitly teach that much. It also was very mechanical; often, no thinking was necessary. ",
            "\u00a0Very impersonal. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: having cool equipment for you to use in labs.\r\nWeaknesses: not having enough time to mess with said equipment, or caring more about completing the lab than thoroughly understanding how to use the equipment. Most of the classes felt like we were on a time crunch to check everything off on the lab guide. ",
            "\u00a0Much of the work seems pointless and the lab write-ups do not serve to supplement the course material. The coursework takes more time than should be expected for a half-credit intro physics lab. Additionally, it was hard to receive feedback on work because of the structure of having two lab notebooks turned in alternate work, so you could not correct mistakes until two labs later ",
            "\u00a0It's not that terrible, it's just busywork that you need to do and in the process you learn a lot. Just need to stick with it. That being said, the class could be structured to actually teach people physics and not how to simply use machines and calculate error. ",
            "\u00a0Way too much in the experiment guides to be able to do comprehensively in 3 hours, for some reason lab books are graded out of 10 (ie 1 mistake means 10% off), and prelab questions confusing. ",
            "\u00a0The course was strong in that it had a lot of interesting experiments for us to carry out that were very comprehensive so we can apply physical concepts to experimental data that supports the concepts we learned. The weakness of this course is that the experiments were not aligned with the learning in the general physics classes, so sometimes it was difficult to carry out an experiment simply by reading a prelab and answering some questions, Also, the prelabs were not very effective because the concepts introduced were easy to understand, but the questions are often much more in depth and make a leap from what was discussed so we have to do a lot more research and googling in order to understand the prelab questions. The prelab also wasn't correlated well with the actual experiments, so sometimes it was just difficult to understand what is going on in the lab experiments until the end when you combine everything you did and try to make sense of the results. ",
            "\u00a0The only strength of this class was the lab report which I found quite fun. Everything else was a weakness. The lab classes were a three hour cram of experiments. The first two hours were boring and basic things I had done in the past and the last hour was slightly more interesting, but it was always rushed. The learning was all done through a textbook at home and never explained in class. The way to improve this class is to shorten the labs greatly. Take the best hour of the lab and have it be done over a longer period. Instead of learning by ourselves, have the professor give an hour long lecture at the beginning of each class so we actually learn something about measuring and error (both interesting subjects, especially the second). Finally, make the writing in the lab guides more understandable. Not only are they poorly worded, but they are more confusing than they need to be. What if the students came up with their own processes given the equipment? It does not have to be fed to us by a lab guide. We have the ability to use this equipment by our own accord and do not need exact instructions on how to proceed. We know when there is something interesting happening in the lab and can record that when we choose, not when the lab guide says to. ",
            "\u00a0Lab procedures often ran over. There was no way we would finish some of the labs in time ",
            "\u00a0The quality of instructor and instructions was good. The TA did not provide great guidence and the reliance on logger pro and excell took time away from guidence in the coarse. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this class are that it was largely successful in its goals of teaching the subject. I left with a much deeper working knowledge of how to conduct experiments in physics with a few specialized types of equipment, how to properly make measurements both by hand and with LoggerPro software, how to determine and calculate uncertainties of experimental data, and how to devise experimental procedures. It was generally enjoyable to participate in.\r\n\r\nThe main weakness of the class is how much work it is compared to other full credit courses, despite being a half credit course. Like many labs, there is much more than the proportional amount of work appropriate for the course. Since each lab period of three hours is generally barely enough time to collect experimental data, each week involved many pieces of time consuming work, including finishing the previous lab write-up, doing the next experiment's pre-lab, and doing a separate problem set, not to mention completing a 3500-word lab report and preparing for the written and practical exam on their respective weeks. The work was simply too time-consuming for a 0.5 credit course. In addition, though less important, many of the experiment guides are written vaguely, to the point that clarification from the TF was needed many times during a period by almost every student, wasting precious time. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course is very dependent on the teaching assistant. My teaching assistant was great, but I know others who did not have the same good experience. Nonetheless, I feel that I reinforced physics concepts I learned in concurrent physics lecture, but it was still very time consuming, hard, and non intuitive.\r\nWeaknesses also include the labs being too long. ",
            "\u00a0That lab report was not well organized, explained, parametrized, or thought out. It needs a full rethink. Other than that it was great. ",
            "\u00a0For me, the biggest weakness of PHYS 205 is that it doesn't feel incredibly relevant to most physics majors. It has very little to do with anyone whose interests lean towards theoretical, computational, or mathematical physics, and it doesn't really teach the skills that most students use in actual experimental lab research. The workload is disproportionate to the half credit (I often spent more time on my lab notebooks than I did on my physics psets). Grading is variable between sections, depending on your TF. Even though we were reassured that grades would be normalized between sections at the end of the course, we were still incredibly stressed about lab. It also felt impossible to use our TF's feedback to improve our lab notebooks-- apparently we were graded based on a rubric specific to each lab, and we had no idea what the rubric was ahead of time. ",
            "\u00a0Lab instructions made absolutely no sense, the apparatuses never worked, the professor was rarely present, and our poor TF, although he saved us all constantly, was overworked as a result. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: good prelabs, not too much hw\r\n\r\nCons: the labs were all so long and it was very stressful each week trying to finish \r\nPlus we did not receive very detailed guidelines for the big lab report ",
            "\u00a0strengths: learned how to use lab instruments, small class\r\nweakness: boring, a lot of busy work ",
            "\u00a0Oftentimes, there was a lot of confusion surrounding the instructions in the lab and pre-lab ",
            "\u00a0The course had some relevant information for my physics education, but the material taught was largely more complicated and advanced than my Physics 200 class. I was told that this lab was supposed to be for students in Physics 200, but I did not understand much of what we learned. Therefore, either do not take this course while taking 200 or at least wait a semester. ",
            "\u00a0The student's are not that good at pacing unless the expected time for each activity is given to them. In the later labs, we often had to skip activities such as building a telescope because we spent too long with the introductory experiments of those labs. ",
            "\u00a0Everyone in my lab section worked diligently on every lab, to the best of our ability, and yet every week, we got out around an hour late. This causes problems for those of us who schedule labs with the intent of being able to schedule something else immediately afterwards without being an hour late to that second obligation every week. I'm sure there are ways to condense the material covered in the lab to make it manageable while still communicating all the vital concepts. ",

            "\u00a0I would say take this class if you are really interested in physics experimentation and are willing to spend a lot more effort for this half credit class than for some of your 1 credit classes to get a lot out of it. The experiments are cool, but the feedback was very minimal and concepts are not necessarily explained  well, so the majority of the learning required you to look at outside sources in order to understand the material, which has very little connection to the concepts learned in the physics classes. It was useful to learn how to use different equipment but without understanding the background principles fully, it is hard to retain much from the class and it sometimes felt like a lot of simply struggling to understand instead of learning from the application of the experimental experience. ",
            "\u00a0Coming to Yale I wanted to be a physics major. After just one semester I think I changed my mind. The biggest reason is this lab class. If physics is going to be anything like this, I want no part of it. The only reason anyone takes this course is because it is a requirement. Even the professor and TA seemed to only be there because they had to be. Why make a course so burdening? Why not try to make it so at least one person enjoys it? Lab classes do not have to be a requirement. Labs can be fun if done right. Someone needs to take the time to work on this course to save the next years freshman from hating experiments. It is these introductory courses that let students chose their major, and right now I strongly believe the physics department is losing countless majors (like me) because they hate this one course so much. It almost feels like it the department's prerogative to scare away students. (I really hope that is not the case as clearly that would be quite self-serving and lazy). ",

It was definitely more work than it should have been, but it was overall enjoyable. Most likely, it makes more sense to take 165L over this class if it is not required. ",
            "\u00a0Only do the course for the major. There are many other interesting science courses that could be taken instead of a lab course. ",
