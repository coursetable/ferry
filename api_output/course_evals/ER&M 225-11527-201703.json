            "\u00a0This class provided me with the vocabulary to understand not just selfhood in general, but to understand myself. Philosophical and literary frameworks of selfhood in this class allowed me to further understand aspects of myself I was unable to explain before. Furthermore, the curriculum's unique approach to concepts of race, class, and gender allowed me to see these concepts outside of the most common conceptual lens. ",

            "\u00a0For me, this course was incredibly helpful, but in a rather unexpected way. What I most learned and took away from the class was rather indirectly from the actual material we discussed in class, but rather, more from the general vibe I got from the class: From this course, I realized the importance of personal expression, and I was given the tools to start experimenting with expression.\r\n\r\nI think that the various texts we read helped inform the various ways that we can express ourselves, whether it be through a medium like a composite of essays or a medium like a narrative memoir. I think that the specific content of the readings weren't necessarily extremely useful in terms of what I was able to learn and take away for the course, but the various forms that the readings took were really useful to gain insight into the flexibility of self-expression and -reflection. ",

            "\u00a0I got an overview of the proper language used when discussing identity, and I was exposed to a few different perspectives on selfhood and intersectionality. My critical reading and writing skills were definitely maintained/put to the test across the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about different theories of viewing the self, understanding identity in the context of race, class and gender, whatever those terms mean for different cultures or for different time periods, and I acquired a new vocabulary with which to think about my own identity and how I can attempt to responsibly and meaningfully relate to the world and people I interact with. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think critically about the concept of the self through perspectives of philosophy, psychology, literature, and art. I also learned about the importance of avenues of self-presentation, and especially how it related to my own idea of my \"self.\" ",
            "\u00a0I learned that pretty much everything that we encounter in life can be interpreted through a lens of the self, race, class, and/or gender.  Each of these categories are things that we interact with consciously and unconsciously in our lives, and I think that this class brings up the ways in which this truth becomes evident. "

            "\u00a0The lecturers were both incredible, but I would have liked less discussion in class and more lecturing. I felt the course would have benefitted from decreasing discussion time in class and instead focusing on providing information and insight, and using section to discuss. The content sometimes seemed not closely tied enough to the topics of the class. ",
            "\u00a0weakness: i think the lectures could be improved to offer more discussion on the readings, less readings more in-depth analysis ",
            "\u00a0Prof Ramachandran and Figlerowicz had invaluable things to say about the readings and the content of the course. I loved hearing what they had to say. What I was not the biggest fan of was all of the in-class participation. Because we had breakout sessions upward of 10 minutes and then went over what everyone said, I felt like we had to be rushed at the end/go over time because we spent close to half of class talking and listening to our peers. That's what section is for! If there is a way to cut that down/use that time a little bit more meaningfully then I would be a proponent of it... otherwise was not a hug fan of the layout of lecture being like that. ",
            "\u00a0This course was ambitious with regards to the time and material it sought to span. At times, this made it difficult to draw connections between readings. But, the professors were not only very open to feedback, but actually invoked it after a midterm survey. ",
            "\u00a0For me, this course was incredibly helpful, but in a rather unexpected way. I would say that the title of the course is slightly misleading: perhaps, it might have been better to have been called \"Expressions and Representations of Selfhood: Race, Class & Gender.\" \r\n\r\nI walked into the class expecting philosophical discussions of texts surrounding the conception of selfhood. In reality, while we did cover a bit of philosophical material maybe in one week at the very beginning, you really should keep in mind an understanding of why this course is cross-listed in so many different departmentsit is a very interdisciplinary course and reflects a somewhat survey-course nature, which I hadn't really kept in mind, so it was a bit of a surprise to me.\r\n\r\nI also think that it is important to emphasize that this course is taught by literature professors, so the emphasis on the readings is very much literature-centered, so while the topics discussed are very interdisciplinary, the approach is very much one based in literature and possibly art as well.\r\n\r\nThe main problem is that I don't think I learned that much specific material content from this course, but it did push me to think in a different way and approach expression in a different way, and I think the benefits of rethinking and reevaluating my approach to expression outweigh the costs of not necessarily gaining a very thorough understanding of particular texts. ",
            "\u00a0I did not like the lecture style - the student engagement felt awkward and forced.  I think it should be a seminar. I liked the variety of readings, but wish we had read more modern material. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Breadth of exposure to concepts of selfhood and how race, class, and gender intersect to give shape to identity. Key questions/ideas were distributed at the end of each class that really helped me organize how each day of lectures related to the larger themes of the course   \r\nWeaknesses: The class was a little ambitious in the material it covered. I think paring down and concentrating on a few works of literature for each category would be helpful in terms of letting students get a deeper understanding of intersectionality and mediums of difference. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n1. Readings (especially in the last 3/4ths of the course) were extremely engaging and interesting.  They covered a range of subjects and spanned a variety of contexts, and yet they all made sense together in the tapestry of the course, which I thought was uniquely surprising. ",
            "\u00a0The professors are fantastic and the assigned readings are very relevant to the themes of the course - I really enjoyed the diversity in media, cultures and themes that we were exposed to.\r\nI enjoyed the group discussion model that was used in lectures, and I also appreciated the historical context we were given for each work we were discussing.\r\nI think it would have been nice if we had more explicitly addressed questions of selfhood and identity in our own current political or cultural climate and how identity is being redefined at this moment in history. ",
            "\u00a0The course material was quite dense and could often be abstract, so it was sometimes difficult to keep up with the amount of readings for each week and really understand the concepts discussed in such a short lecture. I think this was greatly improved mid-way through the semester when the professors began sending out recaps of each lecture with key points and important questions to consider, as it allowed the class to remain focused on some of the essential aspects of very challenging and broad topics. ",
            "\u00a0I think that this class provided a great selection of readings that I may not have interpreted in the way in which the professors ended up interpreting them, had they not provided their interpretation.  I think that this was a great strength of this class, making the student look at everything with lenses that may have been unexpected or not traditionally applied to the given reading.  I was very happy that this class did not only examine Western literature, and that it included authors that are often ignored in typical classes that I have taken at Yale.  I would not change anything. ",
            "\u00a0It was sometimes easy for me to forget about previous units while focusing on the current one; although I know the subject of the class was inevitably elusive, I think there could have been more done in lecture to connect what we were discussing from week to week. "

            "\u00a0Take it. Professors are brilliant and the course allows you to engage with texts you otherwise probably wouldn't. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who's thinking about it. Both professors are brilliant and the structure of the course with the creative assignments and the lecture discussions is innovative, exciting, and allows students to explore the concepts in a different way than in most other classes. This class allowed me to understand literature better, but also, fundamentally, to understand myself better. Highly recommend. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The syllabus is amazing! ",
            "\u00a0sure! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, one of the most enlightening courses I've taken with really interesting readings ",
            "\u00a0I wouldn't say that this course is a \"must-take.\" The syllabus was very ambitious, but did include very important texts that everyone should read and engage with before graduating. Unlike most lectures, each class consisted of a short lecture and group work. The course also enable students to do both creative projects and traditional essays, the grading for which was somewhat difficult. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student, but I would really emphasize that this course acts in a very similar fashion to that of a survey course. It goes through different texts and themes extremely quickly, for instance, reading one book for one class and immediately jumping to something else for the next class. As a result, it is very difficult to gain a very good understanding of the content of the texts necessarily.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, the reason that I recommend this course is that it is really good at opening your eyes to the different possibilities of various avenues of expression. Especially, for me, I come from a background where I hadn't ever really learned how to creatively express myself, so this course opened up this entirely different facet to life for me, which I think is extremely important. ",
            "\u00a0It's very easy to do very little work in this course. But honestly, all of the readings and creative assignments they give you are well worth spending time on. The lectures are engaging, varied, and interesting; the class discussions are rich with layered meaning; and all of the readings are extremely interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is an important class for any Yale student to take and is very relevant to contemporary discourses of identity politics and class/race/gender differences. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a very cool way of approaching literature. You have room to pretty much do whatever you want which lets the class be fun and creative or analytical - whatever you're feeling at the time of the projects. ",
            "\u00a0No, I did not enjoy the class. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this course would be better. I didn't really get much out of it, and got the sense that a lot of people were just kind of bullshitting around. Lectures are not incredibly well organized. That said, if you really want to do all the readings, and feel like going to office hours every week or something like that, you might enjoy it. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this class if you're at all interested in exploring questions of identity both personally and academically, and learning to appreciate how identity is performed in any media we consume. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this course, but Im glad I took it Credit/D because I would have been way too stressed if I had tried to do all the readings thoroughly (there are a LOT and they can be pretty dense, especially if youre not used to reading that kind of material). It was always fun and interesting to listen to Professors Figlerowicz and Ramachandran share their insights about each work and connect complex themes; they are both really brilliant, insightful, and witty. Taking the class Credit/D also allowed me to have more fun with the creative projects (the VR experience was SUPER cool and I dont think I would have had the chance to try that out otherwise) and really use them for self-reflection instead of worrying about the grade. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student.  I liked the creativity that was encouraged in this course, and I really appreciated the fact that the professors tried to make sure that we engaged with technology in ways we most likely had not before.  I really liked the incorporation of the VR technology into the course because I know I would not have tried it otherwise.  I really loved the presentation of all of the reading materials in this course, and I am very glad that I took this class because it has been one of my favorites that I've taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - because there aren't too many courses that I know of that offer both traditional / academic and cutting-edge / creative methods of study. "
