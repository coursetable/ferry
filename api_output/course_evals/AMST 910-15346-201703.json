I strengthened my abilities at primary source analysis and close-readings of seminal theory. Through everyone's shared writings, I learned about the richness and diversity of the field of Latinx Studies. From history, to cultural studies, to urban studies, to history of medicine, I was exposed to many modes of thinking and writing. "
