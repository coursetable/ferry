            "\u00a0To be quite honest, I learned very little in this class as it was not conducive to gaining or retaining material. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to read legal cases critically. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a lot more law-focused than economics focused, which came as a surprise to me. Felt like everyone in the class was pre-law. But overall I learned a ton about the Constitution and how to interpret law. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the levels of judicial scrutiny and we reviewed discrimination cases. ",
            "\u00a0Good overview of 20th century case law surrounding race and sex discrimination. Some deeper dives into the different mechanisms (Totle VII vs 14th etc) by which discrimination can be combatted, and the characteristics of each. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think about the law very critically and the economic effects experienced. Discrimination is explored very deeply. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This class is somewhat disorganized and poorly organized. I stepped away for each class with more questions that I came in, because class discussion was not always conducive to actually understanding material as it relates to the law. It was obvious that some people came in with more context/background on the law than others, making discussion difficult to follow. It would have been better for there to be a more thorough recap of different law concepts at the start of the semester and throughout than what was given. Additionally, the Prof essentially allowed subject matter to be taught through student's presentations. From the syllabus, and reasonable judgement, it seemed that the presentation during each class would last about 20 mins-40 mins because that's how most classes do it. However, from the first presentation, Prof Jaynes made it clear that students would essentially be teaching the class as the group had to stay with their presentation for the full two hours of class. I started coming to class with low expectations and not as excited as I had orginally been because the prof didnt seem that invested in the material seeing as he didnt teach it or come with his own ideas of how classroom discussion should go. In an upper-level seminar like, this I would have expected and desired more background support and structure to ensure student engagement and success. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course could benefit from more explicitly connecting economic theory to the types of discrimination cases we were discussing. The economic theory and legal parts of the course seemed largely disconnected. When it came time to formulate a final paper, I realized I could not think of a way to weave the two together. ",
            "\u00a0The class size was too large for effective discussion to take place. ",
            "\u00a0A large strength of the class is its subject matter and the engaged students that it attracted. Unfortunately, this class was poorly organized and the expectations for the course and coursework are not explicit. ",
            "\u00a0The course was interesting when prof Jaynes would give lectures, but I didn't like how heavily the class relied on student presentations. I mostly wanted to hear from the professor and sometimes the reliance on student presentation made the class feel more like AP US History than a College Seminar. ",
            "\u00a0Student presentations tended to last the entire class, with large breaks for tangents and discussion. It might be better to have a set time for student presenters to speak (like 20-30 minutes) and a set time for class discussions. This could eliminate the pressure on presenters to continually fill all silences and give the class as a whole more opportunities for discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Very interesting topic and professor is very knowledgeable and really tries to get us to think for ourselves, but could use some more organization. "

            "\u00a0Yes, Professor Jaynes is a very nice person and is able to teach often through the lens of his own experiences. I really enjoyed getting to listen to him and felt our class discussions were generally pretty lively. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this class if you expect to get something tangible out of it. This class is somewhat disorganized and poorly organized. I stepped away for each class with more questions that I came in, because class discussion was not always conducive to actually understanding material as it relates to the law. It was obvious that some people came in with more context/background on the law than others, making discussion difficult to follow.

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. Certainly shop the class; the teaching style remains consistent throughout the term. Professor Jaynes has fairly fixed opinions on many of these issues, which manifests as him letting the class discuss the opposing side but gently guiding us to or outright sharing his own opinion. He often goes on tangents as well, sometimes sharing relevant anecdotes from his own life. If his teaching style doesn't bother you at the start of the term, then it's an interesting class and one worth taking. Professor Jaynes also has an interesting perspective as someone who has testified as an expert witness in many trials; that means that he understands the law to the extent that he has picked it up over the years and needs to understand it to do the economic analysis, but he doesn't have an in-depth understanding of the law beyond that. One note is that student presentations take up the full length of most classes, with Professor Jaynes interjecting to correct student errors or contribute his own insights. When presentations are not well-prepared, I would recommend directing questions at Professor Jaynes to make sure he clarifies and contributes more in that particular session. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. Such a chill senior seminar for econ majors. Especially recommend for people who want to go to law school / are interested in the Constitution ",
            "\u00a0If you aren't an EP&E major or interested in law, you may find yourself a bit out of your depth. Jaynes is pretty chill, but the course lacks a lot of structure and clarity in grading. By lack of clarity in grading, I do mean it in the \"one or two sentences can be the difference between a C and an A\" sense, so you decide how you feel about that. Honestly, I'd only take this if there's no other senior econ seminar you'd rather take. ",
            "\u00a0Not really...it'll be extremely dull if you don't have an interest in Constitutional law. It's easy to be unengaged and most people are, making the class dynamic stiff. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to another student unless they are hoping for a class with minimal coursework. ",
            "\u00a0Yes if you want a survey of economic discrimination and its relationship to the law. No if you want to dive really deep into the history of economic discrimination. ",
            "\u00a0This is a good senior seminar for people interested in discrimination related case laws and constitutional methods of combatting discrimination. It might not blow your mind, but readings are short and manageable (DO THEM) and the discussions can be interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - interesting conversations "
