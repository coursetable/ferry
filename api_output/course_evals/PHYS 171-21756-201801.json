            "\u00a0The TAs, peers, and professors were all really supportive and kind. The modules are pretty confusing and honestly kinda unhelpful for learning the material, but the lecture slides and problem sets are very important for doing well ",

            "\u00a0I didn't think the lectures were taught as clearly as in 170. I don't think we were prepared as well for the exams as we were for 170. Often, stuff came up on the exam which we had hardly practised before or done in lecture which I thought was unfair as despite studying an awful lot, I always got caught out on the exam. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength was the amount of resources provided to students. I greatly benefited from the numerous peer tutors and the teaching fellows. I really appreciated meeting with the peer tutors one-on-one, and I highly recommend that future students taking this course should take advantage of the peer tutors. This course could be improved by having one professor teach it, like last semester. Having the switch halfway through the semester forces students to adjust to an entirely different lecture and examination style, which was difficult. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are the study hall community--there is typically help available for those who need it. Weakness: the modules start out mediocre and get worse--a definite decline from 170, and they're really less helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Great system in place to help learning and ensure no one falls through the cracks. Best environment of any STEM class I've taken. Instructors who actually care about you (how refreshing).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: second semester seemed to be harder to understand, the modules became less helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very supportive environment with many outlets for help and instruction outside of class. \r\nWeaknesses: very fast pace that is sometimes difficult for student with little background in physics and math. ",
            "\u00a0One weakness is that I felt like it was hard to express all my knowledge in the tight time constraints during exams. One strength was the study halls which allowed me to talk through problem sets and course material with other students and professors/TFs. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: study hall, availability of professors/ta/peer tutors, fairness, growth mindset. this is a good class ",
            "\u00a0It is very similar in structure to physics 170 which I liked. The quizzes and exams felt harder than last semester though. The TA's were slower at grading, so it was hard to know our grades. ",
            "\u00a0strengths- great format of working with other students on psets, professors and TFs are extremely helpful, dedicated, and kind \r\nweaknesses- topics don't have as much as biology focus, lectures could be presented better ",
            "\u00a0This course had two instructors with drastically different teaching styles. The second half of the class was difficult material and to understand. It would be helpful to keep the instructor consistent. The physics study halls and office hours were a major strength of the class. ",
            "\u00a0Poor poor poor problem sets. Wildly unlike midterms. Significant discrepancy between TAs in grading. Good collaborative environment with an emphasis on support. ",
            "\u00a0The study halls are the most helpful part of this course and the professors were always very willing to support us and help us with the material. The professors I think need to be a bit more forceful in lecture in getting the attention of the class, as sometimes the students would not be paying very good attention or talking, and it was very distracting for the rest of us. Also I felt that the homework grading between the TAs was inconsistent both this semester and between the two semesters. Would be more helpful if the lectures lined up with the lab material. ",
            "\u00a0I think the class structure is fun, but the weakness is that the material is not very applicable to life in my opinion. Well, not my career. This is supposed to be a pre-med physics course but i did not learn much about physics in anatomy or physiology as I would have wanted to. ",
            "\u00a0This course was incredibly time consuming, stressful, and intense. The quizzes set a tone of panic and stress at the beginning of the week, which was carried through during too-long psets, and started again with the next week's quiz. The cycle of physics stress defined my weeks and my year. I found that the instructors did not work through helpful examples during class, leaving us struggling by ourselves during psets. These were longer and harder than necessary, and impossible to complete alone. I understand why you are trying to get us to work together, but this isn't fair for those with other time commitments or classes. The strength of this course, I suppose, was teaching me how to juggle a ton, be pretty miserable, and keep going anyway. ",
            "\u00a0Very good organization of course content, study halls and reviews. Sometimes, however, the derivations of equations can lead students astray. ",
            "\u00a0Study Hall was amazing ",
            "\u00a0It was a great course, its a lot of work but any physics class will be! ",
            "\u00a0The course is taught well and the instructors and resources available are phenomenal. However, there simply are not enough problems with which to practice and the problems encountered on the problem sets are usually much different than the problems encountered on the exams. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths for PHYS 171 lay in its dedicated teaching staff and its commitment to helping the students. Everything was made to facilitate student learning. ",
            "\u00a0The class lectures are good and engaging, the clicker questions are definitely good and help us maintain interest in the material. The TA and peer tutors are also a big strength since they are super helpful. The problem sets are definitely excessive in length, compared to other classes, and the fact that it is not possible to solve many of the problems without help is very frustrating and to me a weakness of the class. ",
            "\u00a0This course takes up an incredible amount of time (at least 10 or more hours outside of class) because this class has an inverted class structure in which students learn how to do problem types outside of class. It would have helped me if more of the class was dedicated towards learning the basics of different problem types. Also there NEED to be more TFs at every study hall. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: highly engaged and enthusiastic teaching staff, excellent support system for individuals who need extra help, reasonable homework load and exams, interesting applications of material to life, option to do exam corrections, collaborative nature of problem sets and other learning, lots of feedback on my work\r\nWeaknesses: a lot of seemingly unnecessary derivations on the board, the course felt disorganized and behind schedule for the second half, poor synchronization with the Phys 166L course (lecture content was always behind lab content) ",
            "\u00a0This course really did not fulfill what was promised in the syllabus, as there were absolutely no biological applications unlike PHYS 170 so I'm not sure how it even differs from 181. The only biology module was cut out because we ran out of time and we were constantly behind compared to the lab! Unlike Simon who discussed biological applications in depth in class and tried to integrate them into the psets, the instructors made no effort to do so (one or two applications were mentioned in the last 5min of class). I thought the lectures were also quite poor - we went into endless derivations of equations which were not helpful for the psets or exams. The clicker questions were really helpful but I think the material emphasized in lecture should really be chosen better. Additionally, I felt like a lot of the quizzes were quite unfair - we were told to use the clicker questions to study but they rarely had anything to do with the questions or the lecture. Instead, they were based on pset questions which requires you to have started the pset on Sunday to do well on the quiz. I learnt the most doing the psets at study hall and peer tutor hours (who are the highlight of this course) because the lectures were so unhelpful. The first midterm was very fair but the second midterm and final felt much too difficult, with tricky questions applied to new situations we had not been introduced to in lecture. I also wish Professor Nagai had been more organized during the second midterm (forgetting the formula sheets and starting the exam late) because it put some of us at a significant disadvantage). ",
            "\u00a0Lectures could be slightly clearer ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - The material is organized logically and the exams are helpful in solidifying concepts!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - This introductory course demands a disproportionate amount of time. ",
            "\u00a0Information density seems to taper off as time goes on in the class.  By the end, it felt like I didn't really gain anything by going to lecture.\r\nThat being said, everything you need to know is in the modules/lecture slides and the exams pair well with the material presented. ",
            "\u00a0The course material is more difficult than the previous semester. I think lectures can be improved to help students conceptually understand the material. The modules could also be more detailed to show the reasoning and math used to solve different problems. ",
            "\u00a0The notes supplied do not match up with the questions that will be asked. The notes for this semester lacked examples and were very hard to follow. Also, we spent too much time proving equations before using them in class. ",
            "\u00a0Students are extremely well supported in this course, and it is very evident that a lot of thought has been put into it, which is quite unprecedented for STEM courses. One weakness might be the decreasing relevance of the modules with respect to homework problems and exam questions. "
