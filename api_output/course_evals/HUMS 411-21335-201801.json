Take it if you want to know more about yourself, the traditions you come from, the philosophies we live every day, or the way to shape a vision of your future. Take it for fun, or for a lot of food for thought. Definitely do this for yourself. ",

            "\u00a0I developed a well-rounded view of popular philosophies and religions that shape our societies today.  I learned critical thinking, open discourse, and building/challenging comments and ideas. ",
            "\u00a0This course really allowed me to take a deeper look at the opinions I hold on meaningful pursuits and experiences in life. It also gave me a basic understanding of different traditions and religions, and allowed me to understand my own more. ",
            "\u00a0I really learned to open my mind wider than I thought I could. It was a privilege to be exposed to so many traditions, both religious and secular, and be challenged to imagine their practices in my own life. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me an introduction to the world's major religions and philosophies of life (e.g. Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, utilitarianism, Marxism, etc.). Through the course , I learned how to think about questions such as \"what does it mean to live a good life?\" and \"for whom/what do I live this life?\". "

            "\u00a0Strengths: excellent structure, excellent teaching, interesting readings, challenging assignments. Fascinating guest speakers.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I feel like we needed more than 12 students in the seminar. Maybe 14? 16? Sometimes the conversation was going in circles and we were not getting anywhere productive. ",
            "\u00a0strengths-- a community that is built up\r\ncons- exclusive, essays are graded up to professor and too much, TOO MANY readings ",
            "\u00a0This course was overall very well moderated.  A weakness could be the occasional lack of practicality- sometimes discussions were too ethereal and never came back to application. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: choosing incredible readings and discussion format\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the readings were a bit inaccessible or hard to understand. ",
            "\u00a0This class also was one of the first in which I didn't feel like I was taking it partially for the gradeI genuinely enjoyed seminar every week and thought the course material was important to discuss for non-academic reasons, too. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - The instructors are incredible and the material is well thought-out. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - A little more background each week on the readings would be appreciated! ",
            "\u00a0The course did a great job introducing students to the major life philosophies. I really like the combination of 2 seminars and 1 lecture per week. The guest speakers that came during lectures were often some of my favorite parts of the course. It was really cool to see people that had dedicated their lives to each one of these religions. The retreat was also really cool.\r\n\r\nI wish the course would focus less on big principles and more on the meaning of everyday actions. I often times found it hard to relate to the philosophical arguments of e.g. utilitarianism, Marxism, etc.  This is especially true since we only spent a week on each of these. Furthermore, I didn't like when professors had prepared speeches for lecture and simply read them. These were often filled with unnecessarily complicated vocabulary and were much more difficult (and boring) to follow than less planned lectures. "

            "\u00a0Yes, I would, but only if they understand what the course is about. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend this to anyone at all who wants to have a transformative experience in a class at Yale. Forget Psych and the Good Life, this is where it's actually at. ",
            "\u00a0yesSSSS!!! IT WONT change your life but It will teach you to think and consider values and ideasa that will then help you live a life that's worth living ",
            "\u00a0Yes.  This is an essential survey of philosophies. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely- the course made me take a step back and begin to appreciate my roots. The course helped me introspect and evaluate what I want in the present moment, and later on in life. Hearing others lives worth living in our seminar was also awe inspiring and made me appreciate the class that much more. ",
            "\u00a0YES!! This is one of the best courses I've taken at Yale and really made me reconsider many beliefs that I take for granted. Also, the others students in the class were amazing and challenged me in important ways. Please take this if you have the chance. ",
            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND!!! This course is so very unique and is the kind of thing you talk to your friends about outside of class all the time! If you are hoping to come across ideas and questions that will stick with you throughout your career at Yale and beyond, take this course!! What an amazing cap to senior year! ",
            "\u00a0I would totally recommend this course! Even though most of the readings didn't necessarily vibe with me, the course was great because it got me thinking a lot about what is important to me and what makes me happy. The essays in particular are meaningful because they force you to think about what Yale, other people, and you yourself expect of you. It helped me see more clearly that Yale is pushing me in a academic direction in which I do not necessarily want to go. While I still don't have everything figured out, this course will definitely play a fundamental shaping my road ahead. "
