While I was apprehensive about this format at first, I believe it aided my own engagement with the material and facilitating more ingrained learning.  The downside of such a format is that we often did not have time to finish or go over the answers to at least some of the problems on a given day, meaning we received little feedback on all the iterations of a given concept with which we may be confronted on an assessment.

A weakness is that some more difficult topics that were not as related to everything else we learned, like solids of revolution, were rushed and I felt that spending more time on them would have been helpful.
