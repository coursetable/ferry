            "\u00a0Learned about research opportunities across Physics, Applied Physics, Astronomy, and other related fields. ",

            "\u00a0Could be improved by having more professors from physics come to speak (I feel like it was mostly applied physics professors or professors in other departments). Also invite the applied physics 1st years to join this seminar. It would be useful for them as well. ",
            "\u00a0Not more than 2 speakers per seminar, otherwise the presentations are more likely to be too broad and not specific ",
            "\u00a0It would be better to space out some of the talks towards the start of the year. ",
            "\u00a0The course is a wonderful idea, but it would be great to have a better selection over topics in physics. For example, there were very few theorists and I would have loved to see the quantum information group (Michel Devoret/ Robert Schoelkopf) or Dave DeMille's group also represented, as they are on the frontiers of their research. ",

            "\u00a0Sure, you get pizza and get to hear about research across the department. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, for a first year graduate student I think having such a view of all the research going on at Yale is very necessary, even if he/she has already decided on an advisor. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially if that student is still unsure of which lab to join. ",

            "\u00a0Yes. This course is particularly useful for first year graduate students at Yale, even if they are fairly confident about their plans in graduate school. "
