This is crucial for my development as a researcher and this class is unique for offering that training. ",

            "\u00a0This course could be improved by assigning reviews rather than primary literature. Allowing students to pick primary literature may prevent classes from becoming journal clubs, as not all students would have read the same primary papers. It may also help the presentations be broader to improve engagement in discussions by having open-ended questions. "
