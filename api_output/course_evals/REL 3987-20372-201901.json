            "\u00a0Shepard was very kind and very patient with our group. He was very understanding of the dynamics of our group and the age and experience differences. He was very encouraging and kept a good balance between edification and exhortation. ",
            "\u00a0Very compassionate, calming presence. Didn't always keep us on topic though, so we didn't end up having much time to do what was scheduled for us. ",
            "\u00a0Rev. Tracy did a good job leading our small group. She created a welcoming environment where students felt supported. My only frustration stemmed from certain students who sometimes used our group as therapy. ",
            "\u00a0I met with Sr. Ann regularly  with regards to planning retreats and prayer services.  She was always available to discuss issues as they came up.  She was extremely helpful with guiding me through processes and expectations. We worked on the Advent treat together. She treated me as a partner in the process. I am very grateful.\r\n\r\nSr. Mary and I met for 1 hour weekly for theological reflection on my work. We also worked together for St. Brigid's retreat, a Celtic prayer service and on the three of the Triduum services.  My time with her was invaluable and I was privileged to have had the opportunity to work with her. ",
            "\u00a0Bill was a great personality to lead our practicum discussions. Though he seemed to disregard the weekly assignments, at least for the second half of the year, I didn't ultimately care because I didn't understand why the assignments were important in the first place. Bill led great open discussions in each week of practicum and I felt supported by him and the rest of my group when talking about struggles I had in my site. I will say, however, that since my site was a non-church setting, I don't know if Bill really knew how to help me - he's a Baptist preacher and I am a Unitarian Universalist working in a non-religious organization, so I don't think he knew what to make of me most of the time. ",
            "\u00a0Tracy was great. She facilitated conversation well. I wanted her to talk more. Sometimes her face clearly gave away that she had comments, but then she wouldn't say them. ",
            "\u00a0He's a great moderator of the practicum. I enjoyed a lot having conversation with him. ",
            "\u00a0Tracy was incredibly knowledgeable and engaged in our practicum discussions. She asked insightful questions and went above and beyond to help us be successful and thriving in our site placements. ",
            "\u00a0Alison proved to be an excellent listener, always paying careful attention to where we were and what was going on in the room, in order to adjust the content of the session. Her advice was always very helpful and she made sure to always ask us first what we thought about a situation, what we would recommend: she moderated our conversations in a way that was empowering for everybody and made sure to make room for everybody. Her comments and the way she checked on us was always very thoughtful. Her emotional intelligence is absolutely remarkable and, as a leader herself, she shared - both through her words and acts - the various parameters to take into account in a situation in order to find the healthiest and wisest options to move forward. ",
            "\u00a0Alison was a spectacular group leader. Her pastoral skills and organizational know-how are top-notch. I credit the positive experience I had in this class primarily to her weekly leadership. ",
            "\u00a0Joyful person! Easy-going, warm and encouraging. Good insights and questions during weekly check-in sessions. ",
            "\u00a0Alison Cunningham is an excellent section leader. She encourages individual reflection and participation. The section drew out the differences in our supervised ministry sites, and offered reflection on how to manage each of our challenges. She was excellent at enabling us to come together as a group, notwithstanding differences in our faith traditions or callings to ministry. She was exceptionally helpful in coaching me towards understanding  how I had grown within my supervised ministry experience. ",
            "\u00a0Shepherd was always a champion for students within practicum. He was so excited to be there, and his kindness made practicum much easier. However, He often had difficulty pushing us or giving critique, which then led the rest of the group to be more reticent to do so. ",
            "\u00a0Shepard is the best! He did a fantastic job making people feel special and holding space for open conversation. He was intentional about the things we needed to cover and kept the meetings fairly structured, but he was also flexible and changed the plan to make it the most beneficial for all of us. And the Holy Spirit MOVED. ",
            "\u00a0Rev Mathis was a really great practicum leader. He let the conversation find its natural course and helped us think about timely issues and give space to anything we were struggling with at our sites. ",
            "\u00a0Alison has many strengths. During our time with Alison, she exuded a calm that encompassed our group to the point where we, her students, felt that we had a space to come to extract enough confidence to go back out into our ministry sites to face our challenges and to do so, successfully.  Alison listened to her students concerns and suggested possible ways the matters might be resolved.  Alison celebrated our successes as though they were her own.  As, Alison's students, we felt listened to, appreciated and celebrated. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Honest and empathetic. Knowledgeable about the realities of ministry. ",
            "\u00a0Katie was great at making us feel welcomed, valued, and included. The group dynamics were generally positive and I attribute that to Katie's optimism and personality. She has a pastoral heart to the core.\r\n\r\nKatie could improve by allowing students to more fully inhabit the times when they are not feeling well emotionally, to counter her wonderful upbeat personality with some more quiet, reflective times in practicum. Additionally, we had one student who consistently dominated the energy and discussion in the room. I wish Katie had been better able to manage the time spent with each person in the room, although I recognize how hard of a task that would be, given some of the personalities present. ",
            "\u00a0OMG SHE WAS WONDERFUL!!!!! Understanding, non-judgemental, caring, looked out for us, was attentive to whether we were being treated fairly at our internships, created a loving, safe environment for us. This class feels like yet-another-box-we-have-to-tic in our very hectic schedules, but Tracy somehow made it a nurturing space we all looked forward to attending. "
