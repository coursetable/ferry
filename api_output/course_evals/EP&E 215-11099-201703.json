            "\u00a0I learned some core political philosophy tenets and how to evaluate political philosophy in light of some more modern political institutions. I learned how to read some philosophical texts better. ",

            "\u00a0The course had an excellent selection of readings, and the essay questions brought coherence to each topic.\r\n\r\nI would have preferred submitting papers a day after the seminar during which we discuss the material; this would have given students an opportunity to consider rebuttals and develop their arguments more fully. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: It's straight forward in how its laid out, going from institution and institution and that it's laid out around one thesis. It draws on a variety of readings. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I had a few issues with the course. Firstly, I think that the thesis that it's laid out around is pretty meh. It wasn't a thesis that remotely got me excited, that I cared about proving, nor that I saw the importance of proving. I understand that creating a thesis maybe gives the course some guidance, but the thesis just seemed kind of pointless to me (and I'm not sure I agreed with it). Secondly, I think the course doesn't work as a seminar with 7 kids, especially when a couple of them don't speak often. No matter how long Professor Sabl spoke at the beginning of class, it still meant that essentially 4-5 kids had to have an 80 minute long conversation about tons of reading. That's a lot of responsibility to prepare for that much and the readings were unreasonable given that we were held accountable for them every week (realistically in most Yale seminars there's a couple weeks a semester when you don't do the reading because of other work, that was impossible in this course because everyone needed to speak for 20 min to keep discussion going). This isn't really a flaw in the course design as much as the pure demand for it, but Professor Sabl should've adjusted readings accordingly. Finally, I think the method of assessment in the course wasn't great. Quite frankly, reading for each week was already enough work, there wasn't legitimately enough time to do the readings and write the type of paper that Professor Sabl was looking for. Some seminars ask for a quick reading response each week, or one reaction paper, I've never been in one that asks for 4 thorough 1,900 word reaction papers held to a pretty high standard. Furthermore, the fact that you had to choose paper weeks before the semester starts made things unnecessarily difficult (it's hard to foresee whether readings will inspire interesting thoughts and it's hard to foresee whether there's bottleneck in work). I just don't think it was a good method of assessment, I'd rather have written 2 longer papers answering deeper questions and over a different period of time. The final was okay, I found the questions to be kind of vague. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that this class benefitted from being focused on institutions rather than texts. I felt like I came away with some really important ideas, frameworks, and questions that would have been less cogent or relevant in the context of a \"Great Books\" class. I also think that the class assignment structure was ideal. "

            "\u00a0Awesome course! ",
            "\u00a0I would; this course challenged my beliefs about modern political institutions. ",
            "\u00a0I took this as a requirement for EP&E. Some of the material was quite interesting and Professor Sabl is nice and is quite smart, but the course is not well organized and from what I've heard is not as good as Kapustin's version. Take this if you need to for the major and Kapustin's doesn't work with your schedule, but otherwise I'd go with Boris. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course with Sabl, absolutely. He is a professor who is brilliant, organized, and motivated to actually teach. The texts were thought provoking, and discussions were fruitful and well managed. An excellent class. "
