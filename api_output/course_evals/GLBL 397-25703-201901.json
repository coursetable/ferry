            "\u00a0A pretty thorough knowledge of Russian foreign policy decision-making throughout a fairly wide range of history. ",
            "\u00a0This course definitely provides a good overview of Russian history for the last 300 years, as seen through the lens of foreign policy.  Even though Professor Graham has focused on specific case studies, together they provide an accurate picture of the major events in Russia's history.  The short papers also provide some necessary motivation to become a more concise, clearer writer. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a better understanding of patterns in Russian diplomatic history. Many of the topics we touched on I had learned about in high school and college history classes, but we approached them with greater rigor and from a political science perspective, which gave everything an interesting twist. ",
            "\u00a0I began the class with very little background information on Russian history or foreign policy, and what I did know was strictly related to interactions with the United States. This course provided a great foundation in geographical and historic challenges to Russian foreign policy. Realizing there was no real history of private property ownership helped me understand the willingness to support communist governments. There were so many instances where I thought, \"ok, that background helps explain why this strange action was taken 20, 40, or 60 years later.\" "

            "\u00a0This was a really strong course overall. The structure of class was really clear and helped the class work through and understand the material in a really interesting and engaging way. I really like how the same structure and main questions were applied to each case study - it allowed us to make interesting comparisons between case studies in very different points in history. The readings were never too much to handle and were pretty much always interesting. ",
            "\u00a0The course is so well organized.  Professor Graham has articulated five key questions that are answered when discussing each case study every week, which is such a fantastic way to connect the course despite the fact that each week focuses on a new case study.  The last class then focuses on some major questions, which are answered using the case studies covered throughout the entire semester.  Such a helpful way to know what should be taken away from this class / summarizing the main ideas in order to really understand Russian Foreign Policy! ",
            "\u00a0Professor Graham and the subject material are the strengths. The professor is clearly very knowledgeable, and his interpretations were always welcomed by the class. The subject material was also very interesting. The weaknesses was the seminar structure. I feel that this class would have been more enjoyable as a lecture, as often times the discussion was insubstantial as students searched for something to say that would please the professor or that (sometimes) had no basis in anything other than their personal opinion (i.e not the readings.) ",
            "\u00a0The readings were well organized, informative, and useful. The class time was efficiently structured, offering a brief review of our last topic, a quick introduction and overview of that day's topic with maps, pictures, and other aids to fill in any gaps in the readings, then a discussion, and wrap up with the same 5 questions each week, which allowed an ongoing comparison between case studies. The instructor did an excellent job of leading class discussions and engaging the whole group. He challenged our thinking and assumptions and I felt like I always learned something new from the interpretations and impressions of the other students. We lucked out with a small, engaged group of students who nearly always came well prepared for class, but even that can be attributed to the course design and structure. Plus, I think everyone enjoyed it enough that they wanted to do the readings. One of the best classes I've taken at Yale. "

            "\u00a0This was probably one of my favorite seminars at Yale and I would highly recommend it. The course covers a really broad range of history and allows you to see long term patterns and changes across a much wider period of Russian foreign policy. Professor Graham is just excellent as well. It is really interesting to think about foreign policy decision-making from the Russian perspective, which isn't always intuitive but is always interesting. The grading isn't hard (at least from my experience) and the workload is fairly low for a seminar (two pretty short papers and one medium length paper). The papers are very interesting to write, as they are basically thought exercises that have you analyze topics from class in an interesting way. Great class overall, take it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Readings are a a bit long but no reading responses. All you have is a midterm paper, presentation, and a final paper ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! As you learn throughout the course, Russia is such an important actor throughout history, so it's really important (and interesting) to view much of the last 300 years through the Russian lens.  Such an important perspective to gain. ",
            "\u00a0I would! I'm sure with more students it would be a more interesting classroom environment, and I understand that this year (where there were only 7 or so students) was somewhat of an outlier. ",
            "\u00a0This was a fantastic course and one of my favorites I've ever taken at Yale. The subject material is fascinating, but the real star of this course is the way Professor Graham has designed it. He sets up every class with great exposition and explanation, and the discussion is fantastic. Work load is minimal and reasonable, and Professor Graham gives good feedback. I would not hesitate to take this class, and not only will you actually learn something from seminar, but it won't be hard throughout. ",
            "\u00a0I cannot recommend this course enough. The instructor was fabulous and did an excellent job of designing and executing an engaging course. The readings were approachable and interesting. The class discussions were probably the most robust I've had at Yale. "
