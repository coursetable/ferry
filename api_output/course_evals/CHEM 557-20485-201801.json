            "\u00a0I learned a ton in this course. I found that there were a lot of gaps in my fundamental knowledge of group theory and crystal field theory, and I feel like this class did a great job of filling in those holes. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, this was a very in-depth class on coordination chemistry. I'm glad I had the chance to take it and learn where things came from. I had learned about character tables before and that SALCs existed, but not how we got them. ",
            "\u00a0Fundamental knowledge of group theory and coordination chemistry, ",
            "\u00a0Learning the basics of coordination chemistry! ",

            "\u00a0Very well organized. Assignments facilitated understanding. Long, but not challenging. Reinforced important concepts. I very much appreciated the balanced workload of the course and the fact that the presentation/term paper (great to learn about/write on what you are interested in!) was at the beginning of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Really well taught! Well organized and the progression made logical sense. I like how class notes were written and the use of supplementary handouts. Appreciated the detailed feedback on the presentation/paper. ",
            "\u00a0The only weakness I think is that it would have been nice to learn a little more of the new, cutting edge kind of topics, but this course was mostly foundational. ",
            "\u00a0Lecture is run very well. Writing on the chalk board is much easier to follow than when professors use powerpoint slides. Problem sets seemed a bit longer than necessary, especially when we were just doing the same process over and over again for multiple questions. The paper and presentation being early in the class was also nice, the end of the semester is always so hectic. The exams reflected what we had covered fairly well. ",
            "\u00a0The course was organized and thoroughly covered the fundamentals.\r\n\r\nI would have liked if the course could have delved deeper into advanced topics in coordination chemistry. ",
            "\u00a0Problem sets were very challenging and helpful! It would be nice to have a teaching assistant or additional practice. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, the course was well organized and easy to follow. Exams were very fair and followed the material covered in class. The project on compairing a seminal paper in coordination chemistry to current papers was very interesting and I feel I learned a lot through completing mine and watching others present. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely. It is engaging, interesting, not overwhelming, and pushes your understanding of inorganic chemistry through consideration of thoughtful questions. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, while I can't say I always loved taking this course, I think it has been important in my overall education. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student who had little to no experience with group theory. Students who have seen this material already will only be moderately challenged. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was informative. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course was very interesting and overall great to learn and review inorganic coordination fundamentals.  I learned a lot from Nilay's approach and enjoyed this course. "
