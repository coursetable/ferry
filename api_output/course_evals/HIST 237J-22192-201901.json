            "\u00a0In-depth knowledge about Greek politics, which I had wanted to get to know for a while. Reading long-form articles was a skill I acquired over the course of the semester. Discussion of historical documents and ideas, with lateral thinking of the greater Western world through the lense of Modern Greece. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about Modern Greek history, where previously there was a large gap in my knowledge. I learned to think critically about how different historical events are presented and retold. I also developed my writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0This was the first \"real\" History class I had taken (I have taken intellectual history classes before, very different from this). It was really cool to see the origins of the nation-state thru the particular circumstance of Greece. Writing both papers was really fun too. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I enjoyed how it was so discussion based. A little too much reading on some occasions, but nothing more than that. ",
            "\u00a0The course is well laid out and structured in a way that facilitates learning. Professor Aslanidis is very dedicated to his students' learning. The readings are wide-ranging, interesting, and very informative. ",
            "\u00a0It would be helpful if the only 2 assignments in the course werent graded on a 0/10 scale. ",
            "\u00a0The seminar discussion is dependent on very long readings, honing in on particular dates and facts that one might not remember. I think students should be reminded to build the arc of the \"story\" each week on their own so they can synthesize everything a lot better. That or weekly 1-2 page reading responses would be super helpful. "

            "\u00a0A great instructor who is very approachable and willing to discuss problems and ideas with you out of class. A good way to learn about a country that is underappreciated in today's world. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you have any interest at all in learning about Modern Greece (which, as this class will teach you, you should). You will learn how integral Greece is to European and world history, and learn a lot about a country that has recently made news only for bad reasons. ",
            "\u00a0Not unless theyre particularly passionate about Modern Greece ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another. Very interesting material, Greece's history is fully of spicy characters. It's a shame Paris won't be here teaching next semester, but I know future students will benefit a lot from taking at least one class with him! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Aslanidis is lovely, and extremely attentive to how his students learn best. This class was laid-back but full of really interesting information; you should do the readings but if you don't have time to do them carefully, you're gonna be totally fine and you're still gonna learn a lot. I felt both supported and challenged, which is the best possible combination in a seminar. Take the class! Modern Greece is probably way more interesting and important than you think. "
