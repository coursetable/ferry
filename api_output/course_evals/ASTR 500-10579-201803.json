            "\u00a0It was a good refresher on all of the undergraduate courses in astro that I took. ",
            "\u00a0The 1st part of the course, radiative transfer, Fourier Transform is a review for me. As for the 2nd part, I learned some useful knowledge about fluid dynamics in this course. I found the take-home exams to be very useful particularly. Doing the disk problems, the Pluto project and also calculating the dynamic friction in gas disk provide me some theoretical understanding that will allow me to study more on star and planet formation in the future.

            "\u00a0I like how the course covered many different aspects of astrophysics. However, because we covered so many different topics, it often made studying for exams harder. ",
            "\u00a0The overview nature of the course makes it very scattershot. The fact that it is designed to help those who have little astro background means it is often just rehashing things for students who have astro backgrounds. ",
            "\u00a0The overall course structure is very well designed. I like the idea of creating the modules that cover both necessary math and the physics behind the astrophysical systems. The course gives a comprehensive overview of all the physics involves in all the area in astronomy. From stellar physics to galaxies and black hole accretion, all of the topics are very interesting. It is a pity that we don't have enough time to go into more depth in all the topics. My suggestion for this is to give further readings. Maybe giving students 1~2 most important papers on that topic to read will be helpful. "
