            "\u00a0The class was very helpful in helping us get research going, both by introducing us to the challenges and processes, and by challenging us to come up with a viable research idea. ",
            "\u00a0Learned how to think about writing political science papers. ",
            "\u00a0This course was helpful in setting a research agenda for the year and understanding how other students were going about their research. Being given a class whose purpose is to iron out a research project is extremely helpful and the framework provides some guidance for less experienced scholars (like myself) to take a chance on research. ",
            "\u00a0The course was useful for my progression towards doing my own research, as well as learning about the publishing process in our field. ",
            "\u00a0how to formulate a good research question ",
            "\u00a0This course was helpful in giving me the time and tools to think through a research question and how best to develop into a research design. ",
            "\u00a0I was able to read broadly in the field of political science, especially areas that may lay outside of my primary research interests. ",

            "\u00a0The class was very well designed for its purposes. I enjoyed starting with general discussion on how research works, and then getting and giving feedback on students projects. ",
            "\u00a0I thought it was well run and helpful. ",
            "\u00a0More direct feedback upfront about the strength and weaknesses of my research design, what may or may not be possible in a research project, the logistics of research, would have been helpful.\r\n\r\nPeer feedback was useful but could have been more useful if we were put in small groups and gave concentrated feedback. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strength was getting feedback from the instructors and fellow students. Reading the published articles was somewhat helpful, but seemed like a lot of work for what we got out of it (could have read a few articles instead of 3 full journals). ",
            "\u00a0The amount of independence to develop a project is both a strength and a weakness -- at times it felt really helpful to have so much time to work on my project without a pressing deadline, but at other points I felt like I was maybe falling behind. Some more benchmarks to ensure that I'm making adequate progress may have been helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The clear strength of this course it forcing students to embark on what may be their first research project aimed for publication. One possible suggestion for improvement is to provide graduate students with a brief overview of the resources available to them at Yale for their projects, potentially aggregated by subfield and/or methodology. While the need to cultivate a cordial environment is appreciated, at times increased critical feedback from instructors would have been appreciated, particularly with regard to methodology. ",
            "\u00a0This course required students to work on their research without a formal timeline of requirements. I found this beneficial; that I was able to pursue my own interests with the support of my peers (and instructors). ",
            "\u00a0This course was not very useful for me as a theorist. I learned very little about the landscape of theory journals or the different approaches to writing publishable theory papers. The course seemed to be designed almost exclusively for political scientists, and what I learned about political science publishing was not particularly applicable to the type of work I hope to engage in. The feedback in class was also not useful, as peers who were not political theorists did not particularly engage.  \r\n\r\nThe only useful feedback I got was from the theorists when we met for a day as a group (the day class was cancelled). I am in ongoing conversation about my work with the other theorists anyway, so this didn't really add anything new. I was very disappointed with with this course overall. \r\n\r\nThe best thing about this class was having a deadline. "
