            "\u00a0This course helped me develop problem solving skills to solve organic synthesis questions and how to work around certain caveats and issues that may arise in a synthesis. Not only did this sort of thinking help me in this course, but these problem solving skills can be applied to many other fields and avenues in life. This course focused especially on the use of trends, resonance, electronics, molecular orbital theory, and sterics to be able to predict reactions and outcomes, without ever having to memorize them. ",
            "\u00a0This course teaches students about the fundamentals of organic chemistry: alkyne chemistry, resonance, aromaticity, the Diels-Alder reaction, carbonyl chemistry, and amine chemistry. After taking this course, students will have a strong intuition for deciphering reaction mechanisms and designing chemical syntheses. Students will also have a strong understanding of the relative acidities of different classes of compounds, and how to determine which compounds are more acidic than others. ",
            "\u00a0I continued my learning in the tools necessary to think as an organic chemist, especially by emphasizing mechanisms and syntheses. A lot of the early part of the course is spent on learning the Diels Alder reaction, and then we spent a great deal of time on carbonyl chemistry. ",
            "\u00a0I developed an intuition for the types of reactions that occur in organic chemistry. ",
            "\u00a0This class covered the important reactions of organic chemistry and how those related to some biological processes. ",
            "\u00a0My past (six) chemistry classes at Yale were more conducive of learning bits and pieces of chemistry for psets and exams and then studying for finals in this compartmentalized way, which isnt terrible, but in this class each unit anew was really focused on understanding and learning to apply perhaps the same knowledge in different ways, so, as an overachieving non-technical take-away, I was able to leave the class understanding big picture concepts in chemistry like I hadn't before.

            "\u00a0I very much so enjoyed having this course twice per week, as opposed to Orgo I which was held for 3x for 50 minutes. With longer modules, it is easier to cover more material and there is less time spent getting back into the flow of things and changing to an organic chemistry mindset. The 50 minute modules that meet three times a week are much less productive and feel very brief and choppy.\r\n\r\n The small class size was fantastic and really allowed the professor and students to interact and learn better. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses of this course are that there are not as many biological applications as I would have liked to see. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The course meets twice a week (Monday and Wednesday) rather than three times a week, which gives students more free time on Friday. The lectures are clear, and Professor Spiegel is very good about emphasizing the fundamentals of organic chemistry that show up over and over again. The tests are very fair, and Professor Spiegel is very transparent about the topics that will be covered on each test. The TA posts lecture notes after each lecture. The peer tutor this year was incredibly helpful.\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the questions on the second and third problem sets required knowledge of information that was not covered until after the problem sets were due (particularly the Baeyer-Villiger reaction). This could be remedied if the instructor covered the relevant reactions prior to the problem sets' due dates, or included some sort of indication of where to find any relevant information that was not yet covered. However, this is not a major issue; the peer tutor taught us relevant information that was not yet covered if we went to him for help. ",
            "\u00a0I think it would be better to slightly restructure the syllabus so that Diels-Alder doesn't take as many lectures to teach as it now does, so that one or two more lectures can be devoted to carbonyl chemistry, especially towards the end of the unit (where multiple reactions were taught in each lecture). Overall, though, the syllabus made sense and the reactions were not too difficult to understand. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths -- Professor Spiegel made an effort to get to know each of us in the class, and was also very interested in hearing feedback and improving the class based on the feedback. Additionally, I felt that the flow of topics was intuitive, which made it much easier to grasp the concepts. I enjoyed having the class twice a week, as I felt having the longer class periods allowed us to immerse ourselves into the topic. Additionally, I thought the exams were fair but challenging. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses -- The problem sets could sometimes be lengthy -- while they provided valuable practice, I think that some of the book problems could have been shortened, or made optional, so that we could have more flexibility in completing them. Alternatively, problem sets could have been posted earlier to give us more time to work through the concepts. ",
            "\u00a0The class was arranged quite well. Everything we learned was essential to the text and problem sets so there wasnt any extraneous information. The midterms and final exam were very fair and accurately tested the information while also forcing us to build on our skills and find new ways to put different reactions together. Also, having 2 classes a week instead of 3 was very very helpful and left a lot of good time in the week to ask Professor Spiegel and our TA for review sessions or office hours. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to others. Many people dislike organic chemistry because they see it as a \"weed out\" course for premed, but if you put in the time and effort the material is very enjoyable. Chemistry and organic chemistry are very generative and the problem solving aspect makes it very interesting. The applications of what we learned in this class, such as the synthesis of various pharmaceuticals and interactions between compounds and DNA for example, were also very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student. The course meets twice a week for 75 minutes instead of three times for 50 minutes, which gives students more free time on Fridays. The lectures are clear, and emphasis is placed on many fundamental principles of organic chemistry, which ensures that students will remember those principles. Professor Spiegel is very flexible when it comes to scheduling review sessions, and is even willing to give extra lectures at unconventional times if the students request it. Professor Spiegel's tests are very fair, and he is very transparent about the topics covered on each exam. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend the off-sequence organic chemistry courses, simply because the smaller class sizes ensure that you get much more personalized learning and interaction with the professor+TA. The exams are much less stressful than the on-sequence class, probably in large part due to the absence of a toxic pre-med culture in the off-sequence. The smaller class size also makes it a lot easier to simply enjoy the material as you learn it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I am glad I took this course off sequence. The small class size was a plus, and I thought that Professor Spiegel organized the course well. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This class was much better for me than on-Sequence Orgo II because the smaller class size and organization go curriculum was much clearer and easier to learn from. I also felt that the tests were more clearer and greatly improved my opinion of organic chemistry as a subject. ",
            "\u00a0Even though the standard for orgo 2 is knowing and being able to use a certain set of reactions/reagents/etc, the focus here was more on understanding generally applicable concepts (e.g how electrons behave in different situations), and appreciating that details necessary to answer problems on exams would henceforth fall into place or at the least then be very easy to study. Although orgo 2 wasnt a major requirement / am not pre-med and accordingly I was apprehensive at first since I wouldnt use specific reactions in the future, I was pleasantly surprised by the usefulness of the course for general scientific understanding. So, Id recommend the course to fellow Yale students interested in science. "
