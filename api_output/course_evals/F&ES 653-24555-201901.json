As someone with no real experience in Maple, I am walking away having learned a lot. I think I learned the most from Joe's own experiences and what he was able to teach us from first hand expertise. ",

Off tasting sap and why, different types of syrup beyond maple (birch, etc.). Greater appreciation for maple syrup in general after knowing just what goes into it. ",

I was in a group of 10 people for the project, which is just too big and doesn't facilitate a group atmosphere in which everyone contributes to the work or works efficiently.\r\n\r\nThis course's strength was eating maple syrup in class! Kidding, kind of. That's true, but also I really appreciated Joe's clear, infectious love for the subject. He made it really fun to learn. ",

            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the course overall. I think for the amount of time we had Joe did a really good job covering as much material as he could but also having a relaxed lecture environment such that people felt comfortable asking clarifying questions and fleshing out certain concepts if need be. I think this was the right way to approach it given that we did not have a ton of time every week to discuss and had to make it through a certain amount of content. I also really enjoyed getting to go outside whether it be on the fields trips or even just out behind Marsh to help us novices get a sense of what syrupping actually looks and feels like. ",
            "\u00a0Very strong course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Material is great. Professor Orefice is a very engaging lecturer. Field trips were fantastic and I liked that we were encouraged to try boiling sap and making maple syrup ourselves.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Can't think of any ",

            "\u00a0This class was both interesting intellectually and very hands-on, which was awesome -- we took several field trips in order to experience the maple sugaring process first-hand, which really added a lot to the course.\r\n\r\nThe lectures were sometimes a little disorganized and Joe tended to go off on some tangents, so a little more structure and organization to the syllabus would have been good. ",
            "\u00a0This course made it possible for students to learn the basics about how maple products are made and marketed. We also had a few field trips and a class project. However, I do wish that there had been more opportunities for us to engage with the material outside of class (with the understanding that it was a one-credit course). ",

This class is going to teach you about maple trees, forests, sap collection systems, boiling sap, marketing, history, all of it.  If all you want to know is some super specific thing like \"hey can I use maple syrup in this salad dressing?\" then maybe just talk to Joe for 20 minutes one day, you'll probably be bored with most of the course material.  But if you wanna learn about maple syrup, tree to table, then do yourself a favor and TAKE THIS CLASS! ",

            "\u00a0If you were ever considering or wanted to understand the process in sugar making, then I highly encourage you to take this course. There is more to sugar making than just boiling down a lot of sap to produce a little bit of syrup. ",

If you don't think you can think about maple syrup for an entire semester, this might not be the right course for you. "
