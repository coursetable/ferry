            "\u00a0You learn about VLSI design, timing, and architectures to support good designs ",
            "\u00a0An overview of VLSI Design from transistors and logic gates to circuit design. The course incorporates a good balance of theory and practice taken from the professors experience in the industry. ",
            "\u00a0We learned how to built circuits from the transistor material level and upwards, learning timing techniques, optimizations, and current practices along the way. ",
            "\u00a0Many things about VLSI.\r\nHow to use Magic (the software to draw layouts) "

            "\u00a0You learn a lot about the field and it goes very well with other courses such as the chip fabrication class. There's a lot of troubleshooting involved and little tricks that you can learn to get by. There wasn't a lot of guidance, and we all had to figure out the little tricks and design rules ourselves, which was a bit time consuming, but Rajit is great and understands this. It would have been nice to do design reviews after each lab, so we could understand how to better our designs or to do the first lab as a class tutorial instead, so bad habits don't carry on throughout the course. ",
            "\u00a0The course is well-designed with each project building on the previous one in a logical manner. The course could be improved with more comprehensive lecture slides that have more explanation. ",
            "\u00a0Generally I really enjoyed this course. Rajit was a great lecturer and was very helpful with the labs. The labs could be overwhelming at times though; I learned a ton from doing them, but the second lab in particular was a lot to get through. I think breaking the second lab up into smaller chunks could help, because after completing the first lab, I didn't anticipate the second lab taking as much time as it did. Otherwise, I really enjoyed the labs and thought they were well structured for learning. The quizzes and midterm were fair, and I think making them open note really helped my learning because I focused more on fully understanding the concepts than memorizing equations. I do wish we had received feedback on the labs though; I was pretty sure that mine worked, but even working on my final project I had no clue how the other labs would be graded. ",

            "\u00a0Definitely take this course because other students in other universities typically take a course like this and this will catch you up to the curve. You learn a lot about VLSI and Rajit is an expert in the asynchronous clocks/timing field, so you can have an edge when it comes to timing design. It's a lot of time and a lot of troubleshooting involved, but going to Rajit early will help you figure out what's wrong faster than just sitting there and wondering. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. The subject is very practical, interesting, and well taught. I especially enjoy the fact that all tools used in the class are open source so one can delve as low-level as they desire. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in understanding how processors work from the transistor level through the circuit level, this is a great course. Professor Manohar is a great professor who packs a lot into the semester in a meaningful way and the final project is really cool. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. Rajit is a great teacher, the material is really interesting, and the hands on nature of the labs makes you really learn a lot. I can't stress enough though how important it is to start the labs early-- you will always run into problems that you aren't anticipating. Rajit is very willing to help out when you encounter problems, but the labs do end up being more work than you think they're going to be. The quizzes and midterms are very fair though. ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend this course. The course content is super cool, the labs are fun, and the professor is an absolute gem. The course is sufficiently challenging while the work we do is always reasonable (labs and open notes midterm & short quizzes). "
