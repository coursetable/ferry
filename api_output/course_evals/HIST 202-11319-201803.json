            "\u00a0I learned so so much from this class. It is a broad survey of European history and you will leave with a very very good sense of the entire scope. Merriman definitely spends a lot of time on France so prepare for that. You will learn how to study hard since there is a lot of material on the exams and how to write a comprehensive research paper. The paper is really fun! ",
            "\u00a0I learned much about European history. ",
            "\u00a0A great insight of European history of the time period. ",
            "\u00a0You learn a lot about European History! It is focused around France for the most part because Professor Merriman specializes in French History, but overall I really enjoyed it! ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me about how Europe had changed over the last 400 years, and the end of the course specifically, was extremely interesting and examined the causes, political, economical, and social, that led to the beginning of WWI and what factors led to the rise of fascism and other right wing radical parties after the Great War. The course taught me how to think critically in terms of examining events and explaining reactions to their outcomes. ",
            "\u00a0Considering I didn't take AP Euro in high school, this class filled in a lot of the blanks for me. I think I got a better sense of the particularities of European society that will prove useful moving forward in life. ",
            "\u00a0A general overview of European history, with an emphasis on cultural/social themes and trends. ",

            "\u00a0I learned about European history and how it is all intertwined ",
            "\u00a0Great course for a basic overview that makes you feel a little less out of place when the dinner conversation with your European relatives turns to the Treaty of Versailles or the Spirit of Locarno. It won't be enough though to get a full and complete understanding of many important parts of European History (just since so much is covered some of the narratives are a little to simplistic) ",
            "\u00a0Solid understanding of major events and important people from this timespan. The lecture focuses on France (Professor Merriman's area of expertise), but the textbook has tons more information. ",
            "\u00a0a TON about European History. Great perspectives provided by Prof. Merriman. ",
            "\u00a0I have a strong understanding of the period from 1648-1945 in Europe. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a good overview of the development of Europe over the late 18th to early 19th centuries, which I found interesting as I had never studied European history before. ",
            "\u00a0This was a survey course into European History. As the date range suggests, it's obviously a very broad overview that leaves most topics severely underexplored if not altogether disregarded. I didn't really gain any new skills or insights; the course tries to cover a lot and often does so in a way that isn't completely satiating use of primary materials or historical argument directly related to the content of what we learn in lecture and in the primary reading assignments are sparse. This is very much a \"what\" class, what happened and what our conclusion ought to be, with less engagement with the contextual basis or founding of the theories and arguments Professor Merriman advances. ",
            "\u00a0I acquired knowledge of European history from the period 1648 to the end of World War II in 1945. I also learned about the political and social changes that occurred during the period, which, directly or indirectly, led to our modern-day society as we know it. I improved my writing skills with a research paper, and the weekly discussions in section definitely helped improve my understanding of historical events. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a good base knowledge of modern European history upon which I can build with future, more in-depth courses. ",
            "\u00a0Improved my ability to analyze primary sources. Learned invaluable knowledge about European history with a degree of depth that tis highly uncommon. ",

            "\u00a0This was a pretty effective survey course on European history from the Age of Absolutism to World War II. However, we could only give a brief overview and go into detail on a few issues. You should know that professor Merriman focuses heavily on France and likes to give biographies of people he finds interesting, but won't always be the most significant historical figures. Nonetheless, I learned a lot about modern European history and how it affects Europe and the broader world today. ",
            "\u00a0Through the course, I was able to explore the intersection of art and literature with history while gaining a greater understanding of Europe. ",

        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The course is definitely leftist. The professor provides his own political bias with regards to historical events and developments. However, I do appreciate that Prof. Merriman refrains from commenting on current politics. And, he is also very lively and spontaneous. ",
            "\u00a0I thought each lecture was very interesting but also it was hard to follow along at times. I also had a very bad TA which ruined my experience with the class. ",
            "\u00a0The course is overall great, but I would have liked to have known more about the content of the exams. ",
            "\u00a0John is phenomenal. Only weakness is his being sporadic, but the madness all makes sense. ",
            "\u00a0His lectures can go on tangents at times, but his knowledge and experience is worth it! You get more than knowledge about the course, but also real world advice. ",
            "\u00a0I was not a fan of the discussion sections, they added supplementary material such as primary sources (songs and cartoons), but I would much rather have had longer lectures than the two 50 minute ones and covered more content in that time. \r\n\r\nThe course was fantastic in terms of teaching about political patterns at the turn of the 20th century.\r\n\r\nThe TAs however, did not provide clear feedback as to why they took off points on exams and would often take off arbitrary amounts such as .1 or .3 or .7 points out of 4. Their expectations for the IDs were never stated explicitly and they ended up grading based on a different standard. ",
            "\u00a0This course is kind of a gigantic survey, so striking the right balance in terms of the scale of history was important. While I appreciated Professor Merimman's stressing of the social conditions of those who lacked privilege in society, sometimes the class seemed to lurch between macro intergovernmental history and internal social movements with very little lubrication to move us from one topic to the other. That said, Merimman is a real strength of the course because of his idiosyncrasies. I felt he was invested the material, which taught me something about what it means to be a historian. ",
            "\u00a0Great lecture, quality of section dependent on TF ",
            "\u00a0I think the course provides a good survey of European events and ideas. I do wish Prof. Merriman spent more time discussing major events and how they transpired than he did discussing French anecdotes. That being said, he did provide a lot of information about how to think critically about European History, which I appreciated. I also liked hearing his takes on various subjects. ",
            "\u00a0It is honestly perfectly organized, I have no complaints; lectures were at a good time, well structured and paced, and fascinating, and section helped reinforce the topics not only from lecture but also from the readings ",
            "\u00a0I think a little bit more recognition of historiography on part of the Professor could be helpful. Much of what was purported as fact has been disputed by many scholars, and I think a key takeaway from any history course should be that there exist limitations to the materials we have available to us, and that these make it hard to create one simple theory for many things.\r\n\r\nThe course organization was also a little unorthodox - lectures often had very little to do with the material for the week. Rather than spending 30 minutes talking about Peter the Great's appearance, we could have easily talked about some more relevant parts of the history of Russia, such as analyses of primary sources to give some color to what was in the textbook. ",
            "\u00a0Very lecture heavy so if you're not prepared for that don't take it. No powerpoints or anything. Simply a little bulleted list that Merriman lectures on. Works for some people, but many did complain. I do wish there were more graphics shown, there were photographs and paintings shown early on in the course but they really dropped off, and it would've been nice to have those continually. ",
            "\u00a0The major strength of this course is the range of history that it covers. Additionally, the specific periods discussed were interesting, and the supplemental readings were totally engaging. The one weakness of the course would be the overemphasis on French-centric history. For instance, professor Merriman spent the entire lecture on WWII describing Vichy France. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Merriman is wonderful. He knows his stuff. ",
            "\u00a0The main way this course could be improved is in organization. It was often hard to pick out what we were supposed to take away from a lecture, and what seemed like important areas in the readings were often never covered. Also, Professor Merriman had no idea about when/if we were taking finals and midterms, so they kind of came from nowhere. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Merriman is a gem; he cares about his students and about the material that he teaches. That being said, the class was extremely poorly organized. Having taken other introductory-level survey history lectures, I can say that this disorganization is specific to this class. Merriman is smart, but so smart that sometimes he doesn't get to discussing everything he needs to. The lecture is relatively disorganized. Although he sends out a pre-lecture brief bullet-point list of the topics/general outline of each class, note-taking in this class is often a challenge. There are lots of anecdotes, sometimes some numbers, but otherwise lecture is just a watered-down version of the reading assigned. The main source of reading is Merriman's 1000-some page book, which is essentially a textbook that follows the progression of lecture. The reading is often pretty tedious and, in the medium to long run, not all that helpful since the course's scope is so large that you couldn't reasonably be expected to remember the minutiae. Section is often similarly about details and does not really add that much more depth or dimension to what you're getting from lecture and reading. Additionally, there are three mandatory films screened in the evenings. As another point, logistics were extremely unclear. You never knew how much an assignment was worth, or the rubric, standard, and/or curve that you'd be graded on. Not until after the course's completion and with my final grade did I get any breakdown of my scores and how they contributed to the final grade. It also seemed that much, if not all, of this was left to TF discretion. Additionally, there was minimal feedback aside from the midterm grading, which was returned slowly and also marked rather haphazardly. ",
            "\u00a0The course dealt with issues that shaped Europe, however, it sometimes seemed as though it were a class about French history. While the course was often interesting and required the students to be engaged, the repetitive analysis of France rather that Europe was often tedious.\r\nThe course would more interesting if the focus could be shifted to Europe. ",
            "\u00a0The key strength of the course was the lecture itself, which was excellent. Professor Merriman always kept the topics exiting, often using paintings or pictures or anecdotes to detail his points. The weakness of the course was perhaps its sheer breadth. Because the time period was so large it sometimes felt that we were going over huge swathes of history in just a couple of lectures, which made it hard to keep up and stay interested in the work. ",
            "\u00a0John Merriman is an entertaining lecturer, but you will have to learn much of the material on your own. ",
            "\u00a0Sections did a great job distilling important lecture information. ",
            "\u00a0Merriman has a lot of knowledge about European history and explains the course material in a really engaging manner. However the class is highly disorganized and you do not know your grade until after the final exam. ",
            "\u00a0The strongest part of the class is Merriman's lecture - he is an interesting and compelling speaker, and a great teacher to learn from. However, I didn't find the assessments of the class well-suited to learning and actually assessing your abilities - having a midterm and a final felt unnecessary, and I would have much rather taken the time to write an actual essay than take a midterm which was just writing an essay but under a strict time limit and without any resources. ",
            "\u00a0The course did a great job incorporating culture, and I really enjoyed how the lectures did not attempt to cover everything, but rather focused on certain historical figures or themes. Despite covering such a large period of history, the course did a great job of providing sufficient detail on those topics that were covered. ",
            "\u00a0Strength and weakness is Merriman's lectures. While they are quite interesting, they do not compliment the readings well. It would be nice for more summary. The focus is on French history more than it should be. ",
            "\u00a0I think the class is the way it is. Obviously slightly disorganized but also quite fun. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend it because I love Merriman so much but I would warn them that the lectures themselves are kind of confusing. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. The class is enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, take as many classes with John as possible. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in European History than yes. It is a lot of reading, but I found it interesting to learn about Europe as a whole, having only studied one or two countries before this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course is very interesting for anyone who is fascinated by the 20th century and overall is a great survey course of European history. Merriman is phenomenal, and I think everyone should take at least one of his classes at their time at Yale. His anecdotes and teaching style are super engaging. ",
            "\u00a0If you haven't taken AP Euro and want a survey course of post thirty years war European history, take this class. Otherwise probably better to take something more focused. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to someone who wants to learn a little bit about European history without any prior knowledge. It is difficult to know where you stand in this class grade-wise and the lectures can often be really disjointed. But, if you are looking for a class with not a lot of work and some interesting lectures, I would take it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes; a fascinating subject and great lecturer ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend a European History course to anyone, and this will cover enough ground to give enough of an overview. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, an important class to take and even more so if taught by Professor Merriman (he's a living legend) ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but as long as there are new TFs. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I found this course to be a great survey course covering the most important periods and events in modern history. ",
            "\u00a0Great survery course of Western European history. Take it to enjoy the great lectures. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to learn about this subject, there is no better way. ",
            "\u00a0If you take this course, make sure you go to section and take notes - sections are super important and helpful in getting a good grasp on the overall trajectory of the material. Also, Prof Merriman sends out emails before every lecture with a list of terms/keywords for that lecture. Half of the midterm and half of the final are IDs that are taken directly from these lists of terms. There are a ton of them but if you can remember them well, you'll be in good shape for the exams. ",
            "\u00a0If you're looking for a good survey course, I'd recommend this. You do focus on a few random subjects pretty closely and you choose your own topic for the paper, but this course is more of an overview. Also, the Merriman experience is something every Yale history student should experience at some point in their academic career. ",
            "\u00a0If you've never taken a general European history survey course, I might recommend it as a great class to Credit-D, but it is frustrating otherwise. Professor Merriman is great, but the utter lack of organization, structure and transparency makes it a hard class to be motivated to work hard in. It's not difficult, per se, but there's very little incentive to stay engaged deeply and strive for improvement. Although I love history, the reading for this class was always the one I left for last and both lecture and seminar could feel like slogs. Additionally, the independent research paper, which sounded great, ended up being extremely independent  really, there was no guidance whatsoever unless you explicitly sought it out, and even then it was minimal. It was basically \"your paper is due on this date and it can be about anything within the scope of this class!\" The process was much less of a learning experience than I would have hoped. ",
            "\u00a0People often say that \"history repeats itself,\" and taking this course would definitely clear any doubts one might have. The reoccurrence of certain themes across time show how a failure to learn about the past lead people to make the mistakes as the previous generations. I would recommend this course because of its focus on the socio-political aspects of European history, and because there is so much to learn from it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, merriman is a beast. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I thought it was a great introduction to modern history and history at Yale. The lecture was very enjoyable and the reading manageable. There were also interesting films. The paper was enjoyable to write and the final and mid-term not overly stressful. I believe one's enjoyment of the course is quite dependent on their TA, who can definitely make it a lot more or less fun. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely - unmatched European history course. ",
            "\u00a0I might recommend it, but it is definitely Merriman's version of modern European history - it's important to keep this in mind when you take the class. He makes some effort to remain impartial, but for the most part he just gives you his own view on issues and focuses on what he finds interesting. Nonetheless, I still found it an enjoyable and interesting class. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course for anyone eager to explore history. The course provides a broad overview while permitting sufficient opportunities to explore subjects in depth. ",
            "\u00a0I would if you're interested in european history ",
            "\u00a0yes! ",
