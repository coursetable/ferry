            "\u00a0Though I admit I will not remember the particulars as in who-wrote-what, or the nuances of the Persian War, I will forever carry with me this method of thinking that allows us to reflect and synthesize different human cultures, the pattern evident in human nature, and the reasons for our downfalls since the beginning of time. Looking into how people think and analyzing their analysis is one of the most rewarding things I've ever learned. It's a skill I will forever cherish and put into use. ",
            "\u00a0Although I really thought this was just another history and politics class before I entered DS, I have come away from this really understanding the idea of historical and political thought. This class is truly incredible because it motivates students to approach history and politics in a new light. This course really taught me a lot about history through the lens of different authors. I feel like I also got the opportunity to explore an author's take on history from his take on why things are the way that they are. ",
            "\u00a0Better understanding of the evolution of how history was written about and the stylistic choices which historians made, starting with one of the very first histories and moving into the Medieval age. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to analyze texts on such a deeper level and also how to bring into conversation authors separated by thousands of years. ",
            "\u00a0How to basically analyze history and political theory, and perform close readings of ancient writers. ",
            "\u00a0I disliked writing for history when I did it in high school, and so I perhaps came into this course with some negative preconceptions. I still do not love history, but I have more of a begrudging respect for it now.\r\n\r\nThe politics side of the class was what I really enjoyed, and I learned to extract meaning from books that were very complex. Seeing how political thought developed was an interesting theme that ran through the course. ",
            "\u00a0I gained lots of knowledge about the development of historical and political thought (wow!), and certainly refined my writing and my ability to think about such things. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt how to write essays with a hostile reader in mind and to analyse historical and political texts. I also learnt a great deal about change and continuity of ideas concerning historical and political thought from Herodotus to Machiavelli. ",
            "\u00a0Close analysis, especially one upon the historians' uniqueness/technique/rhetoric/psychological method, as well as the link among the different materials. ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge about the many works studied was gained. The insights I've gained are too many to number. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: Though it was a lot of text, section and lecture helped solidify the most important parts.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: more distinctions could have been made to differentiate the different historians (ie Herodotus, Thucydides, Polybius, Livy, Tacitus, etc) from each other, as well as the different thinkers from each other (ie Plato, Aristotle, Maimonides, Aquinas, Al-farabi, etc).\r\n\r\nIt's also a ton of material to cover, and so some readings (especially Augustine) were simply too long for students to get through. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, this was a great course. The strengths of this are that once you understand how to approach a text, it becomes so much more manageable. The section starters are a great addition because they allow students to really become more in touch with one of the texts while asking the questions that they have about why the author makes certain decisions in writing the text. Although it is a lot of material, it seems to all be condensed particularly well in the assignments. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the Directed Studies program is structured efficiently and that all of the classes fit together well. I enjoy the lectures as well as the small seminars, and think that they facilitate great conversation between students and professors and allow for many different readings of texts to come together. There is a good balance between professors teaching the students about aspects of the texts and their histories and the students being able to discuss their own views and how they interpret different aspects of the texts that allows for more open and interesting learning. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: lovely collection of texts, plenty of connection between books, and quite applicable to real life\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the expected reading was extremely long at some times. Because of this, if you even finished the reading it was due to skimming or doing literally nothing else. This was especially true with the Augustine passages. I was sometimes frustrated because I really, really want to deeply understand these books but I just don't have enough time to afford to such a task. ",
            "\u00a0It's a bit difficult to handle all of the reading which could be either a strength or a weakness, but what might help this course the most is limiting mentions of other authors near the beginning of the semester. Later on, there are plenty to talk about and connect with each other, but earlier on, when only a few books have been read by the whole class, it would be beneficial for those with a more limited background of the material if everyone stuck to discussing only the material assigned for class. Additional information about the era or text might be helpful if it is presented in a way that everyone can contextualize and use it. If it's not, then class time where people casually mention the other works they have read is wasted for those unfamiliar with it. ",
            "\u00a0This was a good course. I was challenging, more work than some others, and it is well led. The slight criticism I have would be on some of the books we only spent one section on. Sometimes, perhaps you lose more than you gain when trying to fit more texts in. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: well-organised reading materials, intriguing discussions, close relationship with the professor, and excellent essay questions that help us reread the texts even more profoundly than when we encountered them for the first time. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strength was the expanse of text material studied. Another strength was the professor (and several lecturers) with their invaluable expertise and knowledge. The discussion-based approach for the course is also extremely effective. "

            "\u00a0I would 100% recommend this course. Professor Norma Thompson has changed the way I think about the world. Historical/Political thought in general is an incredibly insightful course, and goes hand-in-hand with the other two DS courses quite nicely. ",
            "\u00a0This is really interesting course because many students do not take this approach to learning about history and politics in high school. It also allows you an introduction to such a wide range of historians, yet you leave feeling like you have a decent understanding of each of the different books that we cover in class. This class was probably my favorite out of the three DS classes! ",
            "\u00a0I think that the assigned workload (weekly readings and five-page papers) is manageable, and allows for students to become more familiar with the books of the classic western canon, as well as develop their paper writing skills. The small seminars keep the class engaging, while the weekly lectures allow for new insight on specific portions of a text that a seminar doesn't typically discuss/delve into. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend to another student. There are so many things to take away, and Norma Thompson really made the class such a lively discussion that enhanced what we were reading. I got very lucky with such a good teacher. ",
            "\u00a0Norma Thompson is an incredible faculty member, and it's a blessing to experience her class as a first-year. If you love the Classics or just want to know more about them, I highly recommend this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only if you are a good student and can balance hundreds of pages of reading a week. If you aren't it will be too painful to be worth it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it seems to be a more engaging version of the poly sci intro course, with some extra bits of history on the side. If you've studied classics, its a bonus, but doesn't make the class much easier. \r\nThere is a lot of writing, and I found this style to be the hardest of the DS courses to write, harder than philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Learned a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course. Norma Thompson is an especially engaging professor who gives good feedback and really pushes you to dive deeper into your initial ideas. Although some of the texts were a bit dry, the majority are interesting enough. ",
            "\u00a0DS H/P is not merely about history or politics, but about the long river of thoughts of historians, which have inherited in the Western civilisation. After a semester, you will be astonished to figure out how our scheme of thought is (more or less) affected by the thoughts of previous thinkers. This is a great pleasure since you can objectively analyse your own perspective and harden your system of thinking. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend Directed Studies as it is an extremely insightful and unique programme within Yale's academic community. The H/P section is particularly great because of the texts studied which, though ancient, bear the foundations of societies today. "
