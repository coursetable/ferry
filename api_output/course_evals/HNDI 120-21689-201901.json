            "\u00a0It primarily felt like a review of L1 with some new concepts tossed in. Maybe learning more grammar patterns would have been helpful with our writing and speaking skills. Both Swapna Ji and Seema Ji are very knowledgeable about Hindi though and are able to help students with worksheets during class, but it would be helpful if we could be sent answer keys after doing an assignment.
