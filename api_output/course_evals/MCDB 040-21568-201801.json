            "\u00a0Lots of detailed knowledge about the history and science of cancer and cancer treatment. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about the intricacies of cancer. The multi-faceted nature of the issues presented to us through the class material painted a complex image of cancer in our society. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to analyze primary and secondary sources and learned how to create cohesive understandings of historical events and legislation, taking the biology of cancer, the state of the research at the time, and politics into consideration. ",
            "\u00a0This course expanded my knowledge and view on cancer. Before taking this course, I was focused on the scientific aspects of cancer and cancer treatment, and although I learned a lot about that in this course, I also became interested in the political side of cancer treatment and how it is viewed from the government's, society's, and drug companies' perspectives. It showed me that issues often have many facets to them, and I really enjoyed discussing all of them. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a lot of knowledge about cancer in pretty much every aspect possible. I learned a lot about the biology of cancer which was very interesting both on a broad level and a more specific one. I learned about the politics having to do with cancer, the history of cancer, healthcare concerns, ethical dilemmas, personal stories. Literally, anything you can learn about cancer, we learned about. ",
            "\u00a0Exposure to a whole new area that I had never really explored! Going in I was more interested in the politics component of the class and I think I was able to get that through my final paper, but the discussions/guest speakers/readings that we had during the semester were definitely eye-opening something I didn't think there was much to. Learned about the science behind today's immunotherapy and targeted therapies, but also the historical development of cancer treatments and how the arc of progress in oncology is about more than just science but also its intersection with the limitations of statistical technique, the realities of acquiring funding, the forces of public opinion, and ultimately, how our society makes progress: a series of trials, some that fail and others that succeed. Going forward I don't think I'll really utilize the science I learned in this class, and cancer policy probably isn't a field I'll end up in either, but if I end up pursuing what my interests current are (technology, policy, access, and sustainable development), then I'll definitely be taking into consideration access to medical research and treatments. The Wikipedia project (which is one of the options for the final project) was also really insightful, and made me reconsider our role as students at a well-endowed research university in disseminating knowledge for public good (for example, Yale provides us with access to numerous academic journals, but for most of the population, that knowledge is locked behind a paywall. Is it right for people to have to pay for knowledge? Should we contribute to efforts to democratize knowledge?). Skills-wise, I definitely got better at skimming research articles more efficiently and grasping the main points. I also got the opportunity to write an in-depth paper on a completely new topic, which gave me experience in constructing a cohesive argument on a topic for which information was scattered and required me to piece together different sources and.

            "\u00a0I learned so much about healthcare, cancer, and medicine in general by taking this course. ",
            "\u00a0This class teaches both the science and politics of cancer in great depth. In addition, the Wikipedia project taught me how to use Wikipedia. "

            "\u00a0Wish it was run as more of a socratic seminar, rather than splitting up into groups and regurgitating the same info covered in readings. I wish there was more analysis, discussion than reiteration. But the content was really great and interesting. Especially enjoyed the Mukherjee reading, documentaries, videos in class. A lot of really great guest speakers too. ",
            "\u00a0The one drawback of the course was the way it was structured in the former half of the semester. Much of in-class time was spent regurgitating readings. There was little room for open discussion and debate. If I were to take this course again, I would prefer to have more discussion amongst peers.\r\n\r\nI believe that class was well-paced. Though we covered a lot of topics, I did not feel at any point that we were rushing through the material. ",
            "\u00a0The course was flexible and Professor Bazell was open to feedback. You get to shape your course experience. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course is its small size, which allows for discussion-based classes. However, I felt sometimes that going over the readings did not help me that much (unless they were confusing), and I would have liked to debate issues from different perspectives and take advantage of the diverse set of interests and backgrounds of my classmates. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course is great in that the subjects and readings are extremely interesting. I also really like that the course is flexible to how we want it to be set up and that Professor Bazell was very receptive to suggestions and feedback. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: interdisciplinary design of the course, guest speakers who shared some really unique insights, the knowledge that I came out with. Weaknesses: for someone without a strong background in the sciences (I didn't take AP Bio), the science parts of the course got difficult at times (and there were many parts of the course that were focused on science, which was totally fine, but I just had more trouble with the bio than I expected to). Readings were heavy for some classes. I personally didn't enjoy the presentation format nearly as much, because I felt like class time would have been better utilized having interesting, open-ended discussions. ",
            "\u00a0I think the material covered in class is incredibly interesting. However, I think a weakness of this course is that Professor Bazell does not really explain much in detail regarding readings or the projects (wiki, final paper) he assigns. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - really interesting material. I really liked a lot of the readings (especially Mukherjee and all the New York Times readings), speaker events, and Wikipedia project. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - the discussions sometimes felt like lectures, which aren't as engaging. Also, for me, the science of cancer was hard to learn, because we read about the science from texts like medical journals. For myself, I like learning science with diagrams, so the scientific part of the class was a bit more challenging. "

            "\u00a0Yes, especially if interested in the social/political side of health. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would highly recommend this class for anyone who is interested in medicine or policy. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you wish to gain a better understanding of how the biology, history, and politics of cancer relate to each other, I would highly recommend this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, regardless of whether the student has STEM or non-STEM interests, they can learn a lot and enjoy the course. It's thought-provoking and the class facilitates discussion and student-learning. Also, the guest speakers are incredibly interesting and cool! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student because it really gives you an incredible view of cancer. You learn about so much having to do with it so if you're interested in cancer, healthcare, or medicine, in general, I would highly suggest it. Even if you're not interested, it's still a really interesting current issue to learn about. The guest speakers were incredible and had so many different perspectives. Professor Bazell was extremely knowledgeable and brought his own perspectives because of his past career which added an incredibly interesting layer to the class. Loved it! ",
            "\u00a0Are you purely interested in the science of cancer? No, this course isn't as science-heavy as other courses you can take. Are you primarily a pre-med or a bio person, still exploring which subfield you want to go into, and want a more broad, multidisciplinary view of the field of oncology and how cancer research intersects with other fields? Are you interested in public health? Yes, this class is perfect. Are you a social science person (such as me, a poli sci major) looking for a policy-focused look a ordinarily STEM-focused field? This class might not have you want. Are you a social science person or a non-science STEM person (such as me, also double majoring in S&DS) looking for a science credit, and willing to go through the science components of the course to get a broad look at oncology? Yes, this class is great. ",
            "\u00a0I think this is a great class to take if you're interested in STEM or in humanities. There is a good balance of topics for anyone and you really do learn a lot. There are incredibly guest speakers that help facilitate understanding by explaining the fields they work in more in detail. ",
            "\u00a0I think if the student has an interest in bioethics or cancer, it is a worthwhile class to take. However, there were times when I felt like the class kind of dragged along. Sometimes we had really interesting discussions, but sometimes, it felt very empty. There are also more readings than some might expect, although I did enjoy many of the readings. "
