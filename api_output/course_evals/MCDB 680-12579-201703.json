            "\u00a0I feel that the knowledge I gained from the course is fairly comprehensive, and covers many aspects of plant biology, including new plant biotech, plant defenses/pathology, the plant circadian clock, and plant development. The lecture sections covered topics that I had largely never encountered, and reading the papers was beneficial in learning about current techniques used to study plant biology. "

            "\u00a0Overall, the course was excellent, and the content was very appropriate and beneficial. The papers were interesting, and the overall classroom environment was supportive and engaging. If I have one complaint, it would be the workload on the weeks in which we had a News and Views article due. It was often challenging to fit two papers and a News and Views into one week, especially with other coursework due in other classes. Maybe just one assigned paper on these weeks?\r\n\r\nI really enjoyed the green cafe presentation! Like we discussed in class, maybe a bit more preparation time, but overall I felt that the expectations were clearly laid out and we had enough guidance to complete the project. "
