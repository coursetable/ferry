            "\u00a0I gained a much better understanding of medieval texts that I had had before. ",
            "\u00a0I've learned more about Chaucer, Donne, Milton, etc. More canon in my brain! ",
            "\u00a0I think I gained a better understanding of how to evaluate poetry (particularly short poems with a limited amount of content) across long essays. ",
            "\u00a0Had a good opportunity to experience a wide range of early English poetry, and the discussions we had provided new insights and ways of thinking about the text. ",
            "\u00a0Thinking critically about poetry, close reading poetry, choosing a topic of interest to analyze in-depth towards the end of the course ",
            "\u00a0How to think critically about poetry and pay close attention to details and how they affect the overall themes and message of the work "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: Good texts are chosen. Chaucer is gone into in some depth, which I liked.\r\nWeaknesses: class is not all that fun. You won't get THAT much out of each class/book based on class discussion. It's kind of what you make of it in terms of actually doing the readings closely on your own. ",
            "\u00a0Since the curriculum is in fact quite varied, it can cause engagement with the material to fluctuate. ",
            "\u00a0The course includes a good assortment of poetry, but I thought it was somewhat imbalanced in that some weeks had very light reading and some weeks had a tremendous amount. I think some of the longer, more challenging texts (the Canterbury tales and Paradise Lost) could've been spread out or excerpted. I liked the subject and spread of our papers. I did not love how the class time was spent. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Minnis is absolutely wonderful! He knows so much about the poetry we read. He is very approachable and gives helpful, constructive feedback at any stage in your paper's process. I loved how the course was designed to help students deal with a range of texts through many essays (and no exam!). I also wish that the class were structured in a way that facilitated discussion better. We had one person present the readings every class, which was great because it got everyone on the same page, but it didn't really allow for much class discussion on the points the presenter found. Maybe it would help if students/Professor Minnis call specific difficult passages to attention and we discussed them? That would add some variety! ",
            "\u00a0Engaging and informative; no real weaknesses "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The discussions in this course are often led by students, who are asked to give presentations at the start of every class, so you are not learning very much from the professor in the end. However, it is engaging enough that you leave it learning something about English poetry. ",
            "\u00a0Now that you can avoid this course and still graduate as an English major, I might. Each class, one student would be assigned to give an overview of the reading, which basically resulted in a good chunk of the class being this person giving a Sparknotes-like overview of the text, which is not all that useful. I thought Chaucer was a pretty interesting unit, but others felt a bit rushed through. It's an okay class. If you really love the authors, and don't really care about in-class discussion, you might like the course. ",
            "\u00a0You will have to take a couple of the preliminary ENGL 12X classes anyways, but I did not find this as engaging as one of the prose fiction classes. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend this course if you're comfortable with your writing skills and want to avoid the stress, work, and mediocre grades of 114,115, or 120. If you'd really like to improve your writing or are looking for a super stimulating class, think about others. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students that want to try out a poetry class or who like spending a lot of time on a small amount of text. If you want to improve your writing through essays, this would be a great class for that too! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Works are interesting and Professor Minnis is great, you will leave with a better understanding both of the works and of how to look at poetry in general "
