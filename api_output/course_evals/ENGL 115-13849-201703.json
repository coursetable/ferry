            "\u00a0I learned how to formulate arguments, outline them, and write them in essay form. I also gained valuable skills for literary analysis. Most importantly, I gained a stronger understanding of important literary works dealing with climate change, as well as a more thorough understanding of the current status of the climate and the role that literary activists play in the long run. ",
            "\u00a0This class is great to develop your writing skills and learn how to construct an academic argument in a sound, organized manner. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how to make arguments about literature, such as how to cite textual evidence and how to write an effective, relevant introduction. ",
            "\u00a0I developed an understanding of underlying issues of climate change. I also learnt how to structure my writing better and improved my critical reading. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to effectively utilize others thoughts and incorporate them into my own arguments. ",
            "\u00a0I'd say that the ability to plan out an essay, going through the process of multiple drafts, was my primary takeaway from this class. I really enjoyed being able to learn about writing by reading different works of literature. \r\n\r\nMore than the skills, I'd say the best part of this class was the content -- learning about climate change, its causes, its links to the modern economy. This was an extremely interesting course in this regard. ",
            "\u00a0Taking this course helped me improve both my English and Writing skills. I feel much more prepared to communicate and express my ideas now. "

            "\u00a0My main complaint with the course was how the assignments were scheduled. This is a problem I had with a past Yale English course as well. I did not like how students would often be expected to both work on an essay and reading class material simultaneously. This is a lot of work, and I would prefer to just focus on an writing assignment alone without having to do any additional reading on top. I feel I would be able to write better essays were I able to concentrate on the essay alone. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the readings, assignments, and feedback given in this class. As a literature class about climate change, the discussions were both interesting and unique. However, sometimes it seemed like the class period itself was not that useful. I learned more from getting feedback on my essays than class itself. Our class was pretty small, so it led to sometimes dry discussions, but I still enjoyed the class fully. ",
            "\u00a0I really like the peer-review sessions where we could learn from each other's papers and receive feedback from a variety of perspectives.\r\nI think it would be better if the professor could include readings about climate change denial to present a more multi-faceted perspective. ",
            "\u00a0The course was centered on a very interesting topic that happens to be extremely relevant to the world today, which makes it very easy to be engaged with the class. ",
            "\u00a0I liked that (unlike English 114) it was not explicitly teaching writing -- but rather, it came naturally through the close analysis of texts. Prof Lindskog also really helped in the drafting and feedback process, which is another strength that this course had (really teaching you how to write). \r\n\r\nAlthough I feel like (in some cases) it might've been interesting to go into some more literary theory (we shied away from this a bit), this is a minor point and does not detract from the class at all -- the class was still very enjoyable overall. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very interesting. The topic is super relevant and all the readings make you think about many different things. "

            "\u00a0If you are looking for a writing credit that will actually help you improve your writing skills, this is the class for you. Katja is one of the best professors and is always available to help. I loved taking the class on climate change, but I'm sure other topics would be interesting as well. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course. I think the subject matter was very interesting, and the readings were very interesting. The amount of feedback received on papers allowed for me to grow a lot as a writer in just one semester. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The readings are all very interesting and thought-provoking, and the professor is really nice and helpful, and the way the class is structured really facilitates active learning. ",
            "\u00a0Yes.\r\n\r\nThe combination of the course subject and its teaching of how to write effectively makes this a good first year course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely! I can't speak for all of English 115, but this particular section (about literature and climate change) was very engaging. Also I highly recommend Prof Lindskog as a professor with whom to take a class with. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would. The course is fantastic. "
