            "\u00a0The one-term, independently written senior essay is a great way to deepen your knowledge in a field that interests you, that might not be covered in a seminar in the semester you're writing. For me, my senior essay felt like a culmination of all of the classes I had ever taken and cared about in the political science department. Done well, the essay requires many hours of reading, researching, and writing, so find an advisor you get along with and who knows you. They don't necessarily have to specialize exactly in whatever question you're trying to answer. Overall, it's a really rewarding process, and I'm happy I have this essay that I am proud of to show for my work in the major. ",
