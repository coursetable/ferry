            "\u00a0I gained a far better knowledge of the workings of NGOs and their interactions with the state, something I knew very little about. This class taught me a lot about how advocacy works and how policy change happens. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the fundamental operating strategies, goals of, and mechanisms to advancement that NGO (Non-Governmental Organizations) and Non-State Actors use and follow. ",
            "\u00a0Why non state actors behave in a certain way and how they interact with populations, other organizations, and governmental bodies. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the nuanced approaches NGOs use to gain credibility, spread their message, and co-opt other groups around the world to become effective agents for change. ",
            "\u00a0I gained an understanding of how global networks interact with each other and governments. We covered specific nonprofits and situations that showcased concepts we were learning in class, which was very helpful for applying the concepts. ",
            "\u00a0This class provides a decent overview of NGOs and how they relate to the social and political platform of global society. ",
            "\u00a0Learned so much about how non-state actors function in this complex world. Learned of their strategies and analyzed some examples ",
            "\u00a0How NGO's and international organizations work around the world, the smartest and most efficient tactics they use to achieve their goals. and how people choose to engage with them. ",
            "\u00a0Basic political science theories and intro to ngo structure ",
            "\u00a0This was a wonderful introductory course on international relations, and I know a lot more about how NGOs push for policy change, and the texts we read about that helped me understand how states and other organizations interact on the global stage. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about how the global institutional infrastructure of non profits and other non state political actors function, as well as how to write a policy brief. ",
            "\u00a0In this course, I gained a thorough understandings of the mechanisms and history of non-governmental organizations. "

            "\u00a0The subject matter was overall, uninteresting and extremely disengaging. I enjoyed the parts where we learned about real case studies, but analyzing and discussing other authors' theoretical pieces turned me off. The lectures were not engaging and monotonous. The amount of reading also was overwhelming for a lecture-style course. ",
            "\u00a0This is a very engaging course, with readings that are very instructive and interesting, and it is well structured to facilitate participation in class. ",
            "\u00a0The slides are very well organized and very well presented with case studies and current issues. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course covered many different areas, which was great. I felt I was sensitive to the importance NGOs play in bridging the gap between civil society and the government institutions, but I think this course was great at filling that out more. I think adding a greater focus to specific NGOs as a way to make the material more meaningful and concrete would be great. A lot of theoretical material was covered with not as much emphasis on the specific groups using them, which made it more abstract than I would have liked, at times. ",
            "\u00a0There are only three graded assignments in this course: the midterm, final paper, and final. Because of this, the extensive readings in between can become difficult to keep up with. There is also no clear guide of what to study for these tests, and you have to assume all course material and concepts could be on it, leading to some intensive studying.\r\n\r\nThe course is very interesting though, and I found myself explaining topics from it to people in daily life quite often. If youre interested in NGO or government work/ studies, then this is a great course for you. Professor Bush is very knowledgeable about the topics and the course material is all a great addition to the lectures. ",
            "\u00a0I think a major strength of this course was how it married the empirical to the political. I also think this course did a good job at facilitating discussions. That said, I believe the course was unorganized at times. I also believe the materials/reading sometimes overlapped each other and therefore made coursework feel a bit repetitive. ",
            "\u00a0The readings and topics were very interesting. However, sometimes the lectures are repetitive of the readings. The guest speaker was great so it would be cool to have more of them. Additionally, more discussions, videos, and articles would help. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes repetitive ",
            "\u00a0Good themes and readings, but the lectures were not as complex as I would have hoped. I felt like we covered a lot of the intuitive material in class but didn't really touch a lot of the more challenging pieces. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the \"leminar\" style; I felt like it worked well with the class. I do wish that there was less mystery surrounding the content of the exams (especially the midterm), though I was very thankful for the support we were provided w.r.t. writing the final paper. ",
            "\u00a0More presentations based on the aspects of the class that students are most interested in. ",
            "\u00a0While I liked many of the readings in the course, I felt there was a disconnect between the readings and the in-class lectures.  I wish the professor had posted the slides, as there were many gaps in my notes, simply because I couldn't write the information down fast enough.  I also wish there had been required reading responses, so that we had something to go off of in class.  Additionally, it would have been helpful to go over the responses before the midterm and the final. \r\nIt also might help to have a paper for the midterm, rather than a written assessment. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student who finds the topic interesting; if you do not like political science, there is only so much the teacher can do for you to keep you engaged, but it is a good course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in the study of Non Governmental Organizations or who wants to someday work in one of them. Otherwise, I unfortunately would not recommend the course. The professor is outstanding, very knowledgeable for the subject, and did the best job she could conveying the course materials. However, the subject itself simply does not lend itself to be very interesting, and so unavoidably the course can be boring. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I think NGOs play an important role in society and learning more about what they do and how they go about their business is important for everyone to know. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend because of the strength of the teaching. Professor Bush is a great teacher and she explores some interesting and very new topics to political science. But be ready to be very self motivated about the readings, as there is little accountability for having done them. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially if you are interested in non-state actors as a different take on global governance. ",
            "\u00a0YES because it solidifies trends in the world that one usually just takes for granted and think is natural. Terrific if you are interested in NGO action ",
            "\u00a0Yes; it is interesting and I do feel like I came away with a better understanding of international advocacy. ",
            "\u00a0I would! It was a great first course in intl. relations/political science, and the readings were really interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Not necessarily.  I didnt find the general disposition of the class compelling - I would like more thorough critical analysis of the nonprofit industrial complex. ",
            "\u00a0I felt meh about this class.  The questions on the midterm were vague but mandated specific answers.  The readings were interesting, but I found it hard to engage with them in a way that was conducive to my learning style.  I wish we had been able to discuss more.  Also, since the slides weren't posted, you had to rely on other people in the class if you missed. "
