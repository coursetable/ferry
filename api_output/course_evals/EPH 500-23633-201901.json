            "\u00a0I felt that this course was very beneficial to me as it provided me the opportunity to experience work at the state Department of Public Health. My practicum supervisor at the department was extremely helpful, welcoming, and supportive. I did find the commuting slightly time consuming especially with a number of other courses that I had to attend, however I felt that it was worth it for me to gain experience in an area that is actually of interest to me. \r\n\r\nI felt that some of the work required by the actual practicum class at the end of the project was slightly redundant. Having spent a lot of time working on my project at the Department of Public health, I felt that just a presentation or a narrative would be sufficient to relay the work that I had done, not necessarily both. (Ideally a presentation would be preferable as I really enjoyed hearing about my colleagues' projects also). ",

            "\u00a0Strength: opportunity to practice public health to benefit the greater community; appreciated the flexibility given the minimal class time \r\nWeakness: difficult in the 1 semester course to complete anything that was meaningful/substantial; after the final group meeting with individual presentations, I felt disheartened that colleagues often failed to produce a result that was meaningful (beyond personal learning). While students clearly learned about public health, the impact component on local organizations was GROSSLY lacking. Consider a presentation where 5 of the 10 min presentation was spent describing a historical background to tobacco use. Another presentation where an extensive IRB was conducted only to receive 2 responses with minimal generalizability. Perhaps projects already somewhat developed could be advertised to students so that a more meaningful result could be developed. "
