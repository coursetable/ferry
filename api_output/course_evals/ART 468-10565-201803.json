            "\u00a0We created a poster series, zine, and animated gif for this course, so we practiced a fairly wide range of skills, from typography to bookmaking to informational hierarchy. In particular, I learned how to navigate the balance between being too minimalistic (in other words : boring) and too complex (in other words: overwhelming). ",
            "\u00a0How to create a cohesive system of work that has independent pieces but still shares a visual/thematic language. ",
            "\u00a0In this class, students were asked to explore a theme (most turned out to be politically oriented) through 3 related projects (poster series, pamphlet, and video loop). Advanced skills for graphic design were focused on through weekly critique. "

        [
            "\u00a0Strength: Liked how we got to focus on a single theme throughout the whole semester and create work that responded to this theme. \r\nWeakness: I wish the course was organized so that we could contribute and receive more peer feedback. I felt that most of the four hours consisted of Julian solely giving crits. While I respect Julian's eye, this made the feedback we received a bit one-sided/one-dimensional. It also seems really exhausting for Julian himself. Would've loved to have received feedback from the many talented designers in the room. ",
            "\u00a0This class was well-structured and well-taught for the most part. The biggest place to improve would be the speed of critiques, which tended to be on the longer side, forcing non-critique content (ex. example works) to be looked over at home or class to be extended. "

            "\u00a0It is a good graphic design course that consolidates everything you learned in previous design courses. However, compared to previous design courses, it feels a bit like anticlimax. You design a series of posters, a short book and a short animation loop -- something that you have done many times before. It is more about refining your skills rather than learning something new. Julian is a great instructor who pushes his students beyond their comfort zones, so in one way or another you will become a better, more sophisticated designer after taking his course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, take it! It will push you to think at a larger scale in regards to design. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course in the progression of graphic design classes. I would recommend this class to students who have taken some of the lower-level graphic design courses and are interested in taking more. "
