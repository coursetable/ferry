            "\u00a0This course exposed me to many influential modern and contemporary plays, which not only were great in themselves, but also inspired me with new forms/structures/story-telling techniques to try in my own writing. Each week we read (on average) two plays and wrote a page reading notes about each, and we had a short writing assignment--writing a monologue, a scene, a description of a setting. The final project was writing a 45-page one-act, which we started early in the semester and worked on consistently. Each student got three 20 to 30-minute workshops, evenly spaced throughout the semester, in which classmates read a section of the student's play aloud and the writer solicited feedback/answers to specific questions from classmates. During class, we spent about an hour talking about the plays we had read, then the remaining hour and a half on workshops/reading students' writing. ",
            "\u00a0The invaluable chance to work on a single project over the course of a semester, with structure, and (relatively loose) guidance. The class is what you (and the your classmates) make of it, and the final play you produce is what you put into it. \r\n\r\nAlso wonderful is the opportunity to talk about great plays with a knowledgable, passionate, top-of-the-food-chain playwright. \r\n\r\nI can't say I know what makes a good play (Prof. Margulies will teach you about objects and subtext), I just know that I enjoyed writing one. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a ton about structuring a play and motivating the action of a play. ",
            "\u00a0Learned how to structure a play and motivate the action of the play. ",
            "\u00a0The course is organized around creating a one act play as a final project. There are weekly assignments and weekly readings, all of which are designed to teach you the basics of play writing. ",
            "\u00a0As a person who has done a great deal of writing, I took this class very specifically to understand the way in which playwriting might diverge from prose storytelling.  I learned a good deal about subtext, the importance of brevity, the constraints placed on a piece of work by the realities of the stage.  We also read a great deal of contemporary and mid twentieth century playwriting .This was valuable, for sure. ",
            "\u00a0This course really helped me develop an understanding of the structure and rhythms of playwriting. It taught me how to structure the play, how to build tension, write engaging dialogue, and generally engage with the intricacies of the genre. ",
            "\u00a0As someone who has always wanted to write plays but never did, this workshop was a meaningful introduction to the world of playwriting. We read truly incredible plays and I learned about the craft of playwriting from these authors work as well as the work of my peers. We also had weekly exercises that got us to think about themes we might want to explore further in our larger plays, which were very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about creating realistic dialogue and developing characters in plays, from this class. I developed my skills as a writer but also as a narrator. ",
            "\u00a0A really good beginning knowledge of structure and a strong working in the basics - plot, event, dialogue, stakes, etc. A really good reading list / history of playwriting as well. ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus is introductory, and so were most of the class discussions. Office hours were extraordinarily helpful, both with Prof. Margulies and the TA, Alex Lubischer. I learned how to put together a sketch of a play and how to tell what worked and what didn't. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The syllabus of plays is great, and the writing assignments are engaging, varied, and helpful tools for generating material in the future. You don't need to have much previous knowledge about plays or playwriting (though it helps) to become a more informed reader of drama, and to improve as a writer through this course. That said, this course does not have the rigor of a literature course when it comes to the readings, and students' skill as playwrights vary drastically. Because of the rhythm of the class and flow of comments, some students did not get equal time for their work during workshops, while other students got a lot of time. The equal time limit should be more strictly enforced. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the great reading list and the leeway to pursue and develop a passion project. \r\n\r\nSome weaknesses: Discussions often meandered. The loudest voices got to speak the longest. Also frustrating was the imbalance between talking about the reading (which often consisted of students' reactions to the play rather than technical dissections that might actually teach us more directly about playwriting) and workshops (the only time you get any sort of extensive feedback is every third week when your play-in-progress gets workshopped). ",
            "\u00a0As with any workshop, it all depends on who is in the class. If you can get a good thing going, you'll enjoy the class and the workshop. If you don't really connect with people or their work, it can be a tougher hang. Margulies is brilliant and so good at diagnosing problems in plays. The workshops are pretty short, so it can be tough to really dive in, but it's fun to have a literature class for the first half and a writing class for the second half of every session. ",
            "\u00a0As with any workshop, it depends on the makeup of the class. Margulies is the strength. He's really good at diagnosing problems in plays and providing feedback without being too prescriptive. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes, when I'd fulfill an assignment, I'd never hear anything about it in response.  This was disappointing, but probably a reality of a course in which students are writing a great deal. \r\n\r\nThe discussions of the plays we read seemed inevitably to center on issues of race, gender, appropriation and politics.  As much as I consider myself a feminist, this proved wearying, and distracted the class from concerns beyond those of political correctness.  I might have appreciated a stronger voice, from the instructor, leading us in other directions. ",
            "\u00a0I think Prof. Margulies is an excellent teacher who's really invested in helping his students improve and edit their work, and the selection of plays was very interesting; the course is structured (discussions of the readings, followed by workshopping) to keep everyone invested in helping each other. I'd have liked to see more plays from the world of Anglophone literature beyond just American and Britain. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great class and I feel very fortunate to have been able to take it. The plays we read were exceptional as was Prof. Margulies feedback. Perhaps we could have discussed the exercises we did more in class or in office hours, but I think it made sense that we focused more on reading scenes in progress from our larger plays. I liked that we were able to get feedback on our plays throughout the semester through office hours and in class. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course: the quality of the readings and the interesting nature of the creative writing assignments. \r\nThe weaknesses of the course: Because there were so many plays to read each week, doing the readings, the assignment, and writing the talking points took so much time out of the week. I felt I wasnt able to work on my play each week because of the sheer amount of homework for this class. Furthermore, because of all the readings we had to discuss in class, we never got feedback on our weekly playwriting assignments. We could meet the professor during Office Hours to discuss the assignments, but most students including myself used office hours to discuss progress on their plays. It would have been better to just read one play per week so that we would have time to get feedback on our writing assignments AND our 45-page plays. ",
            "\u00a0A little less time discussing the readings, more time for the scene readings! Otherwise a really great seminar. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Margulies is very organized, and it shows. He requires all students to send him notes on all of the plays he assigns. I'm an English major, and I'm assigned a lot of reading every week. In most of my classes I would say I do the reading a solid 70% of the time, but having to write talking points made it so I read everything. And I knew how I felt about most plays. It made me think more than I would've if I were just required to read them. Don't expect Prof. Margulies to read your talking pts. though.\r\n\r\nI think it could be more improved if we could read the work we were workshopping beforehand and write talking points on them in addition to reading them aloud. It would provide more focused, well thought-out feedback I think.\r\n\r\nTA was excellent. Wish this class had a more analytical bend to it, but that's a personal preference. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes! It's a great introduction foundational/influential plays and to the craft of playwriting. Professor Margulies is down-to-earth and helpful. Take advantage of office hours to talk about your writing and get his feedback and suggestions. You should know that workshopping (listening to and commenting on) other people's work is a large portion of the class, your writing and revising happens outside of class, on your own time. ",
            "\u00a0Yes and no. Yes if you've always wanted to write a play but never had time, yes if you want to get to know Prof. Margulies (who's a great person), yes if you're fine with sitting through underwhelming class discussions and having limited feedback on your work. No, honestly, if you're looking for a hands-on writing seminar, or if the people around the table aren't people you'd be excited to have a book club with, which is more or less what a third of class-time becomes. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah take it! Margulies is super helpful and patient as people try out a new style/find their voices. He expects you to come in for office hours a lot, which I didn't realize, so factor that into the timing of the class if you want to get the most out of the feedback you get in class. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah take it. Margulies is very patient and supportive as you try out a new medium/find your voice in playwriting. He expects you to show up to office hours a lot, which I didn't really realize, so be prepared to get most of your feedback/present your work one on one.  It's fun that the first half of every session is a literature class and the second is a writing class. Workload is totally manageable. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this course if you're interested in play writing. Professor Margulies is a great teacher and obviously an incredible play-write. You get about as much out of it as you put in, so make sure you're very passionate going in. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend this class to a student with a strong interest in the material. ",
            "\u00a0I'd highly recommend this course to anyone interested in playwriting at all, even if they've never tried it before. I think it offers an intriguing challenge to both veteran theatre-goers (and even playwrights) and newcomers looking to get an appreciation of the art. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! It is a lot of work each week  youll have to write scenes, work on your larger play, read two long plays and write talking points. But its worth it. Coming out of the workshop, youll definitely have a better grasp on playwriting and become a better writer. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course for people who have the time in their schedule to take it. The course soaked up most of my time. The professor also doesnt give very thorough feedback so its hard to improve on your play if you dont know how. I did however learn more about playwriting, so if a student really wants to be a playwright it would probably be a good class to take. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Take this course! It has a great reading listyoull become familiar with a range of playsand the workshop component is fantastic. The weekly assignments are really helpful, and the final one act is a great opportunity to work on a piece you can really feel proud of by the end. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's a great class! Definitely one of my favorite writing classes at Yale. Professor Margulies is awesome and his seminars are very well structured, you also get really individualized feedback on your writing! ",
            "\u00a0Generally would recommend -- Margulies is organized and knows what he wants from his students, so he won't let easy, careless choices slide. He'll hold you accountable. He's a good professor, and he'll always make time to see you. I enjoyed his class immensely -- a good intro to playwriting. "
