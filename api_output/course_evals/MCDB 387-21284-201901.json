            "\u00a0Good practice presenting papers in a casual setting, learned a lot of new experimental techniques ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about making presentations and the class made reading primary papers much easier and less scary. ",
            "\u00a0An in-depth examination of the cell cycle and its implications for disease and therapeutic technologies. ",
            "\u00a0Great deeper look into clever and impactful studies regarding different aspects of the cell cycle. Learned a lot on experimental design/what makes good research. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the various pathways involved in cell cycle regulation through reading primary literature and reviews for every class. I gained insight into the model organisms that are used in this field of research, including Xenopus, budding/fission yeast, and immortalized human cell lines (e.g., HeLa). "

            "\u00a0It was a small class and discussion was possible. The length of papers made it difficult to ask questions, simply because we didn't have time to address them. Would be good to put more emphasis on only presenting the necessary figures and background info ",
            "\u00a0There wasn't much discussion every week besides going over the review paper, which actually made things less stressful when you weren't presenting and allowed you to just learn and understand things more without the fear of having to participate. Feel like I learned a lot about all aspects of the cell cycle and about current research in the field. ",
            "\u00a0The class is great, but there should be accountability measures in place to ensure that students are engaging actively with the material in class. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are the seminal papers and concise reviews chosen for this course as well as the participation of students in presenting papers 3 times over the course of the semester. Both of these aspects of the course aided me in learning the nomenclature and types of experiments frequently used in cell cycle research. A weakness of this course is that, since reading was not required, students would sometimes ask simple questions that could have been answered if they had read. An improvement that could be made is a weekly reading response for those who aren't presenting to make sure that all students do the reading. "

            "\u00a0Yes. The mock grant proposal at the end is very challenging yet pays off in real-life science skills ",
            "\u00a0Yes! You really just need to prepare a few presentations throughout the semester (2-3) and the only other thing you need to do is write the final grant proposal, which does take a good amount of time but is doable. Besides that, you spend the rest of the semester listening to other people's presentations and learning about research in the cell cycle. Pretty interesting stuff if you're interested in cellular biology ",
            "\u00a0The semester is larger very manageable up until the final paper - be careful, as it is a lot of work and requires a lot of preparation. This class was great though and I feel like it really helped me in reading primary research papers, outside of gaining a more in-depth understanding of the eukaryotic cell cycle. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would highly recommend this course. Professor Dawson chooses great topics and papers and lays out some really great studies/research. By the end, you have a much better hold on what good research consists of and how to go experiment by experiment in a study. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to MCDB majors! You learn a great deal about how the cell cycle is regulated and how to design an experiment to test a specific hypothesis. ",
            "\u00a0If you are good at learning on your own, then you should take this course. If you need more instruction, maybe pass for a different special elective. Watch out for that final paper. "
