            "\u00a0This class is tough but you'll learn a lot. The final project is a lot of work in very little time, though maybe still better than a final.\r\nProf Ganim is also very responsive to the students and interested in making sure you actually learn. ",
            "\u00a0This class is pretty good overall, but I would like to see assignments reflecting what was taught in class and the book more. Some of the lectures are very high level theory and it would be nice to do some more mathematical things in class. A lot of times, we didn't know what was going on and it was difficult to catch up. The midterms were both kind of different from the material in the homeworks and also very difficult. It's stressful being in a class with an average test of 57. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The material was very interesting and a nice extension of thermo. Additionally the professor and the TA were both very friendly and tried to help both on the homework sets and the final project.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The lectures didn't really connect to the problem sets, and the problem sets didn't really connect with the tests, so it was really hard to do the problem sets and, if I tried to use the problem sets to study for the test, it didn't help because the test had completely different topics that were covered. Additionally, our final project was given to us too late; I think it should have been given to us before Thanksgiving Break. ",
            "\u00a0Here is the thing: physical chemistry is hard and there is probably no way of teaching it well, but the way the class is structured now just makes the learning process extremely dreadful and it feels like the class was designed for students to fail. First and foremost, the pre-requisites for this course should be clear: stats is a pre-requisite and so is multivariable calculus and knowledge of MATLAB. The class also assumes that we have a very deep understanding of statistical mechanics before taking it, as we are never introduced to concepts and simply jump into them. The book for this class was essentially useless, it is not well written and does not seem to correlate with the material taught in class, I would either recommend that the book is changed or that professor Ganim write his own. Moreover, the topics covered do not seem to correlate to each other and there is not enough background information given on them so you kind of just have to know. The problem sets took at least 10 hours to be completed, required you to write your own code, and were on such niche material that no book, published paper, or resources on internet could give you a brief understanding of how to approach them. Furthermore, the final MATLAB project was extremely unpleasant -- we were expect to write our own 400-line code (when coding was not a requirement for the class), to make a 20-minute presentation, to write a 20-page paper, and to work in groups of 4 or 5 students, and the project was assigned in the last two weeks of class (also known as the busiest time of the semester) and took over 60 hours to be completed. Finally, the tests for this class seemed to have no absolute manner to prepare for -- it was as though in class we were learning Spanish and the test was in German. The psets were quite unhelpful in that manner and provided little insight as to what the test was going to look like. Moreover, the tests were also extremely long and no student was able to finish on time and present so much new material that there was no way anybody could do well. Either make the tests at least minimally similar to the psets or the opposite. ",
            "\u00a0Ziad generally cares about students and the TA Kris was nice to me (although I never went to section). But there were a lot of weaknesses. Sometimes Ziad came unprepared to lecture (or at least it appeared that way), and the material was not presented in an order that made sense. Reworking the curriculum might help, because the topics felt somewhat disconnected from each other. I still don't clearly have an understanding of classical vs quantum mechanics. It could be improved by: (1) providing more support for problem sets that doesn't involve begging the peer tutor for answers, (2) using more class time on explaining the principles, rather than providing examples (the biological system applications were unfulfilling given that none of us understood the principles), (3) awarding half the points back for midterm test corrections, rather than a quarter, which would be more motivating to students, (4) ending class on time (stop running 5-10 minutes over!!!), (5) providing more support for learning MATLAB throughout the semester (or just getting rid of it overall), and (6) significantly reworking the final project. The final project needs to be presented earlier in the semester, so that students have more than a weekend to plan for it. The scope of the project is several weeks long, especially for groups who do not have a coder familiar with MATLAB. It was unfair to expect students to extend a model in MATLAB over the course of a weekend. Again, either the course has to actually teach MATLAB earlier on (which is outside the scope of the course, and should not be expected). More reasonably, MATLAB should not be involved in the course. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: only 2 midterms, and a final project instead of a final exam; going over some interesting models with biological relevance; getting exposure to various stat mech concepts\r\n\r\nweaknesses/suggestions: lectures mostly center around one or two difficult-to-understand examples, without the full structured teaching of the content necessary to understand said examples. they're also often disorganized, especially when derivations are involved and time is spent troubleshooting errors in math. I don't know how possible this would be, but I feel like having 75-minute meetings 2x a week would be very helpful for this class so that there's more continuity and more time to both explain difficult concepts and provide examples. | there have been times where the pset asks for things that have not been covered in class (e.g. the last problem of one of the psets involved the equipartition theorem, which was not covered until the class after the pset was due. the only way to get the problem was to talk to the TA/peer tutor and basically get the answer.) | pset problems could benefit from additional clarity/building in complexity starting from the more familiar problems presented in class. Often book problems are chosen, but there may not have been enough building of content knowledge in class to effectively tackle these book problems without finding some formula or concept buried somewhere within the book chapter. | Entire chapters are assigned as reading even though lectures, psets, and midterms obviously only focus on several key aspects. it would be incredibly helpful to be given detailed page numbers so students know what they're expected to know for psets/midterms, and it would be much easier/there would be more motivation to do the readings | midterms are WILDLY different from the content/focus of classes, psets, and even review sessions. the midterms should be better optimized to be 1) able to be completed reasonably in one class period, 2) align with the content covered in lectures/psets/review sessions, and 3) yield a reasonable distribution that doesn't need to be grossly adjusted (e.g. making a 50-something on the midterm a B) | for test corrections, students should only be asked to re-answer the questions they got wrong, maybe with additional explanation. they should *not* be asked to re-do the entire exam, offer explanations, offer potential pitfalls of the question, etc. - especially when the professor/TA won't even thoroughly read through the corrections. if you're not going to even read through it, then make them more reasonable to complete. | the final project was honestly a mess. it's unreasonable to ask students to complete any sort of MATLAB project in *1 week* when only one or two people per 4- or 5-person group know how to code and no real coding instruction is given. this was the most frustrating aspect of the entire class. there should either be a week-long MATLAB bootcamp, or several sections should cover MATLAB basics. psets should build MATLAB skills and generating/modifying code with proper syntax, not just plugging in numbers into existing code. and the prompt for the final project should be given WAY in advance so that groups can actually start meeting, troubleshooting, asking for help, etc and not having to freak out during the last week of class when students already have so much other things going on. | there should be more synergy among the prof, the TA, and the peer tutor. namely, the TA should have an idea of what exams will look like so that review sessions can accurately prepare students and show them what they should expect. or, the prof should host review sessions himself. same thing with the final project. it just seemed like there were a lot of cases in which the TA didn't know what the prof was thinking/planning and thus couldn't provide the most effective help. ",
            "\u00a0This course provides a solid understanding of thermodynamics for a biologist and provided examples of applications in biology. I thought that the course could have spent more time using Matlab to integrate thermodynamics into these models in a practical manner. ",
            "\u00a0strength: instructor convey ideas clearly\r\nweakness: the final project may be difficult for students without coding experience ",
            "\u00a0The class is extremely hard and is heavily math related. The concepts are really interesting and relatively easy to understand, so going slower on the math might make the class easier. ",
            "\u00a0I think the concepts that we covered in this class were interesting, just not necessarily the most structured. I think one of the biggest suggestions that I have is in the way the lectures are delivered; we cover a lot of math and a lot of content, not all of which is clear. Perhaps printing out the slides or posting the slides online before class so students have an opportunity to focus less on digesting the slides themselves and are able to take notes on the sides rather than focus attention on trying to copy things down.\r\nAdditionally, I would have appreciated practice exams or a list of topics to be covered on each exam or in general more of an idea of what to expect going into midterm examinations. Out of all the MB&B classes I have taken, this was the most stress-inducing in terms of exams because I had no idea what to expect. ",
            "\u00a0Midterm exams were fairly difficult and not exactly based upon the problem sets. ",
            "\u00a0I think Prof. Ganim has been a great lecturer, especially for the first two-thirds of the class. Although pchem is notorious for being a hard subject, I dont think I ever felt lost/confused during his lectures. Ive found the lectures interesting and easy to retain  I think the knowledge/skills I gained in this class will last a long time (perhaps forever).\r\nAt the same time, I think the memory of struggle Ive endured in this class will also last a long time. The textbook was mostly easy to follow and pretty clear, but there were some parts that the textbook didnt explain in enough depth (especially when it came to thermodynamics). The last third of the class was perhaps the most challenging time Ive spent at Yale. The final group project was so difficult. We had only about a week to complete it, when I think two weeks or even more would have been more reasonable. Given that we havent had real training or practice in MATLAB before the project, we had to spend hours and hours figuring out how to code. Some groups had students who knew how to code in MATLAB and finished relatively quickly, but that was not the case with all the groups. If this is to be repeated in the future, I think more time and more coding help could be offered. Perhaps there could be MATLAB coding tutorials at sections or optional MATLAB coding problems in the psets. Also, while the lectures themselves were reasonably easy to follow, I do think we were constantly a little bit behind where we wanted to be (pacing could be improved). ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the final projectfelt like I learned the most here. Except for the coding aspect, which seemed very tedious at points, the final project was quite enjoyable compared to the exams. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a challenge for the department.  Is it possible to provide a solid foundation in physical chemistry in an applied class?  I still don't know the answer.  The one thing that really bothered me about this course was the insistence that this class would be less math intensive, and yet knowledge of differential equations was extraordinarily useful and had to be learned on the spot if not known.  Sort of the same with MATLAB and coding, which was taught very poorly, if at all. ",
            "\u00a0A major strength of this course was the accessibility and helpfulness and of the TA and professor.\r\n\r\nThis course goes over a lot of material rapidly. Some of this is the natural consequence of the sheer amount that must be covered.\r\nThe challenge/depth of the homework did not always seem consummate with the lecture material. ",
            "\u00a0The workload was (I thought) chill to other courses Ive taken for MBB. I could start the psets the day before if necessary and still do ok. I like how the exams/psets were based off the textbook- made studying straightforward. I didnt like how the lectures and slides were sometimes hard to connect to the book. The quizzes seemed totally unnecessary in terms of making up one pset grade (especially since we only had 2).  Maybe just make them optional study assignments for exams? I like the idea of doing a final project instead of an exam, but I probably didnt learn the last bit of material as well and am not sure how I did on the final project. ",
            "\u00a0Personally, I think the course as a whole could really benefit if the questions discussed in the problem sets was more closely aligned with the questions used on the midterm exams. The most difficult part of the midterm exams was trying to understand what exactly was being asked for. It would also be better if we had an idea of the topics that would be tested on as opposed to a vague \"everything since the last midterm,\" which led to overstudying on the topics that failed to show up once on the exam.\r\n\r\nI also think the idea behind using MATLab in the problem sets was good, but without an explicit training in the software, it led to uncertainty and stress, especially among students who had no MATLab/coding background. I think if more time was spent on topics and concepts instead of the coding project, I would have enjoyed the class more. "

            "\u00a0I'd choose this over CHEM 332 again. While they seem to be roughly equivalent in terms of material covered, in this one you can at least bond with your fellow MB&B majors through the inevitable suffering. ",
            "\u00a0This is a requirement for some majors, really just MBB, but I have no idea how the other Pchem is. I think PCHEM overall is a terribly difficult topic and there is no \"best way\" to teach it. ",
            "\u00a0If you are looking at this course it is probably because you are majoring in MB&B and are looking for a \"fake pchem\" course -- do NOT do it. Just take the normal pchem version which at least has some structure and is, unarguably, way better for learning and for your mental health. ",
            "\u00a0Take CHEM 332 over this. I thought having one less midterm and no final would be good, but the teaching was poor and I still don't understand anything. Final project is in MATLAB and MATLAB was never taught, so good luck if you have no coding experience. ",
            "\u00a0no, unless of course you're an mb&b major and have to take either this or CHEM 332. the fact that the course has only two midterms and no final exam may just edge it a tiny bit higher than CHEM 332, which has three midterms and a final exam. but unless some major changes are made to the course, you should go into it expecting to teach yourself a lot of the course material, use sections/office hours/TA hours a lot, and get wrecked on midterms - though they're curved ofc. it's just a lot of stress that doesn't have to exist, but if you establish a good pset group/group chat you should be able to make it through ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any students in the MB&B department. It is useful for understanding lectures given by various professors in the department and provides a solid understanding of thermodynamics for biology. ",
            "\u00a0for biology student, it's helpful for them to understand biological phenomena in physical and chemical perspectives ",
            "\u00a0If the student is interested in biophysics studies or understanding the thermodynamics behind living systems, Yes. ",
            "\u00a0No, as of fall of 2018 it is still poorly taught. ",
            "\u00a0No; however, it is a required course for MB&B and arguably better than 332. ",
            "\u00a0This is a really hard question to answer because chances are that youre taking this class as a major requirement. I hear that the alternative (CHEM 332) has its own problems. I dont know if either of them is better for any given person, so weigh out the pros/cons of each class carefully! First off, I think Ganim is wonderful. His lectures are pretty easy to follow (although there can be awkward lulls/silence due to the class starting at 9:25am). It shows that he does care about what he teaches and about his students. The material is very challenging, but at the same time it has been one of the most mind-blowing subject Ive ever learned. However, be prepared to struggle. The material is hard, the psets are hard and long, and the tests are very difficult. It was normal to spend 15 to 20 hours a week on just this class. But the final group project was really what got me (and all of us, to be honest). It was really nice not having a final exam, but we only had one week to start and finish the project (developing, running, and interpreting a model using MATLAB). I luckily had the most wonderful group where everyone was respectful and put in their fair share of effort. But none of us have really coded in MATLAB before, so we spent so many hours just trying to figure how MATLAB works. The psets prior to the project tried to introduce a little bit of MATLAB, but that was not enough (we didnt actually learn how to code in MATLAB). Given that the final project week also happened to be when things were due for every other class, my group didnt really get to work on it until halfway through the week. My group and I gave up sleep, social life, and extracurriculars. We even had trouble finding time to eat during that week, and we found ourselves working on the project past 3am. Hands down, that was the most academically stressful time I have ever spent at this university. But of course, if you can code in MATLAB, you wont have too much trouble with it (the class in general assumed a lot of prior knowledge). So know that if you choose this class, you will struggle a lot but also learn a lot (remember when you wrote I like to be intellectually challenged on your Yale application?). It is an experience that changes you as a scholar and as a person. So theres no right answer. If you want to major in MB&B, you have to go through this or CHEM 332 so might as well take this one and own it Obviously if you are not MB&B and thus dont need this class, then dont take it unless you Cr/D/Fail. ",
            "\u00a0If you're in MBB, you have to take it. THe final project is good, the exams are hard. Overall, however, you will learn a lot! ",
            "\u00a0Look. This class has all of the shiny draws--no final exam, homework is 50% of the final grade, you'll take the class mostly with your MB&B friends instead of the Chemistry geniuses.  That being said, know yourself.  If you took Phys 180 or higher, take the other class.  The issue with applied classes is that you feel like you haven't learned anything and that the information is random.  By the end, you'll have some vague idea about how physical chemistry is used in STEM research, but really lack the fundamental basics to use it.  This course is going to be widely panned, but I think you can get a little bit out of it because Professor Ganim is committed to making the course better and improving himself as a professor. ",
            "\u00a0Please save yourself and do not take this course. It was offered at the same time as the regular pchem and I really wish I had taken that instead. The class presumes extensive background in mathematics and physics (beyond Math 120 and Physics 180/181) and glosses over background knowledge that is critical to the understanding of the material. The lectures and the problem sets have little to do with each other. Prof. Ganim's lectures are clear enough, but the problem sets are far more challenging than the lecture material. The final project is entirely in MATLAB despite the class itself providing very little help with learning MATLAB. Steer clear. ",
            "\u00a0I ended up enjoying this class, in a way. Some of the revelations of physical chemistry as they apply to biology are sort of beautiful. However, try to take this with friends (study groups helped a lot) and consult with the TA(s) and professor as needed to get through the problem sets and some of the more difficult material. Much of it is abstract and difficult to grasp at first (or in general). ",
            "\u00a0You probably have to take it. I think the curve was easier than other upper level MBB courses (probably bc certain people took the other pchem) but not sure how effectively I learned the material. Ziad does care a lot and hosts ample office hours, has been trying to improve the course, etc. ",
            "\u00a0I think I would have benefited from a more traditional physical chemistry course (CHEM 332) as I feel as though my knowledge of the fundamentals of physical chemistry is rather weak. Knowing what I know now I probably would have taken the other P-chem course. That being said, if you enjoy biological relevance to the material you are learning, this would be the more interesting course to take. "
