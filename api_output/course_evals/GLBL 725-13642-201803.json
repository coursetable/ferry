            "\u00a0This material this class covered was as diverse as Governor Richardson's career. We discussed many facets of foreign policy and the current challenges facing the world, but we also discussed Congress, the domestic political process, and how to get elected to office. ",
            "\u00a0Fantastic course. Governor Richardson brings in an accomplished guest speaker every week who gives a short lecture and then answers students' questions. Guest speakers included a Four-Star General, a negotiator to North Korea, a White House Chief of Staff, and many former ambassadors and academics.  Each seminar covers a different topic, creating a fast-paced and consistently engaging environment in class. ",
            "\u00a0What actually happens during difficult negotiations processes. Not sure if I learned anything else. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a highlight of the semester. The opportunity to talk to foremost experts on the world's most pressing issues was invaluable to me. ",
            "\u00a0Practical life experience and stories about how diplomacy works. ",
            "\u00a0Course provided me with a broad sampling of senior policymakers and advisors, and, crucially, how they see problems and how they go about solving those problems.  Taught me how my civilian counterparts think. "

            "\u00a0The course was very disorganized. To some, that can certainly be off-putting. But as Governor Richardson told us, the practice of foreign policy and politics is constantly changing and a bit chaotic, and thus the class would reflect the nature of the field. Governor Richardson brought in different speakers each week to speak to the topics we were covering, and this aspect really made the class unique. We went from talking about climate change and election interference with John Podesta to the future of NATO with General Wesley Clark, and many experts in between. ",
            "\u00a0All the guest speakers offered very high level of engagement with their specialties. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting and diverse topics and guest speakers. ",
            "\u00a0The speakers were the strength of this coursefrom John Podesta to Obama's lead negotiator on the Iran Nuclear Deal. It was incredible. ",
            "\u00a0It could be made more rigorous. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: world-class speakers and instructor.  Concise writing requirements that allowed us to engage with issues we are uniquely interested in, and prompt feedback from the instructor on those writing assignments.  Instructor guided students to focus on policy areas that are interesting to them--this guided subsequent writings and oral presentations.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: hold students accountable to course standards.  Specifically thinking of in-class oral presentations--these were pitched as having to be delivered with minimal notes, but the majority of students turned them into essays that they read.  The purpose of the presentation was to develop public speaking skills and to help students develop their rhetorical tactics...but a lot of them got away with basically reading off a teleprompter. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely- if Governor Richardson ever returns to Yale to teach, TAKE HIS CLASS! This was by far my favorite class at Yale (speaking as a senior). I cannot say enough good things about this class and about Governor Richardson. There is a reason the Governor holds the record for most handshakes in eight hours by a politician- he is a warm, approachable leader who shared so much of his vast experience with the class. In addition to benefiting from the Governor's experience, he brought in well-known speakers each week to weigh in on the week's topic. Overall, this was a fantastic course and I am so glad to have found it. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to meet and speak to lots of guest speakers from US diplomatic/political circles, this course is for you. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Highly. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, very much so. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely.  This is the sort of course that provides truly unique exposure to senior leaders and their perspectives; it's why people chose to come to a place like Yale in the first place. "
