            "\u00a0Good survey of music cultures from around the world. We focused on South Indian classical music, Arabic/Turkish scales, and Gregorian chant. In the South Indian unit we learned Carnatic vocal exercises, which we had to perform on exams. These were tricky to learn but were enjoyable and rewarding. There was a curricular focus on transcription (what it accomplishes, how to do it, etc) as well as on how people construct theories of music genres. Final project was an analysis of an ethnomusicological website of our choosing, which was very interesting. \r\n\r\nWould recommend this to anyone looking to expand their knowledge of non-Western music theories. ",
            "\u00a0A greater understanding of how musical theories developed along with a new skill to create my own ways of interpreting and conveying existing musical theories. ",
            "\u00a0A survey of non-Western music traditions, especially Carnatic music and Arabic and Turkish maqam. ",
            "\u00a0I gain the ability to think about music in different ways based on the theories of cultures from around the world. "

            "\u00a0The only weakness in the course curriculum was a lack of following the syllabus, though that was less to do with the quality of teaching but instead a medical emergency. The strength of the course is the professor's ability to consistently guide students through harder readings and concepts. The communal singing aspect also allowed theories to be internalized, and more structured singing would be good for the course. ",
            "\u00a0This is an exceptional course, but it could be augmented by studying a greater number of musical traditions. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was very captivating and exciting, and it opened my eyes to music that I never knew existed. I would have liked to recieve clearer feedback on assignments though. "

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! It was engaging, largely discussion based, and a great opportunity to learn about non-western music. "
