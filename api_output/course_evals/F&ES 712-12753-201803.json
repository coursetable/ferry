            "\u00a0I learned a lot about water management. This course covered such a broad array of topics and gave students a good foundation for understanding the challenges associated with water management, as well as potential solutions. ",
            "\u00a0Many! the course allowed me to gain knowledge on a great variety of topics related to water management (hydrology, infrastructure, policy, ecology, social issues). This is a very complete course that integrates content from multiple disciplines. ",
            "\u00a0I gained an immense amount of knowledge, skills, and insights around how to manage freshwater and tackle global water challenges. Most importantly, I think that Shimi provided a really helpful framework for thinking about tradeoffs in addressing problems like flooding, water scarcity, conflict over water, etc. This was my favorite course of the semester, and I feel like I learned the most from it! ",

            "\u00a0Strenghs are Shimi's dedication to the class, his passion to teach and make sure we understand everything. I can't think of any weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0Again, course was great at covering a lot of material at an appropriate level of detail. This was an excellent opportunity to learn applied science, policy, economics, and political science--it felt like a thoughtful survey course that was appropriately calibrated for interdisciplinary managers.\r\n\r\nIt would have been helpful to know in advance when sections would happen or not. I appreciated the visual context of movies, but wonder if those are really the best use of time--especially when viewed in non-sequential form. \r\n\r\nSome homework assignments seemed nitpicky in the science and math of concepts. The unit conversion, for example, felt more like a high school course--and we didn't cover that in class. I would have appreciated more thought questions or mini research assignments to broaden applicable knowledge or make me engage more with the material. \r\n\r\nI really appreciated how Shimi read the reading responses and thoughtfully, efficiently incorporated them into lectures. His responsiveness was amazing. ",
            "\u00a0I feel like the documentaries could be utilized better. I think that we could more critically assess them, and maybe rather than watching parts of them week to week we watch one in full every other week or a few times a semester in its entirety. ",
            "\u00a0While I loved this course, I do think that there was a lot of time and effort put in for a 3-credit class. Perhaps next year this can be a 4-credit class. I also wished the discussion sections weren't timed so late in the day. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course attempts to cover too much material. There is so much to learn about water management, it is difficult to do it all in one semester. I appreciate that this class gives such a good overview of water management. However, the class could perhaps cover fewer topics in greater depth. I also think this class should be 4 credits. With the field trips and  weekly night sections, there is more class time for this course than others. Although the material is manageable, the class time is closer to 4 credits than 3. ",
            "\u00a0The book, selected readings, instructor's teaching style, movies, and field trips are among the strengths. \r\nIn my opinion, the course include a lot of content on US water regulation (laws, permits, standards, legal cases) that, in my opinion, where too specific the class. Also, the work loas was heavy in comparison with other 3-credit courses. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: great professor, interesting and helpful readings, great guest speakers, insightful field trips, and thought-provoking lectures. I really appreciated the wide range of water challenges that we covered. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the course requires a lot of time for weekly discussion groups, field trips, homework, and reading responses. I think that it's worth making it a four-credit class even without a paper, although I think that I would've enjoyed doing the paper as well. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Organization, Shimi's lectures, homework assignments\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes we didn't get into as fruitful of a discussion as I think we could have in the sections. The films were helpful to watch but I think sometimes we needed more targeted discussion questions to get the ball rolling. ",
            "\u00a0WEAKNESS: The size of class. It was big. \r\nSTRENGTH: the fields trips and guest speakers. \r\nSTRENGTH: The film screenings\r\nSTRENGTH:  The way Shimi included student experiences in his lectures through the reading responses \r\nSTRENGTH: The assignments that required us to explore different water management databases. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the homework was helpful in that it had us do small tasks that explored different water databases. The book was great. The other readings were entertaining when they were highly opinionated. \r\n\r\nStudying for the midterm and final were the most difficult parts of the course. So much ground is covered in the course it just hits you like a load of bricks at the end all the things you would need the memorize. I wish there had been more advice on re-writing notes or the lists of all the things we learned, far in advance of the final. To that end, usually I feel like homework is reserved for solidifying that information, but the homework in this class was used for a different purpose. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- Shimi is a truly great teacher. He teaches in a way that you will understand and remember the content. The homeworks are interesting and involve databases that a water manager or ordinary citizen might use. \r\n\r\nNo weaknesses ",
            "\u00a0I really liked having class time and lecture in the evening. Perhaps if certain students were assigned to lead discussions, then there would be more equity in conversation. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very well organized. Shimi constantly let us know where we stood in the course progression. The content was very engaging and the readings always relevant.\r\n\r\nThe homework sometimes felt like busy-work. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is the structure and organization--I always knew how the current topic fit within the larger framework of the class. The weaknesses were (a) the same set of students that constantly took over the discussion. I think it would be better to designate discussion after the lecture. And (b) the discussion sections in the evenings didn't seem necessary and took an entire evening out of the week--which though only 1.5 hours, is a large commitment for students with full schedules. Especially, given that this is only a 3 credit course. ",
            "\u00a0Strength is that I walked away from the course with the sense that I could speak to almost any question that someone might ask about freshwater. Another strength is Shimi! Fantastic professor. "

            "\u00a0Take it for sure! It is one of the best classes in FES. A great balance between natural and social sciences. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class even if you come in with experience in the water sector. Shimi is a fabulous teacher who excels at breaking down complicated topics into understandable (but not overly simplistic) concepts. He is a strong lecturer, dedicated, thoughtful, responsive, and deeply committed to making a good experience for his students. ",

            "\u00a0This is a great class and I highly recommend it to anyone who is even remotely interested in water. Do not be dissuaded by the additional obligations (i.e. field trips, night sections). The material is completely manageable and the class was very engaging. Shimi is also an amazing professor and everyone should take a class with him. ",

            "\u00a0It's a good amount of work, but it results in foundational knowledge of various water issues, which I think is important no matter what environmental topic you want to ultimately focus on. ",

            "\u00a0Stay engaged with readings and make sure to do them. They aren't excessively demanding, but offer great amount of insight and inform much of the course. ",
            "\u00a0This is a fantastic class and a great introduction to water issues. There is a fair bit of time outside of regular hours required including section, weekly reading responses, small homeworks but none of it is exactly difficult, just kind of time consuming. ",
            "\u00a0Great class if you are interested in a broad survey of water. This is an introduction class, you won't come away with expertise. You should only take it if water is a specific interest of yours. However, if you are not a specialist, take this class, it's an important piece of the entire environmental pie. "
