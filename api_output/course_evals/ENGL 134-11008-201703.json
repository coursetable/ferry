            "\u00a0I have, in sum, learned to write a story. I feel that I have learned so much on every single aspect of craft and what it takes to write a complete story - this class has pushed me to be a much better writer than before. ",
            "\u00a0I really learned how to read fiction. I learned how to fully appreciate the various components of a story, from the characters to the plot. I also learned how to write and tell a story, how to develop characters, and how to create a truly engaging plot. I feel much more empowered as a storyteller, writer, and reader. I also found that I have a passion for writing fiction that I was not aware of. ",
            "\u00a0Exactly what the title of the course was - I learned a lot about writing fiction by studying elements of craft showcased in great literature that Prof Sexton picked, then learned how to implement that in my own writing. I also learned a lot about myself, my own writing ability, and ways to improve that. ",
            "\u00a0This course has improved my fiction writing significantly (I think!) and given me the skill set to recognize the kind of work that I want to create going forward as well as the increased capacity to appreciate fine work done by others. I really am grateful to this class -- the only one of its kind I've ever taken -- for the experience. ",
            "\u00a0I learned ways to write stories. I learned how to read like an author, find things in the stories that I could implement in my own. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a much deeper understanding of the craft behind fiction writing, both from examples taken from literature and from our own practice. "

        [
            "\u00a0This was such an amazing course. I loved the weekly writing exercises, and had a lot of fun with those. The class discussions were really great and engaging. My one criticism is that some (but not that many) of the readings were incredibly boring, such as Sense and Sensibility. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - so many! Great prof, very encouraging environment for writers to present their work and try new things/take risks. Great and very diverse reading list. Good level of workload, frontloaded at the start of the semester to offset the amount you'll get from your other classes at the end of the semester. Really loved getting to read other ppl's writing and critique it, as well as present our own and get feedback.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - at times, it could feel like class was dragging a bit (but I never felt this when we workshopped other students' work, that felt very engaging for everyone and it was neat to see how we workshopped student work for the same elements of craft that we did for \"real\" writers). I can see how the quality of the class might depend on the ppl in it though. ",
            "\u00a0The short assignments are definitely a strength. They might seem a bit cumbersome, but they get us used to writing regularly and they give Prof. Sexton an opportunity to give us regular cumulative feedback. I also think the size of the class is perfect. The reading materials are a bit controversial (I don't know if a single soul liked \"As I Lay Dying\") but there is much to be learned from them. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: There was a lot of reading. The \"writing book or whatever\" presented information and ways of thinking that I never thought of before. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Maybe not enough one on one interaction with the professor (like office hours). Maybe that's just me. ",
            "\u00a0This was one of the best courses I have taken at Yale.  I really loved the material we were studying.  I found the seminars to be very interesting and engaging and the outside reading was enjoyable and useful.  I loved everything about this course. ",
            "\u00a0The course is a good introduction to the craft of writing fiction and the well curated reading list facilitates the analysis these elements of fiction from the greatest literary fiction writers. That said, you don't get a lot of feedback on your own work until the very end of the semester and have no idea how you're doing in the class. "

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to any student who wishes to improve upon their writing skills, learn how to write fiction or simply wants to take a fun, creative class that will add to their skill set. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It's such an amazing and fun class. ",
            "\u00a0YES! Esp if you're an unconfident writer or someone who doesn't classify themselves as a \"writer\". Prof Sexton is very encouraging and genuinely kind to everyone. This class felt like a wonderful break from the high-stakes, stressful environment you often find in other Yale courses, and it's a great place to take risks or try something new. Great reading list, and really enjoyed reading other students' work and workshopping my own. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would! It was an excellent writing credit, and taking it Cr/D also liberated me a great deal to just reflect on my writing and enjoy the class without pressure. 10/10 ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It is fun, creative, and not terribly hard on you. It's very open to experimentation and encourages you to try new things. ",
