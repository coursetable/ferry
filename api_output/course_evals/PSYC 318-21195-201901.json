            "\u00a0Strengths: very interesting and applied!! It was cool to be able to do so much actual stuff with data after just one class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think the timing/number of assignments was unnecessary and very stressful. In the last weeks of class/finals I found that this class requires way more time than others. I think if the project/final/production quiz were spaced out that would be better. Also, class often ended late, which was stressful when I had to leave and then missed material. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: introduced us to different aspects of phonetics without too much emphasis on any one\r\nWeaknesses: little guidance on production of IPA sounds or using Praat ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- Many different parts of the course contribute to the grade, so none of the tests or assignments are weighted too highly.\r\n- You really do learn a good amount about phonetics. \r\n- The lectures had good continuity and were also uploaded to Canvas for reviewing. That was very helpful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Labs were not well-organized and took an enormous amount of time because of how convoluted they were.\r\n- There was not enough direction or guidance given on the final project. ",

The class provides a great overview of phonetics and you will come out feeling like you have a greater understanding.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes lectures drag on a bit. Some more interactivity may help the lectures be more engaging and make the material stick better. ",

            "\u00a0I would only recommend this class to linguistics majors. It requires a fair amount of time and commitment in order to be successful. You really do need to do the readings as well. There are lots of elements that will challenge you, including listening quizzes where you transcribe foreign words into IPA by ear. The midterm and final aren't too bad, but there is quite a bit of work including a comprehensive final project that you have to do independently. ",

I feel I have a much better understanding of sound as a whole after taking this class, and I know the entire IPA, which is invaluable for linguistics. If you are not interested in linguistics, this class will probably not be extremely interesting. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in linguistics, yes. If not, it is still interesting to take although it might be asking a lot of you if you do not have some background in like an intro to linguistics course. The professors and TA do their best to help you and understand it is a challenging course. "
