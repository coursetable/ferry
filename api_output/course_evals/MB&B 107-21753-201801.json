            "\u00a0There should be more representation among the professors. If not, they should approach the class from more of a listening and learning perspective. I didnt learn much in the class, but we began to have some important conversations about race, gender, sexuality, ability, and socioeconomic status. "

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It was very refreshing to be able to talk about diversity and identity in a STEM environment. I learned a lot and felt I was also able to teach others and make a tangible change on the campus with the project. ",
