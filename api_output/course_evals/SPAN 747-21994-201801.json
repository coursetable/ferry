            "\u00a0Taking Professor Valis Generation 27 Poetry class enabled me to hone and develop the necessary literary analyses skills for deciphering and explicating modern Spanish poetry, especially with respect to the many different tendencies and schools of poetic thought that arose during the modern eras. The centralization of the course upon the various and distinct manners with which the Generation 27 poets interacted, confronted and engaged with the modern era, its implications and conceptualizations enabled students to not only compare and contrast each poets styles and perceptions but also acquire a comprehensive and profound knowledge concerning modern Spanish poetry. Furthermore, the inclusion of many intertextual and intercultural references, such as Charles Baudelaires works and Andr Bretons manifesto, enabled students to acquire interdisciplinary knowledge about the cultural and historical context within which the poems were composed, thus encouraging the students comprehensive and profound learning about modern Spanish poetry.

            "\u00a0Professor Valis wonderful, extensive and insightful explications and commentaries concerning each text deepened her students perceptions towards modern Spanish poetry, especially with respect to her inclusion of a broad range of texts, from manifestos to modern day criticism. The poetry collections selected for this class enabled the students comprehensive and profound learning experience about the consequences of and reactions towards modernity within modern Spanish poetry. The oral presentation provided an empirical opportunity for students to not only develop their Spanish speaking skills but also to showcase, and thus test, their own observations and hypotheses concerning a particular poem, and the final project truly encouraged the students to engage with the poems read in class and strive towards augmenting their analytical skills.

            "\u00a0Yes, I would most definitely recommend this course to my colleagues, since they would surely acquire a diverse and profound knowledge about modern Spanish poetry, and in fact modernity itself, as well as its poetic implications and consequences. Professor Valis kind and extensive explications exemplify the essential analytical skills required towards ones deciphering modern Spanish poetry, and the students would be able to strive towards showcasing such skills themselves within the oral presentation and the final project. Furthermore, the variety of the texts utilized in the class-from collections of modern Spanish poetry itself to literary criticisms of today-ensures the students multidisciplinary and intertextual academic experience.
