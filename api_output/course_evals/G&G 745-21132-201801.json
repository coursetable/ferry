            "\u00a0Through this course I synthesized material taught in other energy studies classes by listening to weekly guest lectures and by completing four writing assignments that included a final research presentation. ",
            "\u00a0This class gives you a wide variety of perspectives on the current state of climate and energy issues around the world, from experts in a wide range of different fields and different locations. The class also helps you develop various styles of writing, from op-eds to shareholder letters to speech writing. Ultimately, it teaches about the complexities and uncertainties of climate and energy issues, and how to make sense of them through a multidisciplinary framework. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot more about a wide variety and berth of topics related to the climate and energy spaces. "

            "\u00a0This course is a nice ending seminar for the energy studies program. It is a manageable workload with guest lectures each week. I thought the writing assignments were generally well-designed and allowed students to think through current issues in energy and write analytical and persuasive pieces.\r\n\r\nThe quality of the guest lectures varied considerably; some were fascinating, while some were somewhat dry. The final research project was very open-ended and allowed students to research a topic interesting to them. Because this class is so small, I wonder if there are ways to incorporate more class discussion about the interesting topics we covered. ",
            "\u00a0This course was excellent at giving its students first-hand accounts from researchers and stakeholders of many different perspectives on climate and energy. This allows for interactive learning of up-to-date information and viewpoints, which is especially important for the complex and rapidly changing fields of climate and energy. The student presentation at the end was also a great part of the class, as the topic was entirely up to us and the approach was flexible. The writing assignments in between pushed us to put ourselves in the role of different stakeholders and think critically about what would be important to them. ",
            "\u00a0This course covers all sorts of developments in the energy industry. \r\n\r\nStrengths: Interesting guest speakers, covered a range of topics \r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes was heavy on financials - difficult to understand if you don't have a finance background, I would have used a smaller classroom - the classroom selected was way too large and I think that the class would have felt more intimate if we had a different room rather than the large lecture hall, the  readings were sometimes repetitive of the presentations ",
            "\u00a0Fantastic topics and very interesting assignments as well. The biggest suggestion for improvement would be to fix a class time/day at the start of the semester and allow students to mold their schedules around the course rather than whenisgood links. "

            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY TAKE THIS CLASS! It's a great senior seminar that covers incredibly interesting topics without much work. Great class for senior spring! ",
            "\u00a0This course is a manageable final course in energy studies. It is an interesting seminar with a diverse array of writing assignments. I would recommend that students look carefully at the guest lecture list, because these lectures can make or break the class. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course. If you are in Energy Studies, it is a great way to finish up the program as it brings together a broad range of perspectives that you have probably touched on in your other Energy Studies classes. Even if you are not in Energy Studies, it is an excellent informative class--a series of interesting speakers and writing assignments in between to help solidify an understanding of these different perspectives, culminating in a final presentation of a topic of your choosing. If you are at all interested in the current state of climate and energy issues around the world, this is a great class to take. ",
            "\u00a0If you're looking for a good senior Energy Studies course with not a lot of work (I actually even had fun doing some of them) this one is great! Professor Oristaglio and Krosinsky are great and bring in excellent speakers. Only bummer is the G&G building is far. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This is a fantastic course and Michael is very eager to work with students to maximize learning. "
