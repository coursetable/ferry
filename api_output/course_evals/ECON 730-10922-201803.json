            "\u00a0Both the lecturers were great, and the material covered was very interesting and relevant. The only suggestion for improvement is that, without any assignments or exams for the first semester, it was hard to know what was expected of us in terms of being able to replicate the models in the papers, or simply understand the intuition behind them. ",
            "\u00a01st quarter: clear presentation, good lecturer, nice to see the structural side of development. Models were well-explained, Mark is clearly knowledgeable about these topics.  Would be nice to have more variety in the topics covered.\r\n2nd quarter: very very good lectures and slides.  Really enjoyed coming to class, the selection of papers was a good mix of reduced form and structural, all very interesting applications, and Nick is very good at distilling them to their essence and drawing key lessons from each -- what insights we can use with regard to approaches and topics for our own research -- this is what this paper did well, this is what it didn't do well, this is an approach that's fruitful, etc. "
