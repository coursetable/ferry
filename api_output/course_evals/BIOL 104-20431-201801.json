The material was also really interesting which helped keep me engaged.\r\n\r\nOverall, I think there should be more communication/cohesion in the intro biology sequence. This doesn't really apply to Bio 104 as I think the professor did a good job of trying to tie in other parts of the intro sequence, but there were weird gaps in the sequence (we never actually learned about photosynthesis) so I think the intro sequence should be better arranged.

We were able to go to the marsh gardens and the peabody and see all of the cool diversity present here on Yale's campus. The one thing I would say  to improve this course is to have review sessions that have been planned rather than just Q&A sessions. The Q&A sessions are helpful, but not as much as the review sessions from BIO 101-103. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: The papers were integrated into the course in a way that emphasizes the most important points and glosses over the methods and complex background information.  While this may be dull for students with very strong scientific backgrounds, it does serve to create a level and fair playing field.  During one section we had the option to either attend a tour of the Peabody collections or the Marsh Botanical Gardens.  This was an excellent addition to the course.  As someone whose biological sciences are lacking, the exposure to actual honest-to-goodness plants and animals was a great wakeup to the material of the course. Though this did lack any tie-in to the course material.  It would have been a fine addition to the final to have a question at the end asking for an interesting fact from the tour you went on.  Section was always good.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The lectures were often delivered in a dry and unengaging tone.  Michael Donahue's passion was occasionally apparent but rarely translated into energy or enthusiasm from the crowd of undergraduates.  The 5-page paper which is the majority of the out-of-class work isn't started early enough in the course and left me struggling in the last few weeks with a variety of other tasks which needed doing at the same time. This was quite possibly a factor of my procrastination, not the course design. ",

            "\u00a0The order of the course made a lot of sense, as each lecture built on the last. I really loved that the slides were so organized and that each discussion section allowed us to reinforce our knowledge. It was also nice having the lecture outline at the start and end of each chapter so that the big ideas could be reinforced. ",

            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this course a lot. the material was fascinating, and Donoghue really taught everything well. My only complaint about the class is that so much of the grade relies upon the midterm and final (which is fine), but the grade distribution for the midterm was very narrow, meaning that, because the intro bio sequence has strict percentage cutoffs for grades, the difference between letter grades is very small and slightly arbitrary. This made the class a bit stressful because it felt like I was competing to be just a pint or two able every else, which is silly. I'm not sure how to exactly fix this issue besides changing the grading system or designing the test to have a wider distribution. ",

I thought that the assignments made sense and were the appropriate difficulty level, that every assignment was intentional, informative, and fun, and that there was a wonderful focus on making the material enjoyable and stimulating rather than just being hit over the head with needless facts. I enjoyed every minute of class, and actually enjoyed studying the material during finals period! ",

            "\u00a0Really awesome format. Lectures were very engaging. Best class of the intro bio sequence by far. Only thing I think could be improved is section. The journal club format seemed kind of out of place. Sections were often unengaging. ",
            "\u00a0This course effectively covers ecological and evolutionary biological concepts in a way that's pretty easy for students to understand. I cannot think of any weaknesses or improvements. I greatly enjoyed the tours to Marsh Gardens/the Peabody Museum, so I would highly encourage the continuation of that. ",

I think the positives are that it makes ecology and evolutionary biology really interesting and made me want to continue learning. The assignments also made me feel like I was actually doing something interesting and scientific that I enjoyed. I didn't really have any negatives with the course. ",

Some examples include the field trips and the final paper. Additionally, a strength of this course was its predictability. It was always very clear what was expected on assignments and examinations, and this made it easy to prepare for class and be successful. ",
            "\u00a0Prof Donaghues passion for the material and for teaching was a big strength of the course. The only weakness I can think of is that the format of the lecture slides on canvas was a little confusing - it would have been better if they were each labeled with their topic, and each set of slides only included the info from one topic (rather than the carryover from previous days).

However, it would be a more engaging and interesting course if the focus was less on memorization, especially memorizing phylogenetic trees that scientists will probably revise as soon as we learn them.

            "\u00a0What a relief after 102 and 103!! Pretty good course in that it does apply some of the knowledge from 101-103, but does not rely on it too much.  The week where we had field trips instead of section was great! I wish it was easier to go to both the marsh gardens and the Peabody. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very interesting lectures with engaging slides and supplemental material, discussion sections were run well, the homework was very reasonable. \r\nWeaknesses: the class was very backloaded with very little work at the beginning and two papers and a final at the end. There was less critical thinking than, say, Bio 102, and more memorization (but this is the nature of the material). ",

The final exam did not do as great of a job as the midterm in covering all of the major topics we covered in the second half of the class.  The final paper was also very stressful and I felt was not necessary. ",

Every lecture seems to involve some aspect of the animal kingdom and a tie-in to some cool fact.  \r\nThis is not to say that the course lacks anything in science!  The material is rigorously cited and sourced from recent journal articles.  This is science taught by a scientist.  And sometimes that's obvious.  Donahue's lecturing ability isn't great, but he seems to enjoy it.  The material which would be otherwise \"incredibly engaging\" with another professor is instead \"interesting.\"  His slides are clear enough and attendance at lecture really isn't required to do well in the course.\r\nSome of the more nitty-gritty details of the methods are quickly distilled and while this may frustrate people who are in this course for the hard-science of biology, it really is fine.  The course doesn't offer any significant advantage to those who have taken biology before as many of the questions require knowledge of the specific clades and traits discussed in lecture, not just the general ideas or concepts.  There is an advantage, though, to people who know fossil and evolutionary lineages.  The origins of fish, birds, and plants feature heavily in the \"evolution\" part of the course.  Drawing and memorizing phylogenetic trees is an interesting exercise in a class which is otherwise majority memorization.  \r\n\r\nThe course is well-taught and the staff competent.  It's required for a bunch of stuff so you should probably take it.  But if you are actively looking for a fun bio course this isn't the one. Take E&EB 225 \"Evolutionary Biology\" for harder science evolution and take G&G125 \"History of Life\" for learning about the evolution of the modern animals we come to know and love through BIOL104. ",
            "\u00a0Take it if you have to take it and it will be better than Biol 103, but it's a lot to go through if you're not using it as a prereq for something. ",
            "\u00a0104 is the gem of the bio sequence!  I felt that Professor Donoghue presented the content in a much more straightforward way than the Professors in Biol 102 and Biol 103, this made coming to class enjoyable rather than confusing. ",
            "\u00a0It's refreshing to enter Biol104 after the rest of the sequence to observe biology on a macro scale (especially since 102 and 103 are so specific!).  I'd recommend this course to someone interested in evolution or plants. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This is an excellent class taught by an excellent professor! You will have a great time learning about ecology and evolution! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Best bio sequence class! ",
            "\u00a0yes! definitely take bio 104 in the spring. donoghue is amazing. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This class is very interesting, even for those not particularly inclined toward the sciences. ",
            "\u00a0Even if this course isn't required for your major, Professor Donoghue makes the class interesting, and it's quite easy to follow along in class. The curve is not high since a lot of people tend to do well, but it's a great class nonetheless. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because it is extremely interesting and the topics are very relatable and important. ",
            "\u00a0Only take if you have to or if you like biology, material was interesting ",
            "\u00a0This course was really enjoyable! I even enjoyed studying for the tests because the material was so interesting. It is by far and large the highlight of the intro bio sequence and something to look forward to. Definitely take the class with Donoghue, as it is much better than with Near. Be warned that the two tests are overwhelming based on simply memorizing the material from the slides, and, if that is a weak point for you or something you hate, you might not enjoy the class very much. Otherwise, this class is really enjoyable. Every lecture was fun and engaging! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I loved this course. It was very informative and very well taught. A lot of memorization. But worthwhile. ",
            "\u00a0I think this was the best course in the Biology Intro track, but I don't think I would recommend it to anyone that doesn't have to take it or isn't super interested in ecology/evolution. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. This course was so enjoyable and interesting, and definitely the highlight of this semester! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This course was neither content-intensive nor too easy, but I came away with more than enough understanding of key concepts that would allow me to understand primary literature in the field. ",
            "\u00a0Only if required to do so for their major. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! A very well-structured overview of life history and evolutionary principles. You learn about fossils, molecular methods to infer phylogenetic relationships, ecological interactions. Some of the stuff is really fascinating. If you're into theoretical, logical stuff, you'll for sure find the conditions for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (a population that is static, without natural evolution) and inferring phylogeny interesting. If you like dates/history, then you'll enjoy learning about the time scales (eras) of life on earth. But most of all, if you have any sense of fascination at the complexity of modern life, you'll be enchanted by the strange, wonderful species you learn about. ",
            "\u00a0would highly recommend this class to students! Unfortunately, he or she would have to get through 103 first which was very* poorly taught. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Truly the light at the end of the tunnel of the on-semester bio sequence. I actually enjoyed this class and I had given up on the hell of 101-103. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to any student looking to learn the basic concepts behind ecology, especially if the course is taught by Prof. Donoghue, who does a wonderful job at explaining various topics. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I thoroughly enjoyed the course and found the information very interesting. Not only for someone who needs to take the course, but for someone who wants to understand how life came to be the way it is. It also makes me very interested in the major. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this class. Professor Donoghue is one of the best teachers Yale has to offer, and his class was amazing. Each lecture is full of interesting material which keeps the class engaging and fun. I never found myself bored in this class. From the field trips to the final paper, this class is designed for every type of student. If you are deciding between taking the intro bio sequence on or off sequence, I would say take it on sequence just to have Donoghue. The strengths of 104 definitely make up for the disadvantages of 103. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! I learned a lot and it was very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is a comprehensive introduction to ecology and evolutionary biology that puts research methods and analysis like phylogenies directly into practice through the weekly assignments. ",
            "\u00a0BIOL104 is often thought of as the least painful module in the sequence, which is true, but beware that the exams require memorizing a lot of very specific details unlike the other modules. ",
            "\u00a0Yess! You have to get through 101-103 to take it which sucks, but it is so interesting and probably the best bio class for non bio major science because it feels a lot more like elementary school bio where you learn cool facts and look at pictures of animals. ",
            "\u00a0I wouldn't recommend it to non-STEM people just because you have to go through the whole sequence to get to it, but it was my second favorite of the sequence. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It's so fun and interesting without sucking up all your time. ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend this course and the teacher! Very wonderful and interesting ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This is by far the best class in the biology sequence because it is taught in a way to make it interesting (not painful) to students. Even people leas interested in evolutionary biology will like this course. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Michael Donoghue was so fantastic that even though I am premed, I found myself completely fascinated by his lectures on plants and tiny organisms! ",
            "\u00a0I have already recommended this course to many students. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend BIOL 104. Unlike other BIOL students, 104 was not my favorite, but I really did like the teacher and his way of explaining things. I think this is truly biology for the beginner, which is nice because we were able to get really in-depth on topics because the instructor assumed that we didn't know anything on the topic and could offer some clear sentences in explanation. The course is good, but it is not super easy in my opinion--still a lot to know and to memorize typical of a BIOL sequence course, and so I would still remain on top of your game. ",
            "\u00a0As one of the intro bio modules, you'll probably only take this course if it's required or might be required for your major. It's...fine. Professor Donoghue does a pretty good job of crafting a compelling story during his lectures so that it's more interesting and organized and you can see how everything is connected-- in terms of material and in terms of ecology and evolution! The slides are also pretty nice and good to study from. But we had to know a lot of seemingly unimportant details about random groups of species, which didn't seem interesting or necessary to me. As a result, there was a lot of memorization involved in studying for the midterm and final (ie. memorizing phylogenies and examples of specific concepts, rather than applying the concepts themselves on the exam), which wasn't my cup of tea, and it seemed like the exams were not really testing our understanding but rather our ability to regurgitate everything from the slides. The two problem sets early on were useful in testing our understanding of phylogenies and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and were good practice for the midterm. The final paper (5 pages on a trait and clade), however, seemed kind of pointless. A few of the papers we read for section were interesting, and somewhat easier than the ones we read for other modules. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course! By far the best of the intro bio sequence. The material was taught very interestingly and I learned a lot of thing we typically would not learn in an intro bio course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes it is very interesting and provides a great explanation of past life on Earth. ",
            "\u00a0it's the light at the end of the tunnel that is the intro bio sequence -- take it w donoghue! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student since it was an interesting introduction to the evolutionary history of life. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, it was not much work and was really interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. I feel that I learned a lot about the diversity of life and have a greater understanding of the value of ecology and evolution. ",
            "\u00a0If you need intro bio ",
            "\u00a0Yes but no because you would have to go through the rest of the bio series. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This class is fantastic even if you don't need to take it as a requirement for anything. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in ecology or have to for a major, definitely take it. It's an interesting class and a good break from the other material presented in the intro bio sequence. ",
            "\u00a0No ",
            "\u00a0You have to take all of intro bio to get to this class so maybe not... but ecology and evolutionary biology is a really interesting subject so take classes in that department! ",
            "\u00a0Yes if you are interested in it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes especially if you have a love for biology, this course embraces that instead of scaring you away from the subject ",
            "\u00a0Yeah! I would recommend it, it would be fun to get a overview of ecology and evolutionary bio, it was one of the more fun parts of the biology sequence ",
            "\u00a0This was a very interesting and engaging course and I would recommend it to other students. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. I found this class to be very interesting. I really enjoyed learning the material. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, by far my favorite module of the intro bio sequence ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student, even if they do not study biology or are not pre-med, just to take a fun and interesting science class. It teaches you a lot about the history of humans and life on Earth, and I think it is knowledge that is important for everyone to know. ",
            "\u00a0Hands-down the best class in the biology sequence. The professor was much better than the other three and really seemed to understand his students and how college students functioned. "
