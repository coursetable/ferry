I also think there's pretty limited value in doing extended literature reviews (which ended up mostly as just random theorizing, or lots of historical summarizing).\r\nI also feel like half the semester was spent on just exploring possible ideas or research questions, which meant we just kind of sat there and talked about what we thought was interesting, which while not bad, was not that helpful.
