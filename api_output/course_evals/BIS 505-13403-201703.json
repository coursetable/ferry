            "\u00a0One suggestion for this class is that there should be a compendium of sorts (or like a binded folder) given out in the beginning of the course with all the printouts we will use throughout the course. This would help keep all of the sas codes we used throughout the semester organized.I felt that riffling through all the handouts was a challenge and it would also make it easier for the professor as well if she didn't have to print out copies before each class. Instead just have a booklet of all of them that students bring with them to class each day. I think going over the slide deck in lab wasted time. The homework before lab should be to review the slide deck and then you could have the entire lab period to do that lab work and ask questions. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I thought the workload was very fair, and Dr. Claus is great at addressing any confusion or questions. There was plenty of help available outside of class for both class material and SAS-related questions. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the notes were sometimes scattered and hard to follow along during lecture. The grading system was confusing as well-- I feel like the amount of points taken off for questions either in the homework or exams was a bit arbitrary. Points would often be taken off with no real explanation as to why, so I don't know how to improve upon them in the future. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I thought the course was okay but could have been taught better. I really enjoyed the teaching methods of the guest lecturer.\r\n\r\nThe quality of the TFs varied.  Some seemed more engaged and willing to teach than others. ",
            "\u00a0I do not like the format of lab write up. We should include output and discuss them more thoroughly. This way we can pinpoint where mistakes were made and get stronger feedback ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:  relevance to the field of public health, relevance to epidemiology when taken concurrently\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:  coding assignments teach how to complete the assignment, they do not teach how to become proficient in SAS ",
            "\u00a0Good class need consistent teaching amongst TA but way too hard of an exam. Please curve!! even open book/notes means nothing ",
            "\u00a0The material was interesting. For an intro level course, there were some fascinating applications in the problem sets and material that went more in-depth compared to previous statistics courses I have taken (not at Yale). \r\n\r\nHowever, the structure of the course was severely lacking. For one, I felt like we did not \"learn\" SAS; rather, we learned how to copy code. Coding is all about problem-solving and tinkering, but I felt like that element was completely missing in the course. Additionally, despite R being an option, nobody opted to use it. Even though I wanted to, there was little to no support to guide someone, so I felt compelled to just use SAS, even though companies are straying away from it more. The lab slides dedicated maybe 1 slide for the R code and 15 or so for SAS.\r\n\r\nSecond, the classes themselves did not help enhance my understanding of the material. It was nearly impossible to read the instructor's handwriting in the notes, so you really had to pay close attention (which is a good thing, of course). However, the pacing was hard to follow, which caused a great deal of confusion. If we do chi squared test problems in the problem set which is due today, why are we learning about the chi squared test on the day it is due? I sensed many people had a hard time following along, both during class and the exam reviews. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course does a really good job with teaching through problem sets and lab assignments. The practical aspect of the class helped me learn a lot more than if I were to just sit in lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Learned very useful skills (like SAS) and statistical analysis methods that are incredibly applicable to the field of research in public health. Skills from this class helped me get a paid summer internship as a data scientist! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend creating a compendium of all of the SAS printouts that were given out throughout the semester. If each student was given a compiled folder or book with the pages in order of when we were going to discuss them that we could bring to and from class each day, it would save the professor a lot of time to print out the handouts before each class and would help the students stay organized instead of rifling through all the handouts. Also I think the homework before lab should have been to review the slide deck because when the TF went through it in the beginning of lab it wasted about 20 min of time that we could have been working on the lab. ",
            "\u00a0Things could have been explained more sequentially in class and more steps could have been shown for better comprehension. Also, more effort on the part of the professor to make sure everyone can ready the notes on the board (very sloppy handwriting). ",
            "\u00a0Class notes are not very clear, sometimes it is very hard to read the handwritings. may be better to present the content in the form of powerpoint. \r\n\r\nThe slides for sas labs were very clear and good for review. ",

            "\u00a0In general, I enjoyed this course. Some of the earlier material was review for me. I think the emphasis on SAS was important for me as it was the first statistical programming language I have learned. I do wish R was better incorporated into the class as I feel I mostly needed to teach myself it. The presentation of material could be slightly more organized. ",

            "\u00a0The way SAS was taught was incredibly poorly organized.  We were never really taught how to do anything in SAS and then expected to somehow know how to do things.  It seemed like an afterthought of the class.  The SAS portion of the course should definitely have been a separate course.  I learned virtually nothing about how to do do work in SAS and simply copied what was in the powerpoints without really knowing what it meant. ",

Homework assignments were also fair for what was taught in class, but there were times when homework would be due a day or two after material was covered in lecture. This was a bit stressful, and didn't allow a lot of time to comprehend material nor ask questions with TF office hours. I did find that it was super beneficial to attend office hours prior to homework and labs being due as there were a lot of things covered. Lectures were an adequate level. Material wasn't always presented in the most organized fashion, but paired nicely with the textbook. ",

            "\u00a0The grading of the homework and tests seems arbitrary. Losing 8 points for leaving out a buzzword and only losing 1 for a serious arithmetic error. Kind of gave the sense that the points don't matter at all. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The TFs, the professor's expertise in seeing how student's saw how to solve problems and switching it to our lens. Also, repetition was good.\r\nWeaknesses: I did not appreciate how the final was not reflective of our practice exam. I thought the midterm was fairly written but the final was pretty out of the ball-park. I also wish the professor wrote with smaller pens on the projector because it is terribly difficult deciphering her handwriting. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I really enjoyed what we learned. The course did a nice job of laying out the foundations of Biostats. (I previously took a Biostats course in undergrad and wanted to compare how the two were taught. I thought this one was very clear.) Also, office hours were really helpful and plentiful, and homework was given back in a very timely manner.\r\nWeaknesses: The tests sometimes covered examples that were merely covered in class rather than in homework. It would have been nice to go further into some test questions in our homework.\r\nImprovement: Having the tests focus more/expand on homework material rather than random examples done in class that we never discussed again.

I would like to take 2 separate classes and to learn SAS (programming/data analysis) deeper instead tapping the pond with very little inapplicable knowledge (because my skill is not ready) and forget about everything I've learned later.. I understand it's introductory, but programming and stats nowadays are so important and we didn't focus on maths part enough!!! ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot in this class, even though I had taken a similar statistics course in undergrad. My only complaint was that sometimes lectures did not seem to have a flow--Dr. Claus would go on tangents sometimes with other problems and that got a little confusing. Also, I know Dr. Claus has worked on this, but sometimes her reading was soooo hard to read. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Claus is a great teacher and she made her biostats lectures interesting by including different data sets that applied to the class. There was a lot of emphasis on SAS which is a useful quantitative skill. ",

            "\u00a0This course was slightly disjointed in my opinion. I had trouble following the flow of material that was presented in class. More clearly defining the topic of each class would be helpful. The SAS portion of the class was relatively well laid out. I felt that I was able to learn basic commands, but at times I also felt as though I was just copying what was available in the examples. I was satisfied with the level application this course demonstrated. Problems were very relevant to public health and almost no statistical concept was presented without a direct application. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the lecture portion of this class was excellent- I really appreciated that she did not use lecture slides but instead hand-wrote and explained everything as she went. The abundance of examples used also contributed to a greater understanding of content and how it can be applied to practice problems. ",

            "\u00a0It would be more helpful to have more lab time and less lecture time, or to do part of lecture in the lab room so that students can use SAS while the professor is teaching it ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I learned a great deal from this course. The level of material was fair. I believe the weighting system of the grades should be shifted to increase the weight on the homeworks as a significant amount of time was spent on these assignments. I also think the timing was somewhat off, where we would have homework problems assigned and due prior to learning the material or learning the material the day it was due, which was frustrating at times.

While I liked the way that the class was taught thematically, and especially appreciated the integration of more tangible examples towards the end of the semester, I think it would have been really helpful to have slides or some type of outline of class to look back on. While the slides that Dr. Claus provides and takes notes on are helpful for recording/remembering many aspects of what we learned in class, sometimes it was a little challenging to locate something I wanted to go back and review. Despite struggling a lot in this class in the beginning, I found it to be a positive experience ultimately, and I learned so much--I do feel like I have a real foundation in statistics from which I can build! ",
            "\u00a0I felt that this course was an adequate introduction to basic principles in statistics and did a good job of teaching those concepts in relation to their public health applications.  Doing the reading before lecture is necessary to reinforce concepts. ",
            "\u00a0I would have liked a stronger emphasis on SAS. I understand that we need to understand statistical concepts but having to do problems by hand isn't very relevant to our future careers. I found it frustrating that students who were not enrolled in the course could attend computer labs- the classroom was too large and I would show up early only to be stuck way in the back, where I could not read the board and the TF could not see me raising my hand.

            "\u00a0it is a basic class for new students to understand the statistical knowledge. the recommended boos are really useful. But I think to use PPT while teaching is easier for students to understand the class content. it is clearer than hand-writing and easier for reviewing. ",
            "\u00a0The class is nice in that it doesn't require you to memorize any information. Tests are open note, open book, so it's more about whether you understand the material. So many handouts, so compiling notes was a bit difficult. In addition, tests were difficult, even though they were open note. The questions were a bit confusing to avoid asking in the exact same wording as in other assignments. In addition, grading seemed fairly subjective. ",
            "\u00a0It would be useful to record these lectures like other courses in YSPH are recorded.  It would be very useful to see an equation used again while studying.  Sometimes, it can be difficult to write down all of the information presented plus notes in class.  While learning how to work with equations, many of us would benefit from the ability to re-watch lectures. ",
            "\u00a0The course fulfilled its objective of presenting and teaching the main concepts and principles of biostatistics. The course relies on some degree of self-learning, especially for labs. It was interesting to learn and overview the concepts for SAS. ",
            "\u00a0The coursework is very relevant and the syllabus does a very good work to explain the requirements at the outset.\r\n\r\nThe homework assignments are also well designed. But biostatistics is a hard subject to teach and it is hard to satisfy the students on as far as the outcome/productivity of attending a lecture is concerned.

Handwriting could theoretically be useful for answering student questions, but that was not how it was used in this course.\r\n-- There was not enough engagement with students during class. I recommend 5-10 minutes during class for students to work through questions in small groups, before sharing with the full class. Also, incorporate methods to gauge understanding of the material during the lesson, and adjust course accordingly (if 90% of students answer a question correctly through a polling/voting/handraising system, move on to a new subject; if 30% of students answer a question correctly, the educator has not effectively conveyed the concept and must backtrack, rephrase, explain, elicit questions from students).
