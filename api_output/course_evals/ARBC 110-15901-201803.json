            "\u00a0I learned the basics of Arabic grammar, vocabulary, and culture. I also learned some great Arabic songs. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the Arabic alphabet as well as basic vocabulary in MSA and detailed grammar structures. ",
            "\u00a0Of course I learned basic Arabic words and grammar and introductory phrases. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt the basics of the Arabic language (both Modern Standard Arabic and the Shaami dialect) -- the letters, basic grammatical features, as well as simple sentence structures. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read Arabic, interesting facts about the cultures of Arabic-speaking countries, some bopping Arabic music, and lots and lots of Arabic vocab and grammar! "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0It gives its students a little foundational knowledge of everything, which is a strength, but it can also be overwhelming in trying to teach both an Arabic dialect and formal Arabic. At times, it can feel like you're learning two languages at once with little integration. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths include high focus on interesting and important grammar conventions that allowed the construction of thoughtful phrases. However, vocabulary retention and dialect were emphasized less. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Easy A as there are many easy assignments; Aziz is very very generous in grading, very fun and entertaining, learn lots of the culture and history of words/letters\r\n Weakness: too easy, new lessons and vocabulary are not easily retained as he doesnt drill it into our head, vital lessons are just visited and touched on (so not too much in-depth knowledge), gets off topic\r\n\r\nImprovements: focus on both Shaami and MSA equally, grade harder on homework, ",
            "\u00a0I would like more emphasis on the Shami dialect. However, the professor was very accessible and the class environment really facilitated learning. ",
            "\u00a0I liked its cumulative approach to learning the different grammatical forms and sentence structures, and that what was covered in class was reinforced by the online companion guide. However, I felt that there was too little emphasis placed on the Shaami dialect in the course, and I do not feel like i have a good grasp of it in comparison to MSA. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I learned A LOT. The class was very enjoyable and I looked forward to it every day because of the casual and funny way Prof. Aziz teaches. I learned things that were not necessarily included in the textbook but helped with learning (e.g. Arabic music). The homework and in-class drills that we did daily and regular examinations/ feedback were all very very helpful. \r\nWeaknesses: Prof. Aziz is not always the best at explaining grammatical concepts and he sometimes teaches us things that peers in the other profs' class, our T.A., and friends who take Arabic at other schools tell me are probably too advanced. Also, the class was a little too fast-paced. "

            "\u00a0Yes, if you are interested in learning Arabic and are willing to commit a decent amount of time to it. The professors say 2-3 hours a night but about halfway through the semester the workload decreased quite a bit because we already knew the alphabet.\r\n\r\nI will probably never forget the interpretive dance that Aziz did to a Fairouz song. !   ",
            "\u00a0Definitely would recommend. Gives the basics of Arabic to begin the process of learning the language and progressing was enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0If you want an easy A, go ahead. But you will be behind compared to other Arabic L1 classes. It is very fun and entertaining, while still expressing challenges about the language specifically (not the class/grade). ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It is a great introduction to both the Arabic language and culture. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Prof. Aziz is a super nice, loveable guy who made the daunting task of learning Arabic fun. I learned so so much about the Arabic language and the Arab world. Also, the small class size was really conducive to both learning and making friends. "
