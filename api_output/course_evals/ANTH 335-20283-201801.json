            "\u00a0This course provides an evolutionary perspective into primate diversity. It helps you think critically about some of the methods used to evaluate fossil taxa and reconstruct relationships, and also exposes you to some of the basics of primate bony anatomy. ",
            "\u00a0I love looking at primate bones! Really amazing class! Learned a lot about something I would have otherwise never learned about! ",
            "\u00a0How primate morphology reveals things such as diet (dentition) and locomotion (limbs). ",
            "\u00a0Comprehensive overview of literature peraining to primate morphology, radiation and speciation as well as review of skills to assess the quality of a scientific paper. ",
            "\u00a0An understanding of primate evolution, morphological analysis, phylogenetic analysis, primate diversity and distribution, and the current debates in the field. "

            "\u00a0Though I liked the course, it felt like it was trying to do too much. Having a lecture, a discussion, and a lab all within an hour felt like a lot. I'd break it up into two sessions, eliminate the discussion all together (or relegate it to a section), and then have the lecture one session and the lab the next. Also, I felt like I wasn't very accountable for the information, and so would institute some smaller lab quizzes (biweekly, or maybe 4 per semester) and a final lab practical, as well as two lecture exams (midterm and final). Though this would be a lot of different assignments, I think it would help students get more out of the course and the rich material we have. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing course! Wish for more clarity with grading, though. ",
            "\u00a0The course is well balanced between lecture and lab. I thought it was helpful to learn the material through a lecture, and then apply the material in lab. ",
            "\u00a0Eric is wonderful. I knew nothing about primate evolution before the class, and he made it really enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0A way to engage with the material more than just once a week would be good. Whether that's another class day, or a weekly assignment due on a Friday or Saturday. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Sargis' and Chloe were fantastic at designing labs, planning the content/structure of the course, and answering our questions. Overall a wonderful and informative class--the balance between lecture, lab and discussion was perfect.  \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n       -- the student's engagement during discussions, particularly the disparity between bio and non-bio majors.\r\n                 - Not the course's fault, but it might help if some of the papers were a bit more understandable for non-majors, or if the key portions of the papers were highlighted by you or Chloe\r\n\r\n       -- The labs rarely involved problem-solving as I would have wanted: perhaps if the fossils were designed like an \"evolutionary puzzle\" rather than comparisons whose traits have already been highlighted in class that may be helpful. Its a balance between seeing the things we've learned in lecture in-person versus using the labs for exploration/hypothesis testing. \r\n\r\n       -- The grading felt arbitrary: lab grades were hard to decipher what they mean, the quiz was too quick to be worth as much as it was, and the paper was only submitted at the end so we didn't get feedback to build on. I think having a mid-semester check-in on class participation grades would be very helpful, and having the grades be more performance based (less labs, more the final paper or turning the quiz into an exam would help). I think the quiz could have been expanded to include a written section on evolutionary analysis, and the material we were to be tested on should be more clearly laid out next time. \r\n\r\nOne final suggestion: The course: Primate Diversity and Evolution, seemed a bit heavier on the \"Evolution\" than on the \"Diversity\" components. Balancing them, especially with respect to current conservation/biodiversity issues, might help ground the course in the modern world, provide a complement to the labs and fossils, and make the course especially relevant to the many students interested in Environmental Studies and conservation.

            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course, if only for Sargis. Professor Sargis is one of the best professors I've ever had at Yale, and I sincerely believe every person should take a class with him. Also, the material is super interesting, and it's really eye-opening. ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. Prof. Sargis is an amazing professor, and the class is well designed. The labs are fun, and Prof. Sargis ensures you have the necessary information to succeed in the labs. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. It was a very manageable science credit thats sheds a little light on where we humans came from. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, this course was very fun and well taught. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! A relaxed environment and I've never had a 2 hour class pass so quickly--the diversity of what we do in class makes it fly by. If you are not a science major you will get a bit less out of it and the course may be frustrating at times but overall an awesome class. ",
            "\u00a0Great SC credit for non-SC majors. Difficult material but very helpful teaching and guidance. Primarily look at bones and do labs. "
