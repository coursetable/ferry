            "\u00a0I learned to love Tolstoy. I'll be grateful for this forever. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about close reading and analyzing literary texts, and incorporating outside sources. I also learned how to formulate and defend an argument clearly and effectively through writing. As for the content, I learned about the world in which War and Peace was written and how it has influenced Russian national identity. ",
            "\u00a0Of course, I learned a lot about War & Peace! I also learned a lot about Russian culture at the time the novel was written and the time period the book is written about. We viewed the book and Tolstoy through many different lenses and talked about many things from nationalism to gender and sexuality. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about writing this semester. The course focuses on how to incorporate secondary texts into a literary argument, and the feedback and teaching was incredibly conducive in doing so.  The professor and TA feedback was incredibly involved and helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Great course. We really took a deep dive into Tolstoys best known work, War and Peace. I can know say Ive read a 1200 page classic (huzzah) and I really enjoyed Tolstoys writing style. This course did a really great job of allowing us to read the book without spoilers but also more closely examine Tolstoys views of histories and how this novel has affected the way Russians and people in general remember the Napoleonic wars. We looked at the treatment of gender, history, Russian nationalism, and much more. I really enjoyed this class and would recommend to a friend. Professor Bojanowska does read her lectures from papers, but theyre extremely precise and well thought out. She also makes a point to ask question and made the course part lecture:part seminar, which I really enjoyed. I definitely think I got a lot more out of the course because I heard other students thoughts. This class was really chill as well ( by which I mean everyone was here because they were interested in tackling the novel, and people cared more about discussing and sharing ideas than saying them eloquently and sounding smart). \r\n\r\nReading load is 60-100 pages per week, with two short papers (5 and 7 pages) and a final paper (~12 pages) which wasnt bad. Take it! It was the highlight of my week. Also, the additional readings come from a bunch of different subjects, not just literary POV, which is interesting. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: amazing book, very good secondary literature, great TFs, great professor.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the primary reading (W&P) + the secondary readings was a lot each week. In the first two-thirds of the course, Professor B didn't seem to mind that we'd skip the secondary stuff. But by the end, she started to care, and the workload (particularly between the Tuesday and Thursday class) could be overwhelming and impossible. \r\n\r\nThe lectures were often plot summary, which was often helpful but I know for a fact disincentivized a number of the other students from keeping up with the reading. Something to think about in future courses: plot summary lectures will keep students from engaging fully.\r\n\r\nInstead, I'd strongly strongly strongly recommend Prof. B use lecture to argue for how we ought to read the bookessentially to give us her analysis and let us agree or disagree as we read and think on our own. This makes class time more interesting and gives students a baseline, an anchor for their own interpretation. Otherwise, reading can be enjoyable but unmoored. The best lecturers tell us what they think, feed us an argument from an agenda, and let us criticize or support as we sit fit. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course include its focused, in-depth study of a single work, interesting and insightful interpretations from Professor Bojanowska, and the opportunity to engage more in discussion. I think it could be improved by making it a seminar-style course, instead of a lecture-based course. The most interesting classes that we had were the ones in which we were able to discuss the book more freely. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength of the course are the secondary readings. They are interdisciplinary and provide different approaches to interpreting the book. ",
            "\u00a0This is an awesome course! It was great to be able to focus on one dense book instead of reading multiple Russian novels. We were really able to dig in and talk about the book and Tolstoy. It's a very dense book so there was always a lot to talk about. The reading is very manageable and interesting both for the main text and secondary sources. This course could be improved by having a longer class length. 50 minutes is just not enough time to talk about the assigned reading, let alone get into too long of a discussion. This class should have the 75 minutes class length. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course was the teaching and TAs. Professor Bojanowska is an incredibly interesting professor and lecturer. The TAs are both very engaged and committed to our learning. Of course the material itself-- War and Peace-- is an inherently wonderful and rich text, so having such an amazing team bring it to life was a really good experience. ",
            "\u00a0I think the strength of this course was the novel we were reading, which made section enjoyable and engaging. \r\n\r\nPerhaps a similar structure to the lecture from the beginning would have been preferable, given how small the lecture was. "

            "\u00a0Strong recommend. Tolstoy is worth your time. More importantly, Professor Bojanowska is worth your time. She's erudite and kind, funny and warm. If you ever have the chance to take a one-book course, do it without hesitation. Tired of skimming readings? Fed up with sprinting through a semester of books you bought but never actually finished? Take a class on a single book: you'll read every word and get more bang for your buck, financially and intellectually, than a year in DS. Do it do it do it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I enjoyed the course very much. Even being someone who was not very familiar with War and Peace or Russian culture, I feel like I was able to grow to appreciate it on a deep level. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to people who are interested, or at least curious, about Russian literature and War and Peace in particular. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would highly recommend this course to any other student. It's great for people just starting to get interested Russian literature, who have reading War & Peace on their to-do list, or who are avid Russian literature fans. The reading load is very manageable, even for students who are not used to a lot of reading, and you get to really dig in to the literature. Tolstoy is also very interesting as a person so it is awesome to see it reflect in his work. HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone interested in Russian Literature. Learning about the history, different views, and the context of War and Peace is critical to a full understanding of the text. ",
            "\u00a0YES! OF course. This class was great. ",
            "\u00a0Great course. We really took a deep dive into Tolstoys best known work, War and Peace.
