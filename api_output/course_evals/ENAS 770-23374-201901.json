            "\u00a0Developed foundational skills in soft robotics, learning how to create a soft gripper, a sensing glove, and more (in personal projects). I learned a lot of insights in the soft robotics world, which is a very new and exciting field. ",
            "\u00a0Deep understanding of Soft robotics, their applications, and benefits. "

            "\u00a0A lot of the classes are guest lectures and labs. While those were very thorough and hands-on, a couple of classes are student generated lectures. Those qualities varied from time to time. ",
            "\u00a0There are several lab components which introduced me various aspects of soft robotics, including, but not limited to, sensors, creating pneumatic actuators, learning about variable stiffness materials and more. I feel like there could be even more lab components in the lab, without the assignments that accompany the lab components. ",
            "\u00a0The course was unorthodox which was engaging and it was very hands on. Maybe having deadlines that correspond with what we are learning in class such as deadlines that require manufacturing soft actuators after learning about them (which we did and this was good). Maybe getting a more gradual introduction into robot control instead of cramming it all into one lecture. "

            "\u00a0This class is a nice project driven class on the new field of soft robotics. The control and actuation systems are interesting to learn, and it is a refreshing perspective of robotics compared to the conventional hard bodied robotics. Would recommend. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you want to learn more about the soft robotics and its amazing applications. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It was a great project based course which made most of what we learning in class applicable to what was being done outside of class "
