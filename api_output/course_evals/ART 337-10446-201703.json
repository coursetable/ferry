            "\u00a0To be honest, I didn't get nearly as much from this course as I had expected to. We did do a number of readings about identity, but since we never actually discussed these readings in class after the third week or so, it was pretty impossible to get much of anything from them. I also didn't learn as much about photographic practice as I was expecting to, since our technical demonstrations were always rushed or just very, very basic. If I had to come up with something that I got out of this class, I'd say that encountering interesting photographs and films - even without discussing them - made me gradually appreciate a few specific things, like the texture of film vs. digital, or matte paper vs. luster paper. Still, these few things that I got from the class as compared to what I expected to get from it mean that if I could go back in time knowing what I do now, I never would have taken it. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot. This class taught me an insane amount. It was an intense crash course in contemporary gender and race and sexuality studies, as well as how questions of identity are explored by artists. In addition, I learned some photoshop, how to develop and present a project and digital printing.  I also learned to talk about and argue about contemporary art. "

            "\u00a01. Literally any semblance of organization at all would be an improvement. Terribly, terribly disorganized between readings, work days, slideshow days, crits, field trips, homework, etc. Just all of it was disorganized.\r\n2. The professor needs to actually encourage people to make work about identity. Idk how you could not in a class called Visualizing Identities, but a few people managed and it just grated on the rest of us.\r\n3. The professor needs to actually set an example of being supportive of students' work. She had her favorites, but otherwise just consistently and unfairly dragged people. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing class in which to develop work and learn about identity as much from the other students as from the texts. ",
            "\u00a0The course was strong overall --strongest points were the structure of the critiques --weakest points not enough time to go over more amazing artist. ",
            "\u00a0This class is one of the worst classes I've taken at Yale, if not the worst. The only strength I can think of is the premise of the class - \"Visualizing Identities\" - which was very exciting to see and very different from most art classes that are offered. But since the class failed to live up to what it marketed itself to be, it's hard to count that as a strength. \r\n\r\nThe first main weakness of the course was in its complete lack of organization. The syllabus was constantly changing and the assignments on canvas vs. on the syllabus vs. sent to us via email were often so different that it was pretty impossible to figure out what we were supposed to be doing and when it was due, which made a number of the people in the class give up on trying to do the weekly reading responses. \r\n\r\nThe other way the class actively discouraged doing the reading and responses was the absence of discussion or at least email response to submitted responses. In every other readings-based course I've taken at Yale, the reading response if there is one serves as the student's first somewhat surface-level interaction with the reading, mostly as preparation for a much deeper in-class discussion. Since we stopped discussing or even mentioning the readings in class after about the third or fourth week, it became incredibly frustrating to keep submitting reading responses with cursory analysis of the reading, knowing that we would never have a chance to delve deep enough to actually get anything out of it. While the professor could have tried to make up for this by a) informing the class that even though we would never discuss the readings they were still important to do as some sort of private personal growth exercise, or b) responding to our responses with at least a mini discussion about the reading via email, she did neither.\r\n\r\nAlong those lines, classes were consistently overstuffed with material and disorganized, so much so that we would often spend class periods racing through powerpoints full of photographs or watching films, without actually getting time to discuss any of them. Even on our class field trip, we ran from gallery to gallery, looking over an overwhelming amount of art without ever stopping to discuss it. This made for the similar frustrating sensation that we could have had the same experience just looking at the photographs on our own time - that there was nothing being \"taught\" or \"learned.\"\r\n\r\nThe other major weakness in the course, as mentioned earlier, was its failure to measure up to its initial promise to be about \"visualizing identities.\" While I did appreciate that we looked at a lot of work by marginalized artists and technically read (if not discussed) some theory about identity, we were hardly ever encouraged to bring questions of identity into our own work, or to think about how to do that. On the contrary, students making very personal work about their own identities often faced some of the harshest critiques, and were subject to constant pressure to fit into a rigid set of expectations about what their work should look like, and what kind of images of their own identity were and were not \"acceptable,\" to the point where it became very painful to try to make personal work.\r\n\r\nThe professor frequently used any claims students made about their work's relationship to identity to focus in-class critique on questioning the intellectual/theoretical choices behind the work instead of looking at the work itself, while at the same time demonstrating blatant favoritism for students who never claimed that their work had any relationship to identity. \r\n\r\nThe harshness of critiques and the way we were discouraged from experimenting or making our own choices about how we personally wanted to \"visualize identity,\" made the class feel less like the exploration of identity we had signed up for and more like some kind of pre-professional photography bootcamp that I never would have wanted to take. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength and weakness of the class is the amount that it tried to cover. It was very easy to fall behind in either the readings or the actual art production. Many people simply stopped putting in a lot of weekly effort, which made the class conversations less strong. Having 2 TAs, each of whom only came to half the classes was also a weakness because they always were slightly out of the loop.\r\n\r\nStrengths were Ka-Man, who is incredible and exciting and always willing to meet after class. The types of people in the class and the discussions we had were also great. Pursuing a single project and talking about that project in the context of contemporary art was very exciting. "

            "\u00a0Would absolutely not recommend this class, unless it got organized and was taught by a different professor. I got nothing out of this class as is because we never discussed the (frequently interesting!) readings or discussed the slide shows the prof showed or literally anything. I'm boiling over just thinking about how poorly run the class was. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone interested in identity in an art practice, but would say that students should have previous knowledge of photography and direction within work. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, its shocking to know, within the school of art (undergrad + graduate level) this is the only course that talks race, gender, class, and sexuality. It should be a required course --and blueprint for additional courses within the SOA. I shouldn't have to go into to other schools/departments to have these conversations. ",
            "\u00a0The class is very interesting and well constructed. The professor, however, created a hostile environment tinged with a pack mentality with a couple of students being single out as whipping posts. Students were encouraged to attack their peers personally and in ways not related to an understanding of the work. Critiques centered on the identity of the artist in ways that were personal, hurtful and not at all constructive. I have never experienced anything even remotely close to this level of hostility in a class room environment. ",
            "\u00a0I would in no way recommend this class to another student. Not only was it the most disorganized class I've ever taken at Yale, but it became an increasingly toxic environment for students who actually wanted to take photographs in relation to their identities. Theoretical and artistic choices were questioned at every turn, until many of us felt the need to stay within a very small and very rigid set of expectations and represent our identities in a very specific way, instead of actually making the work we wanted to make. \r\n\r\n\"Visualizing Identities\" was stressful and frustrating, yes, but also deeply artistically demoralizing, and the lack of faith in our work and lack of respect for us as artists or people that we experienced in that class is something that me and several other students in the class are still trying to recover from. I couldn't in good conscience ever encourage anyone else to put themselves through that. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend taking this class to people who have taken photography classes before. "
