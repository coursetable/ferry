            "\u00a0Before I took this course, I had very little practicable knowledge of how to use tones properly, pronounce words well, or how to speak in Chinese generally. This class gave me several learning techniques to help me overcome this challenge, and as a result, I am slowly and steadily making progress in my Chinese speaking. This class also forced me to become a better Chinese listener! ",
            "\u00a0This course developed my speaking, listening, reading and writing abilities for the Chinese language to an extent that I did not believe was achievable in just one semester. We learned nine chapters of material (slightly less than one a week), each with roughly 50 new vocabulary words, and my total Chinese knowledge was more than doubled since I stepped foot on Yale's campus. ",
            "\u00a0Further develop fluency in Mandarin ",
            "\u00a0Your listening skills will improve immensely in this class. Between the weekly required tutorial sessions, the listening comprehension practice, and all the time you listen to Xu Laoshi and Liang Laoshi speak in class, it's impossible for your listening skills to stay stationary. ",
            "\u00a0The ability to quickly and efficiently learn Chinese ",
            "\u00a0I continued to learn more useful vocabulary and grammar, using the knowledge I already gained in last year's L1/L2 classes. I feel even more confident in my Chinese speaking abilities. ",
            "\u00a0I have learned a tremendous amount about handwriting, speaking, an overall grammar skills. ",
            "\u00a0Chinese language speaking, reading, writing ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of Chinese vocab, grammar, and improved in my pronunciation and fluency. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my speaking and listening skills and I also learned how to better study a large amount of characters in a short amount of time. I also gained a better understanding of grammar structures. ",
            "\u00a0By taking this course, I further developed my grasp of Chinese grammar and expanded my vocabulary. This course helped me develop my writing and speaking skills in particular. ",
            "\u00a0Mostly new vocab. ",
            "\u00a0My Chinese vocabulary was vastly expanded and I also learned a great deal of useful grammar; I am far from fluent, of course, but I have improved a lot and also feel much more confident when speaking Chinese because of the way the class is structured. "

            "\u00a0This class does a great job of covering a large amount of material quickly and comprehensively. I feel it could be improved by reforming the weekly presentations (and end of term final project) so that they did not require as much preparation in areas that do not involve Chinese (e.g., creating PowerPoints, editing videos.) I also feel as if the program would benefit from longer, more regimented tutorials that focused on dialogue and drilling on tones, pronunciation, and proper grammar instead of wrote memorization of pre-provided questions and reading words with tone marks from a page. \r\n\r\nOn that note, I feel as if the Chinese oral exams do not necessarily test the ability to speak and listen to the language as much as they require students to memorize textbook content. ",
            "\u00a0Though this course was difficult in that it met five days a week and I had to always be on top of the material, it proved very rewarding in the amount of knowledge I gained. I particularly loved getting the opportunity to present an oral project for each chapter; it allowed me to work on my speaking skills as well as get to know my classmates better. Overall, this was a great course and I'm very excited to continue in L4 next semester! ",
            "\u00a0This course both challenges you and pushes you to grow. The strength is the level of engagement with the teachers and my classmates. The weakness of this course include a sole emphasis ( specifically in oral exams) on the text, which prevent you from using your language skills beyond what we learn in the classroom. ",
            "\u00a0The daily quizzes were definitely a strength. Although I resented them at times, they forced you to keep up with the fast pace of the course and if you did slip up one day, the were little enough that it didn't hurt you badly. A weakness would probably be how we were often let out late, causing me to show up to my next class late as well. ",
            "\u00a0I think being able to keep exams would help us study for future assessments ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is in the teachers. Xu laoshi and Liang laoshi are so nice and so much fun and put so much effort into making sure everyone understands the material. The biggest weakness of the course is its emphasis on memorization of exact phrases and of the texts in the book. The oral presentations often require you to remember specific details about the plot of the text, and when you have all the words and grammatical patterns to say a sentence of a similar caliber but don't remember exactly what happened in the text, it can be quite frustrating. I'd like to see a lesser emphasis on memorizing plot details that don't really have much to do with how well you learned the Chinese material. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: it is very rigorous and forces you to improve quickly \r\nWeakness: The homework and workload is very high ",
            "\u00a0The teachers are very helpful, kind, and knowledgeable about teaching Chinese. I never felt that the grading or homework was unfair even though there were a lot of homework. I would say the biggest weakness of the course is how the daily quizzes are structured; instead of having the first quiz of a chapter be about the course text, the second pinyin/definition, and third the entire character set, I would divide the characters for each chapter such that every quiz will test a subset of the characters. CHNS120 implemented a similar structure and I thought that was better. ",
            "\u00a0Very good course overall. No apparent weaknesses whatsoever ",
            "\u00a0Strength is the emphasis on speaking skills. Weakness is grammar could be explained more ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is that the daily/weekly schedules are very predictable, making it easy for students to prepare well. Also, the professors rotated, giving students opportunities to learn with different teaching styles. ",
            "\u00a0I think there should be more note taking so it is easier to study. I liked how we did each chapter in detail. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength of the class is the emphasis on speaking (instead of writing) in class. Since reading and writing can be practiced outside the classroom as homework, it makes sense to only focus on speaking and listening skills in class. That, in addition to having class every day, is the best way to learn every part of the Chinese language. The only real weakness I found in the class is that vocabulary from previous chapters is rarely used again in subsequent lessons, making it possible that certain words are not necessarily ingrained in student's minds, especially due to the fast pace of the class. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student strongly interested in learning the Chinese language. It is very intensive and detailed, and will provide you with a strong and comprehensive knowledge of the intricacies of the language. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially if you want to reach fluency! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! While it wasn't the most fascinating class I've taken, it's clear that both professors know how to effectively teach Chinese, and you could see the benefit of all the assignments they gave you. ",
            "\u00a0It was terrific ",
            "\u00a0If you took L1/L2, definitely take this course because it is such a seamless transition and just builds upon what you already know. The workload is significantly lighter than in L1/L2 (hardly any written homework), so that's also a plus. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to anyone serious about improving their Chinese level. It is a ton of work but the reward is great! ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in raising your Chinese discourse, writing, and reading skills from a novice level to a more advanced level, CHNS 130 is for you. ",
            "\u00a0Yes if they've taken L1 and L2 ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course, since even though there is a lot of work, you definitely notice a marked difference in your Chinese ability. Also, you really get out of it what you put into it, and if you put in effort, you will feel very rewarded. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It's a great challenge and a class where you receive really tangible results. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class. The professors are animated and caring, and they make class fun and constructive. There are also a lot of assignments that go into grading, which relieves pressure and gives students many chances to raise their grades. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It is well taught and I enjoyed it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to anyone who wishes to learn Chinese; of course, since there is a prerequisite in the form of L1 and L2 Chinese or the placement exam, I feel that anyone who places into this class should take it and is probably willing to take it as well. "
