            "\u00a0This course greatly contributed to my knowledge of Latin historiography, and provided keen insight into Tacitus' historical project. It improved my reading of Latin prose, increasing my vocabulary and strengthening my ability to work through a text. It was conceptually stimulating and intellectually challenging, leaving me with a desire to learn more about the topic and read more Tacitus. "

            "\u00a0No real weaknesses of the course. It was very challenging and sometimes it was stressful to have completed say two-thirds of the assignment and then come to class and have us focus on the one-third I hadn't done, but such is life. The course provides a very thorough consideration of the portions of the Histories that we read. "
