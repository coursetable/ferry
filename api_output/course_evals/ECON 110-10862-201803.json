            "\u00a0I learned that I am far more interested in microeconomics than I thought I was in high school. As someone who enjoys math, I was also pleasantly surprised at the elegant way in which the economic theories and quantitative behavioral models align with one another. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about microeconomics. I thought the material was interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I gained an understanding of both how consumers and firms make decisions to allocate scarce resources, and how those two classes of actor interact in markets. Small bits on game theory and market failures (externalities) were also included. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the basics of economics and how capitalist systems function. ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge: I really learned the basics of microeconomics from an analytical point of view. The professor made it so that you not understood the concept first and then the math, not the other way around. Furthermore, I learned to study economics using examples, not to just memorize things. That made the class all the more interesting.\r\n\r\nSkills: I learned how to better approach a Yale course. The professor really took the time to show us what we needed to do to succeed in the course. He taught us about balance, about how many hours we needed to study, and even broke it down into a nice diagram. He drew graphs describing the long term result of us studying hard, and that was extremely valuable. I also learned that studying economics is much more than learning it once and forgetting it after a test. The teacher encouraged us to provide examples on the spot in class and to explain difficult concepts to others to strengthen our understanding.\r\n\r\nInsights: I learned a lot about myself and that sometimes, it's not just hard work that is important. You must put in hard work the right way to maximize your learning. I also gained a deeper appreciation for Economics, as we touched on how different concepts relate to us today (the job market, the trade war, etc.)\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I would highly recommend that you take the seminar over the lecture because you learn in a different way and gain a much deeper appreciation for economics. ",
            "\u00a0Tolga was an amazing professor. He always stopped to explain concepts in detail, gave clear examples of confusing material, and made sure to be available to his students for questions and guidance. He was very organized and made his expectations very clear. ",

            "\u00a0I developed an understanding of the nature of analytical thought required to tackle economic problems at any individual consumer-firm level and the tools economists use in their day to day work. I believe I now have a good base knowledge which I can use in future, more rigorous economics classes. Professor Koker also linked the topics to the real world very well, which I think will be particularly useful in retaining the knowledge I gained in the class. ",
            "\u00a0I learned key analytical skills concerning how to understand economic trends on a conceptual and mathematical basis. I also learned how to connect real life events to economic models and use them to make predictions on future trends, as well as came to understand aspects of human behavior in factor and product markets. In this course I expanded key skills in interpreting graphs and other models that are used to evaluate trends. ",

            "\u00a0This is course is terribly designed. The material is cumulative, but even the basic concepts are not explained well enough for students to understand them in different instances. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: wonderful teaching with relevant examples and explanations. problem sets resemble exams. office hours and review sessions are very helpful.\r\nWeaknesses: the curve :-( & sometimes the class can feel kind of rushed. But overall, the strengths definitely outweigh the weaknesses ",
            "\u00a0The economics department curve is a bit ridiculous. Since only 35% can get As, the threshold to get an A- can be as high as 95%. ",
            "\u00a0While it is often regarded as the harder cousin of Econ 115, this course was well worth taking. The course is very strong in that the material is presented in an intuitive way - conceptually and quantitatively. I think the curriculum finds a really great balance in these two aspects of econ. Perhaps the course is a bit weak in that we did not cover general equilibrium, which seems pretty fascinating. I'm sad that I didn't get a chance to learn it in 110, but I'm sure it will be covered in later courses at Yale. (So, this is not really a weakness so much as personal preference.) ",
            "\u00a0Strengths is that it is a seminar and therefore students can ask questions. Weakness is I think that with more math, the course would make more sense. There were so many times when instead of saying just take the derivative, the class would be like \"look at the change in the y divided by the change in the x\". I think the class would work better with a requirement for one semester of calculus of equivalent. ",
            "\u00a0This course is quite straight forward. One goes to lecture; one does the readings (ideally); one completes the problem sets; one completes the course. Having taken calculus and being an avid reader of non-fiction, the material and problem sets were not very hard at all.\r\n\r\nThis straight-forwardness is both one of the courses strengths, and one of its weaknesses.\r\n\r\nThe only real weakness I can identify is that the way TA problem sessions are conducted allows students to simply copy down answer after answer to problems.\r\n\r\nIts effective for getting students problem sets done in a time-efficient manner, but it of course probably isnt all that good for students actually learning to solve microeconomics problems. A better method might be study halls in larger rooms, where the TAs are allowed to suggest the setups for the math (which is easy to carry out once the setup is established). ",
            "\u00a0Hard course, more practice problems for the exams should be made available ",
            "\u00a0I liked the fact that there were two office hours per week, allowing students to check their answers when needed. Professor Koker was funny, enjoyable, and approachable. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Koker was adept at teaching the material, but it might have been more helpful to have someone go over the material more slowly so it could be easily understood. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course was the high level of support provided by Professor Koker and his TAs. Not only was the class small, which helped to ensure it was never boring, but there were four hours of potential support time allocated to us every week split into two sessions, one with Professor Koker himself and the others with a TA. I found these very beneficial as they allowed me to consolidate my understanding of the topics. I also particularly appreciated the way both Professor Koker and his TAs were happy to stay past the allocated time to help. The course's main weakness for me was probably that the class felt excessively long at 75 minutes. It felt like we could've fit the content into 60 without a great deal of trouble and my focus would not have began to drift towards the end. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course laid in its detailed lecture approach that covers key economic concepts in great detail as well as presents clear connections as the course moves from topic to topic, which allows students to make connections between the important lessons. However, I believe that this course could better serve students and hold them more accountable to their work if it assigned homework more frequently. The one assignment that is due each week does work to impose some accountability, but it is not sufficient enough. The presentation of work that went over main ideas and key concepts that the course covers would be extremely beneficial to students. ",
            "\u00a0Strength of the course lies in the instructor (please take it with Tolga if you can). Information can conveyed in a manner that makes it fun to learn at times, and accessible to be returned to if any questions arise. Weakness of the course regards to pacing, which at times can feel like too fast while at other times feel like too slow. ",
            "\u00a0Well-structured and organized. However, more feedback on psets would be appreciated, instead of just ticks. Practice exams would also help students internalize and remember concepts. "

            "\u00a0I guess if they want to study economics. Not if they're not interested in the field ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely not recommend this course to anyone. I deeply regret not taking ECON 115. The lectures are extremely confusing, and the material is taught in a way that makes it extremely hard to follow. ",
            "\u00a0I would, but I'd recommend shopping the lecture too. The curve is always going to be worse in the seminar, but you definitely have better instruction and resources. I would recommend this course if you need a QR credit and don't want to do a lot of math or if you are interested in econ. It's an intro course, so the only way to find out if you like econ at all is to take this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Take it with Tolga if possible. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Tolga is a GREAT instructor, and he makes the material very understandable through relatable examples and clear explanations of the math involved. The course is a good litmus test for whether you may want to pursue further courses in econ. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to someone interested in Econ. It's definitely a lot harder than the lecture which I did not know going into it because I was a freshman and not tuned into word of mouth enough. This can be frustrating because of the way the Econ department curves so this class ends up being full of prospective econ majors who actually care and its a harder class so its harder to get a good grade than in the lecture. ",
            "\u00a0If interested in Economics, I would recommend that a student take this course, though I would only suggest that they take it with Professor Koker.\r\nStudents in other sections have considerably different assessments of the time they spent in lecture (though that is mainly just that other lecturers are much drier). ",
            "\u00a0Possibly, depending on how good at econ they might be ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Take the seminar over the lecture. You will gain a deeper understanding of economics and really appreciate economics much better than if you just take the lecture where you receive less individual attention and opportunity to ask questions. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student if they were planning to be an Economics major. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The skills are very transferrable and often required in other classes and subjects. If you want to get a good grasp on them I believe the seminar - especially with a teacher as engaging as Professor Koker - is far more useful than the lecture. The workload is also manageable. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course, because It is a key course for establishing a strong foundation for understanding economic trends on a introductory level. I also believe that this course works to prepare students for higher levels of economics as well as does much to sharpen analytical skills. ",
            "\u00a0Regardless of having prior experience in taking Economics or not, I would recommend this to all who have an interest in the general principles of the field. The workload is not relatively heavy, as it will mostly lie on the digression of the student to put in the hours to review the material outside of class. The class as a great introduction into the field itself. ",
