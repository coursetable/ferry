            "\u00a0I learned a lot about various experiments that can be done to assess qualities of enzymes. This was in the first part of the course. In the second part of the course, we learned about various methods of visualizing molecular structures. Unfortunately these topics were hard to grasp and weren't taught very well so I did not learn that much. ",

            "\u00a0I learned about topics such as diffusion, multiple/cooperative binding sites, kinetics, chemical relaxations, molecular mechanics, Fourier transforms, X ray crystallography, and microscopy. I learned some new experimental techniques used in structural biology and biophysics. I gained more insight into how physics principles were applied to biology, especially when it came to trying to see a molecule. ",
            "\u00a0First half of the course, we learn about the biophysical properties behind macromolecular and cellular processes. Second half of the course focuses mostly on imaging technologies, including x-ray crystallography, microscopy, and cryoEM. ",
            "\u00a0I found this course's content very interesting and definitely benefited from learning about both molecular motion in the first half and x ray crystallography in the second half. Even though I won't be doing research in these fields, I have already applied my knowledge of diffusive motion in immunobiology lab meetings! ",
            "\u00a0This class morphs a lot from year to year, so take the evaluations with a grain of salt.  The first half of the course was Enrique teaching more traditional physics-y things, like thermodynamics, equilibrium, material strength, diffusion, etc.  Interesting stuff, and Enrique is great.  The second half is structural biology, with Peter Moore.  Make sure you learn what a Fourier transform is before he starts, and youll be mostly fine! ",
            "\u00a0I learned some stuff about kinetic and equilibrium studies of biological molecules, along with a little bit of diffusion and polymer mechanics; I also learned a decent amount about crystallography and EM in the second half, although I would have to take another course to say that I really understood it.

Really great to be able to, as Prof. DLC said, \"fill in the gaps of knowledge\" existing from previous biology classes. I think one concept I found particularly interesting was how constrained diffusion and thermal motion explains chromatin packing in the nucleus. It was being introduced to these concepts in class and being able to read primary literature on those same concepts that was one of my favorite learning experiences in the class.\r\n\r\nA somewhat hand-wavy but deeper understanding of crystallography and microscopy as useful methods in visualizing biological macromolecules. An appreciation for the complicated work structural biologists do. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: the first half of the semester is extremely interesting, mostly due to Prof. De La Cruz' engaging style of teaching. I enjoyed that a lot and the material covered is applicable to my current and future research.\r\nWeaknesses: the second half of the course is taught by Prof. Moore, who speeds through complicated material, leaving the entire class confused. There is barely any explanation of any use in class, leaving a lot of work to be done outside of class to understand the lectures and struggle through the problem sets.\r\nHow to improve: get a better professor to teach about x-ray crystallography/microscopy/cryoEM. Go over background knowledge necessary to understand those topics. ",
            "\u00a0The first half of the class was wonderful. Prof. De La Cruz was an entertaining and knowledgeable lecturer with clear slides and explanations. The problem sets had some unclear directions, but nothing too bad. The second half of the class felt disastrous--one of the least enjoyable classroom experiences of my time at Yale. Prof. Moore seemed very nice and willing to explain things. Still, he had a hard time explaining things clearly and intuitively, and his slides were incomprehensible. The problem sets did not seem to correlate well with the covered material, and did not seem well thought-out. I originally thought the poor reviews for this class came from MB&B majors who were not mathematically prepared, but now I believe that the organizational structure and clarity of the second half of the course are much bigger factors. ",
            "\u00a0Just have Enrique teach the whole thing. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Enrique was an engaging, funny professor who cared a lot about students (I met with him once and he told me all about how much consideration he puts into the class). His material and lecture slides were relatively clear and manageable. Both Enrique and Peter had interesting material. Weaknesses: the TAs were not super helpful. Peter Moore's part of the class was very confusing. I actually though Peter's material was more interesting than Peter's, but because we did not have any background in crystallography/microscopy, the material was too dense to understand. Peter's slides were also not very clear (i.e. no definitions of variables), but Peter himself was really patient with all of us, re-explaining material when we asked, which I appreciate. ",
            "\u00a0One of the biggest strengths was the emphasis on collaboration. In a lot of other STEM and MB&B courses that are strictly based on a curve, there has not been this encouragement of working with one another. I feel like I have not only gotten a better hold on concepts because we were encouraged to work with one another to help each other success, but also that I got to know my classmates.\r\n\r\nA suggestion I have for improvement is changing the way that help for psets is structured. While I do understand that TAs and professors should not give out answers, I hope that TAs are more willing to give clarification on the wording of questions or for questions that the entire class is struggling to understand. ",
            "\u00a0The first half of the class (taught by Enrique De La Cruz) was great. The lectures were understandable and organized. Prof De La Cruz made sure that we could understand the material, even if it meant slowing down the pace of the lectures. The second half of the class, however, was a nightmare. Understandably, the material is inherently difficult (x-ray crystallography, microscopy, cryo-EM). To fully grasp the material, a math background beyond multivariable is necessary because the material includes Fourier transforms and its theorems. Since none of the equations in the lecture slides were explained, this was problematic. The slides did not show the mathematical steps; rather, it assumed we could figure out the missing pieces for ourselves. This, combined with the fact that Prof Moore went through the material quickly, led to a lot of confusion among the students. The problem sets were also problematic in that it required us to google equations that were not found in the lecture slides. I would have not been able to complete these problem sets without working with others for hours. ",
            "\u00a0Peter Moore could do a better job of teaching concepts qualitatively, so that students can use that understanding to get a foothold on the math. ",
            "\u00a0The two halves of this class were very different and had very different expectations. Prof. de la Cruz was a super engaged and passionate teacher who was constantly concerned that we wouldn't understand the material, and often emphasized the importance of using rigorous math without actually doing any rigorous math. The problem sets in this part of the class felt disconnected from the lecture material, and I felt that I had trouble applying the metaphors and activities that we did in class to concrete problems. The second half had the opposite problem; Prof. Moore had too much faith in our ability to understand complex concepts related to crystallography and microscopy, and needed to present his material more slowly and carefully with slides that were informative rather than simply featuring poorly written out equations. I did, however, find the material in the latter half of the class very interesting, and Prof. Moore was an engaging lecturer, I just wish that it had been easier to learn instead being a struggle to figure out what the equations and diagrams were referring to. Understanding what we were expected to know and applying it would have been far easier in both parts of the course if the problem sets were more connected to class and we were given practice materials for the exams. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Enrique is great and really cares about the students,  And I thought the units on diffusion and bipolymer mechanics were well done.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This class was super disorganized and the two halves of the class had vastly different expectations. The first half was generally fine, although I would have preferred to have learned a little more and spent a bit less time rehashing pchem topics. The disorganization here was that the psets didn't really match the material learned in class and were pretty infrequent, and then the midterm had no practice exam which made it really hard to study. The second half of the class had much higher expectations and the slides were horrendous- lecture was relatively engaging, but even taking notes on the slides in class didn't help understand what was on them- equations were put on the slides and not explained, and complex geometrical problems were explained without pictures. Again there was no practice exam for the final and it was not like the problem sets. Overall, this class needs to be significantly more organized and have consistent expectations throughout the semester, as well as better practice materials both in problem sets and exam prep. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting material, well set-up (having discussion sections in place of lecture every few weeks is nice).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not explicit about the kinds of background knowledge that would be necessary to succeed in the course. The second half of the course was extremely difficult to understand without adequate math and physics preparation. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses include no transition whatsoever between semester halves. The second half with Professor Moore was like being thrown in shark infested waters and no matter how much you yelled for help no one came. I really wanted to learn the material but the lack of any introduction our teaching of foundational concepts made my attempts useless. Wish I could have had better for my penultimate MB&B class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: material is naturally interesting, class size is small, professors and TA's are accessible for extra meetings/questions/help, collaborative peer group, paper discussion sections help see class material in practice and make us think more about experimental design, course was not cumulative which made the exams more manageable, lectures are printed out in advance, overall well-organized course\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- section should be part of course registration rather than something added casually - I know some students could not make the scheduled time and section is really important for this course to really understand the material\r\n- section should be better organized - I've found section most helpful in other challenging courses (pchem, biochem 2) when TA's spend some of section reviewing the most recent material taught in lecture. Hearing material a second time a different way with more opportunities to ask questions is HUGE to actually grasp challenging course material. Our sections were question-driven, and we always had plenty, but that wasn't sufficient to help us grasp the material. Near the end, our TA's used their grad slides to do reviews of course material. That was helpful - I hope in future versions of the course there will be some prepared slides for every section and some opportunity to ask questions.\r\n- attitude against assisting on psets - I completely understand that professors do not want students to simply collect pset answers and not try to learn. But for many problem sets, we were all completely stumped and could get little to no help from our TA's or professors. Nearly the entire class would gather multiple nights trying to take a crack at the psets. Because the psets were 25% this year, which is as much weight as each exam, doing well is important. I think the course stands to gain a lot from permitting professors/TA's to give more clues and maybe reconsidering how much psets weigh might help\r\n- psets - I think especially the later psets required material or equations that weren't covered in class. We had to google for random other biophysical resources, bug our physics/math friends. It would be nice if we could be assessed on material we were taught\r\n- practice material for exams - frankly I think it's really lazy when professors don't give at least one practice exam for students to have a sense of how they'll be assessed. I re-did all the psets for each exam, but redoing problems is not the same as tackling new ones. I don't think practice tests warp my perception of what the actual exam will test for (an excuse used by one professor.) We know the content tested on a practice will not be identical to content on the real test, but what's important is getting a fresh chance on applying our skills and knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0Pros: Lectures were printed, professors were available for question\r\nCons:\r\nDe La Cruz - pacing was a bit on the slow side, especially with regards to random walks. I would have preferred more time spent on explaining Adair or other concepts.\r\nMoore - material presented on lecture slides did not have any explanation of variable meanings, expectation of math/physics background that we did not have, mistakes in notes (that were identified and explained by helpful physics majors). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Enrique is an absolute blessing as a lecturer. His lectures are engaging, clear, and paced well. Prof. Moore was clearly also very enthusiastic about his topics and wanted us to learn, and made himself available for questions. The paper discussions were a good way to tie this in to how we are actually going to use it.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The way the section was set up is not actually a section (sections are a couple of times each week, usually in the evening, and scheduled during reading period). Peter Moore's pacing was way too fast, the order the material was presented in was very counterintuitive, and assumed a lot of background that we did not have. ",
            "\u00a01st half:\r\nStrength: Enrique and his passion for teaching and his commitment for making sure we understand. Negative reviews are for the first hald.\r\nWeakness: \r\n-PSETS do not match what is taught in lessons, especially when they involve MatLab without great tutorial.\r\n-Enrique needs to circle back after some analogies and re-remind us what we are talking about.\r\n2nd half:\r\nStrengths:\r\n-Crystallography/Microscopy could be cool and I had little prior knowledge\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-The subject matter does not match first half and feels disjointed\r\n-The prereqs and expected background knowledge literally do not match what we learned\r\n-I was lost approximately >80% of lectures on average because fundamentals were rushed in the beginning\r\n-TA's spend longer on these topics than their undergrads\r\n-MB&B doesn't know what it wants its students to know. Deep understanding of math? Broad conceptual understanding?\r\n-Variables not well defined on slides and hard to follow skipped math steps ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course lies in the first half. The application of physics to biological processes such as cell movement and diffusion/active transport was very interesting and relevant to the work done in MB&B. Prof. De La Cruz was also a very clear effective teacher. I definitely appreciated his willingness to slow the class down and take more time on a concept when needed, rather than adhere rigidly to the syllabus. His in-class demonstrations and props were also very helpful for student learning.\r\n\r\nThe second half of this course was a total disaster. The material was inaccessibly taught, inappropriately difficult for undergraduates, and blatantly disregarded the math prerequisites as they were explained on the syllabus and on the first day of class. I do not think Prof. Moore was in tune with the capabilities of his students, or considered multiple students suggestions that the material was difficult to grasp. The presentation of the material was based on math that students were entirely unfamiliar with (such as Fourier transforms), which made it impossible to follow. Expectations were NEVER clearly established, or even hinted at, and the class had no idea what kind of questions to expect on the final exam. Altogether this class was unnecessarily stressful, and I do not feel as though I walked away from the second half of the semester with any useful knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0I think many, if not all, of my classmates have agreed that this course teaches very interesting and fundamental content that biochemists and biophysicists need to understand before going on to do research in any related field. However, I believe many of us also agree that the way the second half of this course was taught was not conducive to our deep learning and understanding of the material. The speed with which PBM taught the material in the second half of the course was extremely difficult to keep up with, especially considering that many of us come from different levels of math backgrounds and that most of us have never seen/encountered basic concepts like Fourier Transforms. To teach in the way PBM did with a heavy focus on the mathematics behind such concepts was setting many of us up for an inability to truly develop an intuitive understanding of the material. \r\n\r\nI think the department would do well to consider either establishing a math prerequisite for this course (which would most likely deter potential students from majoring in MB&B, given its existing stringent course requirements) or re-instituting a bio version of Physical Chemistry that introduces some of the concepts we cover in the second half of the course. I've heard PChem II discusses Fourier Transforms, so taking some of those concepts and inserting them into PChem I could be a viable option. "

        [
            "\u00a0Not at all, entirely due to the second half of the class--one of the least enjoyable classroom experiences of my time at Yale.

The problem sets did not seem to correlate well with the covered material, and did not seem well thought-out.

            "\u00a0If Prof Moore is involved, never in a million years. ",
            "\u00a0You probably have to take this course. Enrique teaches the first half, which is manageable, and he's really energetic and funny and cares a lot about his students. Someone else teaches the second half (we had Peter Moore, but that will change next year). His part was a lot more confusing because we as students did not have enough background in crystallography, microscopy, Fourier transforms, etc. He was patient when re-explaining concepts, but it was just too much at once. Psets are kind of difficult due to ambiguous wording and, in the second half, total lack of knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0This course is required, of course, so it sorta needs no recommendation.  That said, I think that taking and enjoying this class (as I did) is a good indication that MB&B is the right major for you!! ",
            "\u00a0Biophysics was not an entirely bad class, but it certainly had some problems that would keep me from recommending it to another student. The material of the second half was much more interesting than the first, but it was not presented in a way that made it easy to learn (although I do not believe Professor Moore will be teaching this class again in the future). Prof. de la Cruz's part was better taught, and he is an incredibly nice and approachable person, although it felt a bit scattered and disorganized and the problem sets were very disconnected from what we did in lecture. Take it if you have to (it's not that much work, so it's not going to ruin your life or anything), but for students with a strong interest in biophysics and structural biology, I would recommend taking Pchem II and then Macromolecular Structure instead of this class. ",
            "\u00a0Hopefully the second half of this class will be better in the future- the topics were in theory interesting but poorly taught (crystallography and EM). First half with Enrique was fun but not mind blowing. If you want a deep understanding of biophysics do pchem II and macromolecular structure instead. ",
            "\u00a0This course is mandatory for the MB&B major. That said, it's helpful to know what's coming before the start of the semester. The first half of the semester (taught by Prof De La Cruz) was fairly interesting and covered a range of topics in biophysics, from diffusion to binding equilibrium and kinetics, some of which had come up in previous classes and others of which were new. Prof De La Cruz is funny, easy-going, and likes to explain things in layman's terms. There are weekly psets which don't take too long (2-4 hours) and one midterm, which was fair. The second half of the course (in our case, taught by Prof Moore) was far more difficult, dealing with structure determination by x-ray crystallography, light microscopy, and cryo-EM. It required a pretty substantial math and physics background (do yourself a favor and learn what a Fourier transform is ahead of time) and was not very clearly taught. That said, the material was really fascinating and by the end of the semester, by Googling a lot of things and watching YouTube videos on my own time, I felt like my grasp of those topics was far better than I had anticipated they would be. This was a good class that was painful at times but definitely worth taking for anyone with an interest in biochemistry and biophysics (hopefully this is you if you are an MB&B major). ",
            "\u00a0No, I mean you have to if you're MB&B but you;ll spend the semester running around trying to get help and everyone turns a blind eye to you. This class is an exercise in long suffering all to get jipped of your hard work trying to keep up at the end by impossible homework and an exam. The class had the potential to be rigorous but useful and instead it became a marathon and a sprint of Googling material, watching other college's teach the material, and praying. For the money I pay to go here and for the hope I placed in the department to teach me, I am severely disappointed that I essentially had to outsource my education in this class to even try and stay up to date on the material. ",
            "\u00a0If you're taking this course, you probably have to for the MB&B major. Material is fascinating but challenging so having professors and TA's to support you through is important. The first half was manageable but TA's were not too useful but TA's got somewhat better near the end and the professor taught at too high of a level so it was a mess. ",
            "\u00a0You probably arent taking this class for kicks (although if you are, kudos). First half was relatively familiar material (binding affinities, random walks, etc). Second half went over our heads and kept going. Crystallography was cool, but I dont think I really understood what was going on in that half of the class until the very end - and even that was shaky. The professor probably wont be teaching again, but that class was not well handled. ",
            "\u00a0Don't take it unless you have to, and even then, consider taking P chem II instead. The second half of the course was the most unreasonably paced class I've ever been in and the material was unclear through and through. ",
            "\u00a0No. This is not even the biggest hurdle of MB&B, but it will sneak up on you at the end of your probably senior spring and the second half will crush you.\r\nThe first half is a lovely experience, Enrique actually has passion and patience, and doesn't mind spending longer on less material so we can all understand the material. >90% of the negative reviews are from the second half. Rumor has it the second half is always rough, we had a professor filling in. It was rough because the prereqs don't match what we learn, TA's spend longer learning similar concepts, and fundamentals are breezed through up front so we are lost for most of the lectures. ",
            "\u00a0If the class remains in it's current form, I could not recommend it to any undergraduate student.\r\n\r\nAs a caveat to the above, several members of the class were told that this course will change significantly for the 2018-2019 school year. Your mileage may vary. ",
            "\u00a0First half of this course is awesome. De La Cruz is an absolutely wonderful professor. The second half of the course can be a toss-up. Your experience may very well depend on who's teaching it and how they choose to teach concepts around crystallography and microscopy. "
