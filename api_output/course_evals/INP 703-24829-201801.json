            "\u00a0This course provided a detailed examinations of sensory, motor, and cognitive function in connections to human disorder. I was able to become exposed to various fundamental papers and all the research that is currently being conducted at Yale. I believe this class improved my critical thinking skills. ",

Additionally, some of the lectures felt like the material was being spoon fed as opposed to going over the studies that led to the conclusions. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Lectures from many different faculty members\r\nWeaknesses: Hard to stay engaged with a purely lecture format; lack of feedback on exam ",
            "\u00a0Some lectures were very moleculer while others were more system based. I think they should al be systems based\r\nWe go into sensotry system a lot in fall, so there I feel like it is not a very necessary lecture in spring ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Diverse set of lecturers, supplementary reading material\r\nWeaknesses: Very \"vision-heavy\" in the beginning ",
