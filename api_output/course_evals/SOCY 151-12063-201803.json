It was really fascinating to see the connections and interactions among the different ideas of different philosophers from different eras. It was also incredible to see how ancient theories are still applicable today. ",

            "\u00a0A wide breadth of social/political theory from a surprisingly diverse body of writers. If you're interested in systems of morality, and how abstract questions of free will/human potential are answered by not just white men, this is actually a great class for that. ",

            "\u00a0This course is great for getting a top level view of a very wide range of theorists, all in all I think we covered over TWENTY THEORISTS. \r\nWhile this is sort of a strength, I thought it was a pretty big weakness as well. there was just WAY too many theorists to cover, and we'd usually only spend one day on a given theorist. Occasionally we'd spend two days one someone. I really think this course would benefit from slowing down and focusing on maybe 15, even 12 theorists over the semester. Cutting out the more obscure ones would help give a better understanding of each one, and I think would be more rewarding. Another weakness is that this class had SOOOOO much reading, often it'd be 40-60 pages per class, or about 100 pages in total. I did most of the reading up until about 3/4ths of the way through the semester, and I really didn't feel like I gained very much in comparison to the time it took. Some of the theorist's language were way too obscure to understand, especially without really knowing what to read for. If some theorists were cut, I'd have been able to spend more time with the text. \r\nTLDR: Weakness is wayyyyy too many theorists, and too much reading. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: TA and Professor were great. Liked final paper assignment.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Content, had to take this course for the sociology major and it is not something I would have taken otherwise. I wish I could've linked what we were studying to modern ideas more.It would have been interesting if each week we read a theorist and then an example of how it was relevant to sociology today or something. It just didn't seem tailored to the interests of sociology majors at all, so I'm frustrated that it was a required course for us. Maybe if the class were split into one how it is now (seemed like some people really liked it) and one with a stronger focus on social issues/race/class/gender/sexuality that would be good, because I think a lot of people choose sociology as a major to examine those issues. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: in this class we really got to grips with some of the most prolific thinkers in 19-20th century. Prof Erikson made them accessible while articulating the salience and complexity of the works.\r\nShe also was SO willing to get the students input, from anything to interpretations of concepts, to the timing of circulating assignment prompts. She also made it that those who came to class got so much more out of the course than those who didn't; i.e. what was on the slides were merely a taster / briefs of her main teaching points. ",
            "\u00a0The topics are logically organized into 5 sections that feed into each other, and the reading workload is just right. Professor Erikson is also great at presenting and explaining the texts. That said, perhaps she could've given us some pre-reading tips (i.e. things to look out for) before each reading because sometimes they were so dense that I wasn't sure what to focus on. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Nice professor\r\nWeaknesses: Too many texts, not enough depth. I would've much preferred to do a close reading of 3-4 seminal texts. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n--> Fantastic readings\r\n--> Diverse authors\r\n--> Professor Erikson is really talented at boiling down complex theories into understandable tidbits ",
            "\u00a0I'm not a humanities major, and found that this was course was excellent way to become familiar with a lot of interesting social theory; some might say its too general, but for me the survey nature was what I wanted. ",
            "\u00a0No particular weaknesses -- this is a good 5th credit class that can go toward the PLSC or SOCY major. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Erikson is great in class and at office hours. Her power points were less than helpful at breaking down concepts. It was oftentimes hard to follow along with them and sometimes did not seem like an asset to the class. Also, while it was a survey, I would have liked to spend more time on fewer theorists. I think some of our best discussions in section were aided by having spent a full week on a theorist. ",
            "\u00a0More texts on the slides would be helpful, sometimes I was unable to get the main points down because they were only spoke and not written down anywhere. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were presented in a way which was engaging and easy to follow. Professor Ericson did an incredible job of explaining some very abstract concepts. ",
            "\u00a0More varied perspectives. More female voices; more PoC voices. Has gotten better than past syllabi; 20th century content is really good--would be great to get a more diverse perspective on older material. Prof. Erikson's commentary on context of writings in class is good, just wish we had this in readings as well. This is very difficult for primary sources of course but not impossible; also teaching secondary courses/ more contemporary analyses/ recontextualizations of Hume, Kant, Smith, Hegel would be good--shouldn't be reserved for more advanced courses--donot think these should be introduced in an abstract bubble. Or, shape the class with a more critical lens on the 18th/19th cen canon. Same texts can be taught with greater historical context while keeping a focus on theoretical content and the current course objective questions, by providing greater context/ discussing implications of writers' positions within their society (largely, ones of great privilege up to DuBois) and on the sorts of societies that could produce such theory. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - the readings were very interesting and thoughtfully chosen, however sometimes felt very long. Lectures were usually very good and Professor Erikson always made a sincere effort to try to engage the class in discussion (though many times the class was too tired to respond/didn't do the readings beforehand). Dana's guest lecture was awesome!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - sometimes it was hard to hear what Professor Erikson was saying and if you missed a key point it was hard to follow along because there was basically no text on the slides. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I like that its a survey course and introduces you to myriad opinions. The professor is really nice and I really like the way that she explains and dissects the topics that we talk about. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The texts are difficult to understand so many students don't read them before the lecture, but the professor tries her best to engage students on textual matters (which is hard if we don't understand them). ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Erikson did her best to move beyond the old Western canon but  the course would be better if it was significantly more modern. ",
            "\u00a0Great course overall. Would be helpful to know more about what they were looking for in the final paper. ",
            "\u00a0The professor did very good lectures that summarized the theories of philosophers well and left room for class involvement. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the lectures were very informative, Professor Erikson does a great job in keeping us engaged with the material. The sections were a valuable time to reflect on the readings. The readings themselves were chosen well, although my one big concern is that this course does try to cover a lot of material, giving us less time to break down the more nuanced conclusions from each of the readings. ",
            "\u00a0I think that if there were tests that didn't have questions provided beforehand, students would review all the material. Although it's pretty good the way it is since we really learned a lot about a few. ",
            "\u00a0The course was engaging and had a manageable work load. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in philosophy, politics, or sociology. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent syllabus and wonderful lectures \r\n\r\nSection could be more engaging ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- Midterm/ Final essays were really helpful in gaining a better understanding of the material, the lecture was interesting and provided both historical contexts of the readings as well as helpful explanations for confusing aspects of the text. Prof. Erikson encourages verbal participation in the lecture by posing a lot of interesting questions to the class and having us discuss potential answers among ourselves and then sharing them with the whole class. This seems to be unusual in a lecture class, and I found that it helped keep me engaged in the material.  Also, the texts were relatively diverse (not just limited to the western canon and included critical theorists), which I think is important.\r\nWeaknesses- I didn't like how quickly we moved through each theorist, but I suppose that is more of a personal problem (because I prefer to go more in-depth on a smaller breadth of material). "

        [
            "\u00a0If you don't mind pretty much skimming a lot of theorists, I'd recommend this class. If you'd rather have a more in depth reading (like, more than 2 class sessions on Marx, Smith, Rousseau) take another class. ",
            "\u00a0No, unless you really like theory or have to take it for the sociology major. I enjoyed writing the final paper because it involved linking the theorists to the present day, and my TA was awesome, but i was not passionate about the material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Great for anyone who wants an introduction to the theorists more pertinent in society and in academia. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to someone who has an interest in philosophy or social theory--it's a relatively painless and interesting introduction to those concepts. However, if you're not at all interested in those topics, then this course probably isn't for you. That said, I definitely advocate for this course because you finally get to learn about all those thinkers that you hear about in passing. ",

            "\u00a0This is an excellent class to take as an introduction to theory-type classes in PLSC or SOCY. Professor Erikson is a talented lecturer with useful explanations -- I don't think I would have gotten much from the course had I not gone to lecture. The amount of work is fairly appropriate. I admittedly didn't do all the readings, but for some of the writers it suffices to simply read Sparknotes. The two midterms/final paper are pretty straightforward and fair. ",

            "\u00a0Yes. This course provides an interesting, informative, and accessible introduction to the works of some of our world's most important theorists, including: Kant, Simmel, Smith, Nietzsche, Hobbes, Weber, Marx, Hegel, Foucault, Du Bois, Fanon, Arendt, and many more. Take if you are unfamiliar with their work and want to learn more in a relatively relaxed setting. ",

            "\u00a0Yes! I think it's a great course for someone looking to generally learn from the thinkers on the syllabus. ",
            "\u00a0If you need a political philosophy class, you should definitely take this one. The Professor is an amazing lecturer and the TA's make it easy to understand in section. Some of the readings are pretty dense, but with lecture and section it becomes really easy. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you understand that its focus is on Western social thought, a particular history and one whose legacy shaped Sociology as its studied in Western institutions, but also one that in the contemporary has many many recontextualizations, revisions, and worthy alternatives. ",
            "\u00a0Would recommend if you enjoy learning about theory and philosophical approaches to understanding the social world (many times the class felt like a political philosophy class). The workload isn't too too bad though readings can be kinda long and the midterms are somewhat confusing though mostly test your understanding of the social theories explained in class (which is nice) rather than ability to come up with new connections. Final essay is pretty killer especially since there was no essay style writing before in the class. ",
            "\u00a0If you are thinking about taking an actual philosophy course but aren't sure if you're up to par, I would take this one because it's kinda like an introduction. I've never been exposed to philosophy before so this was a nice transition into that way of thinking. If you know philosophy well you should probably look elsewhere, you'll probably be aware of most of the topics in the class. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend to someone interested in the thinkers and readings covered. It was a good, solid course--but requires extra work on the student's end to make it a great experience. ",
            "\u00a0YES! Take it! Thank ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Good if you are into philosophy or want foundational knowledge in sociological theory. ",
            "\u00a0I think this a great course to take if you don't have a rich background in philosophy or sociology, especially if you want to gain knowledge on the different perspectives that different philosophers take when describing social interactions. This course probably isn't meant for someone who is majoring in philosophy, but if you need a social science credit it's well worth it. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah, its super interesting, you will read stuff from really important people and learn about the world today. ",
