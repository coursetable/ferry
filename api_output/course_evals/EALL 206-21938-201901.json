            "\u00a0I learned valuable information about the history of Japanese art and literature. I also learned how various aspects of Japanese culture altered Japanese artistic practice. ",
            "\u00a0We read many Japanese classics such as the Tale of Genji, Pillow Book, Tales of Ise, Tale of Heike, etc. (too many to name) and looked at a lot of the art associated with these classics. "

            "\u00a0Wonderful integration of art history and literature, enjoyed the gallery visits, particularly passionate TAs, readings are manageable and enjoyable -- all feel worth reading\r\n\r\nLectures were at time vague and didn't offer as much information as I would have liked -- guest lecture from one of the TAs did a really good job of integrating information and identifying themes and connecting to art/literature ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: material is presented in an engaging way\r\nWeaknesses: no outright large weakness I can find ",
            "\u00a0Great course! Absolutely loved the professors, and all of the material was very interesting. I would perhaps like to see more artistic analysis, as it felt as a bit of a literature-heavy course. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures did not continue to be relevant to what I was writing about and so skipping class became more and more common I feel as for class attendance. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed all of the reading material. The lectures were fine. They were split between the two professors, with Professor Kamens focusing more on the text side and Professor Yieungpruksawan focusing more on the image side. The class was definitely more text-heavy and we spent a lot of time talking about common themes and devices throughout the text (I do think that a little too much time is spent on summarizing the plot). I wish there was more emphasis on the image side, though I do appreciate the visits to the Nolen Center, which became more frequent as the course progressed. It was also cool that they had the Tekagamijo installation at the YUAG just in time for us to write our second paper and give our final gallery talks on objects in it. It would be nice if we had more opportunities to engage with the class, such as section or smaller discussion groups. Professor Kamens did try to make the class more engaging by opening lecture up to questions and inviting discussion on Canvas; I just did not personally find the structure of the class to be especially conducive to discussion. ",

            "\u00a0This was a wonderful introduction to East Asian and particularly Japanese literature and art history, highly recommend it to someone like myself -- a complete beginner really hoping to have some level of understanding of history and art when I find myself in Japan! I enjoyed the gallery visits -- really enjoyable to see works up close. At the same time, found it difficult to analyze art that had little written about it, and because I couldn't understand the Japanese calligraphy. Essay grading seemed kind of random but not terribly harsh, but led to a lot of people dropping the class after the first essay grade. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this! professor Kamens was amazing. his voice is so perfect, and it was a pleasure to listen to him talk. very interesting course, and I was never bored of the material. professor Yiengpruksawan was amazing and so knowledgable. she really made the connection between text and image evident and I loved her part of the lectures. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. As long as you're interested in pre-modern Japan (or even if you aren't but enjoy old literature/art) this class will open your eyes to things that you've heard of before. ",
            "\u00a0If you have any interest in the discipline, this is a great course! Amazing professors. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you want to read a lot of Japanese classics. I personally enjoyed everything we read for that class (The Treasury of the Loyal Retainers was my favorite). As an art history class, you learn more about the art that was associated with specific classics rather than Japanese art as a whole. ",
            "\u00a0I would, except Id tell them to actually come to class! Half of the class just doesnt show up to lecture and sometimes I wish attendance had counted more/we had something in the system that tests in-class knowledge gained, like a written exam. "
