            "\u00a0Critical thinking about the middle East \r\nHow to ask the right questions\r\nHow to put myself in the shoes of other leaders areas ",
            "\u00a0A deeper understanding of the Middle East, the history, current problems, and how different states perceive themselves as regional and international players. ",
            "\u00a0I developed an in-depth knowledge of the Middle East through taking this class, as well as a better understanding of the type and nature of questions that are useful to ask when studying the region beyond simply memorising facts and regurgitating knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0At the beginning of the semester, Professor Sky said that her only demand in this class was that we approached the material and discussions with candor, critical thinking, and good humor, or something along those lines. I think this class reminded me of the value of those three qualities taken together and the value in the thought provoking discussions that can come from them. ",
            "\u00a0You learn as much as you can learn about the ME in the amount of time given ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the different countries/issues in the ME region as well as how great powers have clashing interests in most of these countries. ",
            "\u00a0This course encourages students to critically engage with complicated, but vital geopolitical and social issues. The seminar structure allows class participants to both challenge other students, but also to challenge your own understanding of the modern Middle East. Professor Sky is clearly brilliant, and her insights are ultimately the most worthwhile takeaway from this course. ",
            "\u00a0Coming into the course knowing nothing about Middle East politics and the Middle East in general, I learned a massive amount. I now feel I have a basic understanding of the region and a deep interest in learning more. The course was also extremely valuable in that we were able to listen to many different perspectives: there were two veterans in the class, a journalist, students who are actually from MENA, and of course Emma Sky herself. We also had a number of very impressive visitors to share their perspectives. ",
            "\u00a0I came into this class knowing only simple concepts surrounding the Middle East. I believe that this made the class very difficult to learn from. Though I learned a lot through the readings and class discussions, I believe that it was difficult to improve on any specific skills because the discussion felt largely undirected and not structured. Saying this, I learned a significant amount of knowledge by listening thoroughly to other students in the class. I know more about the Middle East now than I believe I could have learned on my own and I owe that to this class. I think that the individual opinions and first-hand knowledge brought the topic to life in the way that Emma wanted it to. From this class, I understand how you must truly be ingrained in the culture then understand it. I got just the first taste of this through the seminar. "

            "\u00a0Strengths \r\n- makes you keep up with the news \r\n- incredible guest speakers \r\n- amazing material \r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n- little to no direction on the final paper ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Emma creates a very relaxed classroom dynamic where everyone''s opinions and thoughts are valued but also open to debate.\r\n- Classwork is very manageable and I felt like it had meaning\r\n- Since there is a mix of undergrads and grads, it's fun engaging discussions with people from very different educational and life backgrounds \r\n- Emma makes herself available to talk about class material and offers feedback on assignments, but most importantly just likes getting to know students \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: As an undergrad, I felt like I didn't know as much as grad students so I didn't talk as much as I wish I could have\r\n- Certain people can tend to dominate discussions ",
            "\u00a0The freedom for discussion in the seminar was both a strength and weakness of the course. The instructor was incredibly insightful in pointing out and challenging issues and weaknesses in each student's opinion. While I appreciated the opportunity for quick-moving discussion that was not rigidly bound, occasionally the seminar discussion could have benefited from more facilitation when discussion topics veered into more unfamiliar territory. Additionally, some more facilitation could have helped discussion become more balanced instead of being dominated by particular students. ",
            "\u00a0The most interesting parts of class for me were the very end when we tried to answer our classmates questions together, but we almost always ran out of time to go through them thoroughly. I would have liked to spend more time on that and less time on the student presentations.\r\nI also absolutely loved the news briefs at the beginning of class, I learned an immense amount from it. ",
            "\u00a0Emma could probably talk more and students present less ",
            "\u00a0I think this is a great class, one thing I would change is to have more discussion and debate. Although we had some wonderful conversations, I feel like most of the time was spent on news updates and presentations--so maybe apportioning our time better would be one suggestion. ",
            "\u00a0The major strength of this course is Professor Sky. She's a delight to listen to and engage with, and is incredibly knowledgeable about the topics covered in the class. In fact, I wish she talked more and offered more of her personal insights, rather than ceding the floor to students for presentations. Sometimes, the student-driven discussion felt cursory and slightly ill-informed and it left me desiring more time to hear from Professor Sky. ",
            "\u00a0The student presentations and class discussions were fruitful. It was also interesting to have each student follow a country in the news for the duration of the semester. I feel Emma did a wonderful job of selecting students for the class who would add an interesting perspective to discussion. My one suggestion for improvement is that I did not like the midterm assignment (write a speech in the voice of the leader of the country to which you've been assigned). I felt I learned very little from this assignment. I think a research paper of some kind would be more productive. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: This course was very good for in-depth discussions on particular topics in the Middle East. The class was filled with experts on the Middle East which proved particularly fascinating to facilitate the group discussions. There was a level of expertise that would be unmatched in many other classes you might take. The mixture of both undergraduate and graduate students also made for particularly fruitful conversation. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Though the class was filled with experts and fascinating conversation, this also meant that the class was largely dominated by these discussions and felt somewhat unstructured. I believe this could have been improved upon by avoiding having the entire conversation being led by 3-4 students each class. Those who did have a breadth of knowledge also seemed to be ignored for much of the conversation. On that note, the conversation was great to be a part of, but it became somewhat one-sided in certain situations. "

            "\u00a0Yes. This is a great overview of the middle East conflicts and exposes you to the kind of questions you should be asking. ",
            "\u00a0WOW. I could not recommend this course more highly to anyone with a remote interest in Middle East politics. Emma is an absolutely incredible professor. She is so passionate about the Middle East and that comes across in every session. You will learn a lot--and have a lot of fun in the meantime. Plus, Emma is incredibly well connected and brings in the most fascinating guests. Do yourself a favor and take this class--if you are lucky enough to get in! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think it's better if you come in already having a base knowledge of the Middle East though. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely would recommend this class. It is an incredible environment and group to be a part of, to learn from Professor Sky and all the others in the class. Take it! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, if you can get in, take it. Emma is one of the best professors at Yale, you'll learn enough to change your perspective on the region whether you know nothing or have a Ph.D in ME politics ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend that you take it if you get in. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would certainly recommend this course to other students-- if for no other reason than to experience class with Professor Sky. But beyond that, the topics covered are quite timely and important, the guest speakers brought in are fascinating, and class discussion often proved to be interesting (though more often than not dominated by only a few). Take the class for the course material and the professor-- and encourage your classmates to keep the presentations brief! ",
            "\u00a0I think everyone should take this course. It is incredibly informative and interesting. The Middle East is such an important region to understand, and this class, as well as Emma Sky, is an extremely valuable resource. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student only if they already have an in-depth understanding of the Middle East and want to have very specific conversations about certain issues. It should be a requirement to take a lower level course before entering this class. It is largely a class that requires an opinion before entering, otherwise, you may get lost in discussions. "
