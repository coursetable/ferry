            "\u00a0Specifically, I learned about the theories and concepts behind modern and contemporary art. I also learned how to discuss these more abstract concepts as well as apply them. We were also exposed to different kinds of works, which I feel supplemented and widened my knowledge of art history. ",
            "\u00a0I'm an art history major, and this course gave a really interesting overview of modern art via an exploration of surface. We read many texts by important art historians and influencers, so my knowledge of the field was greatly deepened. "

        [
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the way the course was organized around a common theme, and looked at many different artists. Would have liked if the class had incorporated historical and societal influences in a more direct way--was often quite formalist in approach. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: great readings, amazing artworks, very reasonable workload, lots of independence. Weaknesses: plays into the traditional art historical canon and linear narrative. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This class is a great way to get exposed to modern and contemporary art through art history. The theory and conceptual readings help you understand the works in a more nuanced way. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend this course to a student who is already knowledgeable about art but wants to depend said knowledge.  The set of readings was wonderful, though challenging at times (particularly with the psychoanalysts), and discussion was centered around them.  Lots of freedom with the final paper to really explore a topic that interests you.  Dr. Rosenberg was kind and helpful, though sometimes fished for answers in seminar discussion.  Overall was a great course. "
