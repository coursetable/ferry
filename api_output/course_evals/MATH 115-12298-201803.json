            "\u00a0I learned how to teach myself material and work through a large amount of problems. ",

            "\u00a0This course helped me gain a much better grasp on the difficult concepts in calculus 2/ AP calculus BC that I didn't quite understand in high school. ",
            "\u00a0My knowledge in calculus expanded beyond the information I had learned in high school (and it even cleared up some concepts I was confused with in AP Calc) ",
            "\u00a0I gained a broader set of tools in the field of calculus. In high school I took Ap Calculus AB, the equivalent of MATH 112 at Yale. Mayh 115 built on that and gave me more knowledge and techniques related to integral calculus ",
            "\u00a0I learned an incredible amount about specific math topics but also changed the way I thought about math in general. ",
            "\u00a0Learned principles and theories behind taking approximations of areas to find integrals. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt the basic concepts of integration, parametric and polar functions. It helped me develop the skill of understanding mathematical functions visually and spatially. ",
            "\u00a0I was able to gain a deeper understanding of the calculus I learned in high school. I also learned about real world applications of many of the concepts. "

        [
            "\u00a0Math 115 is an interesting course - you are exposed to a variety of topics in a short amount of time. A weakness of the course is that you aren't really taught the material in a traditional sense. You definitely are expected to have a general knowledge of the material and should be able to apply that knowledge to new concepts. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course was taught well and the material was thoroughly explained by my TF. I don't see particular areas where it needs improvement. ",
            "\u00a0This is a flipped classroom style course, which I didn't like. We were expected to know material presented in videos posted on Canvas before we came into class. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: taught by unqualified Yale graduate students who are not PHDs (tuition is too high to not have real professors teaching calculus classes), not representative of normal calculus 2 material (other universities like Georgia Tech and MIT will not take because the topics covered are cherry picked and not a cohesive cal 2 course), representative of the poor teaching and terrible Yale math department reputation that Yale College STEM classes have (specifically the math department) ",
            "\u00a0I'm not a huge fan of the flip-the-classroom aspect, and I know of many other students who didn't watch the videos/modules presented in the class (I didn't even know they had these videos until someone told me...AFTER the midterm). I think the last few classes before the final went through the material through quickly, while I thought the section on series was presented too slowly. The explorations were also, in my opinion, not useful, as it felt like I didn't learn anything after I took them. It would be great if the class was more balanced time-wise and structure-wise. Offering more practice problems would also be great. ",
            "\u00a0This course is great at covering all the calculus II material we ought to know but it does go over a lot of material in a relatively short time which can make things extremely difficult at times ",
            "\u00a0I thought it was well structured and engaging. I liked the explorations and video modules. ",
            "\u00a0This course could be improved by including more quizzes/tests throughout the semester rather than just 2 midterms and a final. ",
            "\u00a0I felt like the math was very theoretical, and a lot of problems were quite tricky. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths for me was the breadth of content covered and the strong basis it establishes for other classes. However, I think the content wasn't handled well. The class seemed catered for people who had covered most, if not all concepts before. For someone new to almost everything taught, the pace was too fast, barely allowed for a deep understanding of concepts and the practice of sums in class. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the flip classroom idea is very unproductive. I also feel that had the instructors been professors rather than teaching fellows that my understanding of the material would have been much greater. Many times I would go to office hours and the answers to the questions asked in office hours would be incorrect. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the class organization and the homework assignments were very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I would get rid of the explorations because I never did them thoughtfully and I didn't think they were necessary or helpful to understand the material. ",
            "\u00a0Material was covered incredibly quickly. While of course as students it is our job to keep up and actively learn out of class, the class was difficult simply because so many different topics were covered. ",
            "\u00a0The professor explained very well and made sure that the class understood the material before moving on. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any students wishing to pursue mathematics and challenge themselves. I enjoyed the process of pushing myself and learning new concepts. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This was a good math course for those inclined to study calculus. It was face paced but still possible to follow. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student only if they've taken AP calculus BC in high school or if it's prerequisite for their major. I enjoyed the course solely because Ethan Addicot was my instructor, and he made the class engaging and interesting. However, I would not have taken it otherwise. The psets are doable, but the tests are pretty difficult. ",
            "\u00a0No! Poorly taught and actually destroyed my fondness for math in 1 semester. And* I took the math 110/111 sequence last year and loved it. This was just a terrible experience! ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend this class to those who need to take it. It's not that fun of a class, the problem sets can be quite time-consuming, and the class can feel like it's moving too fast to students who have only taken AP Calc AB. In reality, this class made me hate math again. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who loves calculus and wants to learn more about the subject. I would also recommend this course to someone who wants to take higher levels of math after this course ",

            "\u00a0Yes. Math 115 is useful regardless of major. ",
            "\u00a0It helps in the understanding of the basic techniques of integration and as a foundation for other classes. However, the content is covered fast and not in sufficient depth. While I loved math in high school, this class didn't allow an exploration of concepts and/ or understanding math in terms of its broader significance. Take it only as a required class. ",
            "\u00a0No, I think it was terribly organized and I honestly did not learn much. It made me more confused on the topics already mastered by me in high school. I think the presentation of ideas was not done in the best way for learning. ",
            "\u00a0I think the quality of this class is very dependent on the teacher. I would recommend this course to another student, as I found it was a good calculus II class. Most of the students are coming from a Calculus BC background in high school, so I think that's something to keep in mind when selecting a math course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would. I learned a lot and was challenged but did not feel overwhelmed or lost. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It wasn't the most amazing class, but it's hard for a BC math class to be life-changing. Having said that, it was well-taught, doable, and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Rigorous environment, engaged students will learn quite a bit! ",
