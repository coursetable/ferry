            "\u00a0A very useful working knowledge of a few variable topics, such as conformations of molecules, host-guest chemistry, solvent effects, pericyclic reactions, etc. (30% of course)\r\n\r\nA very useless knowledge of interesting tangents pertaining to chemistry and famous professors. (70% of course) "

            "\u00a0There was no real structure to the material we learned in this course. It just seemed like a collection of scattered stories. A more cohesive and logical flow to the course would be helpful in facilitating learning. ",
            "\u00a0It is very difficult to hear Prof. Jorgenson and the topics are not explained thoroughly enough. I think there should be more example problems because the exams did not have problems similar to the ones practiced. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest weakness of the class was that Professor Jorgensen was not the best lecturer, often speaking very softly to the point where it was impossible to hear him past the first row. In addition, the pacing of the class was a little off, with the first few weeks of the class covering very little new ground while the last week basically had a ton of new principles thrown at students. However, the workload is not that hard, and the principles themselves were not impossible to understand. There was a lack of organization but the core stuff was taught well enough. "

        [
            "\u00a0I do not recommend this course to students. It is pretty boring and not engaging at all. Prof Jorgensen speaks really quietly, making it barely possible to hear even from the front row. It is really hard to get the main point of what he is saying because he goes off on so many tangents and stories. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this if you were very interested in organic chemistry ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend this class to another student if they know what they are getting into. The class itself is poorly structured, but it is not a worthless class overall. There are some interesting concepts that are learned toward the end of the class that some students may be interested in learning about, and the class is a good chemistry elective for a student looking for a lower workload. Professor Jorgensen is very traditional and this shows in his lectures and teaching style, which can make studying for the exams a little challenging. Overall, a student with the right expectations may even enjoy the class a little. "
