            "\u00a0Again the strengths were the class size and class time. There was plenty of individual attention and we had the luxury of time to go over grammar and vocab more thoroughly than we would have during the year. I think that a stricter syllabus would have helped us more evenly allocate time for the last few chapters. ",
            "\u00a0The course enabled me to immerse myself in Moroccan and Arab culture and in the Arabic language. I was compelled to communicate in Arabic and became more confident speaking. The class size was small which allowed us to receive one-on-one attention from our professor. The trips and excursions were wonderful. I loved my host family. \r\n\r\nThe chapters could have been paced better so that we could have finished chapter 10. The language tables could be improved and the lectures could be made simpler. Tuesdays and Thursdays should have been made less busy. I also feel that students should be provided with an outline of the course before they apply for it so that they can get a better idea of its pace and demands. "

            "\u00a0Yes. The L3 and L4 summer sequence is great if you want to jump ahead in your Arabic education and get a lot more speaking practice than you would during the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course but would warn that it is fast-paced. The teachers and institute are excellent. "
