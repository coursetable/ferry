            "\u00a0Dissipation in physical process. \r\nMathematical description of noise and stochastic process.\r\nBasic ideas on information theory. \r\nThe interlink between information and physics. ",
            "\u00a0The primary insights I developed during this course were in how to think about noise in physical systems and what it can tell us about the physics of the systems and how statistical arguments can be used to connect equilibrium physics to external response dynamics in both quantum and classical systems. The course was fast-paced so I feel as though I got mostly introductions to the topics, but that exposure was great to have nevertheless as I have now an idea of what interesting stat. mech. research is going on now and how to seek out new sources to read about it. More practically, I believe I have useful knowledge in linear response theory and how it is applied to the various forms of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem as well as a better foundational understanding of information theory and how it is useful in physics. ",
            "\u00a0Understanding of noise fluctuation and dissipation, mainly in the context of quantum circuits. ",
            "\u00a0Every lecture of this course was composed of mostly new material to me. The course as a whole was a fascinating intersection of quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, and signals & systems. ",
            "\u00a0Physics about fluctuation-dissipation theory and noise theory. ",
            "\u00a0Taking this course, I learned a variety of topics that are essential to understanding what information we can gain extracting data from a system, both classically and in the context of quantum mechanics. I have also acquired useful physical models to help think of probabilistic events and data transmission, which helps to gain more intuition for physical processes. ",
            "\u00a0I learned physics I had never seen before in any class. Provided insight into different problems and methods of analysis. ",
            "\u00a0Learnt how to deal with systems out of equilibrium, and how Noise can be characterized and quantified in both quantum and classical systems. ",
            "\u00a0This course allowed me to learn a lot about the theory of Brownian motion (e.g., I learned what are the Langevin and Fokker-Plank equations), the quantum information theory, the quantum theory of signal processing, and study many other fascinating topics. I learned about the important role of fluctuation-dissipation theorem in modern quantum mechanics. ",

            "\u00a0The lecturer is super familiar with the relevent contents, and shows a clear picture in the course. \r\nWhile a problem is that I feel the pace is much faster in the second half of the course. ",
            "\u00a0The lecture notes are great; it would be helpful if they posted solutions for the lecture exercises. ",
            "\u00a0Lecture notes are great. Mini project over a final is a great idea. Great lectures. Occasionally problem set questions could be a bit unclear. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were highly pertinent to my research interests and they were constructed in a logical order. I think the lectures provided the majority of the value of the course. \r\n\r\nI found the homework problems to be excessively difficult. It seems that most of the homework problems are designed with the intent of applying concepts taught in lecture, or requiring me to conduct my own additional research, in order to infer new concepts beyond those taught in the classroom. While this makes the homework very interesting, I think I would have benefited from more homework problems which were designed to simply verify that I understood the concepts discussed in class, reinforcing my baseline knowledge, before attempting to build upon those concepts.\r\n\r\nI think the homework was made more difficult by not having homework graded and returned to me throughout the course, and not having answer keys provided for the homework. When starting a new course, I usually find the first couple homework assignments perform the auxiliary function of informing me of what is expected of me when answering homework problems. Receiving this type of feedback may have helped counter the occasinal feeling of some homework problems seeming vaguely posed, or disconnected from the lecture material. ",
            "\u00a0More time spent on examples, outside of trivial ones. More readings that could be easily accessible. ",
            "\u00a0The course covered a wide array of very interesting and useful topics that broadened the students' understanding of data and information.  Challenging questions on the problem sets have also been very helpful for the students to internalize the material.  There were times when it was a bit ambiguous what a problem asked for, the course could be improved by revising such problems. ",
            "\u00a0I found the class to be very challenging, by far the hardest class I have ever taken (material wise), due to lack of prerequisite knowledge. Maybe went too fast? ",
            "\u00a0Overall this course was great, it might have been better if the assignments ran at the same pace as the class (towards the end this did not seem to happen). ",
            "\u00a0The main strengths for me were that the course covers a very broad range of topics and has a comprehensive set of (digital) lecture notes. Additionally, it was very interesting to work on the final project.\r\nFrom my point of view, the course could be improved by providing more information about other approaches to quantum computing and quantum information processing apart from superconducting circuit-based.\r\nAnother thing is that in the problem set 4 I felt that the lecture materials by themselves are not enough to solve the second problem. Perhaps a list of external references would help. ",
            "\u00a0Broad coverage of topics is a strength. Though, lectures were a bit slow sometimes (in my opinion). "

            "\u00a0This course introduces you to the study of noise in equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium systems in physics, both in the classical case and in the quantum case. The course also introduces information theory and its applications in physics which is a good topic to be familiar with, especially if you are interested in quantum information and quantum computing or in response theory and noise in stat. mech. The course can be challenging with problem sets, but the problems are interesting and engaging. Professor Devoret has prepared typed lecture notes which he follows in lecture and makes available to the students. These notes are nice as a way to review the lectures and they contain most of the questions which are assigned for problem sets. I would recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Provides many valuable insights, particularly in the context of quantum circuits. ",

The course draws from a wide array of fields such as statistical physics, circuit theory and quantum information.  I would advise students to work on the problems early to ask questions to the TA, where they need to. ",
