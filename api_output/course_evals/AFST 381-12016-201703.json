            "\u00a0I learned a lot in this class about building legitimate democracies, the impact of elections on democracy and many other interesting topics. This is one of the most engaging and interesting classes I have taken here at Yale, as both the passion of our instructors contributed to our engagement with the materials. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt a lot about the politics of africa and different issues like conflict and aid ",
            "\u00a0This class effectively taught me to understand the basic causal mechanisms behind the problems and tried-solutions within African politics. I left with a better understanding of how complicated a political situation many African nations are in, and with that perspective, was able to critically analyze proposed solutions and moves forward. ",
            "\u00a0I develop a lot of interest in the African region. As wells as skills of negotiation and breaking stereotypes of previous knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a broad overview of issues in African Politics including issues such as neo-colonialism, international Chinese investment, corruption, civil war, and election monitoring. Most case studies were done in sub-Saharan Africa, including countries such as Benin, Botswana, Mali, Zimbabwe, and Cameroon. In terms of practical skills, I learned how to locate all of the African countries and capitals on the continent, and conducted research about democratization through Freedom House and past election documents. Lastly, I gained an understanding of Africas perception in the world, and the capacity to be weary of stereotypes and misrepresentation. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about international aid, democratization, and learned about how political science research is done. ",

            "\u00a0I guess a weakness is that we didn't really get time to dive into the readings outside class but Baldwin tries to go through them while teaching in class so its not that bad. She is a very good professor ",
            "\u00a0I think that the very basic approach this class takes to African politics is a huge strength. I entered the class knowing nothing about the topic, and wouldn't have been able to keep up had the class skipped the foundational issues and processes. At times, I found that we were ill-prepared for the in class debates, but do not necessarily think the professor/class could have prepared us more. The preparation fell more on the students and felt optional or supplementary vs. integral days within the course. ",
            "\u00a0More african scholars should be added to the readings list ",
            "\u00a0Great teacher, terrible grader/TA ",
            "\u00a0The way the course is carried out by Professor Baldwin is very good, definitely a strength. The readings and their engagement is super interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Having no knowledge about the African continent, Government and Politics in Africa course was a pretty decent overview. Professor Baldwin does a pretty decent job of covering contemporary issues of neo-colonialism, international Chinese investment, corruption, civil war, and election monitoring. The workload is not easy per say, but is definitely really reasonable (two papers, two midterms, and a map quiz), and the grading is fair. \r\n\r\nHer lecture style is engaging, and she tries a lot to engage the rest of the class through conversation (which is usually fun, but can be painful when no one has done the readings). A huge bonus of her course is the organization of her lectures. Because they are centered around questions (i.e., What cause the third wave of democratization in Africa? or Why are SAPs so prevalent throughout Africa?) it felt as if we were gaining useful information, as opposed to random facts. \r\n\r\nMy favorite parts of the class were when we spent time engaging in organized simulations, either pretending to be stakeholders of different governments, or taking pro/con sides of an issuethese made class more fun to attend than the standard lecture and also made us get to know our peers. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the class would have been a lot better without the interactive activities - I didn't learn much on those days and felt they were taking away from valuable lecture time. ",
            "\u00a0I thought overall it was a great class, though I wish it included more readings or point of view that didn't represent the Western capitalist mainstream ideology, to show that it is not fact, and there are other ways of analyzing governments and economies. ",
            "\u00a0This class needed to be narrowed down. Africa is not homogenous so one class to explain all the governments and politics just isn't sufficient. It needs to focus on a particular region or country. ",
            "\u00a0I did not think that the course was incredibly engaging. We read interesting articles and Professor Baldwin did a good job summarizing them, but in general it lacked creativity and excitement. "

            "\u00a0Government and Politics in Africa is a great introductory course to the topic. The course surveys contemporary issues which is great because most discussions are relevant to what's happening today in the news. I'm sure Prof. Baldwin is incredibly knowledgable, but she is not a strong lecturer by any means. However, she is approachable and willing to help. The class activities are irritating and redundant, but that's my personal opinion. Assignments and exams are painless.\r\n\r\nTLDR: Take the course, it's chill, don't expect much. ",

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend it. I learned a lot about a subject matter I was ignorant, and the material both provided wide ranging information about African nations and ideas that are applicable to development generally. The debates were helpful ways to actively engage, and Professor Baldwin was great. The subject matter and assignments were broad and varied, which made the class interesting. ",
            "\u00a0If you like political science, go for it. If not this class is too theory based to be interesting to someone who is just interested in generally what is going on in Africa. ",
