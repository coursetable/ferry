            "\u00a0Coming into this course, I had heard exclusively negative things from at least five different students who had taken Math 120 and one student who dropped it because it was difficult and did not facilitate learning.  I was encouraged by almost all of these people to take the equivalent ENAS 151 to meet my prerequisite requirement instead.  What I found, however, was one of the most enjoyable courses I've taken yet at Yale.  It is difficult conceptually, for it requires one to think about things in three dimensions, which can be hard to visualize and harder to make concrete by sketching.  It is also fast-paced, and it covers lots of material.  But there are ample resources available, almost too many to have time to use, as tools for either comprehension of topics or exam preparation.  This course enhanced my fascination at the world of applications of these concepts in a variety of fields, including physics, which I took concurrently in an extremely rewarding and enjoyable experience.  For the first time in a long time, I was excited and inspired by math.  This course is the reason ",

Students who are not passionate about math/science or who will not appreciate how multivariable calculus impacts the world around us will likely not appreciate this course. ",
            "\u00a0I wouldn't recommend the course until it is taught by a professor instead of a grad student.  But this will fall on deaf ears.  Oh well ",
