            "\u00a0I learned how to read again. It was wonderful to discuss those works with an amazing group and professor ",
            "\u00a0Critical reading and thinking; interpreting texts of American literature; writing critical analysis of literature. ",
            "\u00a0I was able to foster an intermediate understanding of several imperative works in modern American literature, as well as become exposed to a variety of styles and themes that many works explored during this period. I developed skills in analytical reading, strengthened my abilities to participate in group discussion, and became more disciplined in adjusting to a rigorous demand for reading. ",
            "\u00a0I think I strengthened my literary analysis skills for sure! "

            "\u00a0This is a very lively seminar where every one is highly engaged. I learned a lot from both my fellow students and the instructor. The texts selected offer a very unique insight into American literature. Hopefully some essays like those by Emerson and Thoreau  could also be added to the readings. ",
            "\u00a0Reading Moby Dick over the summer was tiring and took away from other works in the course. I would also include works from other time periods since we seemed to focus on 19th century literature. I was hoping to see more form the 20th century. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was a bit too open in terms of direction, which has its advantages and disadvantages. I am personally a fan of highly structured class time, so the employment of a class schedule, in which students can know what to expect before attending class each day, might be a positive addition. The course was very strong in terms of the diversity of works explored, and the different styles of essays we were required to write were both engaging and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I think this class introduced me to some great literature and had me think in about it in cool and unique ways that I haven't been exposed to before in English classes. Honestly the first weakness that comes to mind is having Moby Dick on the syllabus. It's simply too long and dense for a short and compressed summer class. "

            "\u00a0Yes, I will recommend this course to students interested in literature. The class has very lively discussions, from which I learned a lot. And the teacher is also very good at developing students ability to interpret texts on their own. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who is comfortable with having a degree of freedom in terms of exploration in modern literature. By this, I mean that the course allowed for the class to \"guide\" the direction of themes and topics explored as they related to each work. If a student is looking for a more focused and traditional approach to an English class, I might say that this is not the course for them. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to students interested in literature and/or American studies. "
