            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the history of Israel and Palestine, Iran, and Syria. I learned how to write a good response paper, primary source analysis, and historiography paper. ",
            "\u00a0Very interesting course about the Middle East- learned a lot of history, about construction of middle eastern nationalism. ",
            "\u00a0This course was really interesting in that it further developed my knowledge of the Middle East, however, the class was very detail oriented so if you don't know much about the Middle East to begin with, this is not the best introductory course. ",
            "\u00a0Coming into this course, I had a vague understanding of Middle Eastern politics and culture. However, I didn't understand the roots of political strife and history that underlay many of the conflicts we see materialize today. Through this course, I gained depth in my understandings of Middle Eastern culture and politics through analyzing both primary and secondary texts in an attentive, discussion-based class. I also gained a solid understanding of the main arguments in nationalist discourse in all capacities, even outside of the Middle East. I feel after taking this class that I can look at nationalist issues in our modern discourse more critically and through the lens of past circumstances I've studied. ",
            "\u00a0This course goes through the history of the formation of each major country in the middle east. You get a clear survey of the process of national birth and state formation that came out of colonialism. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a considerable amount about the diversity within nationalist development in the Middle East and, in general, a good amount about the underlying tropes that go into nationalist building. The course did a good job at covering the nationalist movements in the various Middle Eastern States and in pushing us to write various types of history papers. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a bit about Middle Eastern history, though frankly, this is only because I didn't know much about it to begin with. I couldn't give you specific dates or paint you a picture of the Arab world in a given time period. ",
            "\u00a0What college history looks like; how to actually write. ",
            "\u00a0Good writing credit, learned how to write a diversity of papers ",
            "\u00a0I think I definitely became better with analysis after taking this course. Analyzing documents and writing has always been something I struggled with, but I do believe that taking this course helped. "

            "\u00a0Dr. Banko is a really great lecturer. I learned the most when she was teaching. The reading were often super dry and hard to get through. I felt like there was not much direction on how to do the papers. Or rather the directions were rather ambiguous. However, if you planned ahead, you could go talk to Dr. Banko about the expectations for the paper and run an outline or a draft by her. She was really helpful in giving feedback in that sense, however, straight up directions when the assignment was presented was lacking. ",
            "\u00a0The class is really interesting in terms of the material, however, Professor Banko's lecturing style can be a bit dry and it can sometimes be hard to follow along with the material because there is just so much of it. ",
            "\u00a0This course was strong in the readings that were provided to help us inform our understandings of certain countries and case studies. It might be difficult to help a student gain knowledge in a topic over nationalist theory when they barely have a picture of what the country looked like on its own. However, the readings clearly and succinctly helped me underscore my knowledge with enough theory and history to have a picture on my own. I never felt as though the large amount of content we were covering greatly hindered me from speaking up in class. A weakness of this course might be the discursive elements of the seminar. Although we as students were always welcomed to speak, it seemed as though the course was overall less discussion based than what first-year seminars seem to be shown as. However, I felt the times we were focusing on more lecture-based content was also valuable, although it did certainly take away from certain elements of the discussion. ",
            "\u00a0This course was structured poorly. The Monday class was purely a lecture and the Wednesday class was supposed the be a discussion (but usually was only a discussion for half of the class).  Lectures were terribly boring and and readings were quite long. Actually paying attention or doing the readings was completely unnecessary because the essay topics were of your choosing. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Well-structured to cover the various regions in the Middle East, informative lectures, very helpful and kind professor\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The weekly discussion sections occasionally felt repetitive, as certain students seemed more interested in sharing what they knew about the topic from past experience than the actual readings; I would say the open-endedness of the discussion class days created this. ",
            "\u00a0I don't know if I can pinpoint exactly what needs improvement on this course, just that it needs improvement. It was organized by country/time period week-by-week, which seems reasonable. Maybe it was the readings? They were long and winding, and I was always under the impression that the primary source readings were optional (the professor said so in class), but sometimes we spent a fair bit of time discussing them and not other readings. It was difficult to see what the purpose of some of the readings and discussions were. Also, the class was set up so that Mondays, the professor lectured, and Wednesdays, we discussed. This wasn't the best format, because for a 3-hour class (weekly) we ended up discussing for maybe 1 hour because on Wednesdays the professor usually finished up lectures from Monday. Perhaps in the future, this class shouldn't be offered as a first-year seminar, simply because it requires too much background knowledge. Because we weren't equipped with that background knowledge, too much of the class was lecturing and not discussion, and I didn't gain as much from it as I would have had I taken a more straightforward course first. ",
            "\u00a0More clear guidelines on papers ",
            "\u00a0I think the strength of this course was that we were able to go over and learn about many different countries. I think a weakness would be regarding the historiography paper. We did not receive a lot of information regarding the set up. I think in the future there should be more guidance for the paper. ",
            "\u00a0A bit disorganized. There is also very little guidance in the assignments, especially the historiography. ",
            "\u00a0The content of this course was very interesting, and Professor Banko did a great job in choosing the readings for each week's topic. I do think the primary weakness of the course was the way it was organized. Because all four papers a student would write during the semester could be on basically the same 2 topics, there was little incentive to complete all of the readings. This made for discussions that were one-sided and most frequently not even about the readings. This was difficult because everyone entered the class with different backgrounds in Middle Eastern history, and the discussions could be somewhat inaccessible because they did not focus on the material we were learning in class.

            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. I would warn them that the workload is intense, but if they planned it out better than I did then it was manageable. I think I learned so much about the Middle East. I came in with a lot of misconceptions about the Middle East as most Americans do, and this class really shattered them. Now I feel like I can read news articles about the Middle East and know why certain countries are the way that they are. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student if they were interested in Middle Eastern conflict, history, and politics. As someone who shared these interests, I felt this class served as a good starting point to help jumpstart my understanding of the current politics and underlying histories in the region, while also providing me enough outlets to research by myself on the topic. Moreover, if students have never written primary source analyses or historiography papers before or in these historical topics, I felt this class provided a good opportunity to write these papers over interesting, applicable topics. I was able to gain knowledge of a wide swath of nationalist case studies in a wide swath of countries and use the papers to analyze in more detail ones of particular interest to me. Overall, I really enjoyed the freedom this course gave me and the interesting topics I was able to learn about. ",
            "\u00a0No, this is a poor history seminar. There was hardly any interesting discussion, except for on the topic of Palestine, and the big questions of the course were not answered. First year seminars are limited by the fact that freshman don't know that much but act like they do. However, the topic is quite interesting and the teacher is a fair grader, so it may still be worth taking. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if they are very interested in the topic and in need of a writing credit. The class was very informative, but, I feel as if I may have been able to learn just as much in a lecture course on the same topic. ",
            "\u00a0Take another course in Middle Eastern history first. Then consider taking a class about Middle Eastern nationalisms. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, taught a lot about a unique subject ",
            "\u00a0I do think that I would recommend this course to another student because it helped me learn about the Middle East and helped me in improving my writing. "
