            "\u00a0In this course I developed the ability to analyze film and literature with a great Spanish vocabulary and fluidity. By being able to analyze films and talk to their creators I also gained insight into the creative process and all the effort that is put into creating films. ",
            "\u00a0I gained much greater Spanish skills, for starters. Additionally, I gained a deep appreciation for Kichwa film, and for the indigenous communities we visited. Above all else, I gained a deep appreciation for the country of Ecuador and learned about a diverse and beautiful country. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my ability to speak and understand Spanish a lot through this program, mainly through speaking spanish constantly with the other people in the group, the grammar review, and my host family. ",
            "\u00a0First and foremost, my Spanish speaking abilities approved dramatically over the 5 weeks I was in Ecuador, both through what I learned in class and spending time speaking with my classmates and host family. I also learned a lot about Ecuadorian history, Kichwa culture, and the way of life in Ecuador. ",
            "\u00a0I'm not doing this again. I just did this on the other form. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me gain more confidence in my Spanish speaking abilities! ",
            "\u00a0A much better understanding and command of the Spanish language as well as exposure to Andean culture in terms of their philosophy, traditions, and general lifestyle. "

        [
            "\u00a0A weakness of this course was presentation structure which became hard to follow and tedious at times.\r\n\r\nA strength of this course was the actual film and literature aspects which we delved into and analyzed very effectively. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very spanish intensive, as you live with a spanish speaking family while completing the program, but that being said, being its first year there were some logistical problems with the course that could be improved. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that the program provides such a great way to see so much of Ecuador in such a quick way. Also, the work is mostly useful, in that it helped me improve my knowledge of the language. I think a plce where the course could improve is having a better structure in which it is made clear why exactly we are doing what we are doing, because at times it seemed liked we were just doing things to do it. Also, I think it would be good to discuss the two books we read a little more in class, as it felt that we were reading them without purpose until we got to the end of the course. ",
            "\u00a0The main issue I had with the course is we sometimes had a little bit too much planned during our weekend trips. For the most part we had the perfect amount of stuff planned, but when we went to the Amazon, we were pretty exhausted by the last day, and when we went to Cotopaxi we weren't really able to do anything but drive from place to place on the bus because we didn't have time to stop for long before we had to leave to the next place. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course involve the level of cultural involvement and the way in which Cine Kichwa was taught. I really enjoyed learning more about Cine Kichwa and having the chance to listen directly to the directors and producers of the different films after we watched them. The direct contact with the makers of the film was a unique opportunity and experience. There weren't many weaknesses in this course however, I belive that afroecuadorian culture and the afroecuadorian experience could have been emphasized a little more. However overall, I greatly enjoyed this course and Profesora Tortora as well! ",
            "\u00a0For the limitations of the course (as it was a summer program in Quito for the first time) it was very nicely balanced, but in general we lacked a rigid academic structure. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who loves film and the spanish language, and also apreciates native cultures. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was a very enlightening experience I enjoyed deeply. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, its a great class and Quito is a great city. I had an amazing time and would definitely recommend this program, since Professor Tortora is a quality profe who cares about her students. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I had some of the best 5 weeks of my life during this course! I learned a ton and experienced so many new things! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I think this course is a great way to improve your Spanish, but also learn more about Ecuadorian culture! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, there's such a great variety of activities and academic experiences that you get to have. ",
            "\u00a0This course was fantastic by virtue of its being in Quito, where there is so much to do. The content of the course was not always the most interesting, but the professor and the city are wonderful. "
