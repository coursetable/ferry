            "\u00a0I gained an understanding of the threat that population growth poses to human society and how it is an all-encompassing problem that is at the root of almost all of the existential threats we face, such as climate change, disease, and even war. I also had the opportunity to deliver a presentation and write a scientific paper on a topic of my choice related to population. ",
            "\u00a0Almost none ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about population trends and gained skills in data analysis and critic thinking. ",
            "\u00a0I did not develop any insights while taking this course. This course was poorly organized, its assessments were unclear, and there were no skills that were developed through this course. Whilst the professor claimed that he was teaching us how to \"think\" and evaluate things, he never considered alternate arguments to what he believed was the \"correct\" opinion, often dismissing what students said in class and other perspectives. Furthermore, all assessments were incredibly vague and often relied on things in the reading that we didn't discuss in the class.  I wish the readings were actually used in class, but it seems like we spent a lot of time doing irrelevant readings that would only show up on the midterms. Furthermore, the assessments were pretty much just a regurgitation of facts, which indicates that this class pretty much was rote memorization instead of critical thinking. Thus, I did not really think that this class developed anything. ",
            "\u00a0Greater understanding of varied topics related to the causes/impacts of human population growth ",
            "\u00a0In this course, I learned more about the history of human populations and the different theories related to the regulation of population sizes. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the history of the human population and the causes/effects of the population explosion in the late 18th century/early 19th century. We learned a lot about primate behavior and early human behavior and how they relate to current human behavior when it comes to aspects of our lives such as marriage and relationships between groups of people that are different from each other. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided me the resources to approach the issue of human population growth from a wide variety of viewpoints. From evolution to abortion and biology to theology, along with case studies from locations such as Bangladesh and China, the course provided many different avenues to explore the history and driving factors behind the massive increase in human population. Often presenting multiple logical arguments that were valid on their own but incompatible together, this course helped me learn to question causality and correlation. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a lot of valuable information about the current state of this world we live in. Whether that was of climate change, population trends of various countries, theology, natural law, accessibility to contraception, or family planning, this course was jam-packed with so many interesting content! ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about human behavior and the biology behind many things. I learned about human patterns and the way history repeats itself among population. "

            "\u00a0The strength of this course was the topic; the readings were very intriguing and I always developed a new understanding for the threat that population poses to our well-being. The weakness of this course was its organization. The syllabus was very unclear, as was the grading policy. Furthermore, expectations were not clearly set out at the beginning of the term. Another weakness was that the course was designed to be a seminar but ended up being mostly a lecture course, with various bits of class time set aside for discussion. A more discussion-oriented class with greater organization, greater student involvement, and less professor intervention would have been ideal. ",
            "\u00a0It was interesting but far too disorganized. The syllabus never gave a clear explanation of how wed be graded and the professor also never explained how exactly the grading would work. The midterms were a bit disorganized as well and we did not know when theyd take place until a few weeks before them. The lack of structure in the class wasnt exactly troublesome for the learning aspect but it was when it came to the grades and exams. I wish this was all clearer since even after the class ended we have no concrete idea of how the grading would be done. ",
            "\u00a0Make it a lecture ",
            "\u00a0This course is very interesting material but the material needs to be reworked so it is more conducive of seminar format. ",
            "\u00a0The assessments were terribly unclear and mostly unrelated to things we talked about in class, but only related to the readings. While the readings were engaging, we never talked about them in class. Instead, he just lectured about somewhat related but mostly unrelated things. I do not think a lecture format is appropriate for a freshman seminar, since most of us signed up for something we thought would be discussion-based. Grading was also incredibly unclear (we did not get our second midterm back, nor our final paper). We also did not know what counted towards our grade and how much it counted towards our grade. Because this is his first time teaching a seminar, it probably can be improved. ",
            "\u00a0The topics covered were very interesting but the way the class was structured was a bit unorganized (e.g. no grading distributions were specified). Nonetheless, the topics and the class conversations they inspired were interesting. ",
            "\u00a0While the course dealt with information that was of clear interest to every student, the seminar was usually in the form of a lecture, with little to no room for questions. I often felt that I would leave a class having actually learnt very little because of the disorganization of the lectures. The readings gave crucial insights into the concepts explored in class, but they were often not included in the few discussions that we had. Assignments in the class were also poorly spaced out, and little attention was paid to the feedback provided by students about the nature of the assignments. To improve this class, I would appreciate a clear and coherent structure that is outlined from the beginning of the course in the syllabus. Furthermore, I would have appreciated more recognition of the seminar aspect of the course, as opposed to the lectures. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include the interesting material that the professor covers, at least towards the end of the course. Weaknesses include the fact that this is a small seminar class, but there isn't much time set aside for discussion. A lot of the class involves the professor lecturing about certain topics. Also, the course description doesn't accurately describe what the course is really about and going to cover. A good chunk of the course is about primate (chimps, bonobos, etc.) and early human behavior and I think the course could be improved if this part of the course was shortened by a lot. Many of the topics covered in class sometimes don't even seem related to human overpopulation or the human overpopulation explosion. I think the class would be improved a lot if the professor made clear why and how each topic is related to human overpopulation and spend more time of more recent history/topics in the last two hundred years or so. Also, we didn't really cover much about solutions to the problem of human overpopulation and I wished we spent more time discussing that as a class. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course was the breadth of material that we covered and the anecdotes and insight from the professor. However, one weakness was that we had very little time in class for discussion and discourse among our peers. The course would benefit from more structure from the beginning, incorporating much more seminar-style discussion into the discourse. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Very interesting content!\r\nWeaknesses: Disorganized, wasn't much of a seminar, little class participation, heavy workload (more than 6 dense readings in the span of two-four days). ",
            "\u00a0So much potential for the course but was first year taught as seminar. I loved it but many thought it was too much lecture. "

            "\u00a0As it is currently designed, I would not recommend this course to another student. I believe that the course lacks specificity in its content and could be more focused on a few different areas of exploration. The course should be more student-centered, since it is a seminar. The lack of open, candid discussion among students was disappointing and much of it was due to the fact that very little class time was devoted to discussion. The administration of exams was haphazard, and the syllabus provided little clarity to students on what they were signing up for. Although I feel that I have learned a great deal through this class, I can't help but think that I could have reaped a much better experience if certain changes had been made to the course to make it an experience that better facilitates student learning, discussion, and exploration. ",
            "\u00a0If youre willing to feel your way around the course and dont mind lack of structure, then yes. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course with hesitation because it is very disorganized at times but also the material is very interesting and the professor knows a lot about it. ",
            "\u00a0No, I would not recommend this course to another student. It has a relatively large workload and we don't learn much in the class. The readings were great for learning, but the discussions facilitated nothing and the lectures were irrelevant to the readings. The course had a decent direction, but it seems like everything we talked about was geared towards one perspective and one solution. It would have been better if we talked about other perspectives, but the professor always shut that down. I thought the subject of the course was interesting, but it was extremely poorly executed. ",
            "\u00a0Yes; Interesting seminar because it challenged a lot of preconceived notions ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to another student if the course remains structured the way it currently is. While the topic and the main concepts are undoubtedly engaging, the class is structured in a way that does not facilitate substantial learning and fruitful discussion, which are characteristics of a good seminar. ",
            "\u00a0As how it's taught right now, I wouldn't recommend this course to another student because I think first-year seminar classes are supposed to be more discussion based, but I feel like this class involved too much of the professor lecturing. Also, the course wasn't really about what I expected it to be. In this course description, it seemed like we would have discussions and learn about some really relevant topics to the current issue of human overpopulation but I feel like a lot of the readings and things we ended up learning about don't really apply to human overpopulation. Although a lot of what we learned in the last month of the course was pretty interesting, I really wish the first half of the course was more interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I personally enjoyed the course, but I think I would only recommend it to other students if some of the structural problems with format were resolved. The professor is used to a lecture-style format, but the course could benefit from more student participation to truly be a seminar. That being said, we covered a wide variety of topics in class and throughout the course I was surprised by new information and interesting analysis. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students who have a background in Environmental Science and are well-knowledgable in areas of current issues. The course does not spend too much time explaining some world phenomenas and current events and leaves those less knowledgable to put in extra work to understand these concepts. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It is incredibly interesting and the professor knows so much on the subject. "
