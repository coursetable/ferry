            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the evolution of fashion, historical writing, and analysis. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about fashion in the context of history, as well as how to closely analyze clothing and historical/sociological essays/articles. I would like to note that the course's primary focus is on fashion over different time periods, rather than aesthetics. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about history in London and Paris and how it correlates to fashion. It is a fascinating course if you're interested in fashion and the arts, but I think anyone should take it! I wish they offered more fashion history classes here at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I learned all about the history of fashion. ",
            "\u00a0By taking History 033 I definitely learnt a lot about fashion. The material was not boring and the readings and discussions included truly diverse topics. However, throughout the course, I also developed skills in research and I also feel much more confident when writing academic papers. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about critical historical discussion. I learned a lot about the fashion industry and how to draw connections to history. I feel like I can not only talk about fashion, but history with more confidence. ",
            "\u00a0I gained analytical skills and learned how to analyze historical context. ",

            "\u00a0I think the subject matter was fascinating and very well presented. Most of the classes consisted of us discussing readings, so it was a very interest-guided curriculum. This was also expressed in our essay topics, since we had a lot of flexibility for each one. I also really enjoyed the \"field trips\" in this course, as they introduced me to museums I probably wouldn't have visited otherwise and also allowed us to see the material applied in a really cool way. The only downside was that some of the readings were pretty long, but overall I think the strengths of this course overshadow the weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely enjoyed the small class size, as it allowed for a lot of interaction between students--in fact, most classes were discussion-based. One strength is that the in-class participation is very high, although there is not a lot of work outside of class. I don't really have any criticisms of the class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: a lot of course material, interesting conversations\r\nWeaknesses: the structure was rather boring at times- we do the exact same thing every class ",
            "\u00a0This course is well laid out, I don't have any complaints. It was a very fun class. ",
            "\u00a0I really loved the presentation-discussion type of learning. It was interesting, engaging, and innovative at the same time. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the intimate discussions. We had an incredible group and really grew as a class. Class was really engaging, with field trips and speakers! Weaknesses, the readings sometimes drag on. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were that we gained a deep understanding of a wide variety of fashion trends and social movements that accompanied them throughout history. The course was very well organized and helped us become comfortable with historical research. ",
            "\u00a0A few of the reading assignments seemed not as important as others. But overall the class was very well put together. ",
            "\u00a0The topics are very interesting and the University resources are used very well. I wish that the expertise of the professor was more utilized in the classroom. While the student presentations encouraged attentive reading of the course material, I found myself hoping that Professor Conekin would contribute more of her knowledge to the conversations. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Conekin knows a lot about the history of fashion, however, it would be helpful if there were more professor led discussions. ",

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to other students. Based on my conversations with other first-years, this seminar is much more engaging, well-organized, and student-friendly than most other classes. It is also significantly less work than most other writing credits, which I highly appreciate. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. It is a writing credit, although there are only two essays--and for someone interested in the subject, the essays are not difficult to write. The workload is low, but the discussions in class are always interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes- everyone should get a background into how consumer habits and fashion correlate to historical events, and this course is very relevant historically but also in the present. I believe more fashion history classes should be offered to Yale students. ",
            "\u00a0I would because I enjoyed the class and looked forward to it every week. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in fashion. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! There are not that many fashion courses offered - so this one is a gem. And prof. Conekin is amazing, not just as a professor but as a person. She helped all of us acclimate to college life. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it to anyone that is passionate about fashion or who is interested in learning about the history of it. It was a very interesting and fun course and you get very close with your classmates and teacher. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend taking this class. It fulfills a writing requirement while learning interesting material. The essay topics are all chosen my the students, leading to a more passionate experience. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend it. The history of fashion is in many ways the history of the expression of social movements, and is a fascinating different angle on the way western society has changed in the last 250 years. ",
            "\u00a0Not particularly, since most of the class was student run. "
