            "\u00a0I learned about a new field of study, gained a better understanding into some of the statistical methods used in the papers we studied, and I was able to take on a longer-length research project. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt about the interaction between religion and politics across the world through books and articles. Some of the readings were theory but most of them were quantitative research studies. "

            "\u00a0The strengths included a small class size and an engaging professor and content. ",
            "\u00a0This was a small seminar that did a good job of promoting participation.  I also really liked the readings for the course and the structure of assignments. ",
            "\u00a0I liked how rigorously we analyzed the political science (methods, data, etc.) of the papers we studied. The structure of three reading responses at pre-assigned weeks helped make sure different students read deeply into different papers each week. I would have liked a greater clearer throughline regarding why we studied each topic each week. I found all the papers individually interesting but they did not always speak to each other each week when discussed together. I understand Professor Baldwin's reasoning for putting more of the analytically complicated papers toward the end of the class, however. Loved the flexibility of the final project! ",
            "\u00a0The readings were incredibly interesting. The final project is also structured very well, allowing the student lots of freedom in their topic and empirical approach. The class was also a very small seminar, making it easy to participate and be engaged in the class. ",
            "\u00a0The course gives a good overview of different issues under the very broad umbrella of 'religion and politics.' It's a huge boost that this class doesn't just focus on the US but has a lot of studies in different parts of the world particularly the Middle East and Africa. It was pretty eye-opening and gave me a lot of exposure to competing theories. I wasn't always so sure how the different weekly topics fit together, but Professor Baldwin did try and spend the first part of every seminar talking about the big ideas. Also, because so much is covered, you never get very in-depth into any one particular thing, but all of the readings are quite interesting (though pretty dry). "

            "\u00a0I'd recommend this class--the grading is very fair and you have a lot of control over when you complete graded assignments for the course; the reading and workload is extremely manageable and Professor Baldwin is an incredibly nice professor and very knowledgeable about the subject matter! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Only if they had a couple PLSC classes under their belt, though. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It was one of the most interesting classes I've taken at Yale and taught me so much about the relationship with politics, economics, and religion (among many other factors). Unlike many other political science courses, this course was also a good introduction to empirical approaches to political analysis (R, survey analysis, etc.). ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you like political science and are more interested in facts and empirical data than you are theory and concepts. Obviously religion is a very important force to study and understand, particularly in today's world, and you will come out knowing more about it. Probably the best thing about this class is that you get to propose and write a research paper on virtually anything you want, and Professor Baldwin is very helpful in that process. Professor Baldwin is kind and lovely too, though perhaps a little bit too nice at times, so class discussions can become a little bit unfocussed at times. She brought coffee every week and donuts for the last two weeks, which was awesome. She is a very dedicated professor. "
