Sometimes the handwriting was difficult to read, I think the classroom made it worse. Maybe it would help if more often, a pause was taken to field any questions and make sure people are following what is being taught. Some more examples from the atmosphere and ocean would be really neat as well, but I can understand the choice not to include them as most students are engineers. Would be interesting though. ",
            "\u00a0He held occasional friday classes, which were no fun at the time but great overall because that meant no classes after Thanksgiving break. He also did 3 tests instead of 2 midterms and a final (so not cumulative). The last day of classes was a lot because of this and finals in other classes on the same day, but I wouldn't change it, as it means you're done with the class before reading period. \r\n\r\nHe has discussed doing a flipped classroom, but I honestly don't think it'd be as conducive to understanding the material. Lecture could get confusing sometimes, as any lecture can, but the book and just studying/doing problems were helpful in clearing things up. The TAs were also great at answering questions. \r\n\r\nThe one thing that vaguely scared me was how well people did on the exams, as I worried about the grade distribution in the end. I'm not sure how it'll turn out, but the grades were more spread out with each exam. His exams were fair, and if you studied and did practice problems, you should do exceedingly well in the class. \r\n\r\nOne weakness for some and strength for others is that people who have taken Thermodynamics before had a significant advantage over everyone else. This mainly applied only to the first exam, but it also came into effect some in the 3rd exam. There's no real way around this, but I'd suggest taking thermo first. ",
            "\u00a0Smooke's among the best STEM professors at Yale, the class is fair, Philip's a great TA, and you actually learn material. This class is mandatory if you're MENG, but if you're AMTH highly recommend as an elective. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the exam structure was great - three 90 minute midterms - and took off a lot of stress, allowing us to focus on studying more specific material at a time. I do think the homework could be a bit more challenging as I often felt I could work through the problems without really understanding the concepts. Also, I don't think a flipped classroom is a good idea. ",
            "\u00a0Great course and great professor. Smooke doesnt like the textbook very much, but I found it very helpful personally. It was a little difficult to follow all the lectures - I could benefit from longer explanations of what we are deriving and where we are deriving it from before jumping into the math. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the structure of the course. We met every other Friday to get ahead on the lectures, and we had three big exams (of equal weight), so we actually finished the course before reading period. This course was taught exceptionally well. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very well organized, tests are fair. Lectures are sometimes boring and sometimes super engaging it really depended. This time slot was a huge hassle for me though. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the class overall; there was not too much homework and generally the problem sets were very representative of the exams. Some subjects were kind of brushed over and ended up being more important than expected such as the work flow, but that was rare. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Smooke is the highlight of this course. He is seriously amazing and makes difficult course material easier to understand. I actually looked forward to going to fluids twice a week and both psets and exams were fair and exactly what he promised they would be. If he warns you that it's going to be a difficult test, it will be. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course could have been improved if the professor taught a bit slower and if the practice problems and solutions were put up earlier. ",
            "\u00a0I loved professor Smooke, but there could have been more examples done in class rather than derivations. ",
            "\u00a0The course I feel was a good balance between conceptual understandings of the derivations of integral formulas and also applications of these formulas. It was not too theoretical but at the same time there weren't too many applications so that you could only solve problems if they were in a similar vein to problems done in class. The problem sets were reasonable and questions pertained to information taught in class . ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes the theoretical sides of the class can be a bit difficult to translate into the application side of things but this is the difficulty of all engineering classes. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked meeting four extra times (on Fridays) over the course of the semester, since it allowed us to finish the material early and gave us more flexibility with homework deadlines and the third exam. I also really appreciated how Prof. Smooke went through both derivations and practice problems (there could have been some more of these) in class, as well as incorporated many real-life examples of the concepts we touched upon in class. The course could be improved by having more practice problems throughout the semester, especially prior to exams. For the exams, posting sample problems/tests and their solutions earlier would also be helpful, as most of our practice material was only distributed very close to the exam itself. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Smooke did a great job lecturing. A lot of time was spent on derivations, which some people don't like but I really value. The TAs were lacking, however, and didn't usually provide great direction. ",

            "\u00a0This class is easily the best one offered in the mechanical engineering track. Professor Smooke actually does a great job teaching everything, and brings cool videos and examples into class that keep everyone engaged. ",
            "\u00a0Great Lecturer, needs more practice materials for the exams i believe ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the Professor for sure; Smooke is the best STEM professor I have had at Yale without question. His lecture format, although fast-paced, is easy to follow and he takes time to answer individual questions. The textbook was also useful as the course follows it quite closely. Weaknesses were perhaps the variability among problem sets and exams, as some homeworks were quite short and straightforward while others took hours on end and required you to look up additional equations, data, etc. The first and third exams also seemed significantly more straightforward than the second, so the pacing of material could perhaps have been refined a bit. ",
            "\u00a0strength- very fair, very well taught\r\nweakness- went a little fast ",
            "\u00a0Great course. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very focused and always started each segment by learning the proper derivations. This was helpful in that we were provided a better base from which to learn the material. ",
            "\u00a0Smooke is a good lecturer and a chill guy. Fluids isn't the most riveting material but he made it interesting though real world examples in class. ",
            "\u00a0I think it was organized very well and very manageably, but I couldn't make any of the friday classes because I had a lab class during that time, so to improve that I would provide more supporting materials on canvas for those friday lectures. I definitely missed some bonus points because they referenced things brought up on fridays. ",
            "\u00a0The applications of fluid mechanics are super interesting, although Smooke did a little on applications, I feel like we could have done more interesting examples. Overall the material is pretty dense and boring, maybe if the class was personalized a little more rather than being taught out of the textbook it would be more interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I liked how this class ran. I really like the three midterm system. I wish classes could be taken just a bit slower as professor Smooke talks really fast, and it could sometimes be overwhelming but that is about it. ",
            "\u00a0Smooke was very engaging in lecture, even though the hour and fifteen minute time slot made the class seem drawn out near the end. I thought that the derivations in class were nice to at least know, but there could possibly be more time for example problems to gain a better understanding of the practical material. ",
            "\u00a0This class had good lectures, although a bit on the fast side. There were adequate examples and fun applications that maintained interest in subject. Problem sets were reasonable, though did not always reflect things we learned in class. Exams were very fair and feedback clear. The only thing I would request is practice exams posted a little earlier. I loved that we finished early by having get-ahead classes too! It made my finals period much better! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Smooke's unrivaled experience in teaching this course helped a lot. He really knows what he's talking about, and progresses in a way that makes logical sense. Homework was fair, and helps were available from both of the TAs.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The classroom was terrible... poor visibility to the board, added by Prof. Smooke's inadequate understanding of classroom equipment made trying to learn visually a challenge. He's also a super fast lecturer, without posting lecture notes after class. ",
            "\u00a0No classes on Friday as an athlete I could not attend ",
            "\u00a0A lot of derivation in class, but the PSETs tend to be practical, so a better connection can be formed between what is taught and what is expected. ",
            "\u00a0Smooke was a great professor and clearly cared about his students. Sometimes the notes were hard to read during lecture and at times it felt like the homework covered material that we had never even talked about in class, but overall this was a fair course. ",
            "\u00a0Smooke is a great guy, and the class was very well organized. I don't think really think anything should be changed in that respect, you might get some comments proposing structural changes, but I bet there is no individual change that the majority of students would agree with.\r\n\r\nThere are some practical issues though- it was really hard to read the board.  The combination of the room, and Smooke's handwriting made it way too easy to get lost, which in the middle of some long fluids derivation could really kill your attention.  Also, such a large class really needs more TFs. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course did a good job teaching fluid mechanics. For me it would have been help if at the beginning of the chapter Professor Smooke would take a bit more time to summarize the key ides in the upcoming chapter and why they are important. For the boundary layer chapter, for example, this could include spending more time describing/giving examples of what a boundary layer is and reviewing why we need to treat them separately using boundary layer equations.\r\nI also think the class would have benefited from going a tiny bit slower because it was sometimes hard to even copy Prof. Smooke's work from the board concurrently with the lecture. I liked the examples in class as they provided useful information about applications of the material covered in class. I really liked the setup with 3 midterms and no final as it helped break down the class into more manageable chunks an keep up with work. ",
            "\u00a0The only weakness I could think of for this course would be the timing of our last midterm; there was kind of a long gap between our last class and the midterm, and it would have been helpful to either have the midterm a bit earlier or have some kind of review just because of the time that had passed. It would also be very helpful to have access to lecture recordings, because sometimes Professor Smooke says something really helpful but doesn't write it down, and it can be easy to miss when writing notes in class. Not having recordings wasn't a weakness, but it could be helpful for students to have. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were very well-organized, and Professor Smooke selected textbook readings that aligned closely with the in-class material - which was very useful for completing problem sets and studying. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: lecture style was boring, followed textbook too closely, labored through boring proofs instead of going further into applications (it is an engineering class so I was hoping to see more applications, detailed questions, project based questions)\r\n\r\nStrengths: included fun bits of trivia to break up the lecture a bit, went through examples, exams were straightforward and matched lecture/HW material well.

            "\u00a0Fluid Mechanics is a required course for several majors. For G&G it is a core class and deservedly so. So much of what you learn in this class will be applicable to your climate and oceanography courses. I would recommend taking it before or at least at the same time as you take Physical Oceanography/Physics of Weather and Climate and other upper level courses in the major. MENG 361 is a well-taught course with a superb professor and excellent TAs (Kevin amd Philip) who are patient and extremely experienced with the course material. The organization of the course also really facilitated my learning and understanding of the material. Unlike other STEM classes I've taken in the past, the problem sets were conducive to understanding as well as retention, while also being fairly challenging. You will not spend an unreasonable amount of time on the homework; none of it is extraneous. The exams are fair as well. If you put in the time and effort, you can certainly do well.

I think every engineering class should be like this  an appropriate mix of both derivations and real-life examples in lecture, a solid textbook that supplements lecture material and explains concepts clearly, practice problems that correspond well with the material that actually appears on exams, and TAs who make themselves available and provide helpful feedback throughout the semester.

            "\u00a0You're probably only going to take this if you have to, but if you have a strong foundation in calculus and are interested in some applied physics, it's a great course. ",
            "\u00a0If you have to take it for your major! Otherwise, it's a little hard to be engaged in. ",
            "\u00a0Great class, not too much more, and very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I am a BME, so this course wasn't required for me. I would still recommend it, as I learned relatively interesting and useful skills that are relevant across several engineering disciplines. ",
            "\u00a0I wouldn't if you don't need to take it just because it takes a lot of prior thinking in an engineering mindset, but if you have to take it I think you'd really enjoy it. ",
            "\u00a0If you're taking this course, it is most likely because it is a requirement. The material is pretty boring, but the course isn't bad overall, so I would still recommend it. It is important to know for other subjects in G&G, engineering, astro, etc. ",
            "\u00a0If you're looking to take a Mechanical Engineering course, I would definitely recommend this course, especially if it's taught by Prof. Smooke. ",
            "\u00a0This class was interesting and useful, I'd recommend it even if you aren't required to take it for your major, especially if you can count it as an elective. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course! Prof. Smooke is truly a great professor and person. I took this course because my major cancelled a core requirement a bit last minute and I needed a last minute elective for my major. This class was very manageable and taught well. Prof. Smooke is one of the most accessible professors at Yale and I am so happy that he is becoming Dean of Engineering! ",
            "\u00a0Take it if you have any interest in engineering or design. It gives you great insight into flows and forces associated with fluids. A great course for mechanical engineers and non-majors alike. ",
            "\u00a0The curve is insane and people do so well, I don't know how, so if you know you will struggle with the material try avoiding it. ",
            "\u00a0If you can take fluids with Smooke, take it!  The class was well organized, with 3 midterms covering a 1/3 of the course and no final.  Smooke is a great guy, and sprinkled in lots of cool details throughout the course. ",
            "\u00a0This course provides a great introduction to fluid mechanics and I would highly recommend it to other students. Make sure to pay attention from the beginning though because it seems deceptively simple at first but picks up rapidly. It's very easy to fall behind and spend a lot of time in class confused. You learn about very cool applications of fluid mechanics to airplanes and rockets. ",
            "\u00a0Fluid Mechanics is a great class; Professor Smooke is probably my favorite professor in all of Yale. I really wish I had been a MechE major just so I could take more of his classes. \r\n\r\nClass is generally pretty engaging, with lots of real-world examples and videos to go along with concepts (although admittedly, derivations are pretty dull to learn). Smooke is also just a really nice and fun person, and I looked forward to this class every time. \r\n\r\nHomework is straight from the book, and it's easy to find explanations if you don't understand. Exam questions can be a little tricky, particularly if you don't have much background with thermodynamics (apparently a lot of material was review for MechE majors; not so much for BME). \r\n\r\nAlthough it isn't part of the course listing, there are some Friday classes to help get ahead of the typical midterm/final schedule; I actually really appreciated these, and we were done with new material by Thanksgiving. \r\n\r\nI would definitely recommend this for BME students looking for an enjoyable elective credit. ",
            "\u00a0This course is no fun, it ends up being largely self-taught from a subpar textbook.  I left with very little intuitive understanding of how fluid mechanics actually works. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's very fundamental "
