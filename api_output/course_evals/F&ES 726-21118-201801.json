It was great to have such a high instructor to student ratio- all of whom were highly engaged in the course and student learning.  I think labs can be improved a bit- I felt that it was easy to follow the lab like a cooking recipe, and not really digest the meat of what was going on.  The real ENVI learning didn't happen until we were forced to work on own own projects  (I almost wish there were 2 independent projects... a feeler project that replaces the labs and follows optional ENVI tutorials- and then a final project).  Also, I felt that some/most of the section regarding physics of radiation/orbit/etc was unnecessary for my learning goals (how to find/analyze satellite imagery?  What can it reveal?).  I would have preferred that this section be expedited with more time devoted to reading papers from academic literature that used techniques from remote sensing (which I only got into later with my project).
