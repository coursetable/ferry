            "\u00a0I learned how to think about underlying themes and patterns in writing. I also learned how to apply strategies used in published writing in a unique an original way into my own writing, which I thought was really useful. I also learned how to talk about writing with others and describe the methods behind the meaning of a piece. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a ton about the writing process, how to analyze essays, and became a much better writer ",
            "\u00a0How to express a larger point/message in a concise and cogent manner\r\nHow to effectively structure essays in a way that emphasizes the essay's point or theme\r\nHow to use language in a way that \"shows\" rather than \"tells\" ",
            "\u00a0I developed a much better understanding of effective writing techniques used to write compelling and engaging nonfiction essays. ",
            "\u00a0Writing, critical analysis, and how to produce consistent material. Particularly, I learned a lot about tools/techniques that one can use to enhance one's writing; the course did an excellent job of providing examples of good writing, and then giving students the means to achieve that same level of proficiency. ",
            "\u00a0I grew more as a writer in this one semester than I did in all four years of high school (in a very strong high school English department!). The class pushes you as a writer and reader, the professor is incredible, the readings are fun and fascinating and the writing assignments are innovative and constructive, and the small class makes sure that you meet wonderful people and grow as a writer and reader tremendously. ",
            "\u00a0How to use different writing techniques to craft a compelling essay ",
            "\u00a0I became so much of a better writer because of this course. I love to write, and this course showed me how much I specifically enjoy essay writing. I learned the value of each word and each sentence, and how to expertly craft a text to be in control of what I put out to an audience. This was an incredible course. ",
            "\u00a0This course has rocked my world. I have become totally enamoured with and addicted to the modern essay. It taught me how to truly observe writing - the cracks and flaws in my own writing as well as the strategies and characteristics of great writers. I've developed a whole new attitude towards reading, in which the way a piece is written is as important as it's meaning. I have been able to compact and assess my own writing and step into other writer's shoes by appropriating and trying on different styles. I have come to realize how much of writing is about construction and review, rather than just artistic flow. This course has opened up my understanding of the forms and intent of writing today, and introduced me to the 'modern essay' with it's power to persuade, expand and relate facets of human experience. ",
            "\u00a0The ability to read and analyze good essays, exposure to a wide range of different writing styles, improved grammar and overall prose in my own writing. "

            "\u00a0This class was one of my most fulfilling and also the easiest to manage. I felt like the class was so flexible and the readings were broken up into very manageable amounts for each class meeting. I think that the variety of having some classes dedicated to discussion and some to workshopping also added variety and kept everyone engaged in class. Having the workshops was also helpful not only for those whose pieces were edited but also by people reading them and seeing different ways of conveying meaning. I really can't think of a weakness for this class, it was by far my favorite this semester. ",
            "\u00a0No weaknesses that I can think of; very individual and personalized feedback ",
            "\u00a0Strengths-excellent teaching, great discussions, interesting essay topics\r\nWeaknesses-perhaps too many essays were assigned which prevented us from discussing every piece ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting readings, introduces students to new genre of writing that is not often taught, encourages creativity, fun essay assignments\r\nWeaknesses: grading in my seminar was based on a ranking system whereby our essays would be compared to others in the class - doesn't promote individual improvement in quality of writing ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes we didn't have enough time to discuss all of the readings, although I did enjoy all of the material, so time and opportunities for depth were occasional issues. Aside from those, the class was excellent. Professor Shirkhani not only provided a warehouse full of writing tools and techniques that would challenge us to improve our writing, but also explored the nuances and implications of each of the readings. Wonderful balance of sociological implications of the material while also demonstrating how each piece had something that we could learn from and even transplant into our own works. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: lots of practice reading and writing different types of essays, in-depth teacher feedback\r\nWeaknesses: wish we could have had more feedback within the drafting processes or a greater number of drafts looked over by the professor so we could make sure we were on track ",
            "\u00a0The readings are super interesting and the essay topics were so much fun. In terms of weaknesses, I feel that out of the five essays, the Person essay seemed a bit out of place. This essay topic felt a bit strange and less captivating than the others. However, every other essay topic was really interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Brilliant, thoroughly engaging Proffesor who is a master of conversation management and has a deep love of her subject combined with remarkable insight and knowledge. Fascinating and carefully chosen essays that cover a broad range of subjects and styles and give the student a well-rounded understanding of the use and forms of the modern essay. The format, in which students write essays which are then critiqued by the proffesor and peers, creates a highly effective space for improvement and analysis of one's own writing. Engaging not only with the proffesor but with one's fellow students creates a petri-dish class dynamic in which the students learn from each other's writing and thought processes. \r\nWeaknesses: Can be quite a heavy workload, especially with frequent (and extensive) essay re-writes. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include the frequency of the assignments, intimacy of the class, and professor engagement. Weaknesses include the brevity of the units. "

            "\u00a0I've been preaching about this class to my friends. I think it's so well-designed and has such a functional schedule. I think a lot of variety is built in and yet expectations and the general format of the class was consistent. I think I felt like my time was considered by the course design and by Prof Shirkhani because everything was assigned ahead of time and expectations were clear. I didn't always get that in other classes. I think if a person likes to write and read this is a great class for them. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely; Professor Shirkhani is phenomenal and very passionate about her work ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is a critical course as writing effectively is an important skill regardless of career choice. ",
            "\u00a0YES - be prepared to learn how to write like you never have before ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Professor Shirkhani is an incredible educator, fair grader, and overall pleasant to learn from. Your writing will develop so much in this class, and the content studied will inform not only your writing but knowledge and social awareness. Easily my favorite course this year. Wonderfully structured! ",
            "\u00a0I loved English 120 and would recommend it to absolutely anyone considering it, no matter your year or major. Great readings, fun discussions in class, and interesting essays to write. Take it with Prof. Shirkhani if you can, she was amazing! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Shirkhani is AMAZING. I grew so much as a writer because of the thoughtful and detailed feedback we got for each and every writing assignment we turned in. The pieces we read are highly curated and the class is just really thoughtfully put together. I wish I could take this class again if youre hoping to take an English class and/or improve your writing skills, THIS IS THE CLASS TO TAKE!!! ",
            "\u00a0If youre used to academic writing and are looking for a change, take this class. Its a mix of creative and modern writing. I highly recommend it. The 120 professors are amazing and offer great feedback on how to improve your writing. The different styles you learn is applicable to academic papers and can really spice up your writing. And the articles and essays you read in class are so diverse and really interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but I would warn that writing essay drafts & finals every week does take a big chunk of your time. ",
            "\u00a0I strongly recommend this course. Not only did it make me a better writer, I feel that it gave me a new love of the English language. It was so much fun, and I think it allowed me to reflect both on myself as a writer and as a person. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely. This class is an incredible opportunity for anyone hoping to engage in any form of writing in the future. It will break open your poor writing habits, tear apart your high-school learnt strategies and help you rebuild with a deeper understanding of the practice of writing. ",
            "\u00a0If you are looking for a broad introduction to college-level writing and to improve your ability to write for a wide-audience, I recommend this course. "
