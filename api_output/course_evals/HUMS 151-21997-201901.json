            "\u00a0Developed a better understanding of Shakespeare's writing. ",
            "\u00a0You will read nine of Shakespeare's plays, many of which are his best, though not all of them are very well-known. The emphasis is on close reading. Everyone, and especially English majors, should read these plays, as they continue to be incredibly influential on both English-language and world literature. ",
            "\u00a0Best class ever. Harold Bloom is legendary and deservedly so. ",

            "\u00a0Classes can draw on at points, but if you're interested in the subject matter you shouldn't notice it. ",
            "\u00a0The highlights of this course are its amazing syllabus and the experience of discussing Shakespeare with a world-renowned scholar who has studied this literature for over seventy years. \r\n\r\nTaking a class with Harold Bloom is certainly an experience, though the fact that it's over Skype does put a damper on things. We also spent large portions of class time (re)reading scenes aloud, which, while pleasant as a refresher, often made me feel like we should have been spending our limited time by discussing instead. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - everything about Harold Bloom. Smart classmates; truly the best of the best. Weaknesses - skype. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: reading Shakespeare\r\nWeaknesses: not really structured, and you get out what the group as a whole puts in to the discussions. Seminars with Professor Bloom can be tough to navigate. "

            "\u00a0As long as Harold Bloom is teaching at Yale, his courses are a must-take.\r\n\r\nAs someone with little to no Shakespeare knowledge, I was intimidated by some of my peers at times, but I was still able to participate in classroom discussion. Needless to say, I learned a lot. I think the pacing of the course was excellent. \r\n\r\nProfessor Bloom's health is flagging, so I understand why he has to video chat with us and we have to go to his house for office hours. I wish it were otherwise. \r\n\r\nThe workload and grading are manageable. \r\n\r\nYou can easily save the money and just read online pdfs of Shakespeare. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, a good evaluation of Shakespeare's writing. ",
            "\u00a0Everyone should read these plays and take a class with Harold Bloom. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Any class with Harold Bloom. ",
            "\u00a0The \"Tragedies and Romances\" semester felt less valuable than the \"Comedies and Histories\" semester. I got a lot more new insight out of the latter, especially because most of the plays were new to me. It is fun to read the plays out loud with other students who care about Shakespeare, and it's cool to be challenged by Professor Bloom's difficult analyses and big questions, but it is not as much of a learning experience.
