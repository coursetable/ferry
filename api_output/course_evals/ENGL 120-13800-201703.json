            "\u00a0I learned how to write creative non-fiction essays. I learned how to make my sentence structure more effective and concise to increase understanding and meaning. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write based on what I read...what a revelation! I am so happy I took this course and know that this will help me to become a better writer beyond Yale :) ",
            "\u00a0Learned to read pieces of writing and examine how the sentence itself affected the meaning of the sentence. Learned to see different movements within a piece and identify how literary devices shaped the piece. \r\nWrote many different styles of writing and began to develop a sense for how to go beyond the surface level. Also learned to plan out the main theme/message of the essay beforehand so that every part of the essay contributes to it. ",
            "\u00a0Exactly what the course title says. ",
            "\u00a0I enrolled in ENGL 120 because I really, really did not like writing personal essays, and I really, really did not like letting other people read them. I am pleased to say that at the end of the course, I have enjoyed writing several essays, and I have enjoyed hearing feedback on them from other people dozens of times. I also gained an appreciation for and understanding of the technical aspects of eliciting emotional responses to writing, as well as the skills to actually do that.\r\n\r\nI also come out of this class with a different way of reading personal essays. I look more carefully at structure, and get more out of reading essays as a result. ",
            "\u00a0In one of the first classes, Professor Shirkhani told us, \"English 120 doesn't teach you how to write, it teaches you to teach yourself how to write\". I could not agree more. The course is designed in such a way to challenge yourself. I learned to read my work critically, always looking to improve my writing, make my thoughts clearer, and let my writing speak for itself. ",
            "\u00a0Don't take this if you're looking to learn how to write. The claim is that they teach to you how to teach yourself, but you'll really just write a bunch of essays. ",
            "\u00a0English 120 is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Creative nonfiction is not really a genre that is covered in high school, and I feel that English 120 really broadened my literary horizons. We did a lot of great reading, internalizing and discussing the techniques we observed during discussion, and then putting those strategies to work in our own essays. I learned a lot about building my voice as a writer, and crafting work with style. Also, I learned a lot about participating in a small seminar class, which was new to me as well. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught how to analyze the literary themes and techniques in a variety of types of essays and how we can implement these techniques in our own work. ",
            "\u00a0How to read closely, how to write closely--paying attention to every word, sentence, paragraph. ",
            "\u00a0This course forced me to really exercise my writing muscle, which was definitely rusty before this semester began. In high school, I was mostly writing analytical papers, and didn't make enough time for creative writing even though it's something I love. It was essential that I kickstart the more creative part of my writing brain this semester before taking more writing courses in the future, and this course allowed me to do exactly that. It also opened my mind to creative nonfiction, which I previously hadn't written a lot of. I became a different kind of reader, also  not only reading for content, but also really trying to understand what the author was doing and how they were doing it, and how I could do that myself. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0A strength and weakness of the course is that it is learning by \"induction\" meaning that we were not taught a framework of how to write essays, we read similar essays and were expected to learn how to write. This was effective as I was really able to engage with our readings and develop my own style. This was a weakness in that sometimes it was hard to understand how to write in a specific genre without more guidance. ",
            "\u00a0The style of reading and then imitating good writing is very good. At first I was dubious of how this would work, but by the end I am convinced! I like the timing of the essays, it is a fast turn around, but after hearing there used to be 6 essays, I am very thankful! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: exposes students to many different styles and topics of writing, provides students with examples of great writing and also teaches students to write their own versions\r\nWeaknesses: doesn't necessarily engage everyone in the class, link between the readings we do and the writings not always very strong (except for the model of the \"funny machine\") ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Engaging English class. Not too much reading/writing compared to several other courses.\r\nWeaknesses: You don't really gain anything from this class. Your writing may improve slightly, but it's not by that much. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, this was a great course. I learned a lot and really enjoyed it. The essay-writing schedule, with ungraded drafts due and final essays due a week later, worked really well for me. The readings on the syllabus were all fantastic--fun and also very informative examples of good writing.\r\n\r\nOne major weakness of the course is the cost of the materials. The fact that more than $200 of books are listed as required, when in fact almost every reading appears in the course packet or on Canvas, is unfair. ",
            "\u00a0The examples read outside of class and discussed in class provide a great foundation for understanding what is expected of our writing. The in-class discussions were exciting, interesting, and thoughtful. The class is challenging, but Professor Shirkhani was always willing to think through ideas with her students, give feedback, and help motivate new ways of thinking. ",
            "\u00a0This class is super engaging in that we get to read a lot of great work from publications like The New Yorker. By observing great writing, I feel that the students of 120 internalize a lot of what they read into their own style. I love how hands-on the course is. Moreover, all the students in 120 receive COPIOUS comments on all drafts and final essays, and the direction of the professor is so helpful to fostering student development. ",
            "\u00a0The course was a good size with stimulating discussions each class. The readings were interesting, but could be improved with more diversity in authors. ",
            "\u00a0You get as much out of it as you put into it ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: This course allows students to read and experiment with writing in a variety of different genres. Due to the frequency of writing and editing, students are able to actually improve a great deal during the semester. The in depth feedback makes it easy to understand your weaknesses and improve in the future. Class discussions were always engaging. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the essay deadlines were very inconveniently placed with regards to other things going on at school (not just for me, but for many students in the class). "

            "\u00a0I definitely would. Although it is not easy to get exceptional grades, I have noticed my writing improve greatly over the course of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would, especially with Prof. Shirkhani! ",
            "\u00a0Would definitely recommend this course to another student who is interested in learning to write non-academic nonfiction. The readings were all well chosen and interesting, and working with writing in different ways (reading others, reading and peer editing/workshops, writing yourself) also engages student with material in various ways. ",
            "\u00a0If you want a fun English class and don't care about getting a 4.0, then yeah, English 120 is a great course. ",
            "\u00a0Take English 120! I went in with a deep fear of personal writing, and came out with essays that I'm proud of. I really enjoyed the readings in this class--it didn't feel like homework to read the essays that we studied. And the amount of feedback that I got in this class was so, so helpful: Professor's comments on every draft and final essay, plus a workshop where feedback comes from everyone in the class. This class is a fun and important one. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Although it is challenging, it is thought provoking and makes for a great time to do some introspection. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend English 120 to another student. I think that every student needs to have this kind of small seminar english experience, and I think that creative nonfiction is a particularly useful and engaging genre. The content is just so fascinating and the structure of the course is so conducive to student participation and active learning. Loved this class. ",
            "\u00a0Prof Shirkhani does a good job but a lot of the discussion can be easily lost in meaningless debate and isn't always helpful. She's also a fairly hard grader so be aware that getting the A will take a lot of work, and only happens for like two students per class (i believe). ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it will make you a better reader and writer whether or not these are your primary interests. "
