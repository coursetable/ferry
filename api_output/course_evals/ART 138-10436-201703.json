            "\u00a0I learned a lot amount the works of famous photographers. It was especially enjoyable to learn about the stories behind those works and what makes them so impressive. \r\n\r\nI also learned how to fine tune my own pictures through Photoshop and to print them carefully. Throughout the semester, I gained a better eye for how to make my pictures better. ",
            "\u00a0Learn to take good photos and use photoshop for color correction. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to better use the settings on my DSLR camera, Adobe Bridge & Photoshop basics, how to print pictures on an inkjet printer, and how to better present my work when the pictures are printed and not seen through a screen. "

            "\u00a0Strengths - great combination of fine tuning students' skills in photography and studying the works of successful photographers. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - while the time spent individually working on Photoshop was very helpful, it would have been great to have more lesson-style classes where we learn a skill in depth as a class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are it's focus on taking good photos. Could use more of a focus on technical sections. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are definitely the freedom the professor gives to explore different styles of color photography, and how the focus is less on getting the settings perfect and more on the angle, feel and emotion behind the picture. The only \"weakness\" I see is that I would have wanted a little more practice on the different Photoshop tools in class. "

            "\u00a0If you're at all interested in photography taking this class with Ted is a blast. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student interested in photography regardless of their background (as long as they can get their hands on a DSLR camera). It is an amazing beginners course. "
