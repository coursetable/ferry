The only thing I can think of is that there was very little critical engagement with one another; perhaps encouraging this in a future class could lead to fruitful discussion. ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus and reading selections were excellent. Weekly discussion posts were a helpful way of engaging with the material before class. I think the seminar component would have been better if we had a smaller group. ",
            "\u00a0I think the readings in this class is very helpful challenging, and the discussions were challenging and interesting.  The teacher is very kind. ",
            "\u00a0It seemed like we spent a really long time in the beginning with older texts -- all the Smiths, etc., I think it's important to know these things, but I would have appreciated getting to the more contemporary stuff sooner. Also in the classroom discussions and posts, a lot of us were saying things that disagreed with each other, I am not wishing the class was more adversarial, but I do think it would have been interesting/helpful to engage these differences of opinion.

            "\u00a0Yes, some people in earlier years have said they really struggled with 510, but I found it to be an overall pleasant classroom experience ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would. It is important to have a centralized place for discussion in this variegated field. "
