            "\u00a0I learnt more about modern South Asian history and was able to discuss ideas that I had not even considered previously. The readings are very interesting and complement lectures well. I just wish that we touched upon recent Pakistani history more, as the latter half of the course seemed focused on Indian issues. I enjoyed the use of pop culture in the class, especially with having to write papers on movies and a book. These exercises were fun and gave me space to think about the things we learnt about in class in another context. ",
            "\u00a0A grab-bag of Indian and Pakistani history, social studies, and current events ",
            "\u00a0A thorough and in-depth understanding of a region of the world I have a personal interest in; engagement with firsthand accounts and different perspectives of analysis (historical, sociological, literary, etc) also broadened understanding of and appreciation for the Indian Subcontinent's recent history ",
            "\u00a0This course was the most untraditional yet enthralling history course I have ever taken. The method of analysis was so powerful. Instead of just relying on the typical writers and intellectuals, we used film and popular culture to analyze each historical period. For instance, we watched Google advertisements that told the story of best friends split in Partition, documentaries on ethnic and religious violence, and just fun Bollywood romcoms. I accordingly learned how to use this more revisionist and democratic historiography, and not just the typical top-down model. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much general history about India and Pakistan since 1947 that I just had never been exposed to at all. It is also really cool to take a course that covers contemporary issues like this one did. ",
            "\u00a0I learned an immense amount about India and Pakistan since 1947 and also new historical frameworks. I also learned how to do contemporary history, which I think was a gap in my history education. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about the history of india and pakistan since 1947, especially the intersection of themes like democracy, post-colonialism minority rights, women's rights, religious conflict, etc. and how they evolved since 1947. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the history of India, the breakaway of Pakistan, the religious and caste struggles that had burdened South Asia for so many years, but also how far India has come in raising itself from the woes of economic struggle. ",
            "\u00a0The course covered a huge amount of material, covering the history from 1947 to present of almost 2 billion people. The course helped me understand a great deal about modern South Asian politics, society and culture, while also revolutionizing the way I look at history sources. Prof De used a large amount of film and music to capture the ethos of the times and I found myself drawing new connections between cinema and history. ",
            "\u00a0You will read a lot of very dense economic and political science papers, and by the end of it you will definitely become more comfortable with taking on that kind of reading load. ",
            "\u00a0This course was amazing because it allowed us to think about history in a deep way, analyzing patterns and trends instead of just memorizing dates or causes and effects. ",
            "\u00a0I learned not only a great deal about the history of South Asia, but also about the tension between history and political science as two separate disciplines, how they interact, and where one ends and the other begins. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the history of South Asia. I also learned how to put media in context and talk coherently about how history affects the present. ",
            "\u00a0This class really developed my understanding about the subcontinent in recent times. I learned about how you can infer different trends and influences from advertisements, clips, movies, books etc. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the recent history of India and Pakistan along with a decent amount about South Asian culture through film, advertisements, and books. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: Student engagement (the weekly reading response can be a little tedious but I really enjoyed doing it and reading my peers' responses too), Professor De -- amazing lecturer, even though we were in a lecture he made an effort to remember names and could call on practically anyone in the class\r\nWeaknesses: I just wish we received more prompt/detailed feedback on our assignments. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are at breakneck pace, particularly for non-South Asian students (of which there weren't many in the class). That said, they were engaging (with frequent media content), cleverly arranged, and always enjoyable ",
            "\u00a0Well-structured and well-taught. ",
            "\u00a0Professor De and the TF, Zaib un Nisa Aziz, were fabulous teachers. In addition to the great teachers, the method of analysis, which consisted of constant reliance on pop culture, film, and media, was particularly powerful.\r\nThe main weakness was that it was often disorganized. Both the midterm and the final were different than described. Also, a very small change but would make an immense difference would be to put all the readings in Files on Canvas, instead of having to use the resources tab and searching for each reading. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were the high engagement from professor and students, small lecture format, great lectures, assignments suited to learning. The only weakness is that sometimes the lectures felt overwhelming. ",
            "\u00a0The course was comprehensive and covered lots of material, and the Professor and TAs were very knowledgeable and passionate about the material.  However, the Professor often lectured very quickly and gave information so fast that it was sometimes difficult to take it all in and understand what he was discussing.  Also, I found it difficult to understand the chronology of lectures and events, as the Professor sometimes jumped around time periods to focus on themes instead. ",
            "\u00a0Sections and lectures were great and there was so much useful information put forward by both Profesor De and my TA, Zaib, alike. I wish at times the Profesor slowed his pace of lecture down, but that is largely my only complaint. ",
            "\u00a0Prof De. is a wonderful professor and human being. His lectures, while fast-paced, are well-researched, engaging and humorous. Prof De puts a huge amount of effort and time into this course and it shows; he incorporates our posts on Canvas into every lecture, makes sure to engage with each of us individually, and is very approachable to have long chats with after class. The class assignments are wonderfully thought out and great fun to do, while the readings are also fascinating and never a burden to read.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the only weakness I can think of is that the class comes into the course with such varied backgrounds in South Asian history, so Prof De is often prevented from going into further detail by the need to ensure no one is left behind. ",
            "\u00a0The lecture is by far one of my favourites I've taken at Yale. Professor De is a very engaging lecturer and he mixes his lectures with videos to demonstrate how the themes he is speaking of actually played out in 20th century India and Pakistan. \r\nAlthough I loved the lecture, I will say this class could be a little more organised. Especially when it comes to grading. Assignment feedback in this lecture leaves a lot to be desired. Most of our assignments were short writing pieces, and I would have found ti very helpful to know how to improve before having to hand the next one in. But that was never the case. We received our assignments back very late, and long past when we could have done anything to improve our writing for the next one. ",
            "\u00a0There may be a more useful way of keeping students engaged/checking that they have done the reading than discussion posts. The approach was interesting, but something I had a hard time keeping up with because of the (middle of the night) hours in which I typically study.\r\n\r\nThe content of the course was extremely interesting, and the lectures well-delivered. Some more pointed exam preparation would have been helpful, and more specific feedback on the assignments submitted (book/film reviews & constitution simulation submission). ",
            "\u00a0This was an amazing class. It really made us think and also tied in pop culture to history which was very engaging and interesting. One weakness is that sometimes timelines of events weren't made super clear and delineating those better might have aided in comprehension of the patterns and trends we analyzed. ",
            "\u00a0I think I would have preferred if the course had fewer, larger assignments as opposed to many small assignments. For example, I think I would have benefited from writing an actual paper. The final was also simply too long for the three hour block. That being said, lectures were amazing and the material taught was fascinating. ",
            "\u00a0The course is incredibly interesting thanks to its charismatic and knowledgeable professor and its great TAs. The grading is a little harsh, and sometimes the low grades seemed inconsistent with the positive comments. ",
            "\u00a0This class was great. The only annoying thing was that it took a long time to get feedback on my essay. ",
            "\u00a0I liked this class a lot, and I think that Professor De's engaging lectures were definitely the course's high point. I felt that the reading response system (a short reflection posted online on canvas every week) was effective in getting me to engage with the readings but not excessively stressing me out. I really enjoyed how Professor De used media in class, although there were a few classes where I thought that we watched videos that were slightly too long; I felt that the videos that were several minutes long followed by some discussion - such as when we watched and discussed advertisements or songs - were most effective. My only real complaint about the class was that I thought that the final exam was slightly strange, and I think that a final essay would have helped me learn more, because writing the essays under a strict time limit kept me from engaging as intensely with the new sources we were given as I might have if I had more time. "

            "\u00a0Most definitely! Especially if you are South Asian. I was apprehensive that I would be wasting some of my time in the course since I came in with a background on the topic but my fears were completely unfounded. Discussions are engaging and Professor De is one of the best lecturers I have had at Yale. He knows how to keep his students engaged (with a lot of music and videos) and does an amazing job explaining often complicated topics. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely recommended. Professor De is a gem and will help you understand so much about India and Pakistan. The assignments (book and movie reviews, etc.) are super fun and different from most history lectures ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely! I am neither a South Asian studies nor a history major, yet I thoroughly enjoyed this course. South Asia is a particularly fascinating case study of post-colonial projects and we did not shy away from any sort of critiques. We read Marxist critiques of the neoliberal state in addition to Hindu nationalist speeches. This is a class for anyone interested in South Asian politics and/or historiography. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Super cool material. ",
            "\u00a0An excellent history course thats far more intimate and engaging than an average lecture. It opened up a whole new world of material to me in an accessible yet challenging way. Rohit is a wonderful lecturer but is also so committed to knowing students and engaging with student ideas. Id highly highly recommend, especially to a history major looking to round out their historical knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0This was a great lecture. Be forewarned, the readings are extensive and it's actually necessary to do them for this class. Grading wasn't super transparent and a bit harsh, so I would recommend Cr/D if it's not required because the content is so interesting. Professor De is a very skilled lecturer and he often incorporated videos and multimedia to mix up the flow of lectures. ",
            "\u00a0You should take this class if you will do the readings and participate in the class. It is a very enjoyable class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes if you're willing to put in a lot of time and effort to engage with the material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, a great way to learn more about Indian and Pakistani history, without getting too much into the foreign relations. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Prof De is an incredible person with true enthusiasm and great insights about the topic. At the same time, he's such a down-to-earth, approachable person with whom you feel immediately comfortable. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely recommend this course. Professor De is an incredible lecturer, and you watch and read so many interesting things. Be prepared to put in a lot of time into figuring out timelines, for the lecture moves fast and is more thematic rather than chronological, and for doing a lot of reading. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0Yes: especially for students who have not been exposed to South Asian history before, this was a great introductionwhich explored many topics rigorously and deeply, but started from a place where I did not feel left behind because I had less personal knowledge of the region and its history than some other members of the class. ",
            "\u00a0I would totally recommend this to any student who likes history. The professor is amazing and every lecture is so eye opening. Assigned readings are also super interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It is such a wonderful class and you will not only learn about a fascinating subject but also fall in love (or back in love) with history as a discipline. Professor De is incredible and, if the TAs next year are anything as good as the ones this year, it's a must take. ",
            "\u00a0This class was great. Going in I knew basically nothing about the history of South Asia, but I learned a lot and every topic we covered was surprising and interesting. This class is hard, but I would recommend it. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class both to people who have a South Asian background and to those who have no exposure. Professor De is an extremely dynamic lecturer and there isn't a second that you aren't engaged. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I really enjoyed India and Pakistan since 1947, mostly because Professor De is a really engaging and passionate lecturer who has obviously worked really hard on this class. I knew very little about contemporary India before taking this class, and I learned a lot; I also know people with much more knowledge about India who still learned a lot. Definitely a great class for people interested in contemporary history and South Asia. "
