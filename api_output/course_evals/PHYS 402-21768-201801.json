            "\u00a0402 does the impossible-- teaching all of E&M in depth in addition to covering statistical mechanics-- and Professor Padmanabhan does it excellently. ",
            "\u00a0Gained a basic knowledge of statistical mechanics and electricity and magnetism. This was a lot of material for just one semester course, so it felt very surface-level. ",
            "\u00a0Much deeper understanding of thermodynamics and electrodynamics, studying problems in greater detail and more rigorously than in intro courses. Learned some new techniques for solving and manipulating differential equations, and some calculus tricks. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about statistical mechanics and thermodynamics. ",
            "\u00a0stat mech and electrostatics and electrodynamics briefly. ",

            "\u00a0I learned about basic principles in statistical mechanics and electromagnetism. "

        [
            "\u00a0This course covers slightly too much too quickly, but Professor Padmanabhan rises to that challenge well. The problem sets are a bit long, but very well written and engaging, occasionally even fun. I think that there should be more time in class spent going through homework problems or similar ones. ",
            "\u00a0Course goes a bit fast. You can keep up, but you must read the textbook. Also, wish we could have covered relativistic electrodynamics. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: your classmates. These people are incredible and will be 10,000x more chill than your 410/420/430 counterparts. Also the professor is one of the best I've ever had at Yale, and everyone should get the chance to have him at some point. He cares SO MUCH about his students and goes above and beyond on a daily basis.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: trying to jam 2 semesters worth of material into 1. I walked away feeling like I had some understanding, but certainly an incomplete understanding of the material in both subjects. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Padmanabhan is awesome. Funny, friendly, approachable, helpful -- you name a positive adjective, and he's it. Naim was also a very good TA. They held office hours and study halls and review sessions constantly, so they were always around to help out. The material was interesting, and interestingly presented. I think the difficulty level was great -- hard enough to challenge, but not so hard that it eats up your life (like I've heard about 420 and 430).\r\nWeaknesses: It's at SPL, huge L. We didn't get through some of the material (namely relativistic E&M), but that's okay. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Great professor who is approachable and extremely knowledgable about the subject. \r\n\r\nWeakness: The pace of the first half of the course was good, but the second half (E&M) was rushed. ",
            "\u00a0You go through the material REALLY quickly so be aware of that. Post-midterm E&M covers roughly 6 chapters in about 4 weeks which is really overwhelming. ",
            "\u00a0This was my first time learning E&M and it did not build as systematically as statistical mechanics. Stat mech was super interesting but E&M left me confused. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were interesting and useful, with a good balance between examples and derivations. Problem sets during EM unit were rushed. We had one entire problem set for vector calculus review, then had half a problem set for magnetostatics, or covered all of electrodynamics in one problem set. I dont believe the exams were accurate and fair tests of what we learned or did on the problem sets. Some questions were completely unfamiliar to questions wed been doing all semester. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this course was very interesting and Prof. P was great. The only downside was probably just the sheer amount of material that is covered, even if not that  in depth ",
            "\u00a0Strengths-- the professor teaches the material well and offers chances for help in office hours, study halls, and piazza\r\nWeaknesses -- the homework material is often much more difficult than what we covered in class. For Statmech, this was really difficult because we didn't have a specific textbook to follow. For E&M, the problems got much harder but Griffiths was there to guide you reasonably well. E&M suffered because it was all thrown into 3 large and impossible problem sets. \r\n\r\nTo improve, there should be more reference material for the statmech portion of the class. Maybe reconsider the pacing of the class so there is adequate time to cover the E&M material a bit. "

            "\u00a0401/402 is better than 410/420 because you get three semesters in one to the same level of depth. I would recommend this course if Professor Padmanabhan is teaching it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only if you're pretty motivated to keep up by doing your own supplemental reading and whatnot. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend 401/402, especially if you have to take it anyway. It is a great introduction to the more advanced physics concepts, so is perfect for people who don't necessarily want to go on to physics grad school. However, I would recommend physics majors seriously consider taking the intensive advanced track as it is too challenging to fit everything I wanted to learn into just one semester. ",
            "\u00a0Take it! I'd recommend it for physics majors (forget intensive, get a life) and for others -- if you're a Math major trying to get a BS, say. You might even be premed or MBB or something, take intro and the labs, then sign up for 401/402 -- and add Physics as a second major.\r\nThe material in this class has breadth and depth, and it's led by the excellent Prof. Padmanabhan. If you need to take it, have no fear, for he will captain your ship like Will Turner; if you don't need to take it, jump aboard anyway. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, would definitely recommend this course to anyone at all interested in statistical mechanics of E&M! The professor and other students in the class were super helpful. The professor's logic was easy to follow and he put a lot of time and energy into his students. The review sessions before exams, flexible office hours, and study halls made him extremely accessible. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this class. My physics background was 401 and AP Physics 1 and I found this class manageable.  The class became much more difficult with E&M and you will have to spend more time reviewing outside of class. Psets take 15 - 18 hours. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course, if you need it for the non intensive major. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah I'd recommend this class. It was really interesting, not too difficult, and Prof. P is awesome. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student! Professor Padmanabhan is a great teacher and also cares about his students very much. He wants you to learn the material and goes out of his way to provide extra help if you ask for it. His exams are unpredictable. The midterm was fair and similar to the practice midterm but the final was not similar to the practice final at all and was much more difficult. Despite this, the grading is kind. By the original grading metric, I would have done much worse than I actually did (think B-). But he was very generous with how he weighted the final in the end. \r\n\r\nContent-wise, the course moves very quickly and covers a lot of material, so if you fall behind (especially in E&M) make sure you catch up ASAP.
