            "\u00a0The senior thesis project has taught me a lot in how to go about researching a topic and crafting an argument around the pieces of information I find. It has definitely shown me how difficult it can be to put together a history of a disease during a specific time frame and trying to reconstruct what the public attitudes were toward health officials at the time. ",

            "\u00a0It's okay. The deadlines are spaced out enough, but the assignments (especially towards the beginning and middle) seem a bit repetitive. I would have preferred to have more of a heads-up junior year and perhaps some more time (in junior or senior year) to begin exploring topics. Other than that, I really enjoyed working with my advisor, but the \"class\" is pretty unstructured/independent so I don't know what else to comment on. "
