            "\u00a0I learned about modernist french literature, how WW1 corresponded to the death of old France, and existentialist French philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0Nothing ",
            "\u00a0I have no regrets about reading Remembrance of Things Past; in fact, I think everyone should read Proust over the course of their lifetime. ",
            "\u00a0Read a lot of Proust. ",
            "\u00a0This class gave a fantastic overview of Proust's major work, with the focus of the course being the interpretation of the novel. Not just honing critical reading and writing skills, the course also offered a window into a particular time period (France in the belle epoque), and the instructors did a great job in evoking the atmosphere and describing the historical moment (and many of its most important happenings) that Proust was writing about. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to critically engage with a single text over an extended period. I learned to integrate secondary reading material into my analysis. And I learned that love should be free. ",
            "\u00a0This course introduced me to In Search of Lost Time. I learned about the cultural conditions in which Proust wrote the novel, strategies for reading and interpreting it, and the philosophical themes that it puts forth for reflection. ",
            "\u00a0improved my literary reading skills and learned some history (Dreyfus affair, impressionism, France around the time of WW1). Gained insights into self and how to better experience events in life "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0It fully could not be improved. Professors Bloch and Saint-Amand were engaged, brilliant, and funny. ",
            "\u00a0This course was supposed to be a seminar, but there were way too many students. Perhaps the course should be offered so that there is a French section and an English section that meet separately once a week seminar-style, and then together once a week as a lecture. There is also WAY too much reading for a semester. The course would be better if offered as a year-long series. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the course. (Reading Proust will change your life.) But thought the professors could've done a better job distributing the reading load. Also, it was unclear why we were reading certain sections of the novel and skipping others. ",
            "\u00a0Professors Bloch and Saint-Amand are absolutely lovely, and have a true deep love for the text. I personally found reading so much Proust to be repetitive after too long. The first half of the semester was great, but overall engagement fell in the second half, because it was just so much Proust. ",
            "\u00a0The material being read is incredible, and the instruction is enthusiastic and enjoyable. There was a lot of reading, but this is inevitable in a course on Proust. To avoid skipping over the third volume and the volume containing The Captive and The Fugitive, I think the class could be extended over two semesters (given the high demand, I think enough students would return for a second semester too). If this wouldn't be possible, then perhaps some of the most moving and important passages from these volumes could be included in the reading for the one seminar course (maybe cutting from the middle of Time Regained and the middle of Within a Budding Grove?). Additionally, the large number of seminar participants might have slightly hampered discussion some days, but, by the end of the course, this seemed more like a strength than a weakness. ",
            "\u00a0The books is certainly a strength! As was having two professors, as was the fluid discussion format. I did wish our class was a bit smaller and that students did a better job of stepping up and stepping back based on how much they usually contributed. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength of this course was the novel itself. Reading Proust was an incredible experience and ensured that our class discussions were compelling.\r\n\r\nIn general, however, this course had several major weaknesses. On a structural level, In Search of Lost Time is perhaps impossible to teach in a single semester. Professors Bloch and Saint-Amand did a good job of paring the text where necessary while trying to keep the heart of the novel intact, but even with a condensed novel, the course suffered from too much reading. We were unable to discuss large sections of the text and we spent hardly anytime on the secondary reading.\r\n\r\nThe course also suffered from at times frosty and unwelcoming environment. I would have wished that the professors had taken a more direct hand in ensuring that discussion was tight and focused on the passage at hand. This problem is not solely the professors' fault, but at times I felt alienated by the nature of the conversations that we were having. ",
            "\u00a0The material was great, though sometimes the reading load was a bit heavy. It was very hard to squeeze in the secondary readings, although I would have liked to. Maybe choose more strategic excerpts? That isn't a perfect solution because I enjoyed reading as much Proust as we did, but I guess everything has tradeoffs and we have other classes too. The class size was too big ",
            "\u00a0This class is a boy's club and it's difficult to get your voice in while being conscious about the amount of space you are taking up. Neither of the professors seemed to be aware of how centered the class discussion was on a few, male viewpoints and rarely tried to get others to speak up. Could have been a better atmosphere "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This course made life just a wee bit more worth living. ",
            "\u00a0No, unless you have some deep interest in Proust. I took this class as a requirement for my major and felt like I had missed a prerequisite because everyone else had read Proust before. I felt like I could not participate in class discussions because this was only my first time analyzing Proust instead of my second or third. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Are you going to read 2,500 pages of Proust outside the context of a seminar? Probably not. So seize this opportunity. His book will challenge, anger, sadden and delight you. It'll change how you think about the world and about your self. ",
            "\u00a0It's a guided reading of Proust's In Search of Lost Time. Of course, it is going to be a lot of work. But Professors Bloch and Saint-Amand were a dynamic duo, the material is excellent, and the classroom environment was lovely. ",
            "\u00a0If you absolutely love Proust, or didnt get enough of him in DS, take this class. If your feelings about Proust are more lukewarm, stay away. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely -- Proust is the kind of author who, if you invest an entire semester in, really provides a number of intellectual and personal rewards. His novel is definitely, without exaggerating, the kind of thing that will change your outlook on life. Prof. Bloch and Saint-Amand are knowledgeable, approachable, understanding, and fun-loving (their banter alone makes the semester worth it). They clearly love the material, and kept the class fun and enjoyable throughout the semester and throughout the many, many pages of reading. ",
            "\u00a0I really would highly recommend this course to another student. In Search of Lost Time alone is one of the most profound works of literature I've ever had the privilege of reading. The knowledge and humor Professors Bloch and Saint-Amand bring to the class are just cherries on top. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Proust is famous for a reason. ",
            "\u00a0In its current form, I would not recommend this course to another student. Covering Proust to any reasonable degree of depth in a single semester is impossible. While I am glad to have gotten the opportunity to read Proust, I feel that I could have gotten a similar amount of the novel by reading it on my own. If the class was to become two semesters, I think it could be fantastic. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's a fantastic work to read just for life, for understanding yourself better. Proust has many great insights and a unique way of thinking about things that the professors facilitated our making sense of ",
            "\u00a0If you take this class be prepared to be surrounded by former DS boys who talk a lot and are not self-aware about the amount of space they take up in the discussions "
