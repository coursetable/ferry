            "\u00a0The course is quite disorganized, as the Professor would not use the slides during lecture, choosing topics and what to focus on with his own pace. The slides are one the only materials students get from the class to review.\r\nIf there had not been section, it would have been incredibly difficult to review the material, as the other source, the textbook, was also not followed.\r\nSection helped a lot, especially with Marnix who reviewed the concepts in a concise and easy way to understand.\r\nThe other aspects of the course may need some restructuring though. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were not useful or informative. Didn't start understanding the information until I just started to try to learn it on my own. TAs were left with little they could do because they only had 50 minutes a week to try to teach us 140 min of lecture material ",
            "\u00a0Prof Kortum was a horrible professor. He would read off of his slides a lot, and talks without explaining stuff. Other students have said the same. He should not be teaching. ",

It is evident in the way they interact with and treat students in person and email. The professor even sends out class-wide emails saying not to email him about stuff sometimes... The course director, Marnix, treats students like they are imbeciles and overall like shit. The course director should not be teaching and should just be researching if that is all he cares about. Students come to Yale hoping for an education, ideally with instructors who care about them, which was missing from this course with Samuel Kortum and Marnix Amand. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are very interesting! Professor Kortum makes the information relevant by discussing their implications for what's going on in the world. The exams could be structured better -- many of us were confused as to what exactly were on the midterms and the final. ",
            "\u00a0This course is obviously taught by a researcher trying to get tenure - refused to help me when I asked for extra help, went off on irrelevant tangents during class, poorly written tests that weren't good judges of what we've learned, etc. ",

            "\u00a0I'm not sure I even got to take an introductory macroeconomics course, because the way it was taught and organized felt so disjointed and misunderstood that I actually think I just sat through almost four months of accomplished researchers COMMENTING on introductory curriculum and never passing any sort of knowledge down. Thanks to this, I don't have any sort of comment to make on the course itself  besides the department's choice in instructor and the overbearing weight of exams upon our semester grade. :o ",

            "\u00a0The lectures were interesting, and the textbook and slides were easily comprehensible. However, sometimes easier concepts were given far too much time, making the class seem slow moving. ",

            "\u00a0The course felt disorganized and lacked attendance. Could be improved by having more organized and informative sections and from the professor following the powerpoints written for him. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - Professor Kortum is nice, and TA office hours were very helpful. The weekly quizzes were good practice to solidify concepts. Weaknesses: Lectures were structured in a way that wasn't very cohesive and hard follow along. It was hard to know what the important part of each lecture was. Additionally sometimes the psets weren't related to what was being taught in lecture so we would have to lots of outside research in order to complete them. ",

            "\u00a0This course lacked a cohesive arc, it just seemed to be random tidbits that werent related to each other ",
            "\u00a0I think the material itself was not too difficult and it can easily be self taught. However, be prepared to teach yourself because the lectures are not particularly informative. ",
            "\u00a0I was uncertain about the goals of the course at times such as what the main takeaways were. There were times when a lot of information was given or a lot of derivations were done, but I wasn't exactly sure what purpose they were done for.\r\n\r\nThere were also many moments when I felt like my studying did not pay off--especially when I study a lot for trade and labor but get a question about the Nobel Prize. I wish there was a better way to give people who go to lecture more credit without penalizing people who go to lecture but don't study the portion of lecture that doesn't seem to be as relevant to a course that seems to be meant to lay down introductory macroeconomic principles.
