            "\u00a0TA office hours were very limited given the high difficulty of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Not sure\r\nWeaknesses: The prof is brilliant but not that great at translating that brilliance to pedagogy.  Sometimes I feel like he just didn't know how to explain things simply. Sometimes section felt absolutely useless. ",
            "\u00a0The course begins with the real world and a macro overview which really helps me see what I am learning about. The weekly section to help with psets is a good idea. I have a sense that Fredrik did try to squeeze a fair amount of content into the class. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Fredrik gives great background to the lessons; the p-sets were challenging but not overwhelming (in terms of both length and difficulty)\r\nWeakness: such a long class period! I have a feeling like I'm not extremely confident about what I learned, but I'm not quite sure why I feel that way. ",
            "\u00a0While I think the overall structure and approach of the course is good, it was very unclear to follow what we were doing in class at times and why we were doing it. So in general more connections to the overall structure/big picture/goals really would have helped. ",
            "\u00a0I feel like we departured  from the book without a reliable source to read at few points in the semester and that really made it hard to understand what is going on. This could be mitigated if we had slides to go to for reference. ",
            "\u00a0This course was painfully basic. The material was presented in probably the worst possible way. Out of all statistics and quantitative methods courses I have taken, this has been the worst and lowest level of all. The professor's teaching style is difficult to follow or take anything away from. The TAs were completely useless, and often either did not show up to their office hours, or provided objectively false information. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, because the approach this course takes is theoretical. This helps us understand what we actually do in our practical statistical analysis. "
