            "\u00a0A deeper knowledge of literary theory and, more importantly for me, methods for how to approach it. ",
            "\u00a0A deeper familiarity with the disciplinary history and central debates of literary studies from the beginning of the 20th century to the present. Refreshingly, the course avoided the typical \"big names\" and \"schools of thought\" approaches to teaching theory, instead centering the exploration of theory around key problems and methodological concerns. I now feel comfortable using and discussing theory in a way that goes beyond simple application of theory to texts. ",
            "\u00a0Lots of skills in how to engage with literary/critical theory, including its vocabulary and history. Knowledge of the same, as well as lineages and legacies and strengths and weaknesses. Many insights enabled by the clustering of topics set out in the syllabus, which seemed to be the design (for example \"Phenomenology, therapy, ethics\"). Tons of diverse reading, some classic, some contemporary, and all presumably (?) important to the field. Lots of names to remember and arguments to discover and retain. ",
            "\u00a0Literary-theoretical methodologies; their history and present applications. Understanding of the development of literary scholarship as a practice and profession. "

            "\u00a0This course was a lot of fun. Marta and Jonathan make a great team, and between them, the instructional portion of the class was very well choreographed. I learned a lot (especially coming in with very little background in a lot of the stuff we were tackling), and the course itself was designed to be an open-ended introduction to the way literary theory ticks. It worked really well in that regard. My only thoughts on improvement (and this is very subjective) might be a smaller and more condensed reading list. The syllabus was encyclopedic in scope (which is wonderful!!) but it did make getting all the reading done (and distilling intelligent thoughts on it) a bit of a challenge. I wonder what a theory course would look like if its syllabus chose 3-5 theory monographs which were read deeply and thoroughly over the course of the semester, as opposed to looking at one or two chapters from many books, or multiple articles. Obviously this would include the exclusion of a massive amount of important texts, but I think other facets of theoretical argument-building would be drawn out which often get obscured. That said, the course was wonderful, and I'm very happy I took it. ",
            "\u00a0This course transformed how I think about literary criticism, about the profession, and about reading. It was a fantastic introduction to the texts that I had always looked forward to reading in graduate school. I loved the thematic approach, rather than proceeding mechanically through the major twentieth-century schools of criticism. Almost all the readings felt fresh, relevant, and vital. I honestly don't think I would change much of anything...a minor point is that I wasn't always a huge fan of the blog posts, which I think often went unread by fellow students. Maybe the course could incorporate short presentations instead, as a way of ensuring that we hear from different voices? Fantastic class; thank you! ",
            "\u00a0Among the course's many strengths was the problem-based grouping of readings and the instructors' clear presentation at the beginning of each session of the main stakes of the week's readings and the connection between a week's readings and the readings from the previous week. Helpful focus on \"method\" rather than getting too caught in the weedy terrain that is theory--the focus, implicitly and explicitly, was \"what would a reading using this method or approach look like?\". Also good was the exploratory and supportive environment that the instructors fostered: students with various levels of familiarity with theory were, I think, able to productively engage with each seminar meeting. The weekly discussion board posts were accordingly open-ended, but could have used more structure so as to generate more of a feeling of conversation between students and to provide some guidance, however minimal, to students approaching new and unfamiliar methods. Also, as in any graduate seminar, what was difficult at times was how to allot discussion time to different readings: sometimes it felt like a long book chapter got only five minutes, while we might drag out discussion of another text for an hour. The approach to discussion was generally to begin with a mapping of the larger picture, then to proceed one-by-one through the readings. I wonder--and this really is a question--if the discussions of each piece might have been somewhat more \"synthetic\" while retaining the clarity that was so well accomplished. In any case, the team teaching worked very well: MF and JK brought usefully contrasting experiences in literary studies to the seminar table. ",
            "\u00a0Amount of reading both a strength and a weakness. Course was much improved (in my opinion) when the syllabus got a little bit culled in the back half--tightened up discussion, enabled more complete reading, etc. Extremely difficult articles sometimes (because obscure or Derrida) partially mitigated by those crucially helpful mini-lectures by both Marta and Jonathan at the start of seminars. Big strength of the class letting some of us be confused or disapproving, though not everyone admitted to being confused; hard to tell the bad takes of students from the good takes sometimes. Some confident voices seemed to dominate seminar, as well as some angry or skeptical ones. Very successful eventually to make people rehearse their blog posts--one more way the class got even better as the semester went on (see also less reading, more lecture). \r\n\r\nCould have used more of the professors' opinion on the quality or importance of some of the assigned reading, as well as more definition of terms. Frustrating sometimes to not even touch on articles (sometimes long and torturous articles) that had been assigned and presumably expected, though this  must be an accident when it happens. ",
            "\u00a0The course was both useful and relevant, although occasionally the amount of reading set was more ambitious than could be covered in class. Discussion was often lively, and we were encouraged to think seriously about what it is that we're doing in grad school beyond at both a practical and theoretical level. "

        [
            "\u00a0Yes! I'm a big fan of two-professor courses, and I think with something like theory, having two instructor voices is very much in the spirit of the subject matter. Also I think theory is as crucial a subject area as any of our distribution or language requirements for learning how to be good literary scholars, and Marta and Jonathan struck a great balance and drew out a lot from different fields and subfields of grad student expertise to make the coursework relevant and applicable. 10/10 would recommend! ",
            "\u00a0This course is a great way to gain exposure to some of the major schools and movements in literary criticism, from the nineteenth century to the present. That's already a huge and ambitious project, but because the course is organized thematically rather than historically (a major improvement on most introductory literary theory courses, in my opinion), we also ended up grappling with some profound questions about the nature of the \"literary,\" the norms of the profession, and perhaps even where literary criticism ought to go from here...a fantastic class and something of an unofficial pro seminar, since most of the first-years take it. The team-taught format worked very well; Marta and Jonathan are different types of scholars with different methods, and they modeled ways of thinking that offered a range of alternatives while also really supporting and respecting each other, I thought. The workload is not insignificant (a few hundred pages of reading a week and weekly blog posts), but so, so worth it. I particularly recommend the course in this incarnation, with Marta and Jonathan, but you should take it either way! ",
            "\u00a0I cannot think of a better way to become familiar with literary theory and literary method. I came away most weeks with the feeling that another piece of the theory puzzle had clicked into place for me. ",
            "\u00a0Would absolutely recommend to other students. Actually maybe some version of this course should be mandatory. Love that it was co-taught, too. But sometimes hugely challenging, and different students come at it from different places. There is one through-line of \"What does this article argue?\" and then a second which is \"How does this argument speak to me/my research?,\" and maybe some people played ball with the second more than they did the first. Self-motivation seems like a requirement for this course, not only to do and internalize the reading but to participate in class, which some of us didn't do too much, maybe because of the confidence on display from some corners. ",
            "\u00a0Yes--I think taking a literary theory/methods course is a pretty essential course for the first couple of years of grad school. "
