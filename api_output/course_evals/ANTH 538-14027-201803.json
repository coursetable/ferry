            "\u00a0I learned about contemporary issues in Middle Eastern societies through an ethnographic lens. ",
            "\u00a0I took the class hoping to get a better sense of the sort of ethnographic work that had been done about the middle east as well as to get a sense of different types of ethnographic writing, regardless of region. I think the class helped me to achieve both aims. The texts we read were pretty varied in terms of the approach they took to ethnography and ethnographic writing (a number of texts were also not ethnographies). I also learnt a bunch more about the middle east, from various religious groups in the region, recent politics, experiences of youth in the region etc. However, it is not a class for someone looking to get a historical overview of events in the region. While these were things we definitely discussed throughout the semester, we didn't focus on them sufficiently to really cement that knowledge if that's what you're looking for. It was, however, not what I set out to get from the course and I think the class did a good job at covering what it purports to - culture and politics in the contemporary middle east. "

            "\u00a0The course discussions were in-depth and incredibly engaging. Though the reading was heavy (one 150-250 page ethnography a week), I enjoyed reading all of the books and feel like I gained nuanced perspectives on issues like refugees, religion, and gender in the Middle East. It is worth it if you put the time in and the work is overall easy to manage if you plan ahead. Each student was required to lead one of our two-our seminars by giving an introduction for the book of the week and preparing discussion questions. I found this aspect of the course to be rewarding and enjoyable, and is certainly a useful exercise for anyone who sees a future in teaching. This course truly has few weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0I really appreciated reading complete ethnographies for the course. I would love if at the end of the course we all compiled the various reviews we had written on the various ethnographies throughout the course just because I think it would be a great way to consolidate our knowledge. However, this might work better in a situation where there are more students taking the course for credit. I bring this up thinking about a different class where we also read one text each week and each week one student was tasked to do a summation of the discussion throughout class and at the end of the class we had a compilation of all of that which was really useful for reviewing after the course.

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in anthropology or the Middle East. This is the best course I have taken at Yale thus far. Although I was interested in the Middle East prior to this course, it gave me a new lens into the lives of ordinary people through ethnography. If you put the time into doing the readings and participating in class discussions, you will certainly get a lot out of it. If you are merely looking to educate yourself about the Middle East and have little background in Middle Eastern Studies or anthropology, I would encourage you to take a more introductory seminar before taking this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would! There are not many classes on the middle east to begin with at yale and I think the texts that we read in this course provide an interesting perspective on the region. "
