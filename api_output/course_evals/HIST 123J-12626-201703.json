            "\u00a0This course seriously evaluated the Confederacy, both as an experiment in slavery as a cornerstone element of Western society and as an experiment in nation-building during times of war. I engaged seriously with secondary literature, particularly some of the most recent work being done on these subjects. I also engaged with primary sources, although to a lesser extent than older historians might have had us do. ",
            "\u00a0Terrific examination of under-examined facets of Confederate South. Professor Shinn facilitated great conversations on aspects of the South that are infrequently discussed or analyzed--such as the role of elite women, counterrevolutionaries, Confederate foreign diplomats, and so forth. It was great to get past Lost Cause sentiments and examine the lasting effects of the Confederate South. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a bit about Civil War historiography and the politics of intra-Confederate affairs. ",
            "\u00a0Wow, what a fantastic course. James Shinn is as good as it gets. This course succeeds in that it tackles a difficult question, one American history students of the 19th Century (and beyond) tend to ignore. We study the Civil War, but never really delve into the specific reasons why the Confederacy was such a frightening political experiment. The CSA is frightening enough as it is when you paint it with broad strokes. This course, though, delved into numerous deep topics (policy, government structure, economics, social hierarchy, the slave economy, military, home-front) that gave the students a full picture of just how dark a moment in US history the CSA really was. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a deep knowledge of Confederate history and politics, especially as it applies to neo-confederate rhetoric that continues to be used today. Additionally, I exercised and further developed writing skills through the various course assignments. I also feel that the class challenged me to think critically about readings and during class discussions. ",
            "\u00a0This class is focused on the Confederacy as an experiment or project. I extremely appreciated that we were focusing on the Confederacy from within because I had always thought about the Civil War in terms of the strengths and weaknesses of the Union. So I learned to think about the Confederates' motives for fighting the war from their perspective. \r\nThe discussions we had in class taught me to read critically as we were always challenging the arguments of the authors from our readings, and asking whether their theses were argued effectively.\r\nI also had the chance to work with primary sources in two of the papers which helped me develop crucial historian skills. "

            "\u00a0I was surprised and unsurprised by how much I enjoyed this course--I loved James, and thought that he had prepared a really excellent reading list and discussions for us. I had expected as much, because I have enjoyed courses I have taken with graduate students. At the same time, I had less interest in arguments about the roles of white women, etc. because I think they make arguments that are predictable (particularly if you are a person of color, as I was).\r\nI think one of the weaknesses of this course was the sheer amount of reading--I did all the readings during one or two of the weeks, and was able to participate in the class just the same. I think the reading could be pared down without detracting from discussion, particularly for books like Confederate Reckoning, which are mostly just repetitive. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this class. The only improvement I would make would be to reduce the amount of reading simply because we did not have the time to cover all of it each session. However, the selection of readings was superb ",
            "\u00a0The course was engineered well so that those without expert knowledge of the South could read the interesting and extensive assignments and play a significant role in class discussions. Professor Shinn allowed us to delve into a whole range of considerations for the first papers and the term paper centered on a topic that interested us the most. The class held great discussions and hosted a guest lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0It was a really strong course, few assignments, everyone had the ability to participate, etc. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course can all be attributed to James Shinn. He set up a fantastic syllabus and led some of the most engaging seminar discussions I have had in any Yale course. ",
            "\u00a0The primary strength of the course was in its topic as it is incredibly timely and unlike other history classes offered at Yale or other universities. One weakness of the class was that it was very much left entirely to student discussion and I would have appreciated more context on Confederate history at times rather than simply discussing readings. ",
            "\u00a0The readings in class were extremely interesting and the discussions we had were even more fascinating and engaging. Everyone was encouraged to talk and add to the discussions. James also often started off class with images and pictures which helped to warm the class up for discussion. I liked the way the course was structured; I enjoyed the progression of topics we broached. \r\nThe only weakness I can think of is that the amount of readings some weeks can be a bit overwhelming. "

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course--largely because I think James is an excellent pedagogue and clearly thought carefully about how he wanted to prepare his reading list. It also did a lot for demystifying the Confederacy for me, and the nature of white supremacy. There are few classes as topical as this one, and I think it's imperative to understand the tenets of Neo-Confederate ideology. ",
            "\u00a0TAKE THIS CLASS ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this class to another student. After taking this course, one realizes the aspects of American society that still exist with Confederate undertones. This class provides a true examination of the Civil War and the Confederacy beyond military histories or studies of just prominent leaders. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to another student, especially if they're interested in learning about the Civil War from a Southern perspective and exploring how the memory of the Confederacy is present in modern America. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Anything James Shinn teaches, TAKE. ",
            "\u00a0I would most definitely recommend this class to another student since it is applicable to any Yale student who is interested in pursuing social justice in the present moment. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly, a major component of whether you enjoy the class will depend on the other students in your section. But James asked really great questions that guides that discussion. The topics each week are realy fascinating, and their are great readings to supplement. \r\nThe class has three papers and no midterms or finals. The first paper is a review of readings from a week of your choosing. The second paper is a short analysis of a primary source which functions as a test run for your final paper. The final paper is a bit daunting at 15-20 pages, but it manageable if you don't put off the research and the writing.\r\nTake this class if you really enjoy Civil War history. "
