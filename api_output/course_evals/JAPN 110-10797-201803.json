            "\u00a0I've learned, quite possibly, the most content in this class than previous classes I've taken at Yale. Learning hiragana, katakana, and a fair amount of kanji, you develop a strong basis for the language. There is an immense amount of vocabulary and grammar. Reading is more emphasized at the end. Speaking and listening are probably the most difficult aspects of the class. ",
            "\u00a0I was able to develop a solid foundation for the Japanese language, as well as consideration for cultural aspects like in group and out group through honorifics and humble expressions. ",
            "\u00a0This course is an intensive foray into language learning. The workload is a little heavy but you learn to work through/around it because the material is so fun! ",
            "\u00a0Language, writing "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is the fact that you have ample opportunity to learn instead of caring about grades. The way the scores are divided is incredibly fair. Obviously, a downfall is definitely the workload, but it is an incredibly rewarding class if you put in the work. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: fast pace, lots of grammar covered, proper pronunciation enforced, culture explored\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: memorization of CCs not enforced ",
            "\u00a0This course sure as hell teaches you Japanese. The high workload is counteracted with fun lesson plans and engaging professors. Seeing the scope of the course, this is pretty much as easy as it gets when it comes to learning Japanese efficiently. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: great passionate professor\r\n\r\nWeakness: high workload "

        [
            "\u00a0If you truly care about the culture and learning the language, I 100 percent recommend taking this course. Without any knowledge of Asian language, it'll probably be very difficult, but it is definitely possible if a little work is put in. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Fantastic elementary language class that really helps you learn a difficult language. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely recommend it. Dont look at the high workload as a crutch; I took it with 4.5 other credits and did fine. If you like Japanese culture/language in any way, definitely take this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0No, it is difficult and perhaps not as useful as some other courses but interesting nonetheless "
