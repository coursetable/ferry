I was so fortunate to have the opportunity to read something that was not as \"frequented\" but would give me better insight into the humor of the elite and the social expectations that surrounded matters such as class, gender and deviance. ",

            "\u00a0I really liked the consistency of how much we translated! I felt that sometimes the discussions became abstract quickly  and, while our professor attempted to get us all back on track, I found myself a bit lost in the discussion with little to add. That being said, I always walked away with more insight, and I was able to synthesize it all more as the class progressed. I liked the writing assignments, and the exams/quizzes were extremely fair! Overall, the strengths DEFINITELY outweighed the weaknesses! "

            "\u00a0Yes! If Professor Peirano Garrison is teaching it, DO IT! She is so supportive, and she makes herself available for her students. Overall, a fun course that translates material that almost feels almost \"counter-culture.\" Essentially, you'll be reading about upper-class, poetry versions of graffiti. It's wild. I would say the translating portion of this course is less of a focus than in others. It's a discussion based class, which makes it more enjoyable in my eyes! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course to any interested in the material.  The workload was very manageable for most of the semester, although it grew fairly busy around finals. "
