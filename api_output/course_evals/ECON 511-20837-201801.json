            "\u00a0Second half of the first-year Ph.D. macroeconomics sequence. Much more applied than the first half, which is nice since you get to see all of your hard work in the first half come to life. Also heavily on MATLAB coding, which is useful prep for research.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most valuable thing learned in this class was not necessarily the models themselves, but how to carefully choose (and break!) assumptions to create a model. This class helped me realize the sheer amount of thought that goes into creating (seemingly simple) models that represent the world in some way. ",

            "\u00a0Exams covered a small amount of material and the long question tested understanding of 2 small macroeconomic facts and then the rest of the question was predicated on performing algebraic manipulations. I found that the final left a lot on the table in terms of evaluating our true understanding of the material. ",

In this class, you learn more models, but more importantly, you start understanding how to carefully choose (and break!) assumptions to fit these models to your research questions.\r\n\r\nAt first, I found it difficult to tease out the economic insights from these technically involved models.
