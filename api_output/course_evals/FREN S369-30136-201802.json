            "\u00a0There was a lot of reading assigned.  Our substitute professor ended up cutting some of it because it was just too much to talk about, let alone finish reading. ",

            "\u00a0The course seemed that it was designed in a way such that the seminars paired well with the the excursions we had. However, since we did not have Professor Bloch to instruct us this summer, it was at times difficult to see the connection between the seminar and the excursion. I did learn a lot about Belle Epoque France and present-day France. I was particularly interested in learning about the life of Colette. ",
            "\u00a0This course, in my opinion, was horribly run. I understand that, due to Professor Blochs family emergency, there had to be last minute changes made, but this was not the way it should have been done. Professor Ladensons first words to the class were that she didnt know why she was even teaching this and she wished she was on vacation instead, and that basically set the tone for the entire class. Within a week, Professor Ladenson cut over half the syllabus, leaving us with barely any material to go forward with for our presentations and final essays. The class, which was supposed to be heavy in discussion, was more like a lecture, with the professor almost looking down on us every time any of us spoke, and basically encouraging us to let her ramble for the entirety of the 3 hour class. The discussion topics, which were supposed to be broad and cover a lot of topics, centered at least 75% on prostitution, and this is not an exaggeration. On the work we did submit, we received little to no feedback, which left us with absolutely no idea on where we stood in the class until we received our final grade. In class, I was told that my presentation was good, which made sense because she basically just told us to do a book report, and thats what nearly everyone did, and on my final feedback I was told that it was sketchy, with absolutely no other feedback. Im still not sure what this means. In our out of class excursions, Professor Ladenson was just as engaged with us as she was in class, which is to say barely. She would often wander off without the class, leaving us with our tour guide, who was well intentioned but often didnt have information relevant to what we were looking at. (which didnt even matter because we barely discussed anything we touched down on in our excursions in class) When she was with the class, shed take opportunities to tell us how much she hated museums, or to verbally berate our tour guide every time he said anything that she didnt agree with. This class was a complete mess, and I legitimately had no idea how I was doing at all until I received my final grade, which is a sentiment several of my classmates shared. The little we did learn was barely relevant to the overarching theme of the class, which was admittedly broad, but definitely not intended to center nearly solely on late 19th to early 20th century Parisian prostitution. To anyone considering this class, this is not an indictment on the class itself, as Im sure if Professor Bloch was the teacher this wouldve been a completely different experience. However, if by some poor turn of fate Professor Ladenson happens to be teaching this course again, run far, far away. "
