            "\u00a0This is above all a course on longform reporting. Besides the large assignment, there is relatively little structured / specific writing instruction. ",
            "\u00a0Learning more about the process of writing long-form stylistic nonfiction ",
            "\u00a0I became more confident in my creative writing abilities and honed my journalistic long-form writing. I honestly did not do many of the book-length readings so I cannot say I learned much from them, but the articles were always fascinating, and it was helpful to look at pieces I would normally read for fun with an eye to their construction. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the craft of writing and environmental literature, more so than learning much about the environment. I learned a lot about long form journalism. ",
            "\u00a0How to ground concrete descriptions of the natural world. becoming a better observer and writer. Understanding all the possibilities of writing about nature. ",
            "\u00a0My writing improved a lot during the course of this semester, both in terms of technique and content. We were really pushed to work collaboratively and learn from everyone's writing. ",
            "\u00a0This class was my first formal guidance in creative writing. I learned so much, and I feel like my writing improved measurably. Professor Burdick does a great job covering all the different scales of writing: from the technicalities of sentence structure to overall narrative structure. His main emphises in the class are on how to engage a reader, how to bring movement into a piece, and how to marry vivid description with empirical facts. I now feel that I have a good grasp on these. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write clearly and directly about the environment around me. This class provided a great opportunity to improve my own writing, learn how to critique those of others, and read very good environmental writing by other authors. "

            "\u00a0There could more emphasis on readings and discussion, and less on the singular writing piece ",
            "\u00a0The classes, especially toward the end of the course, were a little unfocused and thus a little tedious. The creative writing exercises were fun but not necessarily super helpful or relevant to our long out-of-class assignments. I would have liked more peer editing and/or feedback throughout the process of our largest and final assignment. ",
            "\u00a0Great books ",
            "\u00a0The course introduces great texts and builds a great community. The readings are all really well chosen. \r\nOnly thing I wish for is a way to engage more actively between the readings, the writing exercises and our own projects. For the second half of the course, it was perhaps centered too much on our own pieces. Would love to see a way to bring back our readings to what we are working on. ",
            "\u00a0This course was great because of the collaborative aspect. We read all of each other's work and discussed it during class. The small seminar size created a space for great conversation. ",
            "\u00a0This class was fantastic! Its biggest strength is that you spend several months working on one long-form piece. You work and rework and rework it, and in doing so, you become intimately aquainted with your strengths and weaknesses as a writer. And Professor Burdick is very good at helping you accentuate your strengths and improve on your weaknesses. He has a knack for shaping your writing without imposing his own voice or interpretations. In general, the classes were structured well, with lots of readings, workshopping, one-on-one meetings with Alan, and in-class prompts and free writes. At times, the in-class workshopping could be scattered and unproductive, but Alan was always available for one-on-one meetings or through email to give feedback. Another reason why this class stood out was Alans willingness to share his insights from a career as a writer and to tackle questions of journalistic ethics and personal voice. These discussions were engaging and added yet another layer to the class. Overall, I loved this class, though I think it could be improved with a little less emphasis on the student-led in-class workshops and more focus on one-on-one discussions with the instructor and in-class writing practice (e.x., free writes, prompts, or breaking down the writing of prolific writers on a sentence level). ",
            "\u00a0This course was small and provided a very comfortable atmosphere for experimenting with writing and receiving feedback. Professor Burdick's writing exercises were fun and helpful. The opportunity to write and report on any topic of our choice, and follow through and revise our writing many times, was really good for going in depth and learning what our own strengths and weaknesses of writing were. However, the class sessions could have been more focused. We sometimes spent too much time giving other students feedback when we could have been having discussions about reading we had done, or completing writing exercises. Also, the format three writing assignments about the same topic that progressively got longer was intense and forced revision, but it also got to a point where there was just not much more to say, and running out of steam also caused a lack of motivation to continue to improve on the writing. I also wish that there had been more reading assignments. "

            "\u00a0I began this course enthusiastic about the chance to dive into environmental writing specifically, and I was quickly disappointed. The course is geared more towards general long form reporting, and lacks any significant grounding in the environment mentioned in the title. If youre most eager to do reporting (and thats it), then you may well enjoy the class. But if youre looking for a space to write creatively about the *environment,* like me,  youll likely find yourself underwhelmed and frustrated. Besides its lack of environmental focus, I was most dissatisfied by the use of instructional classtime: the seminar is two hours, and  Professor Burdick often spent a whole hour asking about our progress on our final assignments (often not die for a number of weeks or months even). I was optimistic about the chance to learn in class and apply what Id read when completing my assignments, but classtime turnout to be relatively void of any solid lesson. The class seemed to consist of only the assignmentsno solid instructional syllabus. Unless the course is really bolstered an revived (including a more pre-planned reading schedule, and solid lesson plans), I feel like future students would be better served in other writing workshops. ",
            "\u00a0It is a lot more like a thesis project or independent study than a class, but if you like that, then yes ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested in writing about science and/or the environment, definitely. It's more reporting-focused than one might think, though, so if you're more comfortable as a creative writer and don't feel like branching out, this course probably isn't for you. Burdick is a great 1-on-1 resource, so take advantage of his office hours for personal feedback. ",
            "\u00a0Very helpful, relaxing, productive course. The course materials, Professor Burdick and the kind of people who would take the class builds a great community of open minded observers. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. If you want to work on your writing and learn from a great professor, you should definitely take this class. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This was the first creative writing class that I have taken at Yale but I loved it and it made me so excited to keep taking more. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student simply because Professor Burdick is such a good resource to have while working on a piece of writing. His experience and the amount of feedback he gives and time he is willing to spend meeting with you is great. This is a unique experience to focus heavily on writing over content. "
