            "\u00a0Improved my historical understanding of the genesis of Hip-hop, developed an understanding of new terminology, challenged me to learn how to use video editing software, gained a great deal of insight into the international, gendered, class-based and racial significance of hip-hop. ",
            "\u00a0This class offered me an opportunity to learn about the intricacies of hip-hop culture and how it varies between different regions. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a deeper appreciation for Hip Hop Music and Culture. ",
            "\u00a0A greater understanding of hip hop culture. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about hip-hop music and culture and had lots of great discussions! ",
            "\u00a0This is a phenomenal class: you learn a lot about hip hop history, have great discussions about current mainstream hip hop, and get to hear the opinions of your teachers and your peers on music, as well as themes like race, misogyny, class, etc within rap music. I learned a lot about the origins of the culture and gained exposure to a lot of artists through this class. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about social implications and the history behind hip hop culture in America. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The strengths lie in the professor Nick Conway, who allows the course to proceed at the tempo most natural for the students. The class is highly accomodating and low-stress, and you learn through discussion with other students and hands-on interaction with hip hop culture and events. The class is unique in that it deals with a topic that is both recent history & current history, and so it can be brought to life through specisl guests and music listenings, among other activities. If you want to learn sbout hip hop not as some fossil to be studied but as a living organism that you can have a relationship to, this is a great place to do it. ",
            "\u00a0I think it's very good at giving one room to explore their interests. However, I'd say that it lacks structure. That said, I think it particularly benefits from the lack of structure so I wouldn't change anything. ",
            "\u00a0If the class could have a Spring Semester follow-up, it would allow a longer time for students to delve into the different aspects of Hip-Hop more comprehensively. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this class is in its students and professors I think. Everyone that takes this seminar is very interested in Hip Hop, and it shows in our discussions, which often were off the cuff discussions of the recent news in Hip Hop - ranging from discussions of albums to discussions of the cultural impact of songs. The weakness, I believe, is in that, if you were not already very interested and knowledgable about Hip Hop, and had instead taken the course with the intent to learn and discuss Hip Hop history, this class sometimes lacked direction. ",
            "\u00a0I think Nick is a fantastic teacher who really loves the material he's teaching and loves to teach. He makes the class what it is. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the reading and documentary-watchingI wish there was more of that. ",
            "\u00a0Phenomenal course. The professor is very knowledgeable, and you learn a lot about a fascinating topic. Student involvement is encouraged and fun! We had lots of great discussions, and everyone felt comfortable sharing their thoughts. One of my favorite classes I've taken. ",
            "\u00a0The class is not only fun and engaging, but also extremely informative, and if you do have opinions on certain aspects of hip hop, you're always free to share them in this course. ",
            "\u00a0I liked how enthusiastic our professor was about the topic, which encouraged students to also be enthusiastic. "

            "\u00a0Yes. Its truly a gem if youre interested in a low-stress, highly informative way to engage with hip hop music. ",
            "\u00a0This is easily the best humanities course I've taken at Yale. It's immensely fun, very engaging and the structure of the course pushes you to challenge yourself- if you should so choose. Please don't take it if you're not going to take it seriously. You'd only gain from it if hip-hop actually matters to you. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0Just take the class. You will not be disappointed. I am recommending everyone I know to take it. ",
            "\u00a0The class made me much more familiar with themes and conversations in and around hip hopand for that, I am appreciative. Nevertheless, there was so little work in practice that I didn't really grasp onto anything. I wish the course more closely followed the syllabus, because, when I opened the books included in it, I learned a lot. Often, the course was just a discussion of new music, which didn't cut it for me: I wanted to talk about issues that hip hop presents and resolves. That said, Nick is a really generous and kind person and the class is a very relaxed setting in which to engage with hip hop. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! It's a super interesting, you'll make friends, and be introduced to some new music! ",
            "\u00a0100% take it. It's pretty easy workload, but if you're a hip hop fan, you'll learn a ton from this class, whether it's hearing about new artists, learning history, and discussing your/others' takes on certain music. ",
            "\u00a0Yes- not a heavy workload and interesting material "
