            "\u00a0Rigorous exploration of modern Chinese culture and society. ",

            "\u00a0Continued Chinese 150, learned about Chinese history, short stories, and news and media topics. ",
            "\u00a0Listening, speaking, grammar, and writing, as well as vocabulary expansion. "

            "\u00a0No weaknesses. Simply an incredible and well thought out course! ",
            "\u00a0It's difficult to speak of weaknesses of the course in objective terms. A lot of the dissatisfaction from the course just came from personal reasons, not from the course itself i.e some students didn't like discussing economics or learning business terminology, but this might be interesting to some. The course did a well job of alternating between relevant skills- speaking, writing, reading, and listening, although this meant that there were a good deal of assignments. Some of the later chapters were good at narrowing down on and developing a specific skill, like reading the news. ",
            "\u00a0This course was awesome. Constant engagement with the material lets your level of Chinese improve rapidly. The emphasis on oral Chinese was also really good as well. As for weaknesses, I honestly cannot think of any. The textbook which is tailor-made specifically for this course has some strange words and grammatical phrases, but on the whole this class is a 5/5! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include variety to course examinations: essays, presentations, listening homeworks, and even oral homeworks! Weakenesses could be more accessible office hours. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely!! If you want to advance your Chinese fluency and further understand Chinese history and modern society. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to learn more Chinese take this course! Yes it's time consuming but it's also worth it, the teachers are great, and you'll probably enjoy seeing the same people everyday. The vocabulary taught is mostly useful and covers a broad range of more advanced topics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, yes, a thousand times yes! If you want to learn Chinese and learn with awesome students and amazing professors, this class is definitely for you! ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! Wang and Zhang are very good professors and their activities and help outside of class is very accessible. "
