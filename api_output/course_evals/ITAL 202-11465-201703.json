            "\u00a0Taking ITAL 202 was a good decision. Prof. Iacovella adds a lot to the class as not only does she bring her personal experience of being  Italian, but she gave us many readings related to the current political and economical situation of Italy, some of which were very recent, such as the book of Mauro Magatti published in 2017. I learned a lot about the current political and economical situation of Italy, learned economical terms with which I was unfamiliar and wrote  in Italian. The class was discussion-based and I also learned a lot from others in the class. Prof. Iacovella created opportunities for everyone to share their thoughts by hearing a student talk and then ask what we thought or by showing videos and sharing articles that illustrated a point. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the political history and culture of Italy and the economic consequences of this leadership. My writing improved and my ability to participate in discussions as well. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about the political and economic history of Italy and Europe ",
            "\u00a0Good survey course of the major themes facing Italy over the past two hundred or so years. Definitely more of a focus on post-unification Italy, so if you're looking for a course about medieval/Renaissance politics/economy, this isn't for you. I feel like I'm much more well-versed in some of the topics, even though as a non-economics person a few of the technical terms were a little over my head. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about political and economical systems of Italy and improved my Italian language skills. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I do not think there were any weaknesses. Prof. Iacovella made ITAL 202 great. Many students had also visited Italy and no matter the familiarity of the students with the economical situation of Italy, Prof. Iacovella made sure everyone participated through regular written responses, presentations and discussions. She always shared events of the Italian or film department with us, such as the visit of Pierfrancesco Diliberto and the weekly Friday Scarabeo game at the Italian department. ",
            "\u00a0No weaknesses. All strengths. ",
            "\u00a0Very reading-heavy...lots of PDFs. Maybe incorporate other types of class material because at times it could feel a bit boring. ",
            "\u00a0It is a great course! Professor Iacovella made it very interesting and engaging by introducing different media and points of view to her students. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this to a student with some level of Italian and some familiarity with the Italian economy. Prof. Iacovella makes sure every student gets to participate. Prof. Iacovella is also a wonderful person, always sharing events of the Italian department with us, so I thought that while taking this class, I also learned about the Italian community at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes it is an interesting topic taught by a great professor. ",
            "\u00a0Take, an awesome class with a dedicated professor! ",
            "\u00a0Definitely would recommend-Anna is a fantastic instructor and a fantastic, caring human being. If you like smaller courses, this is good for you. Not a lot of work, some of the topics are really interesting (and Anna works around student interest, so if your class is really into a certain aspect then she'd probably change things around and focus on that more!). ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! It was so much fun and extremely insightful and informative!! "
