            "\u00a0This course helped me think a lot about my own relationship with food. It also taught me about writing less traditional essays and allowed me to explore interesting topics in creative ways. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the relationship between food and identity and food and desire. I also strengthened my critical reading skills. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to bring myself into the classroom. The classroom became a space to bring my own experiences and understanding into the material and genuinely broaden my mind and critical thinking regarding sensitive and contentious topics. ",
            "\u00a0I developed ways of discussing deep issues and gave me the vocabulary to talk about women, gender and sexuality properly. We learned how food connects to important aspects of identity and desire. We read books deeply and used our personal perspectives in a academic setting. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to use food as a central analytic to understand gender/desire/love ",
            "\u00a0This class totally changed the way I think about food, identity, and desire. This class has been deeply enriching and enlightening. Some of my favorite conversations revolved around authenticity, food and trauma, and food and race in the restaurant industry. I also loved how the class broke down ideas about the separation of mind and body in academic spaces. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot in this course! It was a skills based class in that we cooked often, but it was much more focused on the readings and  thoughtful discussion. I learned a lot about the intersection of food with internal feelings of belonging and desire. ",
            "\u00a0I gained better skills and a wider knowledge about how identity is related to food and food to desire. I also expanded my library and knowledge of foods and books. Professor Trumpler also gives great feedback on writing and presentations, so I feel like this class can be an opportunity to improve and gain those skills. ",
            "\u00a0This class is unlike any other course at Yale. Professor Trumpler creates a learning community in her classroom that facilitates collaborative learning and encourages a personal connection to the learning material in a way that many Yale course fail to do. Everyone came to class prepared, having read the materials because we were all excited to be there (even if it started at 9:25 am)! The materials we covered in the class were carefully chosen and each was enjoyable and interesting to read and discuss. This may also be one of, if not the only classes where you actually get to cook and eat in class. Aside from these obviously more fun aspects, this course developed a different kind of engagement with the material than anything I've ever experienced at Yale. The embodiment of our learning provided by this class is something invaluable. I would recommend this course to anyone! ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think more actively and critically about food. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the different significances food can take on, especially relating to identity and desire. "

            "\u00a0This course is amazing! I loved that we were able to cook, eat, and have really interesting and deep conversation. ",
            "\u00a0What I really liked about this class is that it felt like learning for learning, not for a grade. I appreciated how Professor Trumpler let us be creative in our assignmentsshe was not looking for a right answer, but a thoughtful engagement with our work. I also think that the embodied practices that we did were super helpful in understanding the texts and engaging with the class and classmates. ",
            "\u00a0The workload for this course was really manageable and allowed us to engage with the material on a very high level. It took a week or so of the seminar to get the ball rolling on conversations and feeling comfortable with each other, so I think context of the material matched up well with that reality! ",
            "\u00a0The style of teaching is amazing. The small class with smaller groups and a self-guided discussion was really engaging. Professor Trumpler is excellent and really engages in the class. The diversity of the class and the fact that we all wrote Trumpler to express our personal interest in the class fomented an environment of respect and dedication to the work. The fact that the class involved reading a book a week never felt cumbersome and I have never been in a class where it felt like everyone actually did the reading. I would say the only weakness of the course is that it occasionally felt a little too self-guided and I wondered if we were kind of reiterating things a lot of us already knew instead of learning new things. The assignments, however, let us explore texts, people, and topics of our interest deeply and without the intense pressure of other classes. Because the work load was not too intense, I was able to engage more deeply with the material and really take my time with my work. ",
            "\u00a0The reading list is wonderful, I loved having one book a week. The assignments accurately allowed me to reflect my learning. Only improvement would be maybe more novels and fewer cookbooks at the beginning-- the novels were my favorite and I am not even usually a literature-person. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: embodied practice, reading list, engagement of students\r\nWeaknesses: could expand embodied practice to field trips! ",
            "\u00a0Overall I think this was a great course. I loved how discussion was facilitated and the books chosen for class discussion were great. It rarely felt like the class was 2 hours long - not much to say for weaknesses!! ",
            "\u00a0I honestly thought this course had no weaknesses. I liked almost all of the readings, the in class discussions were great, especially accompanied by that day's \"embodied practice\" (read: cooking lesson and eating). The final project was a fun assignment and both short  papers were broad enough that you could really write about anything related to food. ",
            "\u00a0The major strengths of this class are Professor Trumpler, the material (which has a lot of range and breadth), and the other students. I think that it may have been a bit more intimate with a smaller class, but everyone had a unique perspective and voice to share. This environment was also incredibly special as a break from the stresses and competitive achievement culture that subsumes much of this university. It felt intentional and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0This course is extremely engaging and thought-provoking. The structure of the course facilitated a classroom atmosphere where all felt comfortable and engaged. ",
            "\u00a0The structure, material, and workload all made this class one of the most enjoyable and engaging classes I've taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0The readings for this class were really interesting, and I liked how each week we tackled a new topic related to food. I loved the \"embodied practice\" aspect of the class and how it provided such a different type of learning than we are used to in the classroom. It was always great to start off every class cooking something. I enjoyed the freedom of the class, but it did feel a little too unstructured/not cohesive enough at times, and it sometimes felt like our conversations for each week were kind of unrelated, and I wished the course could have built more over the course of the semester. "

            "\u00a0Yes! This class is so amazing! It is a pretty light workload, however, the work that is assigned is interesting and never feels like busy work. The books we read were fascinating and led me to think about food, identity, and desire in entirely new ways. If you have the chance to take this class you should absolutely take it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This class was really fun AND really educational! You learn so much about different cultures, different identities, and different desires that are shared through food. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It was a very reasonable workload for a spring semester course and the readings each week were excellent. ",
            "\u00a0This was a life-changing course for me because food is something that I never had the change to engage with seriously at an academic setting and I rediscovered my passion for food through taking this class. I also loved Prof. Trumpler's pedagogy and the way she structured class to foster conversations among students and mutual learning. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It was the most stimulating class environment I have ever been a part of, and I am leaving the class with incredible tools to approach further studies and my life in general. ",
            "\u00a0This was my favorite class this semester and it is one of the most engaging classes I have ever taken. I would recommend this to any student, and I think food, identity, and desire are topics that can get anyone interested in WGSS regardless of their personal identity. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, be prepared to learn in a different way and read one book a week and discuss difficult themes. I laughed and cried my way through the reading list. ",
            "\u00a0YES!!!! So incredibly rewarding for a million reasons including low stress, fascinating topic, and lots of food making and tasting! ",
            "\u00a0YES take this course. Professor Trumpler is so kind and incredibly knowledgeable. You can tell how much she puts in to the course and she truly just wants everyone to succeed and have fun. We often did \"embodied practice\" (i.e. cooking in class) which was great and the workload is so manageable. If you are at all interested in the topic take this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Absolutely engaging, learned a lot, really enjoyed myself in class, assignments felt meaningful and we received thoughtful and personalized feedback, and the books on the syllabus are incredible!! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This was a great course! All around terrific. Super easy yet incredibly interesting. The readings are mostly novels and the discussions tend to be low-key, mainly just focused on asking big questions about food and how it impacts us as humans. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I think this course is an incredible gem. If you can get into it, definitely take the opportunity. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This is a great course to explore themes you wouldn't otherwise get to explore--it will change the way you think about food. The class is also structured totally differently from other courses and makes for a really distinctive (and, in my opinion, generative) learning environment. ",
            "\u00a0Would definitely recommend. The relatively light workload allows you to engage fully with the material, and Professor Trumpler creates a welcoming atmosphere that encourages intellectual curiosity and rigor. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course for anyone who is interested in food in any capacity as a fun, but also interesting class that will require you to think deeply about a topic you may not have thought much about before. "
