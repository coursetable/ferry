            "\u00a0the importance of self-management, and how appropriate interventions should be tailored in order to reach patients ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much in this course, and it all finally came together with more clarity towards the end of the semester.  This was a great intro to self and family management and provided an interesting way to think about research questions in different fields.  I learned more presentation skills, and the feedback was really helfpul. "

            "\u00a0The guest lectures were fantastic. I also appreciated the strict adherence to timeliness and deadlines. ",
            "\u00a0This is an excellent course!!! Perhaps students could be encouraged to finalize their \"final paper topic\" and outline earlier in the semester in order to help with trouble shooting issues (should they arise). \r\n\r\nOtherwise, this was a very engaging course. I really appreciated the special guests, and professional panel discussions our professors brought to us. ",
            "\u00a0Overall the course met its objectives and it was clear there was careful planning of each class content and reading lists.  The content covered was great, and the classes were dynamic and engaging.  My only suggestion would be to start with more introduction about the self and family management framework to provide context for the readings for those students who weren't familiar with the concept of self and family management.  It took 3-4 classes before it started to come together.  Journal club is a great exercise and skill building task, but I would move it a bit more towards the middle of the semester.  I learned a ton in this course. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely!!! This is VERY important for nurse scientist to take ",
            "\u00a0Yes - good foundation.  I would have loved more time for discussion.  Despite the long class time, some of the classes felt very rushed, and I know there is a lot to cover, but it would have been great to have more discussion time because everyone had great things to contribute.
