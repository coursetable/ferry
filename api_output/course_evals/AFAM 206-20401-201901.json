            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the South-- more than I came in with. I learned to think somewhat more intersectionally about the black and Southern experiences, and to see how different genres of writing lend themselves differently to different understandings of the black Southern history. ",
            "\u00a0Literary Analysis! I haven't had the chance to take a lot of classes (or really any) that focus on it, and really struggled with it, but was able to really focus on it this semester, which was really good for me! ",

            "\u00a0The perspectives of many students in this course were very similar to one another. While I recognize that there doesn't necessarily need to be an argument on every point, I think that it would be interesting to see what more differences in opinions could bring.\r\n\r\nI really enjoyed the conversations as well as the presentations that each student made. They were all VERY VERY interesting and demonstrated important aspects of each student. ",
            "\u00a0This is a fabulous class! Basically like a fun book club. ",
            "\u00a0this course was absolutely wonderful in its dedication to the texts and the conversations that were held about the books in class. the course demanded that students came prepared to every class and had read the entirety of the texts. this course had little, if any weaknesses. "

            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY; Take It. You are set up to learn no matter your background. Dean Mahurin is fair and insightful in a way that anyone can come in and take something valuable. The students are held to a high standard so you're learning from everyone in the space. She does have a final paper and a final exam which is a little annoying but the class makes It worth It. truthfully. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you're interested in reading incredible prose and studying this part of America, highly recommend. ",

            "\u00a0Absolutely! This course has been an amazing experience, particularly as someone who hasn't been able to take a lot of classes doing literary analysis, and has been great! Everyone in the class is so amazing and always has so many great things to say  (and the end of semester party is so wholesome) ",
            "\u00a0I believe everyone should read the Color Purple, Heavy, A Lesson Before Dying, and God's Trombones as well as everything on this syllabus. I've already recommended this course to white students and friends of mine who do not understand what the black experience and have not had much push back against their thoughts.\r\n\r\nI do think all black people (especially black southerners) should take this class especially because these books were written for us. These books question our place and have made me reflect on my life and the position that I currently hold. They also provide a lot of insight into navigating America more generall speaking. ",
