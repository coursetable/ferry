            "\u00a0This class is amazing. Professor Hepokoski crafts this incredible narrative of the music from 1800-1950. More importantly, it gets you to think about how the canon forms and the problems and limitations therein. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Hepokoski frames Western music history through the lens of intellectual history. I learned as much about philosophy and culture as I did about music. That was truly fantastic. I am not a music major and had no music theory background (although I could read music, which is important), and my TF helped teach me some theory basics, but otherwise that didn't turn out to be important. I was extremely engaged the entire time. ",
            "\u00a0A great look at a lot of familiar composers, pieces, and history in a coherent way ",
            "\u00a0I received a solid foundation, and one could even say framework, for which to approach pieces between 1800 and 1950. This course does a good job with highlighting the larger themes of music history while still including many entertaining anecdotes which put the eccentricities of music history on display. I think I more fully understand the larger context of music history, and have a much deeper appreciation for music during this era. ",
            "\u00a0Thinking critically about music history, the meaning of the undergraduate music sequence, and the relationship between music and culture; how to recognize passages from 20+ hours of music; how to relate passages in music to composer's techniques and history surrounding them. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about the rise and fall of the Western European liberal-humanist institution of art music. Learned historical and analytical details about select pieces chosen from that tradition (as well as from popular and jazz/blues music of the 1920s). ",
            "\u00a0I developed a much greater knowledge of the history of key composers, musical works, and musical trends as well as the non musical contexts which influenced them in the Western classical tradition from the mid-19th century until about the mid-20th century.I gained a greater understanding for how landmark works and figures in Western art music fit together on a larger scale. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a deeper understanding of trends in European Art Music of the 19th and 20th century, more familiarity with the repertoire of the time period, and a better ability to listen to and process form. ",
            "\u00a0MUSI352 is one of my favorite courses I have taken at Yale - although I am not a music major, I gained valuable insights into the history of Western music that are beneficial for me as a musician. What was really great about the course was that music history was contextualized into history as a whole, and it was almost taught as an intellectual history course, which made it accessible for music majors and other majors alike. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so so much! I gained so much knowledge about composers from Beethoven onwards. I learned about the large trends in the history of music and the historical factors that caused changes in aesthetics. I even learned about ballets and costumes and art and literature. This course was fantastic. ",
            "\u00a0A truly impressive account of not only the most influential and highly regarded composers and works of the Western Art Music canon, but a TRULY impressive account of the social, philosophical, economic, and political histories that supported the canon's construction as something that continues to impact our lives. From the perspective of knowledge acquisition, the course outdoes almost every other class I've taken at Yale in terms of both breadth of information covered, and investing enough stakes in each piece of information such that students feel compelled to remember them long after the tests have been taken. In terms of skill acquisition, students are encouraged almost every class session (and certainly every section) to critically examine the narratives we learn and the value-judgements of the historians that construct them. This class is not the story of the canon as told by the canon itself, but rather a higher level, deconstructive look at the many stories that lead to the development of \"canon ideology,\" and how we as students in the 2017, music majors and otherwise, need to interact with this ideology whether we accept its premises or not. In short, I learned so, so, so, so much. ",
            "\u00a0I have gained a grasp of major repertoire from the canon of Western European art music from 1800 onwards. I also now understand the broad historical trends behind these works. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: The music itself is woven into the course in a great way, which makes the material more tangible. Lectures are fascinating.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The narrative gets muddy when dealing with popular music of the 20th century ",
            "\u00a0This lecture is really incredible. It also does a good job of addressing ugly histories of nationalism, racist philosophies, etc. \r\n\r\nI think this was the first year that included blues/jazz/popular music, and the way it was inserted in the syllabus was a little clunky. ",
            "\u00a0The material is great and very engaging, if you can get past Professor Hepokoski's sometimes more than slightly pedantic performance art ",
            "\u00a0This is an amazing course. Every lecture is a masterpiece. Professor Hepokoski is the most engaging prof I've had at Yale so far. In terms of how it might be improved, you might consider making the listening tests weekly. I found the amount of material on the study guides a little overwhelming too, and test weeks were a great source of stress. However, perhaps I just needed to manage my time better. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Lectures were absolutely outstanding! If you miss just one, you are missing out on the class. Professor Hepokoski constructs a really interesting narrative in the class, while providing plenty of concrete details. Weaknesses: I wish we could have more discussion on the content. In section, we learned new material (which was great), but I would love to know what other students think. ",
            "\u00a0Fantastic survey of 19th-20th century music history! Strengths: lecture style, organization, content. No weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0This course is extremely well taught. It's almost impossible to not feel engaged with any given lecture, both due to the inherently interesting nature of the subject material as well as the professor. Although you by no means have to have a background in music to take this course, I could see how someone with no musical experience might find it confusing at times, but it's nothing the professor or TA wouldn't be able to help with. ",
            "\u00a0Some of the strengths of this course are Professor Hepokoski's engaging lectures, accessible and knowledgeable TA's, and its well-structured nature. The only weakness of this course was that there was no music theory prerequisite listed, although 210 and 211 would have been helpful, given some of the material in lecture - however, I do not think that not having this theory background hampered my ability to succeed in the course and learn a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures are simply fantastic. Hepo is a legend. Section was also fantastic. I NEVER like section and I loved this one and even looked forward to it. The course had a lot of work and was very tough. I would say the only thing I'd ask for is to maybe keep all the materials from the whole semester on Canvas instead of taking them down; that way they're always accessible. You can make folders for the different exams if you're worried about people getting confused. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor, TAs, for the most part, the curriculum.\r\nWeaknesses: Listening exams could perhaps be more frequent so that students aren't binging huge chunks of the period we are studying two nights before the quiz, but rather are constantly compelled to listen to the list and keep a more ongoing relationship with the material. JH's primary narrative is \"The Rise and Decline of the Western Art Music (Tradition/Project).\" What he means by the decline, though a major component of the class, remains unclear and disquieting to many of us. Does he mean the specific configuration of historical institutions and ideologies in the 19th century that lead to the development of the canon, or is he saying that all \"classical music\" activity after 1945 is part of a hopeless effort to sustain an already dead corpse? \r\nBig Problem: The fallacies committed in the last few sessions. Suddenly JH introduces a series of historical binaries and drops composers and their lives works into insufficient genre buckets that don't account for the depth or worth of their music. ",
            "\u00a0This class is incredibly well organized. The only thing I could say is that it would be helpful if readings (even an approximation) were posted in advance of the lecture during which their content would be discussed, and if terms and concept sheets could be posted a little earlier relative to the lecture presentation of their material as well. Perhaps if they were broken down so that they could be posted every 2 lectures or so. \r\nOther than that - wow. every lecture class (and probably other formats as well) could learn from this class. There is a HUGE amount of information to process, but as a student I feel very comfortable in the learning environment because I know exactly what the expectations are, and know how to navigate them. That means that I can plan my time in order to learn the material in depth, and also feel like I can navigate the class when life and other responsibilities get stressful. This is hugely important, because it means that the class is a positive learning experience for me even when I can't devote myself to it as much as I would like (or as the class deserves). It is a rare class that keeps you engaged and yearning to learn more even when circumstances make that difficult. This class kept me coming back for more.\r\nI'm also really glad that Fanny Mendelssohn and Clara Schumann were taught. I'm not sure what the class was like previously, but that was a highlight for me. I did find the implicit idea that jazz and blues - the music, in part, of Black America - were responsible for the lamentable death of elite, white Art music rather distasteful. I know that wasn't entirely the point, but there are other ways to recognize the enfranchisement of Black culture and the decline of institutionally supported Art music without painting the former as culpable, even if it was partly responsible. ",
            "\u00a0If there were weekly listening quizzes instead of three in the entire semester, I feel like I would do better on them and also come away knowing more of the material. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Everything. Weaknesses: None. "

            "\u00a0Yes. This course is wonderful, frustrating, magical, and enlightening all at the same time. If you want to grapple with Western art music in the trenches this is the best way to go about it at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0If a music major, yes. ",
            "\u00a0100% take this course if you have ANY interest in the music from Beethoven - Boulez or so. This is the best class I've taken at Yale and has totally changed how I think about classical music. ",
            "\u00a0Everyone should absolutely take this class. I am not a music major and had no prior music theory training. My TF taught me some basics in about 30 minutes and I was fine for the rest of the course. The lecture is incredible. Prof. Hepokoski frames Western music history through the lens of intellectual history. I learned as much about philosophy and culture as I did about music. This is my favorite class I've taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0A great Credit/D class, but you have to take it if you're a music major (at least for now) ",
            "\u00a0I would reccommend this course to any Yale student who is involved in this era of music. The lectures are incredibly engaging the listening will almost always include pieces that most people are not familiar with. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I would like recommend this course to anyone, whether they're an expert listener or someone who just has any interest in music. The one thing is, this course is extremely challenging, so I usually recommend people take it credit/D/Fail, which I probably would have done myself if I didn't need it for my major. But, yes. I would. It's a fantastic course. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class for Hepo!! He is an absolute gem. If you are a non-music major, you might want to take this class Credit/D, as the listening and reading are difficult to keep up with. Overall, if you just want to learn more about Western music history and be able to critically engage with it - and become familiar with lots of music! - take this class! ",
            "\u00a0Most of the other reviews on here have probably already said this: this is an incredible lecture with an even more incredible lecturer. Hepo is AWESOME. If you are already a bit of a music history nerd, you'll love this class. If you don't have much background in music history and/or music theory, this class will most likely overwhelm you. You don't just learn about important composers and their pieces; you learn about the whole tradition of art music and the sociocultural influences at play in the creation and consumption of that music. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to anyone who is looking to learn more about music. While the workload needs to be taken seriously, it is not a class that will control your life. Taking this course could change the way you look at the Western classical tradition, which is quite valuable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely, it is one of the best lectures at Yale. Take it while you still can. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student - it is one of my favorite lectures that I've taken at Yale, and I'm sad that it's over! I think that this course is not only important for music majors to take but for non-music majors who are musicians. As a musician, I learned so much relevant information to my passion. The listening quizzes were also a great way to be exposed to new classical music that I may not have ventured out to listen to on my own. Professor Hepokoski's lectures were amazing and engaging, and both TAs were extremely knowledgeable, helpful, and accessible. Professor Hepokoski does a great job at contextualizing music history into the larger fabric of history and intellectual history, which I really appreciated as a non-music major who is interested in this period of history. ",
            "\u00a0100% ABSOLUTELY take this course NEXT YEAR before Hepo retires. You will learn SO MUCH and just become a more cultured, educated person in the process. Who wouldn't want to learn about music? Who wouldn't want to be able to recognize a piece when you hear it? If you love classical music it, take it. You do need some knowledge of music beforehand--ie how to read music and some baseline music theory will help. The listening exams are tons of work and quite challenging. If you take it Cr/D (which many do) it reduces a lot of the pressure. This has been my favorite course so far at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I have no higher praises to sing for any other academic experience in my life. ",
            "\u00a0I've teared up more times in this class than...well, I've teared up multiple times in this class. Can't say that about any other class at Yale. Take this class if you have any interest in the music covered, even if you don't have classical training or aren't a music major (in that case, strongly consider taking it Credit/D, because it's a lot of -wonderful - work).
