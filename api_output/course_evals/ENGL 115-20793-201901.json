            "\u00a0I learned more about conceptions of hell and how to write about literature. I was able to read several classical texts that I hadn't read before so it allowed me to get an idea of the classical literature landscape. ",
            "\u00a0My writing skills developed and I believe that this will help me in my future goals. My papers are more coherent, flow better, and my ideas are conveyed clearer. ",
            "\u00a0My writing was meaningfully improved, as was the way that I think about literature and writing. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about critical thinking and about learning to actively read. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write a lot better. I also learned more about how to do close reading. The subject matter was also pretty cool and we went in depth about it "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I absolutely loved how Eric didn't make us print out the readings beforehand. Printing can get expensive, so I'm glad he allowed us to use electronic copies since it didn't seem to disrupt the class discussion. I also thought his turn around on giving us feedback was pretty commendable. During some discussions, it seemed like the same two students dominated the entire conversation and made it hard to get a word in edgewise. It would be nice to have some discussions with a higher amount of facilitation so that more students can participate with more ease. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very student engaged. We were expected to contribute to daily discussions and express our ideas which is a great learning process as you can talk through your ideas. I appreciated dissecting the reading materials, especially if I did not understand something, so I would consider the student engagement as a strength of this course. A weakness would be that we did not discuss writing very much. We of course got feedback from papers and were encouraged to meet with our instructor, but it would have been nice to just break down the writing structure a couple more times with an emphasis on what is expected and encouraged in writing styles. ",
            "\u00a0I wish the course had more discussion of literature and less rudimentary workshopping of writing, ",
            "\u00a0It was really engaging and offered students a lot of opportunities to think deeply about the readings and about the world. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the small seminar format. It really helped me get to know the prof better. I also liked how flexible my prof was with papers and deadlines, that was really helpful when I was going through a tough time. I would have liked to have more literature analysis and less writing lessons time in class, but I dont think that would be possible considering there are certain writing requirements the prof has to teach in class. I also liked the peer workshopping for papers "

            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course. Eric is an amazing instructor who really wants you to become better. He is great to talk with regarding paper progress and ideas. He also made class really fun and the readings were very interesting so they didn't pose a burden. I definitely gained skills as a writer and thinker, and this class made me deal with problems that I hadn't considered before. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because it is a greater learning step into improving your writing skills. I think that everyone, skilled or novice writers, should take this course because you can only improve further. ",
            "\u00a0yes, absolutely. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the curriculum was very well put together, with a variety of different literature.  However, there was still many coherent themes that were discussed and woven together. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I feel like it really allows you to develop as a thinker and reader. ",
            "\u00a0I would most definitely recommend this course. The professor is among the best I've seen and has helped me immensely to learn how to become a better academia writer. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!  I would recommend it over 114 as I liked the literature over non fiction. I also really liked my prof (James Eric Ensley) "
