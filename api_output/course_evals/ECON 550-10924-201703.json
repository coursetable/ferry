            "\u00a0Great lectures and lecture notes, very thorough and really makes you understand the material backwards and forwards.  The first part of the course seems deceptively easy. ",
            "\u00a0The course is a great introduction to mathematical probability and statistics.\r\nStrengths:\r\n\r\n1. Great lecture notes  except for one weakness discussed below.  Unfortunately, I only realized how great they were in the last week of the term.  They are so good, that even now after the semester has ended, I find myself going back to reread the lecture notes.\r\n2. Helpful, caring professor\r\n3. Extremely well organized professor.  The most organized professor this semester - by far - and one of the most organized in my academic career.\r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n\r\n1. Lecture notes would benefit from more worked out examples.  Every lecture note should have at least two to three worked out questions, preferably from past examination questions.  I would prefer harder exam questions, if we have been properly provided with examples and guidance on \"normal\" exam questions rather than spending dozens of frustrating hours trying to answer \"normal\" exam questions while having no solutions to guide you only to then seeing similar questions in the exam and failing them.  This was particularly painful and frustrating for me - and I experienced this problem on both the midterm and final.  \r\n2. Past exams are not very helpful without solutions to the past exam questions.\r\n3. Given that the lecture notes are so good it is not in my opinion a good use of class time for Professor Andrews to simply repeat the lecture notes albeit with slightly expanded exposition. I strongly recommend that class time be used for actual problem solving.  The Professor can solve some example problems AND also have students in the class solve problems on the board.  There is a proven educational technique that emphasizes this form of learning for mathematical classes.  I am happy to discuss this further with Professor Andrews, if he desires and I am sure he can deduce the author of this evaluation, as I have previously made this recommendation to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll in all, Professor Andrews is a great professor and a great person who cares about his students.  I feel truly bad that I did not do well in the course, and feel worse because good teachers should be \"rewarded\" with good performance by their students.  If Professor Andrews can implements the three suggestions above summarized below, I believe almost all students no matter their prior background will excel in the course.\r\nSuggestions:\r\n\r\n1.  Include at least three worked out problems (based on past final exam questions) as detailed examples in each chapter of the lecture notes.\r\n2.  Provide solutions to past examinations.\r\n3.  Use class time as a workshop to solve problems related to each lecture note  - professor solves some problems AND students go to the board to solve problems.\r\n4.  The Discussion Forum on Canvas should be required as the method for students to ask questions of the Professor and TA.  By so doing, Professors and TAs do not have to answer the same question multiple times.  Also this will serve as a repository of learning for all students to learn anew, reinforce or revise course material from answers to questions posed by their peers.  Students who are shy can post questions anonymously or submit them to the TA to then submit to the forum in the TA's name.  No student should be allowed to pose a question on the course material outside of the discussion forum on Canvas e.g. via email. "
