The papers were interesting and the course was organized in an effective way.\r\nWeaknesses - the logical decompositions were difficult without formal training in theory construction. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the structure of this course. It was completely discussion based which was very helpful in understanding the different papers and theories we were covering. The small size of the class was also a strength of the course because it really allowed everyone to have in depth conversations about the readings. ",
            "\u00a0I was quite happy with the course. ",
            "\u00a0Great summaries of the field from the Professor. A good balance of teaching and discussion. The literature review was particularly helpful. It would be nice if we could spend some more time on developing skills for such reviews. One way might be to have one assignment be writing the review and the next revising it. "

            "\u00a0As long as there is interest in OT, the course seemed like a great introduction into the field while still being rigorous enough in its approach ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this to students interested in the development and recent trends of organizational theory. "
