Going into this course, I hoped to finally solidify my grasp of (1) the core vocabulary of the discipline and (2) the underlying rules of \"why we do certain things.\" \r\nThe first of these goals was definitely realized!! I feel as if the statistical analyses I've done on past projects have finally \"clicked\" into understanding, and I'm able to see the mistakes I made and understand why I made them. The second goal was mostly realized as well, to a slightly lesser extent. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: I REALLY liked the flipped classroom setup. Having the ability to pause, rewind, and fast-forward through lectures allowed me to take very thorough and comprehensible notes, which through the process of writing and revisiting really solidified the material in my head. Plus, with the expectation that the next class period was for answering questions from the videos, I felt obligated to record questions I had in the margins of my notes--I'm not sure I'd seek answers to these questions after class in a big lecture hall. I don't think I would have realized this learning style was right for me if two second years hadn't highly recommended the course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I really don't think students were prepared for the final project. Yes, we learned all the material, and yes, Jonathan made himself extremely available with office hours in the weeks before the deadline. But I wish more time was spent discussing as a class the expectations of this huge project and perhaps what students could expect when finally getting their hands dirty with an unkempt dataset of their own. I feel like I could have learned a lot from that project, but instead I hastily slapped something together last-minute because even Jonathan had made it seem low-priority. ",
            "\u00a0The strength was the great variety of ways in which to learn the material. The one thing that could be improved is to spend more time going over which statistical test you use when. ",

            "\u00a0* Keep up with the videos!\r\n* Record questions you have as you watch the lectures--being unsure about a little detail can really hamper your understanding of a concept down the line.\r\n* Participate in any and all walk-through examples done in-class on your own computer. They're REALLY helpful.\r\n* Do the class in Minitab instead of R or SAS--I'm so happy I didn't get bogged down with finding tiny script errors, and instead could focus on learning statistics\r\n* Jonathan's office hours can get really busy, so ask questions during and after class as much as you can. Plus, the answers will benefit everyone! ",
