Class was engaging. \r\nOne weakness is that doing the same thing (same structure) can get a bit repetitive at times. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the news presentations and the stories we read. I wish we had been forced to speak more in class! ",
            "\u00a0The course only meets three times per week, including a section, as compared with five days per week for previous levels. Less class time means that we are not able to cover as much material. I wish that we had spent a bit more time on grammar review and general conversation practice. I liked reading Arabic short stories, but I would have enjoyed discussing them more in class. The students in the course had a wide range of Arabic experience and ability, which made it hard for all lessons to be accessible and interesting for everyone. Section was fun, but I think I would prefer spending Fridays with Professor Aziz. "

            "\u00a0Yes, this is a necessary course to take if you want to become very proficient in Arabic. I do feel that my language skills (particularly my ability to read about and discuss current events) have improved this semester. "
