            "\u00a0I learned how to analyze a film by its different components, how to compare it with other mediums and find connections between them. I gained insight on the subject of intermediality and its importance on filmmaking. ",
            "\u00a0Given that I was relatively very inexperienced in the area of studying art as compared to my classmates, this course was valuable for me in really learning the basics of film analysis and art analysis more generally. I learnt about how to observe carefully, how to analyze based on both observation and research. Of course, more technically, I learnt a ton of film language and theory that I did not know about before- although this may not be true for my more experienced classmates. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to study the ways a film uses and refers to other media (mainly painting and theater). I now have a better understanding of what this intermediality does for a film, why it is used, and how to examine the topic further. "

            "\u00a0It's a gut class, but it's the most BORING gut class ever. Unless you like analyzing boring old movies no one has ever seen, do not take this class! ",
            "\u00a0I loved the comfortable open discussion atmosphere of this course. I enjoyed our class format, where we got to watch clips and comment on them together. I also thought the way the course was structured with regards to assignments was great- the weekly reading responses were fun and helped ensure we read the readings (which were very interesting!). I thought it was great that we had prompts for the papers, and also that the prompts still had wide enough scope that we could basically choose what to write about. I think if I have one request, it would be to broaden the scope of the course a little more to look at other types of media, or other cultural contexts. For instance, I love that we studied 'Still Life' and I wish we did more non-Western content. Also, I think it would be super interesting to look more at the use of media that is not explicitly 'artistic' like theater or painting- more commonplace utilitarian media. I thought Cache was a good example of this, but I wish we had more. But of course, these changes should depend on what the professor is most comfortable teaching and talking about. Lastly, I appreciated that it was an integrated course of undergrads and grad students. I really enjoyed listening to the grad students of various backgrounds speak. ",
            "\u00a0I think it would be interesting for the course to broaden its selection of films to represent a greater selection of intermedial elements. We learned a lot about how films use theater, painting, and tableaux vivants, as well as some video, but looking also at media such as music, dance, text, literature etc, could have allowed the course to impart a stronger understanding of intermediality.

            "\u00a0No, it's probably one of the most boring classes you will ever find at Yale ",
            "\u00a0Would definitely recommend! I think it could be enjoyable for students of all backgrounds. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student with a deep interest in film and/or art -- it is probably too niche for a student in another discipline to enjoy taking casually. "
