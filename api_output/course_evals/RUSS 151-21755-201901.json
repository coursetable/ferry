It's really easy to just put off doing Russian homework once your other classes get busy, knowing that Constantine won't really hold you accountable for it and that you probably won't finish everything you were supposed to in class anyway, but I really wish I had felt more pressure to put the time into Russian, because I wanted to but would just consistently let it slip to do work for other classes that I knew would be graded more harshly.
