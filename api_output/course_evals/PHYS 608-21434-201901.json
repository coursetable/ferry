            "\u00a0Professor Read taught this course at a very high level, way beyond the textbook we use. You can learn a lot if you are familiar with the material. However, most of the time, students in his class just don't know what he is talking about since he basically assumed that you already knew the textbook well. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nThe homework problems Prof Read came up with were very interesting. Covered fair amount of material for Grad QM 2 class. Lectures were very rigorous, and questions were answered well.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\nSome sakurai problems are unnecessarily long, not sure why we did them. A few lectures had a lot of hard-to-follow math, which did not seem useful. Homework grading was somewhat slow, which was annoying when reviewing for the midterm/final. Hard parts of the class (i.e. scattering) were shoved towards the end, which made things more difficult. ",
            "\u00a0The materials have much emphasis on the maths than on the intuitions. ",
