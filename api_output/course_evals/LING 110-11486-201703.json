            "\u00a0This is an absolutely fantastic course! I came to Yale wanting to be a linguistic major and Ling 110 absolutely affirmed my plans. \r\n\r\nThe class can be conceptually tricky for some as it requires you to throw out the window almost every single thing you thought you knew - or didn't even know you thought you knew - about language, but I personally found this exhilarating and was able to learn SO much.\r\n\r\nThe workload is totally manageable and the lectures really help you understand that material. The quizzes are reasonable - if you study, go to every lecture, and meet with Jim/the TAs if you are confused, you will be fine. There is also ample opportunity for participation in both lecture and section.\r\n\r\nThe only little improvement would be that we do not really get a lot of feedback on our problem sets, but I think the grading - on quizzes especially - was quite reasonable. ",
            "\u00a0I wish for practice problems that an answer key could be posted each time instead of emailing professors for each question. However, professors were very quick to respond to any questions whether it was through Piazza, email, or office hours. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nstrong, interesting, and engaging lecture\r\nstudents gain thorough understanding of all topics covered\r\nproblem sets supplement lecture learning very well ",
            "\u00a0Jim Wood is a great lecturer, and the problem sets directly relate to the material we cover. The class is very easy and doesn't take up that much time at all, which is a bonus. A bit boring at times but all-in-all a great class to take as your 5th or 6th credit. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course is very well organized. The weekly problem sets and three quizzes ensure that students are reviewing/mastering material, and section provides a great opportunity for review and practice. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength is Professor Wood as a lecturer and a person. He knows how to make the lectures engaging and interesting and he's very accessible to all the students if we have questions or just want to talk about linguistics.\r\nThere were, however, a couple of weaknesses that really got in the way of enjoying this class a lot of the time. Sections were pointless and not very helpful, and my TF wasn't prepared to answer most of the questions. And there were more than a couple of classes that Professor Wood wasn't there for, which was fine, but the substitute lectures from the TF felt like he was just looking at the powerpoints for the first time and hadn't reviewed the material since undergrad. \r\nAs for homework, the readings were really good and enhanced my understanding of the material, but the problem sets were always more annoying and tedious than helpful practice. They often consisted of long, convoluted problems that could be solved easily if they could be done handwritten, but instead we had to type in weird and annoying formats, as well as needlessly retype all the excessively long questions into our answers. For multiple homeworks, the questions were so confusing that Professor Wood had to make an entire FAQ page just to complete one assignment.\r\nThe last weak point for me was how arbitrarily the assignments and quizzes were graded. For some reason, all the homeworks were out of 5 points, so if you did a great job but had a couple small mistakes that would normally warrant an A-, you would probably end up with a 4/5 which is an 80%. And lastly, grades were often very late to come back to us which left us with very little feedback on how to improve.\r\nAlso, 10% of the final grade is based on participation, which is a little strange for a good-sized lecture like this one. ",
            "\u00a0The course was well taught and formatted well. However, feedback on homeworks and quizzes was always quite behind, so I never really felt prepared for the next assignment or quiz. In addition, the instructors rarely posted answer keys and were not very helpful in general with feedback. Grading of the overall course was not very transparent. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were clear and concise. The course would benefit if only Jim Wood taught it. ",
            "\u00a0Well-designed course with interesting lectures and problem sets that felt relevant to material covered in class and assessed on quizzes. Clarity, consistency, and transparency of homework grading could be improved. Often homework would show only a few comments with more points taken off than the comments seemed to reflect. Homework grades often felt inconsistent with level of understanding and performance on quizzes. This problem was partially fixed with the curving of the homework grades to 4.6 instead of 5 but could still be improved to better reflect performance in the class and level of understanding of the content. ",
            "\u00a0Jim Wood is a great lecturer! At times, especially in the later portions of the course, I felt that he went a little too fast to take notes effectively, but the lecture slides posted were more than enough to study from. I also found it hard to get full credit on the psets for the first few weeks of the course. If you know LaTeX, that may help boost your grade. But overall, the course was enjoyable and that was all i was hoping for. NOT a gut class if you dont have the best QR skills - dont be fooled. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very well organized, in terms of structure and having all of the materials available online. One weakness was that it often took a long time for grades to get back to us. ",
            "\u00a0It provides a good introduction to each topic, and the transition between topics is seamless. Lessons and sections were structured well and exams were fair. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting topic, very organized class and structure, Professor Wood makes the class fun and engaging, there is one pset a week which is pretty nice in my opinion, the TA's are always willing to help as well as Professor Wood\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The psets are due every Tuesday which was not the best because we sometimes learned everything we needed to know to do the pset right before it is due, the homeworks did not always directly translate to what we did in class, there is a required section to this class that meets every week ",
            "\u00a0This class was unorganized. We were not assigned sections until late in the semester, and our homework was returned very late (the last homework was returned a couple of weeks after the final exam). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the topics and teachers, they were all excellent. The topics covered were interesting and well-reviewed by the homeworks and exams. I really liked the 3  quiz format and I enjoyed section. One small weakness was that I got a bit lost at the end with the merge/move/agree syntax stuff. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Wood is a great professor who puts a lot of effort into making his lectures interesting.  The problem-sets for this course were (for the most part) manageable and contributed to my understanding of the course content. ",
            "\u00a0Overall a very good survey course. I would have preferred less of a focus on phonetics and phonology, but I know other students felt differently, and I think it's a matter of preference. Sections were good and helpful, grading was fair. ",
            "\u00a0It is a good amount of material, but if it doesn't come naturally to you then you don't always get the underlying conceptual stuff until towards the end of the class. The homeworks made it difficult to do well but this was changed when the grade distribution was seen to be quite low. The instructor Prof. Wood is very good and does make the class fun. ",

            "\u00a0If you are interested in linguistics, yes, for sure. linguistics is an important field that most of us dont get exposure to in high school so it is nice to learn something about it now even if you dont go on to major in it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!!! Every single person should be required to take this course. Most people live their entire lives with SO many incorrect linguistic notions that lead us to make damaging, misguided judgements of others - taking this class will forever change your perception of language. Beyond this, the phonetics, phonology, morphology, and syntax units are very well taught and absolutely fascinating. ",

            "\u00a0If you've ever had an interest in language, how it comes to be, and how we acquire it, you should definitely take this course! You'll learn a lot through interesting lectures and problem sets. ",

            "\u00a0Yes. If you're interested in linguistics, it's well worth it. It's an excellent overview, and, despite being a lecture course, is quite interactive. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, there is definitely a learning curve in the morphology unit, but then it just becomes more and more interesting! Makes you think about something we do everyday in a whole new way! ",
            "\u00a0This course is for people that don't know if they'd be interested in linguistics and want a broad introduction to the four main areas of the field (phonetics, phonology, morphology, and syntax). If you're interested in other areas of linguistics (semantics, pragmatics, psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics, etc) this is not the class for you. I definitely learned a lot of cool stuff and I changed the way I think about language, but it didn't particularly make me want to take many more classes in the field. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you are really interested in linguistics - you will get a great introduction to the field. However, be prepared for somewhat arbitrary grading and delayed feedback. ",

            "\u00a0I definitely recommend this course--it's fascinating and it gave me an entirely new perspective on language and an appreciation for the languages I speak. This course helped me understand linguistic phenomena I'd noticed vaguely throughout my life. Learning about linguistic rules was particularly interesting--I learned a lot about how we follow rules in language without ever explicitly learning them. The course's connections to themes of linguistic discrimination were especially interesting and made the course particularly relevant to the real world. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone interested in how language works. However, the first two weeks of the course are a bit misleading - the first two weeks cover the assumptions made in the field of linguistics and a little bit about socio linguistics, while the remainder of the course is more based in logical thinking and problem-solving. I dont have the greatest QR-brain, so I struggled a little bit learning how to work through phonology problems and syntax rules. My difficulties werent big enough to warrant going to office hours though (even though I did have to ask a Linguistics major friend for some help occasionally), and I did well in the class overall. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to another student interested in gaining a basic knowledge of the field of linguistics. Its a fun class, but requires a fair amount of work and dedication. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely. I came into the class only intending to fulfil my SO requirement and left with so much more. The work is not too time-consuming and the material is absolutely fascinating. Jim has obviously perfected this class over the years and his delivery is wonderful -- take it even if this will be the only linguistics class you will ever take at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0If you are really interested in learning about linguistics, then you'll like this class. It's worth noting that there's a lot of detailed memorization work about phonology and phonetics, so if you're an upperclassman looking for an easy but interesting intro class, this probably isn't your best bet because it does get kind of dense and complicated. But overall, if you are into the material, it's worth taking! You do learn a lot, and having shopped a few classes in the linguistics department, Jim Wood is definitely a better instructor than most. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course -- not too too hard, but also very informative and applicable to everyday life. ",
            "\u00a0Great class, not a ton of work (neither quizzes nor psets were bad). As a CS major, this was my favorite class of the semester, and one of my favorite of all time. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to people who are interested in the workings behind language and the system people follow when speaking a language. To those who enjoy learning new languages, this focuses more on the mechanics of language. Ths is a class that requires you to really study and understand the concepts on your time out of class. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course because of the lack of organization. ",
            "\u00a0The workload is pretty light, so there isn't much to worry about there. And since it's an introductroy class, you get to learn the basics of linguistics without going too deep into it. Take if you have a little interest in the field. If you already know some linguistics already then you might want to skip this; not because you won't learn anything but because there's not much application in class. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend Intro Linguistics. It's such a fun class, and the professor and all teaching staff are amazing. It's very approachable and if you don't like one section (for me this was syntax, for my friend phonetics) you will probably really like a different one (for me phonetics, my friend syntax). It's really fun to notice phenomena in everyday life and IPA is a seriously useful tool. I'm definitely going to take more linguistics classes! Also it's true, it's great for people with CS minds. ",
            "\u00a0I would strongly recommend taking this course, especially if you have an interest in linguistics or one of its closely-related fields (psychology, computer science, etc.).  It covers four different areas within the field of linguistics linguistics (phonetics, phonology, morphology, and syntax); although you might not find all of these topics to be equally interesting, the course moves at a brisk enough pace that you will never stay on any one topic for too long. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this class but be prepared to spend extra time if this material does not come to you easily. I also recommend going to lecture because Prof. Wood tries to make sure that you understand the information after going to class. This is helpful so you don't have to cram and try to learn everything by yourself. ",

I took this course just to dip my toe in to linguistics and am very satisfied. But I have seen it become busywork for those who weren't all that interested in the material. "
