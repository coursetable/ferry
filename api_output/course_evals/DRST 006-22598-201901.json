            "\u00a0I have learned how to examine modern historians and political philosophers. My writing and class participation have both improved. I have learned to read dense texts quickly for meaning. ",
            "\u00a0A good understanding of the trajectory of modern political thought ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think through many central themes related to the study of political philosophy, such as political morality in relation to the state, etc. I also learned how to improve my writing and close read passages. ",
            "\u00a0DS historical and political though was a really great course, especially with Professor Nakhimovsky. The way he led discussion during seminars and the questions he asked greatly changed the way I both read and understand texts. I was always pushed to reconsider arguments and try to see the deeper questions that authors of texts may be contending with. ",
            "\u00a0I was able to think critically about historical and political thought. One of the main takeaways from this course was learning how to interpret the writings of others', synthesise them with my own judgements and present an argument with clarity. I think the course has helped me to become more mindful about writing with clarity and efficiency. ",
            "\u00a0I got a really solid foundation of understanding of modern political philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0More than anything else, H&P provided an in-depth case study of a considerable problem (how people should coexist) and centuries' attempts to answer it. You'll learn a good deal of history along the way, and become uncomfortably familiar with Social Contract Theory, but will learn most from pondering the evolution of ideas. It's an incredible look at how disciplines advance, and what *you* might do to make them advance. "

            "\u00a0I found the class very strong and engaging. The material was interesting and I did the readings. Sometimes the reading is a lot but that is hard to avoid. The lectures can sometimes be a little unneeded. The seminars are great. ",
            "\u00a0The spring semester syllabus is excellent. I prefer history to political theory so I thought I wouldn't enjoy this semester as the fall, but these texts are so fascinating, and relevant, that I probably ended up finding more intellectual stimulation out of it. I do wish we had more historical context to guide us. I understand that there isn't enough time for everything, but I feel like there should be clear introductions to the historical events of each writers time period either in lecture or seminar. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Seminars were very fulfilling and rewarding. The lectures helped put readings in context. The syllabus was coherent and I wish it could be expanded to include more thinkers. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I personally thought the final was a bit deceptive with the quote ID's. Compared to Literature and Philosophy, which did not try purposely deceiving the students, the H&P quotes on the final were quite difficult and not conducive to DS learning. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - the breadth of texts, the way the texts fit together and could be compared, the manner of dealing with them by somehow covering not only the most important themes but also complexities and smaller details. ",
            "\u00a0As with all DS courses, I think the breadth of works that we read is a double-edged sword. While I really appreciate its ability to give me a bird's eye view of the whole progression of western historical and political thought, I also found that I was unable to really comprehensively understand the specific thoughts of each writer simply because we had to distil entire systems and schools of thought within two sections each week. Sometimes I felt as though I didn't really understand the text before we moved on (because it was always a trade-off between finishing the copious amounts of reading within the short period of time we had, or really slowing down and understanding the text slowly). Nevertheless, I think finals was really really helpful in getting me to re-read and re-think through the works we read in the entire semester at a slower pace. Things became more understandable when I slowed down and thought things through again during reading week. ",
            "\u00a0I found it really helpful to have a peer give their prepared starter to begin the discussion in every seminar. It was also great to have discussion questions emailed to us before we did the readings because it guided me to consider certain aspects of the readings - and the reading responses were useful in allowing me to express some of my thoughts before class. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the second half of this semester's readings. Nietzsche, Du Bois, and Arendt are fantastic and complex thinkers. I'm so glad that they were included in the curriculum, and that we got to see the development of political thought from strict, social contract discourses (those of Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau) to more radical thinkers.\r\n\r\nI was a little disappointed by the time we spent on the Federalist Papers. We only got one seminar of discussion for them. I feel they should either be upgraded to a full week of discussion, or removed from the curriculum entirely. Having such a forced, curtailed talk over them was worse, in my opinion, than not talking about them at all. ",
            "\u00a0The reading pace, though intense, isn't too fast to muddy comprehension. Though some works (like Nietzsche and Marx) were only afforded enough coverage to make you understand how much you don't understand, these were the exceptions. Most works elegantly conveyed fairly simple contributions to political science, which could be understood in context of the others, greatly easing comprehension.\r\nYou should know that there is much more politics than history. The major historical events  the Reformation, the Glorious Revolution, the French Revolution were only ever covered incidentally, meaning that though you'll learn about the context and ideological aftermath, the historical details of these events may remain fuzzy without independent research.

            "\u00a0Yes, Directed Studies provides a great foundation in the humanities. Any first-year interested in the humanities should take. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Don't drop after fall semester unless you're absolutely certain you're no longer interested in the texts; going full circle is so rewarding! Professor Nakhimovsky is a good teacher to have as well. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, I loved it. I think sacrificing a degree of depth for the sheer breadth of texts and opportunity to see the development of centuries of thought is worth it. The texts are also incredibly relevant today; while I expected to be able to draw comparisons, the number of direct connections we made during seminars really surprised me. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend DS as a whole to any student. It's a wonderful foundation to have and definitely forces you to grow by pushing your boundaries. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to other students! ",
            "\u00a0If you've taken DS the first semester and you're struggling about whether or not to jump on board for the second, I absolutely recommend that you do, especially if you have Professor Nakhimovsky for H/P. He's a very thoughtful and intelligent person to have during seminars. He would let the students converse and try to find solutions to internally posed problems, but jump in at critical times to offer a certain trajectory we could take in analyzing a thinker, or suggest a separate way of looking at something, or even change the topic altogether to an adjacent topic.\r\n\r\nI thought feedback for essays was clear, and Professor Nakhimovsky offered a good number of office hours to talk about the papers or other topics brought up in class. The reading responses he suggested we do online were a really good study aid for finals. It was nice to look back and see how everyone's thinking progressed from the beginning of the semester to the end. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Though I wouldn't have guessed it, H&P became my favorite section of spring DS. It integrates marvelously with the Philosophy and Literature, and provides something really unique: a thorough tracing of the recent history of western civilization. You don't just study ideas. You study how those ideas were born, and how they might die. The hundreds of hours of reading awakens you to the timescale of the human race, and lends some perspective to the present moment. "
