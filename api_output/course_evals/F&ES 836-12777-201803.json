Given the close ties between agrarian studies, political theory, history of globalization, and the recent past of conservation and development efforts. Insights weren't necessarily novel, but articulated in a setting with unifying features and narratives which helped bring things together that I had observed throughout my academic career. ",

This course provided a wonderful opportunity to read a lot of great material and discuss with a host of interesting people. The final paper also gave me an opportunity to try writing a research paper in the style of anthropology, a style I have read a lot but not tried writing before. ",

            "\u00a0This course provided me with a clear framework to understand the evolution of agrarian societies in relation with the formation of the state. Thanks to its interdisciplinary approach, the course structure gave me a wider understanding of how agrarianism has deeply shaped the way in which societies work. ",

This class builds on social theories from Marx, Foucault, Scott and others to paint a global picture of people and land. This is an intense, upper-level graduate course with large amounts of reading and complex discussions. ",

            "\u00a0I was expecting it to be a bit more geared towards people not as familiar with the agrarian studies. Because discussion sections are not focused on only the week's readings and lecture it requires students to have personal experience and research they are drawing on to contribute. This lead to a high level of discussion but difficult for all to engage. ",

At first I thought the reflections would be mostly centered in questioning development from an anthropological point of view. However, the weekly readings complemented that with other political, economical, sociological and ethnographic views. ",

Without having a background in social theories, political ecology, and environmental history, I struggled to follow all the lectures and discussion. However, if you want to be a part of this field, this a must-take course and will be a rapid introduction. Just be prepared to work diligently. ",

            "\u00a0More attention can be put when developing the syllabus in making sure that the connecting thread between one class and the other leads the student to see things as a process. In some cases, I had the impression that the weekly readings were completely unrelated to the topic of the class, as well as to the rest of the material in the course. \r\nSince it is a heavy-reading class - and not all students can afford to buy all the books every week - I would strongly advise to have a repository of online copies of the weekly readings. \r\nAlso, during the discussion section a better discussion structure would be appreciated. Although there was richness in everything that we discussed, at times it proved difficult for me to express my reflections or questions in an arena where many questions were bouncing all around. ",

            "\u00a0The strengths were the lectures and the excellence of the professors--they are the experts in their field and offer an unprecedented academic experience. I think students need to know beforehand what they are getting into--the first lecture should be a quick and clear overview of important theories and pieces of history that must be understood as the foundation of the course. The professors didn't do this, and I found myself swimming in very unfamiliar waters for most of the class. I eventually caught up, but it took a lot of grasping on my own. This made for participating in the discussions--an intimidating process--quite difficult. ",

            "\u00a0If you can participate in a discussion group with students coming from other schools, you can have the guarantee that it will be fun and challenging, but also very rewarding. \r\nAlthough the amount of pages to read every week is high, don't be discouraged if you finish the book with many questions. Almost all of them will be answered during the lectures or in the discussion group. \r\nMy last advice would be arrive to the class with a region to focus your work on. Since the region-focus is not exclusive to one part of the world, it resulted to be very helpful for me to know beforehand that I could take more advantage from the readings and lectures with a Latin America focus.

It is a high-level intellectual course, but this is Yale and that's what you are doing here. This is a must for all students interested in being a more well-rounded arbiter of the human systems connected to the earth--this class is a history of land, food, people, and relations. ",
