            "\u00a0This class introduced us to basic techniques in ecological field research, both through reading reports and practicing the methods ourselves. The amount of research papers we read also helped us become more familiar with reading scientific texts, which is a good trait to have. It is a good introduction to a variety of questions and topics of interest in the ecological community. ",
            "\u00a0The three units sometimes felt like they didn't connect very well to each other (agroecology, forestry, and urban ecology), but by the end I felt like I had a good overview of what field ecology looks like, both from an academic and field perspective. ",
            "\u00a0This class gives you field experience, technical forestry research skills, and lots of  studies/scientific paper readings. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how landscapes developed over time and for what reasons, as well as what plants might indicate about a certain area. I found myself becoming a lot more aware of the native and non-native species around the New England area, and feel like I have a deeper understanding of why certain areas are inhabited the way they are. Furthermore, I gained a lot of knowledge of how to identify plants in the New England area, and their growing habits (why forests are composed the way they are). ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the different agricultural and farming methods that different farmers used and how that affects the system of that farm as a whole. I also learned a lot about trees and how to ID a lot of different trees in the northeast. I gained a lot of knowledge of urban ecology as well. I honestly learned a lot about the environment, different issues that have to do with the environment in general, and the new technologies and studies emerging within the field. I also learned how to conduct field research which was really interesting. ",
            "\u00a0This course was pretty much a survey of field research fundamentals. The units are loosely focused on sustainability but there isn't really a clear narrative to the class. You learn a lot about different field research methods and learn about how papers get published and experiments get funded. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me the opportunity to grapple with the challenges of doing science in the field. I learned how to collect data in a variety of environments and examine that data in the context of other scientific research, land use history, and many other factors. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to do certain field tests such as set pitfall traps and use appropriate tools. I also learned about how to read ecological journals and write lab reports like an ecological journal would be formatted. I also learned how to cross compare different studies and apply it to the field work we were doing in class. "

            "\u00a0The Thursday labs were obviously the highlight of the course. Getting to visit forests and farms was fun, and the overnight trip to the Yale Myers Forest was awesome as well. Professor Freidenburg is a very nice and supportive professor, and Andis was a great TF. Tuesday discussions often tended to feel slow, though, because most of us weren't used to speaking about scientific papers, and many of them felt somewhat repetitive. Writing the lab reports was frustrating as well, because we didn't really have enough data to make strong conclusions, and feedback tended to be slow, so that the second lab report was turned in before the first one, without the help of comments and suggestions. I think adding a step where, for the first report at least, you turn in a rough draft before the final draft would help our understanding of writing the reports. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - the field trips are so much fun, especially if you get to know the people in your class. Kealoha is so kind and genuinely cares so much about the topics we study. As someone who's not a STEM major, I felt able to keep up and learn quite about about field ecology along the way.\r\nWeaknesses - the Tuesday discussion sections are LONG. It's really hard to keep up a discussion especially when many people in the class didn't have a ton of experience in this field, so there was very little unique contribution and little incentive to contribute in an interesting way. Perhaps it would be helpful if the professor picked a student to present on the weeks readings and then lead the discussion so that one week we could research the readings more deeply and be more engaged by our classmates. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: definitely all of the field experiences every Thursday. I looked forward to leaving campus and getting to be surrounded by nature every week. The small class size allowed for great connections to form between the students, Kealoha, and Andis (the TA). The content is objectively interesting and very relevant in a surprisingly interdisciplinary way. \r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes class discussions were a little boring because everyone mainly agreed on things so there wasnt much to discuss besides what each person found interesting about the papers. ",
            "\u00a0The hands-on field aspect is definitely a strength, as well as the field locations visited. I found myself being very engaged with the field work, but sometimes losing the conversation in the classroom. While it was easy to tie the research we were doing to the assigned readings, I found it difficult to have an engaging conversation about the homework. The overnight trip was also a big strength; the work was helpful, and having extended time over the weekend to collect data was both fun and academic. ",
            "\u00a0The days when we go out to the field are great! It's really fun and really interesting. The discussions are interesting, but they can also be a little hard to jump into because they're very specific about papers. It can be a little intimidating if you don't know a lot about ecology in general. The urban ecology project was interesting, but the lab reports were stressful and somewhat difficult. ",
            "\u00a0I think the lab days are a huge strength for this course. Its great to get away from campus and be outdoors and do some pretty interesting experiments. The trip to Yale Myers forest was also a great experience. I think the lecture days moved a bit slowly sometimes because it was largely discussing the papers we had read over the weekend. Sometimes the ecological concepts in the papers were a bit over our heads and so the discussion was a bit slow. I think a bit more lecturing from Kealoha on the concepts in each paper could be valuable for helping the discussion along. ",
            "\u00a0Engaging in field work almost every week was a huge strength of this course. Doing field work was challenging and rewarding. This class challenged me in a way that was totally different than any other science class I've taken; instead of being challenged by having to memorize lots of definitions and equations, this class challenged me by teaching me to analyze how myriad factors interact to shape the data that you collect in the field. \r\n\r\nThe weekly lecture/discussion periods could be improved; we usually just spent the 75 minute period having an unstructured discussion of a few scientific journal articles. Sometimes, these open-ended discussions ended up being really interesting, but in they could feel a bit unproductive. I was sort of unsure what I was supposed to be getting out of the class -- knowledge about concepts related to sustainability (which I only gained a bit of), or knowledge about how to collect and interpret data in the field (which I gained a lot of). The structure/expectations of the class were also a little unclear at times. In particular, it took a while to figure out what exactly this class was looking for in its lab reports. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths was the applicability of what we were learning to the field work and being able to go off campus and do more hands-on learning. \r\n\r\nThe weaknesses were that the assignments and labs seemed arbitrary and I felt less prepared to do the assignments from what we were doing in class and the level of instruction we were given. \r\nI feel like there could be a better rubric created and examples made available so that students better understand the expectations of the labs. Additionally, some of the labs seemed to require statistics, even though statistics wasn't a prerequisite for the course. Something that would be really helpful would be if rough drafts of the labs were due prior to the final deadline, so that the TA could give feedback and students could have more clarity about the report. "

            "\u00a0Yes, overall this was a fun class. Someone that enjoys being outside or that has even a remote interest in ecology would enjoy this as well. It's accessible to anyone, regardless of their academic background. Tuesday sections aren't always so engaging and lab reports can feel like a lot, but it's still worth it. ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested in having a good time outside and learning about ecology on a pretty basic level, then yes!!! The field trips do take up a good chunk of your week, but Kealoha brings snacks and tree identification is actually pretty fun. ",
            "\u00a0Would definitely recommend! Super hands on, Kealoha is great, interesting material, low workload ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you have a strong interest in plants and landscapes. The four hour days may seem a little long if you aren't completely engaged, but either way this course is an excellent way to gain a good array of knowledge in all of the units studied. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student if you really want something different! It was a really cool course because you get to go off campus and do something really interesting every week. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, especially if Kealoha is teaching it. She and Andis were a great team to teach this course. They were a great resource out in the field for labs and just generally great people to talk to about environmental and scientific issues. This an awesome science credit for people who want to get out away from campus and do experiments that are approachable for non-STEM people. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student; it gives the invaluable opportunity to experience working in the field. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course because the course material was really interesting and the field aspect was really important and helped me apply what I was learning to the landscape around me, even in New Haven. Additionally, it takes you off campus which is refreshing. "
