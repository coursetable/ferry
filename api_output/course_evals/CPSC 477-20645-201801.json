Unfortunately, a bunch of material on psets is available online, and sometimes they're ripped straight from the tutorial. Overall, I'm pretty disappointed in the quality of this course. ",

Drago moves through the slides very quickly and by the end of every class I would feel like I had a lot of information thrown at me without any clear structure. \r\n\r\nDrago would focus more on linguistics in lecture rather than the computational tasks needed for the psets. Pset 4 in particular was very difficult: we were asked to use Tensorflow and train a neural network without any real direction. \r\n\r\nMy other complaint was with the overall disorganization in the class. We would randomly move between lecture slides out of order. Piazza was a mess of questions and notes. And TAs would randomly cancel or reschedule office hours. The class could have really benefited from a Google Calendar and a simple, clear reading-list. ",

The slides were the longest that I have seen in any Yale course.\r\n\r\nHowever, the instructor took an encyclopedic approach to NLP, going so far as to give the slides numerical titles that impeded understanding. This approach made it more difficult to understand the connections between the lectures. This encyclopedic approach also led the instructor to fairly equally weight the different parts of his encyclopedia. The result was that too much time was spent on simpler topics such as Bayes theorem and not enough time was spent on the more complex parts of the course. ",

The lectures had a lot of key words that sound pretty similar, and its never really clear what is testable material, so the midterm was rough, but everyone in the class is in the same boat.\r\nThe second half of the courses problem sets were just lazy. It was a fill-in-the-blank coding problem, so you never really knew the full scope of the algorithm, and also one of the problem sets was literally a pytorch tutorial. These problem sets would have been much better if they had expanded on or changed that tutorial.\r\nOverall, the course is really ambitious in its scope and you come away from it knowing, at least, what is possible and what resources you should seek out. I dont know if you actually learn any tangible skills, which is disappointing given that we actually did have coding problem sets. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very well structured into different sections, and covered a range of material, so had a very large width of material. Went deeper into specific topics in homeworks. Material was very well presented by Professor Drago. ",

            "\u00a0The strength of this course is that Professor Drago is very knowledgeable about his field.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of the course is that in the latter half of the course, you hardly learn anything from the problem sets because a lot of the functions you use are imported. I had little idea about what exactly was going on in my code. The latter half of assignments were as if I was filling in the blanks of staff-created code. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting subject material, Drago puts together a good syllabus\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures aren't always the most engaging, some problem sets were pretty random and were hard but not in a way that I learned much ",
            "\u00a0Both this and AI should be changed pretty significantly, I think. It's a frustrating mix of highly theoretical lectures with 5 topics we never touch on a problem set for every one that we do. The problem with this is that the lectures are taught so quickly with no opportunity to check understanding.\r\nI know it's a survey course, that doesn't mean you should sprint through material. Choose a few simple versions of things and teach the algorithm, give us problems or written problem sets to check understanding, and then give us the technical problem set where we do some code relating to either that algorithm or a more complicated version of the same idea. As is, stuff like the EM algorithm just wizzes past, with the lecture outlining the algorithm and then absolutely no attempt made (not even on either exam) to give anyone an oppotunity to play with it enough to understand it.\r\n\r\nThe problem sets are also exceptionally lazy. I should not be able to accidently find the code to complete an assaignment by googling pytorch tutorials. Pacman in AI was a great example of using other peoples code well, and Othello was about equally good. Basically all the NLP problem sets were immensley frustrating until I accidently found the place it was taken from, after which they were dissappointing. \r\nIt should not be a TA's responsibility to write something as complicated as these problem sets tend to be. Some time should be invested as these courses are improved and developed into writing some specific manageable problems sets for these classes. This will seem more feasible if we give up always doing some incredible cutting edge version of a technique, and instead focus on an example that is simple enough that 90% of the code does not need to be written for us to be able to do it. ",
            "\u00a0The material was very interesting, although sometimes lecture felt a bit too fast paced. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course include that it is quite resourceful. All the lecture slides are online and the TAs are pretty helpful for the homework assignments. On the other hand, I felt like the lecture glossed over some complex topics and I felt like I had to learn them independently. It would have been great if we spent more time on certain topics instead of focusing on covering as many topics as possible. ",
            "\u00a0The class covered many interesting topics and I got exposure to topics I did not know about previously. However, the class also covered TOO many topics, so I feel like I did not have a solid grip on any one topic. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: covered a lot of aspects of NLP\r\nWeakness: knowledge is highly scattered and poorly organized ",
            "\u00a0I think the strengths were the topics covered, which were interesting, and the homeworks, especially the first 3. However I think the lectures were a weak point, where the organization was confusing and too many topics were attempted to be covered. ",
            "\u00a0I wish that the slides were more thorough. Also, the problem sets were not original which was a little frustrating. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: as promised, it provides a survey of topics in the field of NLP\r\nWeaknesses: lacks depth and rigor; it's not as good as its equivalents at Stanford and Berkeley ",
            "\u00a0Great course, super interesting topics that are presented in a way that make them sufficiently challenging to be interesting but also accessible. I'd say the weaknesses could come from the expanse of topics, that at some point I got a little lost because we did a 100 things. That may just be inherent in a survey course though. One improvement for me would be the exams, because I felt the midterm wasn't a great measure of my knowledge in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Challenging course material. Drago is very skilled at NLP and gave great insights to the field.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Psets were much harder than the content covered in class. Spending more time to discuss coding implementation in class would have helped. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the speed at which material was covered. This was an overview course, and I believe that I did get a decent overview of the field. However, the homework assignment varied wildly in quality. At times they were really interesting, but some of them taught almost nothing and required endless debugging more than anything else. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nLots of pretty interesting material. Psets were very cool and satisfying. Teaching staff was very responsive and on top of things. Material was well organized. Drago is very nice and enthusiastic!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n--Structure / use of lecture time could have been better. It often seemed like we spent a long time just going over vocabulary or repeating very simple concepts, then there would be only 1 slide on some really complicated but very important idea. As a result, I didn't feel like I learned very much from the lecture: much of the time I was bored and easily distracted, then when some genuinely new / challenging material come up, we didn't give it nearly enough attention so I failed to learn it at all. Parts of the class seemed less like a class teaching you NLP, and more like an advertisement for a class teaching you NLP. That is to say, it sometimes felt like we were getting a \"crash course\" for a whole semester. Maybe that just means there was too much material to cover it all in depth-- I'm not sure.\r\n--For the love of God, put titles in filenames of the slideshows.\r\n--This will sound like a joke but it is not. Please believe me: the lighting in that room is corrosive to focus. I was falling asleep even on 9 hours of sleep, EVEN during the final when I really needed to pay attention. Something about that place just saps your energy completely. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Excellent job touching in some detail on all major topics, and drawing connections between. Good balance of theory and application (generally more application). Problem sets cool and appropriately difficult.\r\nImprovements: the sentiment analysis pset involved recursive neural nets, which were really hard, but awesome once you got it. More help on this pset. The final pset was a little cookie-cutter of PyTorch machine translation. Professor could take more questions in class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: PSETs were interesting but really relied on specific applications.\r\nWeaknesses: PSETs relied too much on specific lines of code, lectures did not really have to do with PSETs. ",
            "\u00a0psets leave you out to dry. You better be ready for some serious confusion. I liked the fact that it was a survey course -- you get to learn a bunch of stuff about the subject. You can specialize later! ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are the organized way in which content is presented. The weeknesses are the lecture slides are not always super detailed and it can be hard to follow along with the pace of the class. "

That said, there is plenty of neat linguistics information to be learned through the year. \r\n\r\nAlso, this course is a SURVEY, so there will be lots of breadth over many NLP topics but very little depth in any of them, which is exactly what Drago tells you at the beginning of the term.

I thought the later 2 psets were badly constructed in a way that I didn't learn much. ",

I come to this class already knowing most of the things (from other math, statistics, and machine learning courses) that it intends to teach, and I'm still constantly struggling to guess what the correct line or two of missing code is in a problem set.
