            "\u00a0I learned a ton about reading scientific papers and dissecting their figures/findings in particular. I also developed my own scientific writing and analysis skills. ",

            "\u00a0I learnt how to interpret scientific journals to an entire new level. \r\nIt really helped me and was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale - it really helped me with senior research too ",
            "\u00a0How to extract from a paper the most important information from experiments. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read papers critically and analyze them. I also learned a lot about how to write succinctly about summarizing papers. ",

            "\u00a0It was great practice reading journal articles in depth every week. ",
            "\u00a0This class focuses on the cytoskeleton and several cytoskeletal proteins. You gain a lot of insight and understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that govern many of the processes that you learn about in the lower level bio courses. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: The professor is amazing, she's extremely knowledgeable and kind. The discussions are very interesting because everyone cares about the topics. One of the best classes I've taken. Assignments and grading are very fair. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: can't really think of one. Maybe more discussion? Nothing really. ",

            "\u00a0Absolutely. Interesting, informative, helpful, chill class for MCDB seniors. You will learn a lot and will end up feeling confident about reading primary literature. Take it. ",

            "\u00a0Definitely! It's great to be able to take an MCDB seminar, especially because most MCDB classes are lecture style. This was a good way to engage with the primary literature. Dean C is great! "
