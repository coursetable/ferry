            "\u00a0This course covers a really wide range of topics, from inventory design to landscape-level planning. We learned about how land managers and other professionals in various contexts think about planning. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to analyze and make sense of inventory data.  I learned about many common issues facing forest managers.  I learned some different techniques for planning forest management in the long term. ",
            "\u00a0Forest modeling, a recap of forest mensuration and statistics, practical forest management examples, a variety of forest tools, and understanding of forest management options in the Northern Rockies. ",
            "\u00a0I feel that I gained a sense of understanding of the technical tools that go into a forest manager's box. Inventory analysis, including evaluating the usefulness of an inventory, and having some basic frameworks to consider modeling forest data were both huge gaps missing from my education here, and I am glad that this class has helped to address these gaps at least partially. ",
            "\u00a0We developed skills that allow us to analyze forest inventories and determine the quality of data that is used to model forest growth.  In addition, we gained practical skills in creating forest models under various software platforms. "

        [
            "\u00a0I wasn't really sure what to expect from this class so it's hard to say! I do think that in the end we were exposed to varying perspectives on land management, which I did hope would be included. We spent more time on modeling than I expected, but I know Joe is planning to change that in the future. ",
            "\u00a0Pretty well! ",
            "\u00a0Exceeded. A great class that balanced practical concepts and field work with professional experiences. ",
            "\u00a0I came into this class after speaking up about the original capstone, a speaker seminar where MF students invited experts to come and present about their work. I felt that this would be too similar to the rest of my experiences at FES, where I have invested considerable time and energy inviting and booking speaker events. I am pleased that this class arrived to help me get what I wanted from a capstone; an opportunity to fill in some of my gaps when it comes to technical aspects of landscape-scale land management and planning. ",
            "\u00a0This class seemed to fill in some of the holes in my education, namely by briefly discussing growth and yield models, and the descriptive stats required to look into inventory data.  My expectations were to learn and practice these skills, so I would say they were met. "

            "\u00a0The class felt pretty scattered; it was trying to accomplish a lot of really different things. I don't think that was an innate characteristic of the class, more just a result of this being the first time the class was taught. Also, like I've already mentioned, we focused too much on modeling, but it sounds like that will change.\r\n\r\nWhile I did appreciate the lineup of guest speakers in a lot of ways, sometimes it felt like too much. In particular, whenever we had two speakers lined up back to back in the same class period, it was hard to focus on the second one and give them the attention they deserved. It would have been nice to have slightly fewer guest speakers and to spend some time discussing themes across the speakers so that we could all think about what we learned from them.\r\n\r\nThe section at the beginning on inventory was a strength; even though it was difficult, I think we all needed that refresher! ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were when Joe was lecturing on a clear topic.  When he was up there teaching us about how to look at inventory data, how to calculate the useful measures from it, how to think about forest management, how to plan out timber harvest schedules, that was great.  The guest lectures weren't great, partially because I just didn't have the capacity to engage, which is not the instructor's fault, but also because they were pretty scattered and it was hard to draw a clear narrative from them.  This was the first run through, and I think that, like a well-managed forest, this class is on track to get better and better.  Oh and the modeling programs need to hit the trash.  The instructor should give an hour, maybe two, of lecture introducing the different modeling platforms and talk about some of their strengths and weaknesses.  If students want to learn to use them, they can do so themselves, but devoting class time to using them isn't going to get anybody anywhere. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent structure. One thing that could help would be to identify projects earlier in the semester, have an annotated biblio due before spring break (or half way thru the semester), and then a check-in at the beginning of the last quarter. Kind of force progress. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - the initial lecture about understanding datasets, the excellent speakers we had\r\n\r\nweaknesses - Remsoft (we talked about this), perhaps instead you could invite Dr. Ivan Pupulidy (firefighter, PhD, veteran, incredible contact of Ashton) to give a workshop for the course, following the FVS workshop with Weiskettl. \r\nTimber theft exercise - I understand the importance of understanding how to do this type of regression analysis, but I thought that overall the exercise went on for too long.\r\nMultiple lectures about urban forestry - there was nobody in the class interested in urban forestry. I understand that the student-body has a significant interest in urban forestry, and that students were planning to take the course specifically interested in this topic, but I felt that it was not so useful. Perhaps recognizing that the urban planning / land-use capstone was being taught at the same time in future could allow urban forests to be discussed less in the course. ",
            "\u00a0Some of the classes seemed out of place; for example the remsoft workshop could definitely be dropped in favor of further practice in designing and evaluating inventories from real data.  The class was structured well, however, and I would say it was definitely worth having the guest speakers come in at the end of the class. "

            "\u00a0I think that with a bit more finessing, this course will be a really great capstone to the MF. It does a good job of encompassing a wide variety of goals that MF students have. ",
            "\u00a0Do you want to learn about forest management?  If yes, take this class.  If no, take something else. ",
            "\u00a0A super class that provides students a platform to consider landscape management while engaging with professionals that confront these issues on a daily basis. ",
            "\u00a0Talk to Joe early and frequently about any specific goals you have for the course, or any specific geographic interests. Joe is happy to fit the course to specific students, and you'll get more out of it if you explain to him what knowledge you already have, and where you're hoping to go. ",
            "\u00a0If you are an MF you must take this course. No exceptions. ",
            "\u00a0I would say that they should come in with a clear idea of their forestry interests, to make the project easier to digest.  One of the advantages of the course is that the class can be easily catered to a region/topic within forestry. "
