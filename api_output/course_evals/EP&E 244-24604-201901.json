            "\u00a0I improved my ability to read and analyze difficult econometric papers. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the latest in research on the causes and effects of conflict. More importantly, I learned how to evaluate research methods--which ones work best, when we should be cautious about drawing conclusions from the data, etc.--and economic arguments. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about the literature of the economic effects of conflict. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how econometrics can be used to analyzing poli sci topics like war. Also this was my first experience researching and writing a big econ paper so that was exciting. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how conflict affects people and countries in different circumstances in the short and long term. I appreciate that I learned how to better read economics scholarship through doing assignments and the final. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me further insights into the economic consequences and considerations of civil conflict. Throughout the course we analyzed various civil wars and conflicts and understood different economic impacts which the conflicts had. Our discussions also had us analyze different methods of analysis, and had us judge the merit of how different authors completed their analysis. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a broader understanding of current research related to conflict studies, in particular the political economy factors in conflict and the economic impacts of war and violence. I also gained insight into different perspectives on the causes and responses to conflict and the challenges in methodology and data availability in conflict research. The class gave me insight into the best research practices and the tools to think critically about policy responses to civil conflict, war, and violence. ",
            "\u00a0I gained deep understanding of the topics and empirical methods studied in the field of Conflict Economics. "

            "\u00a0I think Professor Padro is amazing. He is very engaging and an excellent teacher. He is certainly a strength of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - manageable work load, opportunities to practice presentation skills, fun final research project. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - discussion sometimes bogged down or only a few people would participate. It might help to host the class in a seminar room, rather than a traditional classroom, in order to facilitate discussion and participation. ",
            "\u00a0Gerard is honestly the coolest and most engaging econ professor ever. He was the highlight of the class. Might be better to have the class around a table instead of in chairs like in a lecture - the former is more conducive to discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Class format allowed me to learn how economics scholarship is created and how to read it. I think more could have been done at the beginning to help students know how to engage with course material and with each other. In the future, a room with a central table as opposed to desks might help discussion and allow more students to feel included. ",
            "\u00a0This course succeeds in utilizing the small class size to facilitate meaningful discussion in the course. Each class was effectively split into two parts: the student/teacher presentations, and the post-presentation discussion. This allowed for us to discuss and understand the papers for the week, and for us to discuss both the conflict itself and the methods behind them. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course were the structure and content. I really liked how the course honed in on a different topic each week and primarily focused on reading and discussing academic papers. The student presentations (the weekly class presentations and the final paper presentation) allowed us to explore more deeply into an area of conflict research that interests us and to hear and learn from our peers. I also really appreciated the flexibility of the course: the ability to choose the weeks that we wanted to present and write reading responses. The course could be improved by having more feedback available on the reading responses and the research proposal so that we can implement those comments into future assignments. I also think that having a seminar-style classroom setup, and not one with all of the chairs facing in the same direction towards a screen, would facilitate student-led discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The course was well structured and the readings were interesting. Professor Padro shared great insights into the papers during class discussion every week, and I looked forward to hearing what he had to say leading up to the class. The material, although specific, provided a deep view of the field. The assignments were challenging but fair, and pushed me to think critically about the text. \r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes, the student presentations dragged a little long. If time was strictly enforced, each class would feel more balanced. "

            "\u00a0Yes, it is a great class and it really improves your understanding of econometrics and your ability to read economic papers. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because Professor Padro is an engaging lecturer and has an infectious sense of humor and because the course material is interesting and pertinent to many debates about international aid and policymaking. In addition, the structure of taking two recent research papers and evaluating their arguments and methods is good practice for life. Most students won't go on to be economists themselves, so knowing when to call BS on an argument or how to determine if the results match authors' description is useful. ",
            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY. Take this class. Gerard is the only professor I have seen who can talk about econometrics and make it seem super exciting. Fantastic class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you are hoping to learn about the short- and long-term effects of conflict on people and countries. Class structure is chill but informative and the syllabus is well organized. ",
            "\u00a0This course is great if you're interested in civil conflict or other applications of the blend between micro and macro economics. The types of conflict are broad, and the economic analysis is varied and interesting. Honestly, it wasn't a topic I had considered for economic study but having done it now, I realize it is very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! The class allows you to explore the intersection of political science and economics through the exploration of conflict studies and the political economy, and it strikes a really great balance that I haven't really seen paralleled in many other classes. It's very refreshing and interesting to spend most of the classes reading and discussing academic papers, and the course structure really allows you to engage with the material and other students in the class. Gerard is also a really charismatic and energetic professor who has a lot of valuable insight in the field of conflict research. He's clearly very passionate about the field and is funny professor who makes class very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! If you are interested in conflict at all, including a historical, sociological, or anthropological point of view, this class could give you the economic perspective of historical and current events. Professor Padro is a great teacher and you will learn a lot from his expertise. The assignments are rewarding and do not feel like busy work  in fact, I felt accomplished after submitting every essay because I wanted to put in the time to the class. Take this!!! One of the best economics courses at Yale for higher level students for sure. "
