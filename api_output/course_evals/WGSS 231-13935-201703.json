            "\u00a0No new knowledge, skills, or insights. We did absolutely nothing in or for this class. There were readings, but they were essentially optional since not a single one was ever discussed or explained. In fact, many of the readings were changed the night before the seminar, almost as if they didn't expect you do to them in the first place. If you think you're going to get an understanding of how to do digital work or projects, think again! The professors are technologically illiterate and struggle to send emails, and most certainly do not place any emphasis or importance on math, statistics, or computer science. Don't expect to develop as a historian or writer, either. We discussed nothing relevant to WGSS or AMST, and all of our papers were 250 words and we were given no feedback for any of them. ",

            "\u00a0I learned what Digital Humanities are, the types of tools it utilizes and the types of projects that it entails. I learned way more than I expected! ",
            "\u00a0This is definitely an overview course of digital humanities projects and methods. You skip around a lot, and there is heavy emphasis on guest speakers. You get to take a personal stab at lots of the methods. ",
            "\u00a0I gained knowledge of the tools used in digital humanities. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: this MUST be the easiest course at Yale. There are no readings, exams, or homework. There are 4 papers, 250 words each and and all for completion. There is a midterm paper, but it is a group paper and only ~1000 words. The final is a \"true digital humanities project\" as the professors like to call it, but really it's just a group powerpoint presentation with no real rubric or grading outline. It only meets once a week for 2 hours. This course shouldn't even be 1/4 of a credit, and yet it is a whole 1.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: this isn't what I would consider to be an actual \"course,\" rather just babysitting for overcommitted Yalies who need a HU credit. This was the bore of my week and I hated coming to class. Nobody speaks during class, we just sit on our laptops and scroll through Facebook. You discuss nothing insightful, learn nothing new, and literally do nothing. Every other class is just a guest speaker who blabs on for 2 hours about nothing. The remaining actual classes are just the professors talking in a very self-absorbed way about their own works. ",
            "\u00a0Classes where we had a guest speaker were overdone and generally unproductive ",
            "\u00a0Loved the activities, assignments, and lectures. The professors were super nice, understanding, patient and good at teaching. The only thing I would change is that sometimes assignments / readings were given out too late. The communication and organization of the course should be improved more. Other than that I highly recommend the course and it was a really fun class. ",
            "\u00a0The class is relatively fun and interesting. The guest speakers have cool projects to discuss, the course content is easy to get interested in, and the final project was personally enjoyable. The downside of this course is that it was not very organized, and I sometimes had a hard time following exactly what we were supposed to be gaining from any given lesson. I always enjoyed the class discussions, but sometimes the content and readings seemed irrelevant to our assignments, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: It was interesting learning about the different types of tools used in the digital humanities\r\n\r\nWeakness: The course was disorganized at times, so we are uncertain of what is expected of us for each assignment. ",
            "\u00a0I like how it's a seminar and how you get to closely interact with the wonderful teachers of the course. "

            "\u00a0If you can get it, it's worth taking. Profs Wexler and Nieves seem to really care about their students. Also, you never have to actually do the reading (except for Snow Crash, which was fun anyways). Great fifth class. Choose your group carefully on the final project - the people you work with can make a huge difference. ",
            "\u00a0Would I recommend this class to another student? It depends on who that student is, and why they want to take the course. If you're a premed/STEM major like me, and are looking for an easy HU, then this is the class for you. It has a -1 workload and could easily be a 6.5th credit. However, it will be the most boring class you have ever taken and will become the dread of your entire week. It will turn you off from the humanities in general and you will not enjoy it. For me, I knew this coming in to the course based on previous reviews. This was a hard semester for me, and I knew that with my other required courses I wouldn't have a lot of time for some random distributional requirement. For me, this class served its purpose. \r\n\r\nIf you're not STEM/looking solely for the easiest HU you can find, you will hate this course and find it to be a waste of time. Look elsewhere. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Loved the activities, assignments, and lectures. The professors were super nice, understanding, patient and good at teaching. The only thing I would change is that sometimes assignments / readings were given out too late. The communication and organization of the course should be improved more. Other than that I highly recommend the course and it was a really fun class. As a BME major who is not used to reading and writing a lot, it was the perfect humanities class for me. You could get away with only skimming the readings / doing some of them, but they were actually interesting so I wish I had had the time to do all of them. The final project was a bit stressful, but overall enjoyable. I felt like I learned a lot from the class and was challenged the right amount. ",
            "\u00a0If you want a survey course on what digital humanities is and a highlight of a few core projects, then this is a good class for you. It's also a pretty fun and chill course, and can be a good seminar to throw into your semester to create some balance. I personally enjoyed the course and liked the professors a lot, but be prepared for a somewhat disorganized, enigmatic course. ",
            "\u00a0This course has low course load, but the class is disorganized at times. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great humanities class if you're not a humanities person. "
