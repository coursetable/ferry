            "\u00a0This class could be improved by employing teachers who know how to teach the confusing calculus material in a clear way, not by using proofs that aren't conducive to understanding (or even relevant to the course material). Moreover, I often found that the sections were not uniformly taught. When conferring with students from other sections of Math 115, we found multiple discrepancies in methods of solving problems and general material covered in class. There was often much confusion concerning what would and would not be covered on the exams. When I referred to the syllabus, I found that we had not learned material that was supposed to be on the first midterm, and we stayed behind schedule until the end of the course. Math 115 would greatly benefit from uniformity in both professors and the syllabus to prevent even more confusion in an already incredibly confusing course. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: many resources such as peer tutoring and office hours. Weaknesses: pace is a bit too fast at times; inhibits full comprehension of concepts. ",
            "\u00a0This course was good at holding the students accountable by having weekly problem sets and making sure that the problem sets challenged the students. A weakness is that the lecture meetings weren't incredibly engaging so they didn't do much to enhance my learning. ",
            "\u00a0Not many students were aware in the first half of the course that there were short video lectures that were part of the course (flipped classroom), so that should be made obvious on the syllabus. There just wasn't much guidance/suggestions on how we should learn the material before coming to class except through doing the explores - but I wasn't even sure how to approach the explores - was I supposed to read the textbook first and do this? Or use my Calculus BC knowledge? Or just guess and try again because there are 6 attempts per Explore? Either way, the Findings from each explore were very helpful in explaining the concepts I was expected to know. ",
            "\u00a0Appreciated the breadth of what was covered, no real outstanding weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0The pre-class explorations are very poor at illustrating concepts and are generally just a guessing game and feel like busywork.\r\n\r\nIts nice that the exams are more focused on conceptual understanding rather than heavy computations. Sometimes, however, it felt as if missing one part of one problem because one thing didnt click cost an entire letter grade on an exam, and this was often disheartening. Furthermore, the weighting of points on somr exam problems seemed inconsistent - with some being worth more than it seemed like they should be, and others less. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the course itself isnt exactly structured well - while it isnt flipped classroom anymore, it clearly still isnt conducive to effective learning. The majority of students that dont struggle in the class have taken BC in high school - if you havent had previous exposure to this material, youre going to have a tough time. ",
            "\u00a0Fei can be more thorough and explain better. ",
            "\u00a0grading is so harsh ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Good theoretical teaching, effort by professors: \r\nWeakness: Professor went off tangents every class about stuff that was not going to be on the test ",
            "\u00a0Everybodys class experience completely depends on their TA, which is kind of unfair if you get a bad TA (make sure to shop for a good TA). Also its kind of confusing how the people grading your hw, teaching you, and making the test are not the same people. This class is honestly a lot of work that onpy ends up making about 15% of your grade which is annoying. This class could also benefit from a curve. ",
            "\u00a0The flipped classroom setting was a struggle at first but I learned quickly how to maximize learning. However I thought the exams were an accurate and fair representation of what we learbed in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Solid workload, great explorations. The course should have more review sessions maybe. ",
            "\u00a0This course advanced at a nice pace and I never felt unprepared for any of the exams or problem sets. If I had to offer a weakness, I would say that class engagement is usually low. Since this is a math class, however, I do not think that high engagement is as necessary as understanding of the material and practice. "

            "\u00a0I would only recommend this course to another student if they knew what they were getting into. Having the discipline to teach yourself difficult material is crucial to attaining a good grade in this course, since the professors are of little help and the peer tutors, while much more helpful, lack the time and resources to reteach the course to you. My advice is to not let this course, despite its many fundamental and organizational flaws, deter you from pursuing math in the future. ",
            "\u00a0Yes; I believe the content taught is relevant across multiple disciplines and is hence necessary for most students to learn. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because it is effective at teaching the basics of Calculus II and the workload isn't overwhelming. ",
            "\u00a0It would really, really help you if you've already taken Calculus BC and want a manageable math class. Taking Calc BC doesn't mean this class will be an easy A though - you still have to have a detailed understanding of each math concept if you want perfect scores on that psets (they take off points for every minor thing). However, don't take this course if Calculus BC was a breeze for you - do Math 116 or 120 instead for a true challenge. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I find the course to contain important information for a college education. ",
            "\u00a0The only reason you should take this course is if you have to to fulfill a requirement. Otherwise, there are easier and likely far more enjoyable and useful QRs you can take. ",
            "\u00a0I would if the student had not taken BC. If they had taken BC before, they should go into 120. ",
            "\u00a0Not really, unless you had to take a math (if you do then i think it is the better out of the 112,115, 116,120 options) ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend to another student because I personally enjoyed the material we covered during the course but they should know that it is a but more work than other courses. ",

            "\u00a0This is a nice introductory class to college-level calculus. If you are nervous about taking 120 this may be a good option. "
