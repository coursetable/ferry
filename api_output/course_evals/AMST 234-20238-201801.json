            "\u00a0Such a great course. In the beginning, I'll admit I was not too thrilled and engaged by the course. It is one of those classes where you truly het what you put into it. It is not your traditional yale course and Zareena is far from traditional in that she makes her own rules. Learned so much about myself during that class, the most I have ever learned while taking a yale course. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about how to integrate elements from anthropology and religious studies into my, because spirituality and religion are so important in basically every other field and daily life in society. This really affected my work in other fields as a humanities major. In addition, on a less academic level, I feel like I understand where spiritual and/or religious people are coming from much better now. ",
            "\u00a0I gained so much from this class! you'll spend a lot of time thinking about religion, secularism, spirituality, neoliberalism, millennial culture, and the state. It's a lot and it's wonderful. I'm better able to analyze aspects of youth/millennial culture through an academic lens, and I'm better at asking questions (and questioning assumptions) about the state, power structures, religion, spirituality and capitalism. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a more complex understanding of spiritual and religious themes (such as secularism, debate's role in religion, etc.). ",
            "\u00a0I developed deep insight in the ways in which we can evaluate and analyze religion and spirituality. In our current modern age, we tend to commodify, appropriate, and twist spirituality to fit our needs to to show ourselves in a certain way. This class looks to analyze that and it does so by reading and talking about religious philosophers throughout history and by reading novels that fall in-line with the course content. One of the greatest lessons of this course: religion is not one answer, religion is a way in which we try to find the answer. ",
            "\u00a0A bette understanding of myself and how I am influenced by society. ",
            "\u00a0I learned many of the different nuances of religious life in the US ",
            "\u00a0Learned a bit about what makes a religion. However, most of the information was repetitive and many times was a bit off topic. Decent knowledge ",
            "\u00a0This course completely changed my perception of the world, religion, and American spirituality. It was an amazing course and Professor Grewal was honestly great! Overall, I think that I am much more aware of the role that religion and spirituality play in the world around me, especially with regards to capitalism and consumer culture. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think deeply and critically about phenomena I often take for granted while interrogating my own positionality and biases. ",
            "\u00a0Opened up my perspective on spirituality and religion in modern times and where it has been exploited, appropriated, and eroticized. ",
            "\u00a0My understanding about religion was very inadequate before this course. While I am no expert now, I have a much fuller understanding of religion and how it acts in the world. I also have a much better understanding of my own place in that world. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about the constant and subliminal culturally appropriative ways in which we as consumers take aspects of religions and fashion them into something we like. ",
            "\u00a0Zareena admits that the class is a bit of a bait and switch - it demands more introspection than she intitially lets on - but that was ultimately great. Regardless of where you are religiously, I think everyone should learn more about the American SBNR tradition, if only because its been so influential in shaping our society. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly one of the coolest classes that I've ever taken at Yale, but don't expect it to fix all of your religious and spiritual problems that you have in your life. You'll learn a lot just about everything, but not in the standard lecture type of way (which would be boring); but like classes aren't like TedTalks every week as well; Zareena expects participation from everyone and input from everyone while also teaching so it's a give and take relationship. It was really fun and interesting to debate about topics like authority, cultural appropriation, authenticity, religious seekers, spiritual seekers, what it means to be spiritual but nor religious, a whole slew of things. Sometimes it seemed like topics didn't really connect with each other, but like somehow, some way, they just did (because that's how humanities works a lot of the time). Really a challenge for a STEM-minded person, but a good one and something that I'll always remember. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of knowledge on schools of thought and the Role of religion for millenials ",
            "\u00a0I really feel like I gained a new framework to understand growing trends in our nation and globally, especially as religion and secularism relate to politics and identity. ",
            "\u00a0By taking this course, I learned how to ask important questions. I reevaluated my perceptions and I learned how to read and think and write much more thoughtfully. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a very interesting mix between religious theory and a study of cultural appropriation. It completely changed the way I think about many aspects of today's society, including but not limited to campus-wide intellectual discussions, boutique fitness centers, countercultural tendencies, and of course religious traditionally seen as non-western. I also loved the assignments which were thought-provoking and caused me to question a lot of my own thinking and that of my close friends and family. I also thought the SBNR literature that we read made me look at the books I read in a different way as well. Needless to say, this was one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0An incredible insight into many different arguments and ideas surrounding American spirituality and religion. ",
            "\u00a0This course encouraged me to interrogate my own assumptions about religion and spirituality and to think critically about the commercialized, commodified forms of spirituality that have become increasingly popular in American culture. I learned that the distinction between religion and secular spirituality is often fuzzy. I learned how to contextualize both individual beliefs and practices within broader cultural systems, as well as how to place current trends of spirituality in American history. ",
            "\u00a0How to perceive religiosity in today's world. ",
            "\u00a0I became much more aware of how my identity changes the way I interact with religions and spirituality. I also learned so much about the history of the concept Spiritual but not Religious. Mostly, I think this class allowed me to ask better questions when analyzing spirituality and its different manifestations. ",
            "\u00a0This class taught me how to conceptualize ideas of spirituality and religion especially in the context of the way we process spirituality today, and commodify yoga and other measures of spirituality. It was a very interesting connection between personal and political questions Ive considered in my own spirituality. ",
            "\u00a0I went into this class thinking that spirituality and religion were not relevant to me at all and wanted to know what drove this intense search to find spiritual or religious meaning in everyday life. I left the class feeling like I am looking at the world through an entirely different lens, not because I have a solidified answer to questions like \"what is spirituality\" or \"what is religion\" but instead with the tools to have conversations about these questions that are so difficult to answer. ",
            "\u00a0Hard to say because this course was so monumentally transformative. While all of the rest of Yale teaches us how to be productive members of the economy, or distinguished scholars in a field, this class taught us how to ask the important questions to be able to live a good life and build a better society. It changed my life, making me become much more spiritual, and Zareena's wisdom will carry me far beyond Yale. ",
            "\u00a0This question is impossibly narrow in scope when faced with the problem of trying to sum up what I've learned this semester! I've been avoiding this course review because it feels rather impossible to express what I've learned in this class. I learned a lot about whiteness, about previous assumptions that now feel rather foreign, about ways of thinking that have expanded the way I think about spirituality, purpose, colonialism, and mental health. I learned to think about scholars as particular voices to become familiar with, instead of reading each course text as a disembodied source of knowledge as I did before any exposure to intellectual history - oriented coursework. This course changes the way I think about personhood, community, being, and shaping a life. ",
            "\u00a0By taking this course, I learned how to think critically about religious practice and see religion as not merely a set of beliefs but as irrevocably intertwined with race, class and gender. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0On some days, I felt this class was changing the way I thought about a multitude of issues, from belief to neoliberalism to cultural appropriation. On others, I felt like I could have an equally engaging conversation about soulmates or charisma over lunch with friends instead of in lecture. Maybe having a firmer plan about what each class should discuss would improve this. I enjoyed the mixture of novels and academic readings for this course, but I felt that due to the large reading list, we never had time to discuss all of them sufficiently. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n1. Zareena is unlike any other Yale professor I've had. She truly wants us to learn and be critical of our everyday \"Yalie\" thoughts and actions, and as a result taking this class stretched my mind in ways that I didn't know were possible. I am grateful for this.\r\n2. The class inevitably \"drops wisdom\" on its students-- wisdom that tells us how we should live happy lives, how we should stay away from negativity, etc.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n1. Zareena is a fine professor all on her own; I actually thought that her choice to teach us from a book about \"redefining American spirituality\" detracted from the natural brilliance of her teaching style. While this may ultimately be a useless critique (after all, she has to give us something read, and has to test us on it-- don't know how else we would receive grades), I wish she had simply given us excerpts of the book to read, then lectured on their importance on their own.\r\n2. Sometimes, as a result, if you didn't keep up with the reading, lectures would be a bore/super confusing, and I started to really hate the class. Once Zareena started teaching us from pop culture events, YouTube videos, and the like, the class quickly became one of my favorites. ",
            "\u00a0Some more organization for the lectures can be helpful to keep engagement, but I understand why she does not do it -- to teach the lecture in a seminar style. ",
            "\u00a0This class is amazing in its breadth. The only critique is that the organization of the work expected could be laid out more clearly in the beginning. ",
            "\u00a0The TFs and section discussions of readings were the highlights of this course. Zareena's lectures were all over the place and in general unhelpful and unrelated to the course content. I think the course could be greatly improved by more organization in lecture. ",
            "\u00a0strengths included the materials and readings assigned, and the professor's approach to teaching the class. \r\n\r\nThe course did feel disorganized at times, but usually it wasn't much of a detractor. The TAs for the course were wonderful and I wish I'd gotten to hear  a bit more from them. I also wish we could have seen the slides for longer or gotten sent the slides at some point, because there was lots of material there that we never got to. ",
            "\u00a0strength: Any class with Zareena will be opinionated, and that is helpful for people coming up with their own takes. \r\nweakness: Zareena thinks that she is absolutely 100% right about everything she says, making it hard for her to understand why students don't agree with her. In a class ultimately designed to get students to think about how their actions can be harmful (but informed by broader systems of race, class, and power!) it was hard to see her be frustrated by students who think their actions are good and right even if they could logically connect them to legacies of oppression. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the material of the course, and I like the structure of the course where we discussed the novels in section. The lecture material, however, often didn't discuss the readings which was a little frustrating. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this class is the fact that it's a very interesting and engaging topic with an amazing professor. No lectures were ever boring and although the readings can get to be many pages, Zareena always breaks them down to be more palatable and does an excellent job of explaining the course material. This class was definitely one of my favorite at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Weakness: many times the title of the course seemed misleading. \r\n\r\nStrength: a lot of important topics that we are faced with on a daily basis ",
            "\u00a0I think we could connect our section readings with our lectures. ",
            "\u00a0Decent information but many times strayed away from spiritual but not religious. Also repetitive ",
            "\u00a0I loved the readings, Professor Grewal and her TAs are all amazing, and there were so many interesting lectures, though at times the reading load was a bit heavy and some of the lectures were too focused around summarizing the readings. ",
            "\u00a0The course had an incredible syllabus and very engaging lectures. It was a bit disorganized, but that did not at all detract from my experience. ",
            "\u00a0This course is all strengths in my opinion. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this class is single-handidly Professor Grewal and the awesome TAs. \r\n\r\nThe only weakness I can think of is possibly the slides - which are a bit dense for note taking. But it did not bother me much. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: LOVED the reading material and lecture and section was always filled with great discussion\r\nWeakness: Class was sometimes all over the place but there was a never dry moment! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Zareena is very smart and an excellent lecturer. Material is interesting. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes a tad disorganized (but I kind of enjoyed that), sections felt tedious and occasionally shallow (not the fault of the TAs, I think mostly just the fact that too few folks had really done the reading, esp after the midterm) ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: really interesting topic material, really amazing books and readings, super cool professor, good assortment of conversations, not a standard lecture type of class, because there was student participation like every single class; weaknesses: professor came to class late a lot, the more freestyle-flowy structure of the class made it sometimes disorganized and hard to follow along and really absorb and understand the point that the professor was trying to make; some of the readings are really long and sometimes you have multiple of them to keep up with, so it's hard to keep everything organized sometimes ",
            "\u00a0More organized lectures but the readings were awesome ",
            "\u00a0Overall, really phenomenal class. I enjoyed the readings, use of multimedia, class discussions etc. Sometimes it felt like there were a few too many side tangents in student discussions, but overall I loved going to class and felt like I got something out of every class I attended. The only thing I think I would suggest is potentially a little more of a lesson plan to ensure we get to the topics that are important to talk about. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed how the first half of the semester was on religious theory and the second half was on modern connections to society, however it was hard to feel passionate about the material in the first half of the course without getting bogged down in names and large concepts. It would have helped to explain more at the beginning about why this theory is important. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include interesting lectures, engaged TAs, and discussion-worthy material. The structure of the course itself also seems really fair and conducive  to absorbing the material. ",
            "\u00a0I really disliked this class. I found the moments in class when we talked about the readings in detail to be useful and engaging, and I loved my TA and thought both she and the professor gave detailed and thoughtful responses to my papers, but otherwise, I found the course boring, repetitive, and I often felt like Zareena was trying to brainwash the class. I agreed with much of what she said, but the class still felt one-sided and oddly controlling, despite the forged casual and interactive-pedagogy atmosphere. I also did not like that she often recalled personal stories told to her by students at office hours, stories which I'm assuming some students did not want to have shared at lecture. ",
            "\u00a0One of the biggest strengths of the course was the readings. In particular, many of the academic essays and the Carette and King book were so interesting and enlightening. The novels were also fun to read. In addition, it was clear that Prof. Grewal and the T.F.s deeply cared about both the material and all of their students. Prof. Grewal clearly took the time to get to know her students. She is also an extremely insightful, passionate, and genuine lecturer. In general, the class was very creatively taught -- with lots of novels, creative assignments, experiential learning, and multimedia lectures. It was also truly interdisciplinary, which I thought was really cool. However, I think the class could have been structured a bit better. Lectures were sometimes a bit hard to follow, as they jumped from topic to topic a lot. We spent a lot of time in lecture listening to other students' opinions and personal stories-- these often got repetitive and were occasionally superficial, especially since I didn't know most of the people talking and often didn't know the context for their anecdotes. It was also usually the same people speaking every class. I think these discussions could have been more useful to have in section, where more people would feel comfortable speaking and we'd all have gotten to know each other by the end of the semester. I think a couple of novels could be taken out of the curriculum in order to have more discussions about the material in class. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: \r\n-LOVED the use of books that are more pop culture rather than specifically religious as accompanied by readings that WERE religiously oriented (the reading assignments get an A+)\r\n- diverse teaching with multimedia (youtube videos) was incredibly helpful at keeping attention!\r\n- thought the field trip exercise, online blogs, and the fortune cookie exercise-turned-into-real-fortune-cookies were all so great at making the class feel more like a family and something special\r\n\r\nweaknesses:\r\n- did not love/get much out of a lot of the lectures because I sometimes felt they were unorganized, started late, and consisted more of my peers sharing their feelings about things rather than me learning; I felt a lot of my peers were just talking to hear themselves talk, sharing personal experiences, rather than saying things that were particularly helpful; I also HATED pair-and-share (I dread forced interaction and unfortunately don't feel like I got a ton out of this either)\r\n-love the personal papers, they make the class very real and interpersonal \r\n- book reviews I think should be given higher weight and the papers less ",
            "\u00a0The course is geared towards understanding current cultural trends, which is helpful. It's very stream of consciousness, which has positives and negatives. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were a bit disorganized but Zareena is a genius so it was fine. I loved that we read fiction and theory and I also think the paper assignments were perfectly thought out and aided in my learning a lot. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the readings - they were all so engaging and even though at first I was hesitant about the idea of there being separate readings for lecture and section (theoretical readings + a novel each week) I really was so engaged in all of them. I also liked the way that she made the lecture of 70+ people feel so small by engaging everyone. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing, transformative, critical curriculum that speaks truth to power, interrogates existing social structures, and gives us the wisdom and courage to live a good life. ",
            "\u00a0This is the best course at Yale. Its strengths include the reading list, Zareena Grewal, the TFs (including and especially Cody), and the distribution of work. I loved the novels, and I loved the scholarly articles. I loved hearing from my peers. I loved that both my TF and professor read and gave thorough feedback on my work. I loved how much I learned about the way my peers think about religion, their families, and their relationship to history and context. I loved showing up for class twice a week and lecture once. I only wish I could do so more frequently and for longer. I don't know about weaknesses. The only weaknesses were my own, in that sometimes I faltered in my ability to put my full effort into each assignment, because they all felt important to a point that I often froze up. This is the best learning experience I've had, and I only think that it should be available to more people, at Yale and outside of Yale. But probably not virtually, because the intimacy and responsiveness were really critical to the learning process. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course lies in Zareena's wisdom and commitment to her students' success. She does a lot to ensure that her students are engaged (even in reading every single student's essays). In my mind, the weakness of this course lies in the novels and their tenuous connection to lecture. At times, I was unsure why we were reading certain books in section and would have preferred for those connections to have been made more clear. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student with the caveat that they MUST keep up with the reading if they plan on having a good time in lecture. If you don't do the readings, Zareena's lectures will make no sense/be boring. It's up to you to keep up.\r\n\r\nThere are days where Zareena doesn't teach from the book and instead shows you YouTube clips or pop culture events that are relevant to the class and its topic. Those are the best days; if you want to be part of a lecture that really feels like a seminar (she calls on people who raise their hands during class, and lets the discussion take its natural course) then take this course. \r\n\r\nThe midterm causes some stress because it's a test of the textbook reading, but if you take good notes, then you're good to go-- the exam is open note for the last 15/20 min. Be warned that the readings for lecture (academic readings) are different and separate from the readings for section (novels). I wish we had spent more time analyzing the novels during lecture time.

She really cares about us students and want us to get the most out of the class. It's not the most organized class and the workload seems heavy, but it's all worth it, I promise.  Just come with an open mind. ",

            "\u00a0I absolutely would recommend this course to another student. Professor Grewal is amazing, the course material is intellectually engaging, and the course structure is helpful for approaching the material in multiple ways. Furthermore, the written workload is not substantial for a class of this style. This is a great class that anyone would be glad to take. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would highly recommend this course to other students. It might not be exactly what you'd expect from the title, and it is definitely disorganized at times, but it's a fun and different learning structure and you will learn a lot. It's very easy to be self-motivated in this class, so although there's quite a bit of reading and work, it doesn't feel like a chore. I looked forwards to this class most weeks, especially in the second half of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0If you are uncritical of how most of Yale's actions uphold bad systems of oppression, this class will be uncomfortable. If you are, taking this class will arm you with more information. ",
            "\u00a0This course is great in helping you see the nuances and complexities of things that you have overlooked in your life (like what secular means, like what a strong religion means, how you view Islam, etc.). It is a lot of reading, however, and you need to do the reading in order to get the most out of the course--as Professor Grewal says early on, most of the mind-blowing stuff happens from the readings and not lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I definitely would recommend this class to another student. The workload is not as large as it seems: three personal essays, some book reviews, and a few discussion posts. None of these need extensive knowledge of the reading and are only really there to help in facilitating the learning of the course material. I think that that is what makes this course so amazing, it's the fact that I do the assignments and they actually have a purpose. They actually feel like I did something meaningful, not only for my learning, but also as a statement. \r\n\r\nThis class is NOT A GUT, but the workload is not as high as other humanities courses and overall, it's a very manageable course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would. The course material was very interesting, and even though it was a lot of work I feel as if I learned a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely not all spiritual but not religious. Class focuses a lot on cultural appropriation and the negativities of whiteness. Professor said she wanted to call class \"Anthropology of Whiteness\" ",

SBNR changed how I think about my own spirituality and religion as well as how those classifications operate in the broader social context of the country. Zareena is one of the best professors at Yale and her class was the best choice I made this semester. ",

            "\u00a0Yes! This is class that all students should take because we are always exposed to religions, whether we know it or not, and we need to be aware of how those religions are used, portrayed, and commodified. This is a class white Yale students need to take in order to learn about how they culturally appropriate religions and cultures, and it provides a safe and comfortable environment for them! ",
            "\u00a0If you shop it and like Zareenas lecturing style, and are comfortable with the Marissa on the syllabus, go for it! Grading isnt harsh, but youll want to really engage with the material. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would recommend this class to another student if you have the space; Zareena is super cool and getting the chance/opportunity to attend a class in a fitness boutique setting was really fun too! This class really expands your mind and it allows you to talk about religion and spirituality openly since those are commonly topics that aren't shared too often. You get a chance to write about your and others' religious/spiritual histories which is awesome, because it helps you apply topics that you learned in class and gives you a chance to express yourself in ways that you normally don't have the opportunity to. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the readings and content were amazing but the lectures can be a little random and unorganized ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This is such an important class in understanding our society, our history, and our own positionalities. Professor Grewal cares so much about the subject and about her students. You learn a ton in a more traditional sense (good readings, lectures, etc.), but more importantly, you learn in a way of gaining a new framework and thinking about the big questions in life, questions we often don't give ourselves the time to contemplate. Take it!!!! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course - in fact, I already have, to just about all of my friends. Zareena will warn you on the first day that the course is not designed to be a daily TED Talk, but she is brilliant and the course material will consistently inspire you to reevaluate the way you look at things. I'm walking away from this class with very important new insights and I could not feel more grateful or sad that it is over. ",
            "\u00a0I think every student at Yale should take this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but you need to make sure the material interests you first. ",
            "\u00a0No! I found the class to have little substantial content, despite the very interesting readings and potentially great course material. I did not like Zareena's teaching style or the structure of the course, and I found the assignments did not challenge me to delve into the course's questions. Most of lecture time consisted of disorganized and repetitive rants in which the students were instructed on a better way to exist at Yale, but I found the advice to be destructive rather than helpful, and often condescending. ",
            "\u00a0Every Yale student should take this class. The assignments were super enjoyable and fun. In the class, you are able to relate to the experiences in your life. You are encouraged to analyze the religious and spiritual nature of friends, family, and yourself. The discussions are interesting and confusing at moments, but it is crazy to know how deeply embedded religion and spirituality are in our society. There are a lot of assignments, but they aren't graded super harshly as long as you try to engage with the material. Effort is extremely valued in the course and if you take the time, you will get a good grade and get to listen to some really amazing lectures that will affect your daily life ",
            "\u00a0YES 100% ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. It's an eye opening course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Its the best class Ive taken at Yale. Never have I been so consistently engaged with a course because of how the professors inspired me and the content drew me in. I read so many amazing theoretical texts and novels and went through self discovery too. Also, I think i helped others think more deeply about these questions which is very rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0DefinitelyI did feel that sometimes the fictional readings didnt align with academic or theoretical texts, and I wish they did more sometimes. This class, however, was impactful for me in that it changed the way I perceived myself in relation to our generations conception of spirituality. I walked out of classes not only with insights into the texts we read but also into my own life and the lives of those around me. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - everyone should take this! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. TAKE THIS CLASS. Take it if you feel constant impostor syndrome, feel overwhelmed with the competition at Yale, feel adrift in a tumultuous world, or just want to discover new parts of yourself. I cherish the experiences I had in this class and am a better person for having taken it. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Anyone who has the opportunity to take this course should absolutely do so. This course doesn't only change the way you think in the context of the classroom. It also shapes the way you approach the process of thinking and reflecting in your everyday life, which in turn changes the way you think about time and how you want to engage with it in your life. This course has changed the way I think about how to live a life, and I think everyone deserves a chance to reflect upon the questions the course brings up. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student if they enjoy conceptual courses and do not mind if classes are loosely organized. "
