            "\u00a0I learned about the common key traits that made individuals successful leaders, and innovators in American history. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the leadership styles of great leaders and innovators throughout history and learned more about what kind of leader I want to be in the process. ",
            "\u00a0I learned new leadership structures and methods for implementation while learning about a pantheon of historically effective leaders and what made them successful. We specialized in talking about leadership in regard to how leaders can inspire innovation in their work. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about historically influential figures in American history. ",
            "\u00a0Each meeting of the seminar consisted of discussion of assigned readings about a particular leader, and then a short group activity related to the leadership we were discussing that night. We discussed some leadership frameworks (build, measure, learn; follow the heart, etc.), but Im not sure that I could point to specific knowledge, skills, or insights that I developed over the course of the seminar, and that was probably my greatest disappointment with what was still a good course.

            "\u00a0Great readings. Not much dialogue or engagement in seminar, however. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Excellent readings, great team exercise portion of each class, wise lecturer.\r\nWeakness: Class readings could be a bit too much to complete each week, Could have more mandatory assignments to really practice the leadership methods we discussed. ",
            "\u00a0The strength was that the reading material was wonderful. The weakness was that engagement with the reading wasnt as intense as it could have been. It was very superficial engagement. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Baldwin really cares about the students and the material, the course reading list is phenomenal, course brought together a lot of interesting students\r\nWeaknesses: The course discussions could be a bit dry as they were often centered around reading questions ",
            "\u00a0Professor Baldwin is very interested in the material, has followed an interesting career path, and is teaching the class 100% because he wants to, which is all great.  I enjoyed having him lead the seminar. He is also very interested in student feedback-Im sure hes reading all of these and tweaking the course for next year based on what we all said, and I really appreciate that. He even handed out surveys at the halfway mark to make adjustments for the second half of the course. In my mind, the biggest weakness was that I dont have a great answer to the first question: what I took away from the course. It might be useful to go a little more in-depth on what makes a good leader in general, besides just applying the somewhat buzzwordy leadership frameworks to a new case study each week. "

            "\u00a0Its a great additional class. Dont expect anything too groundbreaking though. Topics are interesting, and the first couple weeks are really good ",
            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY!!!! This course will give you knowledge about some of the most difficult to learn yet invaluable skills you will ever need in life. Very fun class environment and very knowledgeable instructor. ",
            "\u00a0I would though it wouldnt be at the top of my list. Its a good class, you can learn a lot, but it really depends on the engagement levels of the other students. ",
            "\u00a0Yes this class is great! The reading list is phenomenal - I wished I'd had time to finish the books rather than just read the assigned chapters. Professor Baldwin is great and brings outside business and life perspective to the course. A lot of the end-of-class thought exercises are cool too. ",
            "\u00a0The course is enjoyable, and also relaxing/not stressful at all. The workload is not high (readings, a 1-page paper, an 8-10 page paper, and a 12-15 page paper, although the two longer papers are not too challenging to write). This makes for a great addition to a busy semester if you need to fit another class in but still want it to be interesting. I enjoyed the discussion with the professor and the other students, and I think the professor did a good job picking people for the class whod be interested in the material. "
