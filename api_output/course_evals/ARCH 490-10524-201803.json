            "\u00a0Research skills, ability to formulate a project and articulate its stakes, how to go about writing a thesis, writing and revising. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a great opportunity to develop ones own project in an intense and productive environment. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a rich background on urban and architectural theory and literature, as well as a good understanding of how to conduct research in these fields. The guidance and constructive feedback on my thesis, as it developed over the semester, was invaluable. ",
            "\u00a0This course was an excellent way to apply my previous work in other architecture classes to my own research project. In the course of the class we created a research proposal, outline, and abstract, and conducted the base of our research, which students will turn into thesis projects or independent research projects. "

        [
            "\u00a0Great class!! You get a lot of feedback about your project - both from the instructor and from the numerous presentations you make to classmates and other faculty, which is really helpful for thinking about your project in relation to a discipline. Marta taught us a lot about how to think through an idea and how to read a text. The reading is also great in that it picks up where a Archi History II stops - you're getting a general architecture education as well as learning about your specific topic. The work was quite uneven though - if there's any way to make sure that we are able to sustain the effort in assignments (perhaps with more close source reading assignments?) that would be great. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of the course was definitely the teaching staffs dedication to their students and the types of readings and texts we were exposed to. \r\n\r\nAn area that could be improved would be facilitating peer-editing workshops early on in the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Seminar format was well-suited and Prof. Caldeira facilitated excellent discussions throughout the semester. The best part of the course was working on our individual theses, both by presenting in class and through individual meetings with Prof. Caldeira. The only thing I could think to improve would to have more time in class dedicated to thesis development. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the class was well structured to build upon work each week, and I felt well directed at the end of the semester to begin writing my thesis. Perhaps more of the research-directed assignments at the beginning of the semester would help students who haven't fleshed out their topics before beginning the semester. "

            "\u00a0I definitely would! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. If you are completing a thesis in the Urban Studies or History & Theory tracks, this is a must (and required!) for good reason. It will be super helpful in formulating your thesis research. ",
            "\u00a0Yes; this course allowed me to dive into my research project while providing the perfect amount of direction and room for independent study. "
