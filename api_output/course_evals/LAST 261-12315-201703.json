            "\u00a0I gained an understanding of medieval to early modern Spanish history, literature, and culture, as well as practical skills in reading historical Spanish texts and writing literary-critical papers in Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely was interesting to analyze literature, which is such an involved process, in another language. Reframed the lenses from which I view literature in general ",
            "\u00a0I learned about literature and the evolution of Spanish literary composition. I liked the professors identification of themes. We covered the position of the woman, marriage, community, religious persecution, and others. ",
            "\u00a0My reading and writing in Spanish improved.  I had never written an essay on Spanish literature longer than 2 pages before this class, and by the end of the class I had written one 5-page and one 10-page paper. ",
            "\u00a0My first introduction to Spanish Literature; read a wide range of works from the about 11th to 17th century. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to read and appreciate old Spanish literature. I was given the opportunity to explore a broad range of authors and writing styles through over seven centuries of Spanish literature. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how Spanish literature has evolved over time, as well as how each piece is deeply related to the historical context of Spain at the time. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about Spanish literature and the history behind it as well! I learned to analyze literature and make connections between varying pieces of literature. I also learned how to improve my spanish-speaking and writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0An ability to analyze different literary structures in Spanish, an understanding of the unique historical context that informed Spanish literature from the early medieval period to the golden age of Spanish literature. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great amount about Spanish literature and the methods used to tell stories and provide details. ",
            "\u00a0My skills in Spanish and understanding Spanish literature improved with this course. By taking this course I gained an appreciation for early Spain and its literature. Contrary to the common understanding of the period, it was not all about religious differences and wars. The period, as the literature demonstrated, was much more complex and nuanced. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a better understanding of medieval Spanish literature and its evolution through history. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me develop stronger analytical writing and close reading skills in Spanish. And perseverance. Some of the early medieval texts are virtually unreadable, so it took a long time to finish a 5-6 page reading. Still, rewarding in the end. ",
            "\u00a0Generally, my Spanish pronunciation and reading comprehension improved drastically over the course, along with my ability to engage analytically with Spanish texts. ",
            "\u00a0I got to read so much Spanish Literature from the 11th to 17th century, it was AWESOME! ",
            "\u00a0We studied Spanish Literature from its beginnings in the 11th and 12th centuries in jarchas, cantares de gesta, and romances, up past Don Quijote at the turn of the 17th century. "

            "\u00a0The best part of this class was Professora Adorno. She was so approachable, kind, and made class so pleasant. The readings could be difficult to get through alone so I appreciated reading important passages through in class. ",
            "\u00a0Profa. Rolena Adorno is *incredible* but the readings also weren't bad. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very good at adapting to the level of every student. Whether you were a native speaker or not, you could get a lot out of the course. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a pretty good survey of Spanish literature and I felt like I learned a lot about a huge variety of different Spanish pieces. However, my speaking skills didn't improve that much because there wasn't that much class participation. ",
            "\u00a0A major strength was the emphasis on speaking spanish and becoming comfortable with it. The classroom was always a welcoming environment and discussions always ran smoothly due to the professors efforts. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes I felt that not everyone got the chance to speak because those who spoke frequently were called on immediately. ",
            "\u00a0Each class included a thorough discussion of the literature read for homework. This was insanely helpful when dealing with hard-to-understand archaic literature. Profesora Adorno is extremely passionate about what she teaches and this is clearly shown in each class. ",
            "\u00a0One of the main strengths of the course was the breath and depth of the texts studied. We covered a lot of ground in the class and it improved my ability to analyze literature. That being said, I felt that at times we could have used a more direct analysis of the text. It was sometimes hard to grasp just exactly the significance of the text and its relation to other works. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths included both the professor and the material. Though it was easier to get by without doing readings in the class, they were incredibly interesting and, if one puts fourth effort and does go over all the material, theyll get a lot out of the class. ",
            "\u00a0Class size was too large. When I took it it was around 35 people in a smallish classroom, so discussion was definitely a bit stunted. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course is the breadth and variety of literature it covers. However, we failed to go deep into the material we read, and at times the discussion seemed to skim the surface of the meaning of the text. This was unsatisfying. There is no single solution for this, but one idea would be to expect everyone to have read the material so as to go over themes more completely instead of reading it word for word in class as though no one had done the reading at all.

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The readings are very interesting and provide an excellent introduction to early Spanish literature and also allow for the discussion of Spanish history/culture. Some of the earlier readings are harder to read because they're written in old-Spanish, but translations, as well as, more modern re-writes were included. If one of your main goals is to practice speaking all the time, this might not be the correct class, but discussion did form a very important aspect of lecture, so there will be plenty of opportunities to work on speaking. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, assuming the other student knew Spanish and enjoyed literature ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Take this class if you are interested in literature and the insight literature can offer to the culture of Spain. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student, but only to someone who really likes Spanish and really likes literature.  If you're kind of lukewarm about either of those things, you will not enjoy this course.  But if you like both, this course is really enjoyable and valuable. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, if only for the professor, Rolena Adorno who is amazing. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who wanted to dip their toes into the world of Spanish literature. This is a great introductory course to all that there is, and it gives you a newfound appreciation of an art that you may not yet have explored. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend it if you're interested in learning about Spanish literature. The workload is pretty light and the topic is very interesting and you get to read a huge variety of different pieces. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I loved this course because I enjoyed every class, but also learned a tremendous amount. The material is presented clearly and reinforced so that studying isn't too big of a hassle. The professor makes it very clear what the expectation is for the tests and papers and is always available to answer questions! The material is unique and encompasses so much-- literature from XI to XVII century-- in such little time, but I feel like the takeaway was tremendous! ",
            "\u00a0Any class with Adorno is wonderful. She is absolutely wonderful and any class with her is worth taking. She has an incredible sense of humor, is incredibly caring of her students, and teaches the material well. The class gets a bit dry sometimes  class consists of closely reading the literature out loud and commenting, which isn't always the most enjoyable. But if you even just skim over the readings, it's a very low workload and good time. ",
            "\u00a0I would strongly recommend this course to other students due to the way the material is very interesting and Profesora Adorno teaches it so well. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students who have taken AP Spanish Literature in high school. Even if you are not the best at speaking Spanish, you will be able to follow along due to limited prior knowledge of the material. The class definitely expands upon the AP course and is an appropriate follow-up to it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because the works we read were interesting and professor Adorno was amazing ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Rolena is a real gem. She makes literature accessible and interesting. She is a kind person and really wants you to succeed and enjoy the course material. If you're not interested in a high intensity L5 course, but still want to get exposed to some interesting topics in Spanish, this class would be a good fit. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Provided that they were genuinely prepared for the course (I don't think that a five on the AP exam actually correlates to being prepared for L5 at Yale), they will find it very interesting and will grow in their ability to engage with the language. ",
            "\u00a0Only if they are interested in old literature ",
            "\u00a0This is an awesome Spanish class! ",
            "\u00a0No, I would not. If you are looking for a class that is light on workload and challenge, take this. But if you are seeking something that will give you a deep understanding of texts and force you to work for it, do not take this class. This class left me wanting more. Out of the teaching, out of the texts, etc. Spanish literature has so much to offer and this was just a little taste of it. "
