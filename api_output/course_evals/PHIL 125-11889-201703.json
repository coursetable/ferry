            "\u00a0With PHIL 125, I learned the general gist of the ideas posed by various ancient Greek philosophers. The emphasis was placed on Plato and Aristotle, but we also covered the Presocratics, Lucretius and the Epicureans, the Stoics, and the Skeptics. I think the main thing that I was able to more successfully take away from this class was a better understanding of the general ideas of the philosophers.\r\n\r\nHowever, one thing I was unsatisfied with was that the class did not really teach you how to approach studying philosophy in terms of philosophical thinking. I wasn't able to learn or receive much help on how to really think or argue philosophically.\r\n\r\nIn other words, we didn't get the chance to really learn the skills we needed to successfully write the philosophy papers that were the core of the assignments for this class. There was no discussion of how to critically read, think, and analyze the texts. ",

            "\u00a0This class is a broad overview of ancient Greek Philosophy, as well as a tiny bit of Roman philosophy at the end of the course. It was very interesting to see how all of the names you're probably familiar with (Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, etc.) all relate to one another, as well as read a fair bit of their original work, as well as reading some of the more obscure pre-Socratic and Hellenistic philosophers. This class was also an introduction to writing philosophy papers, albeit a sometimes frustrating one. ",

By the end of the course, I gained knowledge about the key ideas of famous ancient Philosophers, but probably not enough to formulate a thorough criticism or appreciate all the finer subtleties of their works. Some Philosophers will have you marvel at their ingenuity, others can be mundane or clearly illogical. Writing the 3 papers is an exercise in sifting through lots of translated text about (often) vaguely formulated ideas, distilling the key concepts, and trying to find loopholes in them. ",

            "\u00a0I don't think that we should be penalized for not coming to lecture, and I think that there should be intermittent assessments so that our final grade for the class is not dependent on a final whose structure/content is completely unfamiliar to us ",
            "\u00a0This course was effective enough at conveying the basics of ancient Greek and Hellenistic philosophy. However, lectures often felt like mere summaries of the reading we had just done and so were not very valuable.\r\nGrading for the course was also strict in a way that sometime felt unfair. For example, I worked on 3 drafts of my second paper with my TF only to receive a worse grade than I had on my first paper, which I wrote as a single draft without consulting with my TF. Feedback differed greatly between TF's: my TF thought that one of my arguments was strong, while the TF grading the paper thought it entirely missed the mark. Improving both the depth of the lectures and the consistency of grading (to be clear, my issue is not that standards were high; it is that there was not sufficient guidance to let you know if you were meeting the standards) would be valuable. ",
            "\u00a0I think that as a philosophy course this class is excellent. However, I do wish there were more discussion opportunities, as that's the best way for me to develop opinions on philosophical works. I think without the ability to discuss ideas, writing papers was extremely difficult. Also, as someone who has no experience in writing philosophy papers, the learning curve to do so in this course is formidable. I improved, but because there were only 3 main assignments, I feel that I wasn't able to practice and learn as much as I hoped I would from a WR class. ",
            "\u00a0I felt like this course was so focused on being an introductory course that teaches you how to write essays and approach philosophy that we didn't always get into the actual material that much. Particularly in discussions, they very much revolved around either writing papers or understanding the actual facts of the reading, so we didn't get much of a chance to actually discuss our own thoughts about the readings. ",
            "\u00a0This was a very solid survey course! But I want more section time! We need more section time to properly talk over the topics we have to cover with debate and ALSO learn how to write philosophy papers! More section time! Please! ",
            "\u00a0Professor Inwood is very knowledgeable, but the course structure seemed a bit haphazard at times. In addition, the grading was fairly arbitrary. One teaching fellow might read a draft and say that it is a good argument, but the teaching fellow grading your paper may completely disagree and reflect this in your grade. ",
            "\u00a0This course is definitely helpful in terms of helping you just gain a general idea of what the ancient Greek philosophers did and talked about. Coming out of the class, I at least finally know a little bit more about what Plato and Aristotle did.\r\n\r\nHowever, this class had weaknesses. It just really didn't teach much about philosophical thinking or the skills you need in philosophy, and the resources you have aren't enough or aren't trying to really help you learn these skills.\r\n\r\nAlso, the grading for this class is very harshthe modal grade for the papers was about an 82\r\n for most of the papersso you need to be prepared to be OK with that. An 82 for a grade is what is considered to be the normal grade for this class. If you are OK with settling for a lower grade, you still do learn a lot from this class content-wise, and if you put in the work, you definitely improve in terms of philosophical thinking. It's just that you really don't get much help in getting there. ",
            "\u00a0My one complaint about this course regards the grading of papers by the teaching fellows. There are times when my own teaching fellow advised me to write one thing, while the teaching fellow who graded my paper disapproved of it, causing confusion. Not all the comments I received on my graded papers were coherent. There are certain parts of writing philosophy for this course which appears to have been subjective to the person reading my paper. Otherwise, the fellows and professor are extremely helpful in clarifying any confusion thereafter, but it is inconvenient when such take place. ",
            "\u00a0While the class is called Intro to Ancient Philosophy, it ought to be called Intro to Ancient Greek Philosophy, since every philosopher studied in the class was from Greece. That being said, the class is very informative and provides a strong basis for understanding philosophy. At times, section felt like superfluous rehashing of what was stated in the lecture. The readings were often unenforced. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Inwood is, in my opinion, an exceedingly interesting lecturer. I always enjoyed the lecture component of the class, and he is really rivetting to listen to. At one point I realized that he was able to do all of this without reading from lecture notes, and he can pull page numbers/chapters out of thin air to quote/cite them. The teaching is very coherent and at a reasonable pace. It's also nice that the grades you get on the essays are weighted, so your best grade is worth far more than your worst.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I was less pleased with the way that section and grading was handled. The grading of the three essays is done via a blind grading system, where a random TF who is not your section leader will grade your paper. I'm glad they try to ensure fairness this way, but in practice this is kind of a mess. What grade you get can largely depend on who your grader is. Some of the feedback I got was very helpful, and some was simply terrible; one grader made a comment on my paper which made me question whether or not they finished reading it. It's also unfortunate that there are no example papers to read; in all my other classes, when writing was required, the instructors gave us examples of good papers so we would know what to have in mind. Here, they just said 'go forth and write an excellent philosophy paper', which, as it turns out, involves a lot of very specific things which we didn't know until after our first paper was graded. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Inwood's lectures usually clarified the major points of the reading, but were often incoherent, disorganized, and repetitive and superficially treated highly nuanced material. In short, they did little to improve my understanding of the reading, which was often more helpfully supplemented by articles from Wikipedia and Sparknotes. Also, while I find Greco-Roman philosophy to be often quite interesting, Professor Inwood's presentation was typically lackluster and dry. Essay grades, too, was unclear and often harsh. I was very uninspired to engage with this class. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were sometimes a bit rough to get through and it was difficult to stay engaged, but section was very interesting and engaging and put the information in class into perspective (my TA was very good) ",
            "\u00a0I think that the course was amazing and it made me reflect a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the professor (Inwood) who is a great lecturer and the breadth of the philosophers you get to study. Weakness is, as expected, that each philosopher has to be covered fairly quickly, without going into too much detail and at times switching gears rather dramatically, which can occasionally lead to some confusion. ",
            "\u00a0It shouldn't have a final exam if there are 3 essays ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were very well-done, and clarifying of especially the more difficult material.\r\nSince it is the first introduction most of us had to philosophy writing, it would have been helpful to be shown examples of what a good (or A) paper looks like.\r\nOverall, the TA's were unhelpful (as I've heard across the four discussion sections).\r\nThe grading seems arbitrarily harsh, and is very much deterring me from pursuing philosophy more seriously. ",
            "\u00a0The lecture was great. My section would have been much more helpful if we used the time to practice ways to approach analyzing texts and writing papers as philosophers, considering it is an intro course. ",
            "\u00a0The TAs should release model papers after each assignment.  While I valued the thorough feedback I received on each of my papers, I think I would have benefited from a look at exemplary work. ",
            "\u00a0The course is pretty well organized and achieves what it sets out to do - give a survey of Ancient Western Philosophy. Prof Inwood and the TFs are generally approachable and always willing to answer questions.\r\n\r\nLectures could be improved by spending more time critically evaluating the ideas presented in the text instead of simply explaining them since most of us have (presumably) done the readings beforehand. It would also be great if we had some model papers to look at, in order to give us a clearer picture of the standards expected. Lastly, some of the Pre-Socratic Philosophers could be skipped in order to spend more time on the other people in the course. ",
            "\u00a0It was very interesting material, but I think we went through it too quickly in order to truly understand the material. Also, it would have been helpful to have been briefed on what we should be keeping in mind for the reading, because I only really understood the reading after lecture. ",
            "\u00a0I think that a strength of this course that that it provided a nice overview of ancient philosophical texts.  \r\nHowever, I oftentimes found the grading arbitrary, frustrating, and highly subjective depending on the TA that graded/read the paper that you handed in.  Sometimes TAs would provide conflicting information, about how to improve your writing.  While one TA would tell you to write a certain way, another would tell you that it was wrong, and then you'd end up with points off your paper either way.  Additionally, I sometimes found the grading of my papers excessively nitpicky and it was frustrating because I felt that no matter how many TAs I met with to improve my work or how hard I tried to change my writing, I didn't see this reflect in the grades that I received on my successive essays, and it was very discouraging as the semester carried on.  Maybe communication between TAs would improve this?  Or perhaps taking personal improvement more into account when grading and lessening randomization? ",
            "\u00a0This course had strong teaching by the TA's and the professor. It could be improved by a more consistent grading scale for papers. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: this is a survey course with a lot of materials -- you'll definitely have learned a lot at the end of the semester\r\n\r\nWeakness: the lectures sometimes diverge from the most important content and is a little unorganized ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: insightful professor\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: harsh grading ",
            "\u00a0The grading in this course is ridiculously hard. The strengths are the class covers a lot of information and assigns a lot of reading. "

            "\u00a0Don't take this course unless you have to for the major. Readings are good, and essay's made me think, but the lectures are pretty boring and sections are poorly organized. You'll only get something out of this course if you do all the readings and read about them online. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course unless you are taking it to fill the requirement for the philosophy major. Lectures do not add much value if you do the reading, and there are better introductory philosophy courses offered. Grading is also much harsher even than most philosophy courses, and expectations for papers can differ between TAs. ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend it to people with philosophical-paper-writing experience. I think it's a really interesting and fun class, but it is more useful to build on knowledge than to help introduce it if that makes sense. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It has changed the way I have thought about so many things, and made my approach to debate much more systematic and persuasive. These were good things for me, and I believe they would be good things for others as well! ",
            "\u00a0If you enjoy writing very tight, precise essays about very particular philosophical questions, then you might enjoy this class. However, be warned that the grading can be arbitrary and, at times, perhaps too harsh (our second paper only had 2 A's out of the class of 40). ",
            "\u00a0Really frankly, I generally overall probably wouldn't. I think that if you are motivated enough to read the texts on your own, then that might be better than taking this class. I still think I made the right decision to take this class, but that's because I know I would not read these texts on my own without having a class make me read them. I think that if this class also provided support for learning how to think philosophically and argue philosophically, then this class might be worth it. The problem with this course is that it expects you to be able to learn all of the most difficult aspects of philosophy on your own, while just teaching you stuff you could read on your own. ",
            "\u00a0Inwood is a fantastic lecturer, and the course provides a very nice overview of the ancient Greek intellectual history. ",
            "\u00a0This depends. I took this class because 1) I was interested in philosophy to a glancing extent and 2) I wanted to take a writing credit which was writing about something interesting. If you are a philosophy major (I am not), I would say that you should absolutely take the course, as it will be right up your alley, and Inwood is a really good lecturer. If you are just tangentially interested in the subject, it's a toss up. The lectures are interesting and if you want to be a well rounded, classically trained liberal arts student, then it's probably worth it; otherwise, be prepared to deal with some less than helpful sections and confusing, sometimes contradictory comments on you papers. I'm glad I took this course, but now that I have the writing credit, I don't think I would take it again. ",
            "\u00a0Unless a student is looking to take this course as a prerequisite or has an extremely strong interest in ancient philosophy, I would not recommend this course. They will learn little unless they teach themselves (and, in doing so, defeat the purpose of taking this course in the first place), be frustrated by a confusing and punitive grading system, and frequently bored in class. It is unlikely that will finish the semester feeling like their time was well spent. ",
            "\u00a0Yes; I think it challenged me academically and forced me to reconsider my style of writing and its effectuality. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think that for the work put in there is a great amount of feedback and even though one may not receive a good grade the instructor tells the student how to improve which is so key. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are interested in the material, want a working background in western thought for another discipline, or even just want to learn how to write philosophical papers, this is a good course to take. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend to anyone seriously interested in ancient philosophy. This class is very demanding, however, so I would not recommend if you are interested in it only for the texts. ",
            "\u00a0The texts covered in this course provide an important foundation for the philosophy major.  The amount of reading is varies considerably week to week but is never overwhelming. ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested in the history of Western thought, then you will find this course interesting. The course teaches you to sift through ancient philosophical works, which aren't always concisely or plainly written, and distill and critically analyze the main ideas. The works range from profound to being clearly absurd and wrong, though the challenge is in being able to articulate why exactly you think that way. Section discussions can be fun, but often not as rigorous as I would have liked. \r\n\r\nThis course is required for the philosophy major, but it will not give you an entirely accurate picture of what other philosophy courses are like - the nature of the material covered in this course (ambitious, all encompassing ideas) makes it hard to analyze with the same rigor as more modern philosophy papers. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would if you have an interest in ancient philosophy. However I would warn that it is not really applicable to life, and would advise modern philosophy for that. ",
            "\u00a0I wouldn't recommend this class unless it's a class that is necessary for you to take, or unless it's a subject matter that you were already interested in to begin with.  As the semester progressed, I found the material less and less interesting, and increasingly repetitive. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course was a great introduction to ancient Greek philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0A great class if you are interested in ancient philosophy. I think it's helpful to have some knowledge of ancient philosophy for a philosophy major, but the content may not be very relatable. "
