            "\u00a0I learnt to research a paper, to produce a claim that is original, corrective and contestable. I learnt to really think about my argument and my own motivations for making them, which I feel can really influence their strengths. ",
            "\u00a0I basically learned how to write well and better understand where I needed to improve from Robinson's feedback. ",
            "\u00a0The course was good preparation to write academic papers on nonfiction topics at a collegiate level. ",

            "\u00a0This course has NO weaknesses. Don't think. Just Take it.  Professor Robinson does a marvellous job of giving you feedback and genuinely wants to help you improve your writing. ",
            "\u00a0A major strength was the feedback I received on each of my drafts. I do wish that we were able to submit the full first draft of the final essay and obtain feedback on that as many of the other sections did. Besides that, there were not necessarily any other weaknesses from what I could tell. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very well taught and executed. The flow of the material and the assignments was very fluid and manageable. ",
            "\u00a0The discussion based seminar was engaging and the class provided a lot of opportunities to get feedback. It might be better if the whole class participated in discussions rather than just a few students. ",
            "\u00a0Some essays had vague guidelines. It might be by design but really tripped me up in the beginning. "

            "\u00a0YES. It is an amazing, thought-provoking, entertaining, and extremely rewarding course. Do take it if you can get the chance. You'll learn so much much about writing, and about finding and polishing your own voice ",
            "\u00a0I would. Censorship and the Arts is a hidden gem among all of the thirty-something 114 sections. In general, Robinson was relatively understanding and flexible in terms of deadlines, and listened to student feedback fairly well. Overall, he was great prof who designed a great course, and I definitely recommend his section. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, great class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes TR is an amazing professor, workload is light and you learn a lot ",
            "\u00a0Yes, of course. If you can take 114 with Professor Robinson, do it. He's an amazing professor, so kindhearted and in love with what he does. It's not a terrible writing credit by any stretch of the imagination. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is a good course if ou want to become more confident in writing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The professor was incredibly funny and knowledgeable. You'll have a good time. "
