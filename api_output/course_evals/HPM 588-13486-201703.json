            "\u00a0Great course.  Excellent overview of topics in public health law.  However, requires a lot of reading and time.  Do not take this course if you do not have an interest in this topic. ",
            "\u00a0While the readings for each week were daunting, I really learned so much about how the law and policy can be utilized (or abused) for public health purposes. Especially considering today's political climate, I think Shelley's course is ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL to any student entering the public health profession. Having a limited civics and law background, I not only learned more generally about how federal law and state law interact, but also just how to be a more informed citizen. However, there is no denying Shelley assigns A LOT of readings. While they are all incredibly interesting and useful and I can see why they might all be seen as essential, I think concessions can definitely made, especially with the textbook passages. I think class time might be used more effectively, too, so we don't have to do as much outside work to understand the concepts. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent course that provided lots of information.  \r\n\r\nCould pare down the topics.  Too many readings and topics, would have been better to focus on a few and discuss those in more detail in class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths \r\n-Crams good portion of law school information into one semester! (powers of different branches of government at both state and local level) \r\n-Final project allows us to apply lessons to a topic we're passionate about \r\n-Excellent teaching \r\n-Seminar style (30 students was max size it should be in my opinion) \r\n\r\nWeaknesses \r\n-Daunting amount of reading, never was able to get to all of it (helped that Shelley starred high priority readings) ",
            "\u00a0Interesting weekly lecture, lots of thought-provoking readings. Challenging material but you will get a lot out of this course. ",
            "\u00a0The course had a lot of reading, which was sometimes a struggle to finish and then to remember. But the course covers a lot of material and is a wonderful introduction to public health law. While it was stressful at times, I do not at all regret taking it. ",
            "\u00a0This class has taught me more than any other class at Yale. Shelley is amazing, and I wish I could spend more time with her to soak up her knowledge and worldview. However, this comes at a heavy price. The class is more work than you can imagine. It will take up your weekend, all weekend, every weekend. I think I've spent about half my time this semester working on this class alone. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent and informative course, a must for understanding the laws that drive public health policy. ",
            "\u00a0There's no course like it and I think it is essential to understanding and having a good background public health. ",
            "\u00a0The course has a difficult goal - it has to familiarize public health students with a lot of legal literature and jargon and has to do it in weeks when law students get semesters to familiarize themselves. Because of the sheer amount of information you have to get through, the course can seem tough but it is also really informative and a good way to get a foundation in how the law can be used to advance public health. ",
            "\u00a0The course was really interesting and covered a lot of different topics that aren't taught in any other course at YSPH. However, I thought Shelley was attempting to teach too much information, which meant that I would walk away from class unsure of what I had really just learnt. If the class focused more on broad concepts that are applicable to public health practitioners, instead of the detailed nuances of the law, that would be more conducive to learning. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly, I cannot imagine my first semester without this course. Public Health Law gave me tools and knowledge to better engage with the material of my other courses; likewise, the tools and skills acquired in those other courses allowed for me to better grapple with this material--and, in particular, the final \"toolbox\" project. Case in point: in prepping for that project, I read epidemiological studies (using skills gained in Intro to Epidemiology), considered the economic solutions for common resources (Introduction to Microeconomics), and reviewed the role and powers of CMS (Introduction to Health Policy & Systems). Each of these courses cross-pollinated in their own ways of course, but no other course pushed me to reach into my own personal toolbox quite like this course did.\r\n\r\nAs for the material per se, it was engaging, challenging, and meaningful. I came out of this course feeling like I had a much greater understanding of our government, its players, and our role as individuals within all this.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses? I wish class met more often; I felt the group projects were great and would have appreciated more; some weeks did have a lot of reading. But these are all minor quips. This is a fantastic class. ",
            "\u00a0You can tell that Shelley dedicated herself towards constructing an informative and innovative course, suitable for those both new to law and who have a background in it. Class discussions are invigorating, and we are exposed to a variety of topics. However, there is information overload that makes it difficult for us to retain many of the things we learn. I think it may be helpful to better emphasize key information we definitely should know, and then speed more supplementary information. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent course. Well-planned and expertly delivered. It was clear that Shelley cares so much about her students. I learned so much. ",
            "\u00a0I think the class was a bit larger than ideal, which would get worse next year with the increased class size. It was difficult to have discussions when there are so many people. It would have been far more interesting and engaging if we were able to engage in more discussions!\r\n\r\nThe final project was interesting and fun, but too heavy loaded toward the end of the term. If this could somehow be distributed throughout the semester, that would be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0This course is super interesting and Shelley makes is very relevant to current affairs. It is a ton of reading which you need to do if you want to be engaged in the class. I think it would be better as a smaller size, to allow for more discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing course with tons of great info to help supplement other MPH courses from a different perspective (law). ",
            "\u00a0I think the concepts that we stressed were the ones that were interesting to the students in the class, which is important, but I wish I understood all of them equally as well.  I think the legislative branch was a little glossed over.  \r\nI was really disappointed by the lack of participation from other students.  There were people who didn't speak except in their final presentations and I would have really liked to have heard their perspectives.  I think people should have been pushed to speak more--or the class should have been smaller--or if it was clear you would have to speak in class, perhaps fewer people would have taken it who were wary about participating. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a LOT of work, and sometimes the content went over my head because the readings were so dense and material in class was covered very quickly. However, the slides were very informative and looking back over them after class provided clarity on the material. This class was very different than others I had taken before, especially since I had never taken any sort of law class. Overall, it was a great (but very intense) first exposure to public health and the law. ",
            "\u00a0Incredibly difficult content to teach especially considering the current changing (reckless?) landscape of our government. Fabulous introduction into what a law course would be like but very difficult to keep up with the pace of information being given. I spent all weekend trying to catch up on readings and never managed to finish them all (which looking back on was a great learning experience to have had figuring out how to pick and choose and scan for pertinent information). The class could better be given split into two days a week because so much information is thrown at us over 2 hours, impossible to take in all of it with how fast everything was coming at us.  I really liked how feedback was provided to us and how Shelley actually red the responses every week, frequently quoting students responses in class and using examples from our work. ",
            "\u00a0We received a lot of information in Public Health Law, but the course load and the information shared was overwhelming to the point that it was difficult to retain the material. "

She provides students with so much individual attention and guidance, and helped me so much in creating my final toolbox project. If she came across an article relevant to my topic, she would send it right over to me. She is just so encouraging, patient, and understanding, not to mention very knowledgeable about the law and passionate about public health, which comes through in the lectures. If anything, take the class because of Shelley! ",

She takes the time to learn students' names and interests. She goes out of her way to send us resources and tell us about events that we may be interested in. \r\n\r\nI appreciated that a professor thought of me (rare at YSPH) and made me feel like an individual, rather than another face in the audience. She is truly inspirational, as a professional and a general human being- I want to be Shelley Geballe when I grow up! ",

            "\u00a0I can't say enough good things about Shelley. She is so intelligent, kind, and concerned for students' wellbeing. She is an inspiration. The only weakness that I see is that she loves to read so much that she may not understand how much of a burden her weekly responses are to students, who have less time and less drive to read constantly.

            "\u00a0Shelley was a great professor! \r\nHer assignment were a bit scattered in nature and the prompts for reading reflections were always slightly unclear. But she listens to every students thoughts and provides incredibly insightful feedback. She also knows about so many things! This made discussions in class always very enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0I wrote a lot above so I'll keep this brief. Shelly is the kind of professor you enroll in a program for. Her lectures are informative, her discussions well-conducted, her reading lists impeccably curated. She will key you into readings/events/discussions relevant to your interests and goals. Shelly is amazing, full stop. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing. Does everything she can do not only ensure her students learn as much as they can in Public Health Law, but also guides them on their professional and academic journeys. Very genuine professor. ",
            "\u00a0No weaknesses. Shelley is the best! She puts so much time into each one of her students, makes an effort to meet individually with each one at the start of the semester, and provides continuous guidance and feedback as students work on their final projects. Although she assigned too much reading, I always wanted to do it because every reading was carefully selected and offered something valuable. ",
            "\u00a0Shelley is a fantastic and very knowledgeable instructor! ",
            "\u00a0Shelley is one of the most caring and passionate professors at YSPH. She is an excellent professor, I only wish the class was smaller so would have gotten to interact with her more. ",
            "\u00a0Knowledgeable and challenging instructor that always pushed our class to achieve at the highest level. Rather than toning down the material Shelley pushed us to learn and experiment with examining law from a public health perspective. ",
            "\u00a0Shelley is great!  The powerpoints are very detailed and I referred back to them a lot. \r\n The readings were comprehensive and relatable, albeit large in number.  But I felt I learned a lot from the readings.  Sometimes I had a hard time hearing, but not always.  I wish we had discussed the readings in particular in more depth in class. ",
            "\u00a0Shelley is a wonderful instructor. You could tell she really cared about each of her students, and was invested in our toolbox project topics as well as getting to know us. However, sometimes I felt that her expectations were a bit too high for us students, especially in terms of how much reading was assigned each week. Shelley did do a good job of highlighting the most important readings and laying out each week in a logical manner, but sometimes the sheer amount was still overwhelming. Despite the course load, how much Shelley cares about her students and this class really shows through and was good encouragement to keep doing the readings! Thank you challenging us and pushing us to keep digging! ",
            "\u00a0Went above and beyond to help us out and be an incredible instructor. Never had a class in which a professor invested so much of her time and energy into the students and our work. I don't understand how she did it. Was always available to chat, provided thoughtful feedback, and challenged us in the way in which I hoped grad school would. Really wish she was teaching in the spring. I really like how she continually asked for feedback and actually implemented what the students told her. Also how she provided helpful review materials after lectures to assist in swallowing the information. \r\nIf theres any way possible, there needs to be a reduction of content in the course. Lectures were very interesting but Shelley was always racing against the clock having to speed through lectures, making it very difficult to follow if you hadn't read all the readings (which was very difficult considering the amount). ",
            "\u00a0Shelley is absolutely amazing. She is incredibly dedicated to her students and goes above and beyond whenever she can. I loved being in her class - her passion for the topic makes the discussions so engaging. She values student input and encourages thoughtfulness. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Geballe is very knowledgable, smart and kind, but the work load for her course is incredible. I think she sometimes forgets that we're all have at least four other courses to handle. "

It will be applicable to any career choices you make, so it is good to be acquainted with the principles of the law.  More knowledge in this area will only make you a stronger public health professional.  However, it should not be taken lightly.  It is a lot of reading, and you should be prepared to participate. ",
