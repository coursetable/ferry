            "\u00a0This class enabled me to apply my humanities oriented mindset into a scientific setting. I explored science from the lens of a writer. ",
            "\u00a0This course reignited my love for writing and made me both a better reader and a better writer. My word choice became more precise, my structuring became clearer, and my analysis grew more pointed. Additionally, we were exposed to many amazing Yale resources, including the Cushing Brain Library, the British Art Museum, and the pathology lab at Yale New Haven. I loved what we read, loved the ways that we wrote (varying from op-ed to science \"news\" piece to longer form essays), and I loved Professor Epstein's energy and insights. ",
            "\u00a0We learned how to write about scientific topics for lay audiences. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about a few different methods that writers use to communicate science and medicine to the general public. This included short science news stories, patient profiles, and a long magazine style feature piece. I also gained experience with the process of reaching out to and interviewing patients, doctors, and scientists for these stories. ",
            "\u00a0I became a much more concise writer and learned how to write about people which I reall enjoyed ",
            "\u00a0I learnt how to approach writing as a craft and identify the individual elements that are important considerations e.g., the appropriate use of adverbs, how to write a good lede, how to incorporate scientific facts into the storyline without losing the reader. I got insight into using Yale's resources better because Professor Epstein arranged activities related to the British art gallery, the Yale New Haven Hospital pathology lab, and the Cushing Brains center. I got to think about improving endings and making the reader think through your writing. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to be able to learn from the writings of others. Professor Epstein shares student pieces throughout the classes and I learned to adapt the way someone weaves in a coherent metaphor, or the way a person uses a particular lede to jump into a topic, into my own writing. She does a good job of introducing you to some formulaic writing to serve as a guide for writing Op-Ed pieces, longer form writing, etc. ",
            "\u00a0- Learned about organization and clarity in writing\r\n- Learned about the importance of word choice\r\n- Learned about the importance of the audience in writing\r\n- Learned to analyze writing techniques\r\n- Learned that, when analyzing writing, there is great value in re-reading the work\r\n- Learned to minimize the use of adverbs\r\n- Learned how to interview people\r\n- Learned about ledes, conclusions, and \"gold coins\"\r\n- Got better at taking and using feedback\r\n- Became a stronger and more advanced writer overall; this class was a great next step after ENGL 1124 ",
            "\u00a0I have learned how to write clearer and how to structure different kinds of papers depending on what is the purpose and audience of the paper. I have learned how to present scientific information to a lay audience and how to humanize medicine and science. I have also learned how to read closely and analyze texts. ",
            "\u00a0This class teaches you to write. I know this is what all English classes are supposed to do, but this class actually focuses on the craft of writing. You will learn how to use words with precision, how to structure a piece, how to turn hard science into digestible material, and how to write an interesting article without sensationalizing. ",
            "\u00a0I was given new ways to evaluate and improve my own writing, and I became a more critical reader of medical writing in general. ",
            "\u00a0How to write about medicine to lay audiences in more persuasive and compelling ways. "

            "\u00a0This course was very exciting and variable with the assignments and group sessions outside of class time. No weaknesses in my opinion. ",
            "\u00a0This course is incredible if you want a unique English course that will teach you to write better while focusing on medical/public health writing. You do not need to be pre-med to enjoy this course by any means. Its strengths include exposure to a variety of cool resources, types of writing, authors, and speakers. It is very time-consuming, however, and sometimes has meetings outside of class. That would be its only weakness. If your schedule is super booked, you may not get everything out of this course that you otherwise would. ",
            "\u00a0One of the biggest strengths is Professor Epstein. As a medical writer who also went to medical school, she has a great perspective on the subject matter of the course and is a fantastic source of information. She went out of her way to enhance the course experience, reaching out to her many connections in the world of medicine to set up cool experiences for the class. We had a few guest speakers come speak to us, and we also got to visit a pathology lab and get a private tour of the Cushing Brain Collection. \r\n\r\nIn terms of the actual writing, the course is set up to spend a couple weeks each on learning about certain type of medical writing before moving on to something else. This was great in the sense that it gave me exposure to a wide range of styles, but in some cases it left me wanting to spend a little longer on certain topics. Perhaps that's the point though, since now I'm intrigued and interested in learning more about a subject which I had little knowledge of before this semester. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course because the work is pretty spread out and you are constantly engaged in writing. I also appreciated the different writing styles and type of pieces that we explored through reading archetypical writers such as Lewis Thomas and writing assignments such as drama, opinion pieces, and patient stories etc. At the start of the semester, we had interesting writing exercises in class which were helpful. However, I think that sometimes the discussions were more directed than was necessary. ",
            "\u00a0The course allows you to have access to many parts of Yale that you otherwise will not have a chance to experience. Some of the places that we went to this semester are the Cushing Brain Collection in the Medical School Library, Pathology Lab at Yale New Haven Hospital, Yale Center for British Art, etc. For the final project and through a patient profile, you will get to (and have an excuse to) interview patients, doctors, and other medical professionals. For me the doors that it opened up was the biggest strength. The weakness for me was that at times the writing assignments were not necessarily clearly outlined. She does send emails with some details about what she wants, but would be helpful to have a document with assignment instructions for each writing assignment with topic, word count, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- Good readings from well-known, advanced writers\r\n- Interesting how the class doesn't just ask for basic essays on a topic, but rather essays with particular formats and styles (opinion piece, patient profile, news story, etc.); really helps bring students out of comfort zones and forces them to analyze new ways of writing\r\n- Teaches very practical skills\r\n- Workshops are structured well, though time management should improve\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Readings were sometimes long and/or numerous, to the point that it was hard to have time to analyze them fully; try trimming down\r\n- Not enough student involvement in class; can easily feel more like a lecture than a seminar; try encouraging students to talk more ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the class is that it is laid out very well. Professor Epstein has developed a syllabus that touches upon many different kinds of papers and essays. We also read a lot of different kinds of texts, ranging from short essays to novels. One of the weaknesses of the class is that sometimes for the papers, I felt like I didn't have enough guidance. For example, for the final paper, there was no rubric or really any written description on what kind of purpose we were supposed to accomplish in writing it. But maybe that was the point of the paper - to choose whatever topic and purpose we wanted. ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus was excellent, and Prof. Epstein made her advice concrete compared to other English classes and therefore more useful. Prof. Epstein also goes above and beyond to make herself available to speak with students and connect them with resources at Yale. Getting to hear her perspectives on various writers and topics we discussed was a highlight of the course, as were the guest speakers and field trips she arranged. As for weaknesses, I personally don't like quick, in-class writing very much, which we did at times, but I also see the benefits. The deadlines felt a little bit close together at times, but switching to Saturday due dates helped this a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Epstein is the true strength of this course. She cares about every student and gives extremely helpful and constructive feedback for all assignments. The course could be improved if the readings were chosen to be a bit more relevant to our writing assignments. Especially in the second half of the semester, the readings felt more disconnected from the writing we were doing. "

            "\u00a0I already have recommended this course to everyone because it takes one subject and looks at it through another subject's lens, thus providing a class where students of multiple backgrounds and different interests can all enjoy and excel in. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It was my favorite course this year, and possibly of my time at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. As a STEM student, I have plenty of experience with scientific writing, yet little experience in communicating complex science to a general audience. It turns out this is pretty difficult. After this course, I am a lot more confidant in my ability to convey correct, precise science to a general audience, while still making it accessible and interesting. The course was relatively low stress and fun, as well. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Professor Epstein really focusses on specific parts of your writing, down to your sentence structure. She helps you write formulaically in a way that makes your essay seamless. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants to think systematically about writing, refine their style and get great feedback on their progress. I have always been curious about medicine so this was a really fun class for me! I also got to write about a topic which was meaningful for me. I interviewed a physician and a patient and incorporated the science into the story as well. As a STEM major, I don't usually think about the human aspect of medicine but this class opened my eyes to the pain of patients and the struggle of health providers to support them. ",
            "\u00a0I will strongly recommend this class. You have to be willing to put in the work for it as there are assignments due every week. Some of them are framed as short pieces, but they ended up taking a long time for me. Sometimes this constant weekly assignment was became kind of stressful, but as Professor Epstein says, the joy in writing is sometimes having written something (as opposed to the act of writing itself). The class will expose you to a number of amazing medical writers, Atul Gawande, Siddhartha Mukherjee, etc as well as a chance to read Middlesex, which was a superb book. I have started to read other pieces by some of these writers on my own time. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! It's a great class to take after doing an introductory writing course. It challenged my writing in ways that no other writing course ever has. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student if they are interested in science and medicine. Coming as a STEM person who did not really enjoy reading or writing, having all the course materials centered around medicine and science made the class more engaging and enjoyable. Reading the texts were easier because they were about topics I was interested in. Also, writing was easier because I was writing about topics I was passionate about. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I am not a writer by any means but i got a lot out of this course and saw my writing improve leaps and bounds over the course of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0This is an excellent course, whether you are pre-med or just interested in medical writing. Prof. Epstein has a lot of connections at the medical school that she uses to help you with interviews for your final paper which makes it a more rewarding experience than a normal term paper. You also get to go on some really cool field trips to the medical school and listen to interesting guest speakers. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Professor Epstein will guide you to become a better writer, and you'll leave the semester with tools to make your writing--whether or not it's about medicine--stronger, more concise, and more compelling. There are a lot of writing assignments, and with all the re-writes, there is barely ever a week off without a deadline. Although the workload was heavier than I expected, consistency in writing is good. I left the course feeling more confident in my writing skills, especially as it pertains to conveying science and medicine to lay audiences. Professor Epstein is truly amazing--witty, sarcastic, engaged, supportive, and full of fascinating stories from her own career in writing and journalism. ",
            "\u00a0The course looks at different writing styles, and Professor Epstein is great at helping you become a better writer. "
