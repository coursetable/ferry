            "\u00a0Very interesting topics covered. I liked the mix of presentations on implementation science as well as basic research. My favorite lecture was the lecture given by Dr. Manisha Juthani - her presentation on basic research, public health practice, and being resilient in the face of failure in science was extremely practical and engaging. I would like to see even more lectures on topics that directly apply to public health practice. Also, it would be nice if the lunch options could be more varied. Alternating weeks of pizza and sandwiches became tiresome. ",
            "\u00a0If we have one more lecture on trypanosomes I might just die. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: exposed us to a broad range of subfields within public health\r\nWeakness: We only had pizza and subs :( the subs really decreased in quality, and occasionally had no vegetarian options (other than the salad--which is not really filling). We really missed the pasta from the first semester, and would like to see a more diverse array of food (other departments get Indian food!!) ",
            "\u00a0I enjoy the topics, but its very difficult to follow whats being discussed since my biology knowledge isnt very strong yet. The papers are helpful, but I would appreciate if the lectures were a little more simple or if we had a chance to discuss the papers informally. ",
            "\u00a0the food diversity can be improved ",
            "\u00a0I think its unnecessary and excessive to require students in their 20s to attend a \"mandatory\" seminar on a weekly basis.  Between 5 courses, summer practicum requirements, other mandatory seminars, networking, extra-curricular activities, and assessing future graduate programs or employment opportunities it seems unnecessary to demand students attend lectures on subject matter they may not even be interested in learning about.  I'm not saying the speakers are not wonderful but I am saying it is excessive to ask students to commit time out of their busy schedules to humor a speaker on a subject they may not care about it.  If anything, the seminar should be optional so that students who are interested can choose to attend and those who are not can opt out.  This ensures that the speakers are actually receiving an engaged audience and not flustered graduate students. ",
            "\u00a0Great speakers brought in this semester, including Ann Schuchat!! I feel so grateful to be in a program where such esteemed researchers come to present to me for a required course. ",
            "\u00a0good ",
            "\u00a0This course could be more engaging.  Unfortunately, classes in the EMD MPH program are not actually focused on high level micro research.  Not everybody in this course has a strong micro background, and even those that do have the background do not have a strong understanding of all of these topics.  Many talks were hard to focus on as they went over my head. Classes either need to change to expose students to this information, or the seminar should focus on talks more geared to what we know from class.  A wider range of public health practice talks would be nice as well so that students can be exposed to a variety of public health career options possible with EMD, such as inviting a state or local level infectious disease epidemiologist.  This semester did have more public health practice than last, but some of the research topics were still difficult for many students to follow. ",
            "\u00a0Some speakers have been excellent and others have been average in terms of presenting their work in an engaging manner. I liked how different areas of infectious diseases were explored and would like to see this sort of variation continued. Areas such as foodborne illness, healthcare-associated infections, bioterrorism, and antimicrobial resistance can be further explored. I would encourage bringing more speakers from peer institutions such as Columbia, Johns Hopkins, Emory, etc. Not to say that the Yale speakers were lacking in any way, but some of them have already given guest lectures in our elective courses. \r\n\r\nSide note: the food could be improved. The pizza is great as always but the sandwiches have lots of room for improvement. ",
            "\u00a0Good variety of academic researchers and industry leaders. ",
            "\u00a0Informative to learn about other research ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated that this semester, there were more talks about applied public health. ",
            "\u00a0Useful course, I really liked the selection of guest speakers and I definitely appreciate the inclusion of speakers that were more practice-based. The topics speakers chose to discuss were interesting. "

            "\u00a0Dr. Weinberger is a sweet, caring, brilliant individual. My qualms with this course are not with the professors leading it or the speakers they obtain.  My frustration is with the mandatory nature of the material considering the overwhelming nature of a graduate program. ",
            "\u00a0good ",
            "\u00a0It was uncomfortable when the professor of the class in the room after seminar would come into the room and wait for us to leave when we should have been out of the room.  It would be past the time the class should end, and EMD students and faculty were still asking questions, even past the start time of the next class.  Next semester, professors either need to book the room for a longer period of time to have a safety net or make sure to end on time.  It was not fair to the class after us and made us feel uncomfortable.  I understand not wanting to cut off a guest speaker, but sometimes, it is necessary. ",
            "\u00a0Dan and Sunil are incredibly nice. Both of them seemed to have strong relationships with the speakers (both from Yale and outside of Yale). ",

            "\u00a0I would tell them not to take it but alas that isn't feasible considering the mandatory nature of it.  I think its exciting if you want to attend a lecture here and there that pertains to your interests but otherwise it feels like an inappropriate use of time. ",

            "\u00a0Since it is required, I can't really give an actual recommendation. Like any course based on guest speakers, there are some really interesting ones and some that are slightly boring. To get the most out of this course, I recommend asking questions either in-person or through email. This course is a good opportunity to approach faculty for research during the year or summer, and the instructors do a good job inviting speakers with a broad spectrum of interests. Even if the speaker's interests don't align with yours, it's always interesting to hear about different fields. ",
            "\u00a0Would recommend. Get to hear many leaders in the field give applied talks about their work. ",

            "\u00a0This seminar introduced and allowed discussion of pertinent and novel topics in infectious disease epidemiology. I would recommend this seminar to other students, particularly in the EMD field. However, some topics did incorporate topics and techniques from other departments. "
