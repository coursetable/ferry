            "\u00a0Not many. In theory we should have developed a working capacity in R, but this was never taught in class. The only actual teaching occurred outside of the scheduled class time at a time that was not known until after the semester started and schedules were locked in, making it impossible to actually attend the R lessons that as far as I could tell were the only element of the class that positively contributed to the development of any kind of meaningful knowledge or skill. ",
            "\u00a0Various facets of development economics, such as health, microfinance, migration, etc. Significant emphasis on methodology and empirics, such as RCTs, OLS regression analysis, natural experiments, etc. Working knowledge of R and creating data visualization plots. ",

            "\u00a0Learned about economic development strategies in south east Asia as well as improving my skills with the R programming language. ",
            "\u00a0While this class is described as a development economics course, it really was focused on econometric methods and programming in R. You do learn about different development issues, but each class was focused on analyzing the empirical methods of papers more than anything else. ",
            "\u00a0This class is an overview of current economic research on development economics. I think I learned a lot about current methods being used in development economics studies by reading the papers assigned for the class (which are also discussed in lecture). The PSets taught me a fair amount about R. ",

            "\u00a0This class was misleading in description, horrifically organized, and totally arbitrary in how it was graded. On the first note, this should not be described as a class about development economics so much as a class about critiquing papers from a statistical perspective. Organization was absolutely terrible. The assignments for the class required knowledge of R, material that was only taught outside of regular class time (the timing of which was not even given until after schedules were locked in, making it impossible to attend the R sessions in some cases). The assignments had effectively nothing to do with what was being taught in the classroom and beyond that were hugely time consuming to a stupid degree. I think the best way to sum up the way this class was organized was the fact that the final group project was literally assigned over Thanksgiving break, making it totally impossible to actually work as a group. I have never seen a worse organized class in 4 years at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course comes from the solid syllabus. The course topics were well-delineated, and the course's pace was just about alright. \r\nAs for the weaknesses, I must say that the quality of teaching did not do justice to the syllabus. The professor covered some of the initial topics in a cursory manner, notably the growth models and the methods sections, but the later exams tested them in much greater depth than the professor did in his lectures. The problem sets and the exams also tested knowledge that was not covered in the lectures but went beyond the scope of current prerequisites for the course. The greatest frustration I had with this course was the data visualization project. I understand that the professor tried to keep its scope deliberately broad to not constrain the students, but I wish there had been more concrete guidelines provided on what the posters should contain, what the presentation should cover, and what good data visualization plots entail. Having to work on it during Thanksgiving break was also a bummer. A way to improve on this would be provide a clear rubric for the project. ",
            "\u00a0- It was VERY demanding at times. I did not like the model of only having two psets. I find it helpful to learn from psets each week/every other week. I like building off of the knowledge from last week's pset to complete this week's pset. This set-up did not allow us to do that. I'm worried that the net effect will be a weaker understanding of R.\r\n- The heavy emphasis on group projects is not the best. Some people Credit-D the course and do not put in enough effort, which only reflects poorly on the people taking the course for a letter grade. There was also no way of reviewing your group members so everyone received the same grade on the group project even when one of them (who is taking the course for a letter grade) was not present for any of it. ",
            "\u00a0We weren't really taught how to use R despite needing to use it extensively. ",
            "\u00a0If you already have a good understanding of statistics (how to interpret regression results tables - standard errors, t-statistics, etc.) it can be pretty dry because a large portion of the course was professor Barnett-Howell teaching these concepts to students without an econ background. Classes were not the most engaging with professor Barnett-Howell lecturing for most of them from his slides (which were very detailed and helpful for the tests). Feedback received on the problem sets was not very clear, which I understand is difficult for code-based problem sets, but it was notably worse than I have received in other econometrics and S&DS courses. ",
            "\u00a0This course was poorly designed, largely due to the structure of assignments. During this semester, there were two problem sets (each worth 10% of the grade), a group midterm review presentation of about 5 mins (10%), midterm (20%), a poster presentation in which we were supposed to do data visualizations (30%), and a final (20%). Although, the psets rhythm seemed initially appealing, the problem sets themselves were difficult and not enough information was provided on how to complete them. It was assumed that students would know R well enough to complete them and do things like simulations but little guidance was given on this. In addition, the exams were extremely long, although we only had 75 minutes to complete it: the midterm was 8 pages and the final was 10. Questions were weighted unequally so that you often didn't realize that a question had negligible weight toward your results until you approached the end of time. Despite our requests to make exams short, and the TF doing her best to push this idea, the professor did not change the exams. The poster presentation was also unreasonable. We were given information for it two Thursdays before Thanksgiving break and a problem sent that we were given that same week was due the Thursday before break. Some groups were expected to present the week following break but here's the catch: it was a *group* using R project based on incomplete data AND  we had to print out a scientific poster like the ones used for real research. So essentially we had to do a group project with very little time to do the actual group portion because we were on break. Throughout the semester, it seemed like the Prof Barnett-Howell had unrealistic expectations about how a class should be run and what students needed to succeed and actually retain information. We were all really thankful to have Paula, the TF, along the way to reassure us. She did her best with what she was given and made herself available for support. ",
            "\u00a0I think overall this was a very good course. The biggest strength was the strong content and my interest level in the subject matter. One suggestion would be to ensure we have the resources to succeed. For instance, the R sessions were not quite enough to do the PSets. Giving some in-class lecture time to key things in R would have been useful, especially before the final project. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: you read a lot of research papers and learn more about how to analyze data through R\r\nWeaknesses: really boring and not very helpful information ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The lecture is interesting and you can get away with not doing the readings and still sitting through it.\r\nWeaknesses: The tests are too long and too hard.  The PSets are too long.  The professor assigned a research project to essentially be done over thanksgiving break.\r\n\r\nOverall, the class could be improved by having a more sympathetic instructor.  All of the weaknesses stem from the fact that the expectations of the class were a bit unreasonable. ",
            "\u00a0The class had a very engaging professor and the lectures were very interesting. I found the problem sets to be very long and time consuming. The problem sets required a proficiency with R that was more advanced than what was taught in section and that seemed unreasonable for a class that expected no R experience. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n1. All the topics were inherently interesting because they were about lived experiences of people in South Asia\r\n2. I learned about South Asia, which I previously knew very little about since so few classes cover this geographic region\r\n3.  Prof Barnett-Howell and Paula were both incredibly responsive and approachable. I felt comfortable asking questions in and out of the classroom.\r\n4. My peers in the course had a very collaborative attitude and we had a great sense of team wirk\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n1. The problem sets were very, very long. Because there are only two, it's hard to get started early enough, especially when the pset isn't posted until two weeks before its due. Even though I would begin right when it was posted, I found myself still working on it all night before they were due.\r\n2. The reason the psets were challenging was that it did not align with classroom teaching. It was similar to a computer science class in that sense. I think econ majors are not used to this, so disclaimers about this would be good. More frequent but shorter psets would be much preferable and in line with other econ classes.\r\n3. The final project guidelines were not shared with us until two weeks before the project was due, and one of the weeks was Thanksgiving break. We also had a pset due the week before Thanksgiving, which left us with barely any time to complete the project. It was difficult to work on a group project over break even though all my group members were very helpful. I would give much more guidance and time to complete the final project, which in itself is interesting. ",

            "\u00a0This is the singular worst class I have taken in 4 years at Yale. It is an embarrassment to the economics department and to the greater name of Yale University that this was offered as a class. I started this class very hopeful, as I have pursued a great deal of coursework within the field of development economics and was very excited about the prospect of getting to dive into the cutting edge side of the field. Rarely in my life have I ever been so disappointed. The semester that followed was one constantly plagued by this beast of a class. The 2 problem sets for the class had absolutely no relationship with anything taught in the classroom, were graded in an entirely arbitrary way, and consumed a massive amount of time--mostly because you were forced to teach yourself all of the material contained within the poorly written PSETs before you could actually attempt to complete the assignment. Then there were the two exams. Professor Barnett-Howell told us in the days leading up to the midterm that he \"had not finished it yet, but it will be long--probably very long.\" The one positive thing I can say about Barnett-Howell is that he is not a liar. No one was able to even get close to finishing the exam and afterward he decided to do some strange re-weighting of the points to make it more \"fair\" in a way that was never actually explained to the students. He clearly did not learn from this however, as the same pattern was followed for the final exam. Perhaps the worst thing about this class however, was that the final group project and presentation was assigned over Thanksgiving break. From time to time Yale professors may seem unreasonable, but never have I ever heard of someone assigning a project which requires group interaction over the one single week of the entire semester where it is impossible to meet with members of your group. I have never been so disappointed by Yale. If you are reading this that means this class is being offered again, so firstly DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES TAKE THIS CLASS, and secondly, please consider protesting the fact that this is even being offered again. I had to complete this class because I needed the credit, but there is still time for you to avoid the plague that is this class. ",
            "\u00a0No. I was very much looking forward to taking this class, and I am sad that it was a letdown. The arbitrary grading, sub-par teaching, and unclear guidelines on the exams, problem sets, and presentations immensely frustrated me over the semester. If you are interested in learning more about development economics, Yale has better classes on offer either at School of Management or Jackson Institute that are more pragmatic, more encompassing, and more clearly taught. If you are an economics major, you would be better off taking other electives in the economics department. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to another student - you need an extensive R background to succeed. ",
            "\u00a0The course needs some restructuring but I learned a lot and think it'll be a great class in a year or two. ",
            "\u00a0The class was pretty good; Dr. Barnett-Howell is very knowledgeable, but the p-sets and projects were super time intensive because there was a lack of structure to them. ",
            "\u00a0Only if you don't know that much about econometrics, otherwise you won't get that much out of it. ",

            "\u00a0Take this course if you are interested in the subject matter. It's well taught and the professor knows his stuff. However, expect a decent amount of work to do all of the PSets, final project, and studying for the exams. ",
            "\u00a0NO DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS ",
            "\u00a0A poorly taught class. Don't take it unless you have EXTREME interest in the subject matter. The majority of the class seemed to regret enrolling.  The problem sets were unnecessarily long, and required a strong working knowledge of R (which was not listed as a prerequisite).  The midterm and the final were extremely long (to the point where it was implied that you wouldn't get to all of the answers), which isn't fun to take part in. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend this class. It was very interesting and I learned a lot. If you are at all interested in development economics, Professor Barnett-Howell is captivating and lectures with the best of them. However, if you have no background in R, the problem sets will be challenging and time-consuming. If you're willing to spend extra hours in office hours and drop in R sessions and like programming, take it. Otherwise, maybe think twice, or credit D it. Also, putting grades on the normal econ distribution caused a lot of students to get competitive, as the class was about 25 students, many of whom really cared about getting an A. I'm not sure if this is the fault of the class or the students, but that atmosphere took away from the class at times. ",
            "\u00a0I would take this class if you are interested in developmental econ because it is such an important field. However, beware that while week to week work is low key, the times when there are psets due are rough. You will grind on these psets and the final project for a long time. Hopefully, you have great classmates like I did and really lean on each other for help because this class would otherwise be impossible. ",
