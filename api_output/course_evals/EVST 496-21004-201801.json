            "\u00a0The second semester of the EVST colloquium is much less structured. While my experience was overall very positive, I think it differs depending upon people's personal thesis advisers. The departmental dinners were fun and engaging, and I enjoyed getting to work with smaller groups of students in peer-editing. ",
            "\u00a0My one comment on the BS side was that it would be extremely helpful to meet with students at the end of junior year and pick a topic then.  Having the extra time during summer would be nice, but more importantly I think this would allow us to have a plan to complete data analysis during the fall semester, which was the most stressful/complicated/problematic part of the project.
