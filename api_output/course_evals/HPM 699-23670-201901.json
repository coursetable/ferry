            "\u00a0Loved hearing from prominent leaders in healthcare. I do with we were in a different space -- the roundtable format isn't sustainable given the number of students who regularly attend Colloquium. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Able to hear from a variety of high profile leaders in healthcare.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:  Lack of structure in the course.  Depending on the speaker, it can turn into an hour of \"let me tell you about my career\", with limited opportunity for student interaction.  Thursdays at 6:30pm is also not the most ideal time for the course given conflicts at SOM during this time as well as potential travel conflicts with recruiting. ",

            "\u00a0Excellent course and idea.  \r\nSome of the guests went off on tangents that had little value to me and I believe the rest of the students. It would have helped if someone could have helped steer the guests back to the point of the colloquium.\r\nThe guests should stay focused on what they do, their milestones in life, their set-backs, and how they got to where they are today.
