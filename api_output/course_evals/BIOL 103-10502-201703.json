            "\u00a0BIOL 103 has been the most rewarding course so far in the Biology sequence. Previously, I was not very confident in my ability to read scientific papers. But after taking BIOL 103, I now feel that I can understand almost any paper, even if it takes a lot of effort. BIOL 103 also granted me my first opportunity to write a research proposal. I put in A LOT of hours into my proposal, and it was one of the most creatively challenging STEM assignment I have ever had. I've learned so much from BIOL 103, and I feel that it has had a huge impact on my career decisions--I feel much more strongly about majoring in Bio than ever before. ",

            "\u00a0I loved how the course allowed a lot of room for coming up with our own research proposals. I felt like I had a creative outlet!\r\n\r\nThis course was very challenging and involved a lot of work, but I don't think it has any outstanding weaknesses. It is a very well-designed course. I just have one thing to point out--I didn't like how the final grades were determined. I think \"20% A / 20% A- / 20% B+ / 20% B / 20% B- and lower\" was reasonable, but it would be better if the grading was a more absolute--rather than relative--process. It would reduce stress and a sense of competition among students. ",

            "\u00a0The questions in this class, as in the rest of the biology sequence in my experience, are very poorly written and do not truly test the knowledge and insight that should be gained in this class. The class focuses on wanting to use the techniques we learn about experimentation and combine it with knowledge of genetics and development, but it is not often the case. The quizzes and finals usually contain a good amount of questions that require the memorization of the most minute detail in the slides. The questions are also often very vague, leaving them open to interpretation, but are graded based on one, correct interpretation which is impossible to discern during the test. ",
            "\u00a0This strong was well taught and structured. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures can be confusing and hard to keep up with. I personally took advantage of the peer tutors and enrichment which significantly helped my understanding of the topics. ",
            "\u00a0Terrific professor, the homework sequence was also really cool since each one built on the last. ",
            "\u00a0This course ties together many of the things we learned in BIOL 101 and 102, so that was a strength. A weakness is section and the scientific papers. Writing one was very informative, but reading them and tediously going over them in section was a waste of time compared to different methods of learning the same topics. Another strength is the organization of the course and the entire sequence. ",
            "\u00a0I think the best part of this course was actually the homework assignment.  While the lectures and discussion section readings were engaging, the homework assignment really set this course apart from my previous Yale biology courses.  I really enjoyed the process of working on one project week by week to create a final product I was fully immersed in and proud of. ",
            "\u00a0I think this was the best bio module yet; Vivian Irish was a solid lecturer and Sam Lin was a very organized course manager. The material was often engaging and the quizzes and homework were pretty fair. Not life-changing, but given that it's the intro bio sequence it could be a whole lot worse. That said, quizzes and homework pretend to assess how one would fare as a scientist, when they really involve memorization and presentation of information in a very specific manner that lines up much better with the way some people think than others. ",
            "\u00a0I think the homework assignment of designing an experiment is definitely a good idea - it's very unique and thought-provoking, and I felt like it was a great way to introduce students to research ideas. However, I feel like there could have been more guidance - often, it felt like I had no idea how to proceed. Maybe providing more examples or offering optional info sessions on how to structure parts of the proposal (or going over it in section) could help. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot and the weekly quizzes helped me stay on top of the course material but I thought the formatting of the quizzes and tests could be improved to better reflect the student's knowledge. The wording was often tricky and confusing and the quizzes were rushed. ",
            "\u00a0I think providing more practice questions, especially in the homework (which is currently just a research proposal), would be really helpful for preparing for the final exam. ",
            "\u00a0The class was super complicated from the beginning, and Prof Irish didnt make it easier to understand. Shes not the best at explaining concepts and dumbing down things ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: great professor, great content, very organized\r\nPerhaps more exam-style practice material would have come in handy, as the psets were not traditional ones. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the emphasis around the three types of experiments (catch it, break it, move it). ",
            "\u00a0The professor went through a lot of the material quite fast so it was hard to keep up. You would need to know some of the material beforehand in order to keep up. Maybe going through the lecture slides before class would help familiarize yourself with the material. ",
            "\u00a0This course was strong in the depth of certain topics. However, I feel like I do not know much about development, but rather about the details of a few specific examples. I cannot describe how an embryo develops into an adult, and I know very little about the actual process of gastrulation. I thought that genetics was covered more thoroughly, however, sometimes important topics were glassed over and given the same attention as esoteric facts/examples. Also, when Prof Irish made it so that a graphic appeared on the slide after clicking, it would not be on the printed out notes, which was super annoying. ",
            "\u00a0I feel as if there are almost too many resources in the bio sequence. I get muddled when I get information from all these different sources (lecture, section, piazza, readings, etc). Also, the lectures need to be improved so that they are more focused on fundamental topics rather than specific examples. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The organization of the course was great. Whenever I had questions, I knew what resources were available for me. While the homework was frustrating (especially initially when there are so much possibilities), I believe that having to work out a research proposal throughout the course was a strength because it allowed me to integrate what I learned in class into a project. In addition, it gave me a glimpse of what writing a research proposal would be like. In addition, Professor Irish, Professor Lin, and my TA were helpful in answering questions.\r\n\r\nWeakness: During times, some lectures felt rushed when we were pressed for time towards the end of the lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Good content. I liked the homework. Not a fan of the weekly quizzes. ",
            "\u00a0Strength is the organization and the professor. Irish is AMAZING and truly loves this material. Samantha Lin is incredible at organizing this course and I'm so grateful to have her as the coordinator for the BIOL modules. One weakness is that it does feel section is so unrelated at times because we go over research papers and it feels so rushed. I do appreciate that they are trying to model more of a journal club though! ",
            "\u00a0The lectures themselves were not bad, but the quizzes were pretty weird and the final exam to me seemed horrendously written (full of ambiguous statements, grammatical errors, etc). I think this course can be better at evaluating students in a way that doesn't feel as cutthroat and stressful. The material was not that complicated on its own, so it often felt like we were being evaluated on our propensity to make silly mistakes. I also felt like it could've gone into a little bit more detail - I feel like I learned the least amount of information in this class out of the 101-103 sequence so far. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Irish clearly knows a lot about bio but isn't the best lecturer. I think it would be better if she assumed none of us knew anything about bio and would just explain everything instead of skipping or glossing over important basics! ",
            "\u00a0very good TAs and professor ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: minimal work\r\nWeaknesses: many. The course is poorly taught. A strong background in genetics is assumed to do well. The slides are mostly just pictures with no words and are not explained. Quiz questions were obscure, poorly worded, and oftentimes meant to trick you. No clear feedback was given for quiz answers. ",
            "\u00a0I wish the sections were organized differently, I didn't get much out of section. Questions during lecture were always answered though, which was really nice. ",
            "\u00a0I think it was beneficial that the sections were devoted to reading and interpreting scientific papers and the homework to writing a research proposal. These are good skills for anyone interested in science research. ",

            "\u00a0The strengths include that the class is very straightforward and clear, with many opportunities to seek help if needed (Enrichment, Piazza, peer tutors, etc.). Also, I am a fan of the weekly quizzes in that they keep you on track throughout the semester and help you to digest the material gradually as opposed to in preparation for one stressful midterm. ",

            "\u00a0The homeworks were a lot more time consuming than the professor made it out to be. Also, I just wasn't a fan of the strict grading on an such open ended assignment. I felt as though there wasn't much guidance for the homework especially when past assignments were not returned until after the next assignment was already due. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that the concepts were very interesting, but had the feeling that too much information was crammed into the course, making it difficult to truly grasp any of the information.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I was not a fan of the homework assignments. I prefer problem sets, which allow me to practice the information learned that week. As someone who has conducted research before, I feel like the assignment supported an unrealistic approach to forming a research proposal. I did not learn anything from the work and it was not engaging.\r\n\r\nOverall, I liked the course because I am extremely passionate about biology, but this has been my least favorite module so far. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is that it covered a lot of material in a short period of time. The weakness of this course was that the quizzes hardly reflected students effort in the class, and that you could spend hours studying the material only to be faced with a vague or trick question on the quiz and lose it all. Specific examples almost always confused the students more. The setup of the class was very stressful with the weekly quizzes, and the homework assignment was tedious and took hours and hours. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- Content is well-organized\r\n- With respect to content, doesn't go too deep but also isn't too shallow\r\n- Research proposal idea is cool and gives a good, practical view of what is learned in class\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Lack of normal homework assignments made it more difficult to process what was learned in lecture; problems from the book helped a bit, but not completely\r\n- Would be nice to emphasize more that examples of processes given in class are just examples meant to show general principles ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were well organized but not so much interesting or engaging. ",
            "\u00a0This course was helpful in teaching students how to learn a concept from a research perspective. However, the analytical skills necessary to do well in the class were often overlooked in the broad spectrum of the course. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the homeworks were both a strength and a weakness. It helped to be creative as a real scientist would, but some other homework problems that dealt with course material itself would have been helpful too. ",
            "\u00a0This course was good in that it taught us not just what things are, but how to apply them. I believe, however, that the homework was unreasonably involved. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are that it is set up in a way that encourages cooperation and this was seen through the studying that was seen between students. The study guides were very helpful. The weaknesses were that sometimes the questions weren't answered on Piazza. Also the grading was always fair between TAs since some graded easier. ",
            "\u00a0The quizzes are incredibly hard, niche quizzes. I dont think they fairly evaluated my knowledge of the content, even though I did do well on them. ",
            "\u00a0The weekly quizzes were stressful, and tested material in unexpected and sometimes borderline unfair ways. I felt like even if I studied the material for hours, I still wouldn't be able to do well. ",
            "\u00a0I felt as though the sections were a definite weakness because we barely went through stuff related to the quizzes or final exam. It was just reading outside papers. They were some what relevant to some material we learned, but I felt as though sections could be better geared for the course to prep for the application type questions we received on quizzes and the final. \r\nI liked the help from the peer tutors, in explaining some concepts, because I was unable to attend enrichment hours. ",
            "\u00a0I thought it the course was a little scattered and could have proceeded in more of a organized, progressive way where one module flowed into the other. Some modules formed a coherent hold, and some seemed disjointed. ",
            "\u00a0i was troubled by the professor's language use of \"marriage\" when referring to reproduction. it showed up both on our quiz and in class. marriage has no place in a biology class as it is not a requisite for reproduction. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were interesting, and discussion sections were very helpful to learning, but grade feedback was sometimes an issue because we couldnt tell what we needed to fix for the next assignments. ",

            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are (a) its extension of concepts learned in BIOL 101 and 102 into the field of genetics and (b) Prof. Irish's strong background in genetics research and confidence in lecturing about the material covered in this course. One weakness of this course is that there is a severe lack of genetics at the beginning of the course (more emphasis on development), with the terms \"lof mutation\" and \"gof mutation\" thrown around without enough context regarding how scientists actually generate such mutations. ",
            "\u00a0I think that although the information in the course was interesting, it was taught in a scattered manner without any emphasis on certain topics. Thus, I found it to be difficult to prepare for quizzes and exams. Also, although the psets were interesting, I found there to be no real instruction and did not have anything to do with class thus I didn't really gain much from it and it did not prepare me for quizzes and exams. I also found discussion section to not be very helpful as we would just go over a paper, for I think I would have preferred it to be more lecture based where we could ask specific questions about the lecture or it be geared towards preparing us for what we needed to know. \r\n\r\nOverall though, the material was quite interesting.

Tricky questions with no clear logistical reasoning behind them and whose correct answers don't clearly pertain to something in the class or demonstrate learning  shouldn't be how they teach. ",

However, I felt like the lectures were not very good at informing us about the materials. Also, I felt like they could have done a better job at explaining some aspects of the research proposal. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Instructor, TA's, and general participation in section\r\nWeakness: The general size of the class, but that really isn't avoidable ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the course material; genetics and development, to me, was very interesting to learn about. Another strength is that discussion sections focused on reviewing material for the most part, rather than reading papers. Weaknesses are that the course tends to be a bit disjointed, in that the material we learn one day can be completely different than what we learn the following lecture. Another weakness is the amount of stress caused by the weekly quizzes, and the sometimes ambiguous wording on the questions that led to students losing points. "

It will give you a good sense of what direction of Biology you might want to pursue, and will teach you how to read scientific papers and write a research proposal. It is difficult and a lot work, but it is very rewarding!\r\nEven if you are not majoring in Biology, if you have taken BIOL 101 and 102, you might want to take BIOL 103.

But be forewarned, the weekly homework assignments are death (start them early because you might run into some problems, ie. your disease and gene of interest do not match), the quizzes are much more about applying basic knowledge and not about the examples themselves, and that this is not like the other biology sequence courses.  This was my least favorite course of the bio sequence.  I personally struggled with it quite a lot and it made me reconsider changing my major: I am no longer an MCDB major.

I can't speak for the on-cycle Biology modules, but this course taught in the fall was absolutely wonderful. I really look at development in a different lens now and I appreciate the genetics that underly what makes us how we are today. It's an incredible thing to learn, though of course there is still SO much more to development and this course is just a dabble into this area of biology, but it is still so meaningful nonetheless!
