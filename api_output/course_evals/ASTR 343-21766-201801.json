            "\u00a0Various math and astrophysics skills ",
            "\u00a0Before taking this course I knew absolutely nothing about Astronomy or Cosmology beyond the orbital mechanics I learned in physics classes. ASTRO 343 exposed me to a wide variety of topics from methods of detecting exoplanets, to GR metrics, to Einstein's Field Equations, and the CMB. As someone who is always most fascinated by the big questions, this class actually has made me reconsider my carrier path and I have started considering pursuing cosmology. I now need to take the graduate GR course at least. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The course covers too many topics to go deeply into each, but you know what you'll be getting from the course title. Take it if you're interested in learning about many different astro topics. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course is fundamentally flawed. You get to touch on several incredible concepts within Astronomy, but the key word there is touch. This course reduces the study of exoplanets, General Relativity, and Cosmology down to about four weeks each. This is a problem because you simply cannot get  a firm understanding of these topics in such a small period of time. I would almost like to see the Exoplanets part cut out of it; I think that could be a way to improve this class. I think it would be better as a general cosmology course, that way you can dedicate more time to actually understanding. ",
            "\u00a0Better teaching - Prof Newburgh is very smart but her teaching lacked in strength. A ",
            "\u00a0The main strength of this course was that, as a survey class, it introduces you to a huge array of topics. It's main weakness is that the way you engage with those topics is largely plugging in numbers into results, rather than building a strong theoretical understanding. The class doesn't assume any formalism. For example in the special relativity unit we didn't have to use 4 vectors or tensors or prove that invariant quantities actually were invariant.  We were given a metric and told to basically take it on faith and plug numbers into it which, for me, was deeply unsatisfying. However, I understand that as a survey class it couldn't go in depth the way I wanted. I'm not sure if a different balance is possible. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This course is a low-work, fun course that I would recommend to my peers. The three modules (exoplanets, GR, cosmology) are pretty fun and give you a taste of some of the contemporary frontiers of the field. The downside with this course is that, since it deals with advanced topics (like GR), a lot of stuff are not proven in class. The proofs are thus not that interesting but you do get a good conceptual understanding of the material. Perhaps the proofs could be a bit more advanced. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I definitely would. I learned some of the most interesting concepts in this class. I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to someone who isn't an astro major because it builds off a lot of skills and knowledge from earlier courses, but it definitely isn't impossible. ",
            "\u00a0I honestly would not. I would suggest other classes where they could get a much more in-depth understanding of the topics. If they just want to skim the surface, then Astro 343 may work for them. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially if youre interested in astrophysics/cosmology and have a strong background in math ",
            "\u00a0No unless there is a new teacher ",
            "\u00a0I would suggest this class to someone who is trying to get an introduction to a variety of topics in astronomy. It's probably better to take as either Sophomore or Junior before taking other upper level courses. ",
            "\u00a0Whether or not I would recommend ASTRO 343 depends on what you want to get out of it. If you want depth this probably isn't the class for you. If you want to really dig deep into how stars work or want to understand Einstein's Field Equations, there are other classes for that. This is a survey course where you do a lot of plug and chug to start to build intuition, and talk about what is actually observable. This class will give you a necessary vocabulary to engage with academic papers etc on the topics covered. You will learn what a Metric is (not where it comes from), why exoplanet masses are often reported as Msin(i), and the kind of information researchers hope to extract form the CMB. "
