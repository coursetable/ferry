            "\u00a0This course teaches you so many different skills and how to enhance your style of writing.  The best way to get better is through practice, and the deadlines for Drafts and Finals really provide you that time to revise and edit.  The readings are also super interesting and you learn a lot about the world and other authors. ",
            "\u00a0Taking this course improved my writing greatly! It gave me much more practice in writing different types of creative non-fiction essays, from interview pieces to analyses of places or cultural practices. I think the course also trained me to be more attentive and observant of stylistic choices made by other writers in their work. ",
            "\u00a0I felt I became a much better writer. ",
            "\u00a0My writing improved a lot throughout the semester. This class involved a lot of reading good writing, which in turn led to better writing. I identified what type of nonfiction writing I liked, and so I found out how to write something I like. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about wiring with both creativity and honesty, about how to make writing interesting, convincing, and clear. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a great deal of respect for prominent writers of the nonfiction canon. This came through weekly analyses of famous essays and excerpts in a variety of genres, from discussions of a place to manifestos encouraging unique thought. Furthermore, I honed a writing style to write such essays myself, utilizing the feedback of my instructor and fellow students to build a stronger voice. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write about myself in a very in-depth manner, learned how to focus on word choice and point of using certain phrases and paragraphs and ideas to make my points the clearest they could be, and really the craft of creative non-fiction in general, something I had previously never really been taught. "

            "\u00a0After many weeks, the class can seem a bit repetitive because we have the same routine, just with different readings.  But I feel like it's all worth it becuase of the content and practice you get out of the course.  You definitely have the opportunity to write about what you want, exploring the world and yourself.  The readings aren't too long or difficult, but they are rewarding and meaningful.  Comments on essays were not very specific or insightful, but you should definitely go to office hours to discuss essays in detail.  It is super helpful, and you will improve as a writer immensely. ",
            "\u00a0I think the structure of the class is incredibly successful and effective - the way it pushes students to write more regularly with an essay every couple of weeks, the discussion of examples in literature similar to our essay assignments, and the workshops of our peers writing. ",
            "\u00a0i really liked the course overall there is not much i would improve. ",
            "\u00a0Id say that its strengths are both the quality of writing we read, and the fact that the topics promote engagement in the course. Id say the main weakness is that there were not enough in class writing activities. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this class was incredibly strong at analyzing a variety of different example essay that were genuinely interesting and a joy to read. It was also great in that prompts were interesting and gave you enough direction, but allowed for you to write about whatever interests you most. Forms of feedback from both class workshops and professor notes were instructive and helpful in writing a particular essay, but also improving my writing stye and abilities as a whole. ",
            "\u00a0Unfortunately, this course is by nature one that will receive varied levels of interest by students-- it is impossible for one student to engage with all of the readings, and nothing can be done to prevent this. Its strength came in the \"workshop\" sessions: by analyzing other students works and getting my own essay analyzed by 15 people I felt better equipped to face the assignment. Furthermore, your idea of good writing may conflict with that of the professor's: while it is impossible to give comprehensive feedback for over a dozen assignments every two weeks I still felt like the notes provided pushed my paper in a way that contrasted with my voice, or in a way that weakened the overall message. When this happened, sometimes I would receive a higher grade and sometimes a lower grade. I even began writing to appeal the professor at times instead of myself. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course first and foremost are the essay prompts and the grading technique of handing in a rough draft, getting comments and learning to become the best writer you can before you hand it in. I loved the risks I got to take knowing they wouldn't come with a grade as it made me fearless in trying to write my best possible, knowing I would get immediate feedback that wouldn't affect my transcript something that, at the end of the day, is truly unavoidable in school. The readings too were diverse in idea, writing style and made me the best writer I could be. I think overall, the only thing this class was really missing was some sort of memoir to show us a longer version of this creative non-fiction style but overall it was great. "

            "\u00a0I would highly recommend!  You will learn a lot and improve a lot.  A huge plus is critiquing other students' essays in class, throwing around ideas, talking about your strengths and weaknesses.  If you want to learn how to write, take this course.  Also take it if you are just interested in the world. ",
            "\u00a0TAKE IT if you enjoy journaling or writing in general or even just want to know yourself better. This class is beautifully challenging yet also therapeutic. Cannot recommend it enough. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This course is really fun and also incredibly helpful in improving one's writing. I am so glad I took English 120. ",
            "\u00a0yes. i thought the class was very well taught and i felt i became a much better writer and thinker. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It massively improved my writing, and it was interesting ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this to another student. I truly allows you to focus on improving your writing skills, giving great examples to read to build of while focusing your time on writing, and not just always reading. Feedback and freedom are key parts in helping this to be fun, interesting, and helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend one of the English introductory courses to another student, but I would suggest looking into ENGL 114 and 120 prior to making a decision. It is important to attend many of these courses during reading period in order to find one where you mesh with the professor. See if you are engaged at the discussion, because if you are feeling iffy on day one, you will dislike it by week thirteen. If you want to improve your essay writing in a way that lines up with the rubric and syllabus of the class, I overall think it is a good investment. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to every student. I think it's a great way to learn about yourself and improve your craft simultaneously in ways you could probably never imagine or plan. I think for English students especially, it should be taken as early as possible so that the student is automatically ready to be vulnerable and true in their work, something that's often hard to do but comes easily in this class.
