            "\u00a0I gained a deeper appreciation for the ways in which law and policy produce and maintain hierarchies of race. This knowledge is reinforced through history and legal cases. I am a more critical thinker, able to string together different perspectives more easily. ",
            "\u00a0I learned SO much in this class. I'd always heard of critical race theory but I never really understood what it was until now. I learned about indigenous rights, the rights of undocumented persons, the ways whiteness and racism has become entrenched in our legal system and society. Through our coursework and readings, I was forced to reflect on my own beliefs and behaviors and in this way this course challenged my worldview. ",
            "\u00a0How \"race is a social construction\" is just the beginning of the story. This course taught me so much. ",
            "\u00a0SO much-- this course really deepened my understanding of institutional racism. It helps you gain a more abstract perspective. The readings were wonderful and we got to meet one of the authors. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. HoSangs course helped me to gain confidence in my writing and in participating in class.  This course also helped me to work on my critical analysis skills, particularly through the three synthesis papers. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a fascinating web of information in this class. The intersection of race, politics and law is something that I had not studied specifically. It seemed like many of my other classes touched on these subjects but did not look at race and politics using the lens of law quite as much. \r\n\r\nThe papers were interesting and really pushed us to think hard about moving beyond what the texts presented us. This was challenging, but I think more valuable than most of the other assignments I have done at Yale where one can get by by simply summarizing the readings in an interesting way. "

            "\u00a0This class was incredible. For the first time being taught, it was so well-organized. I loved our synthetic papers because they forced me to think critically and engage with every reading. I wish we had short reflective assignments on how we've grown personally throughout the semester. Other than that, I am very happy! ",
            "\u00a0This course was literally amazing. ",
            "\u00a0This was an incredible course. Professor HoSang's syllabus sets out as one of the primary goals to \"familiarize students with some of the important themes, debates and arguments central to the development of racial politics in the United States during the last 100 years,\" and now, having finished the semester, I certainly feel that goal was accomplished. I think in a setting like the course evaluation, constructive criticism tends to be more effective than effusive praise (although I do have a lot of the latter to give!), so I've decided to focus on the formerbut that shouldn't be read as a negative comment on the course's quality. I didn't initially intend to take this course this semester, but I would enroll again in a heartbeat.\r\n\r\nA few areas that could be improved, though:\r\n1. I understand that professors are limited by the published literature available, but the readings in this course seemed somewhat uneven in terms of quality. In particular, the shift from Haney Lopez's incredible White by Law to Gutierrez's somewhat lackluster (at least in terms of scholarly rigor) Fertile Matters was somewhat jarring. I don't know if it would be fruitful for Prof. HoSang to take another look at the reading list, but Fertile Matters, in particular, seemed weak to me. (And of course Mohawk Interruptus was... dense.)\r\n2. Setting clearer expectations for the first synthesis paper would likely help reduce student anxiety. I think most of us figured out the format by the second go-round, but I, for one, wasn't totally sure what Prof. HoSang was looking for in the first paper, and I think my grade reflected that. Perhaps it would be helpful to provide a model paper? Or at least a model outline?\r\n3. I appreciate the unique ability of a course like this to speak to students' personal experiences outside of the classroom, but sometimes it felt as though some students were bringing in anecdotes not totally germane toor at least not productive forthe discussion at hand. I would hate for any professor, especially one teaching about a topic like this, to completely close off the possibility of contributions from students' personal lives, but I also think that it's important to ground those comments in the literatureor else students just end up talking past each other, as we saw a few times in discussion this semester.\r\n4. It wasn't too big an issue this semester, but the enrollment for this course was, obviously, somewhat higher than one would expect for a typical seminar. Sometimes it felt like this gave people a sense that they could slack off a bit on doing the readings, since they had so many other voices to rely on to fill the time. I don't know if this issue is big enough to warrant curbing enrollment, but it's worth considering. ",
            "\u00a0It's small and everyone gets to know each other. All the students also eventually lead the class discussion, so everyone feels respected and on an equal footing. I did like when we had more multi-media presentations like Prof. HoSang's occasional lectures, and would have liked a few more of those-- but overall, not much to improve! ",
            "\u00a0Professor Hosang puts a lot of time into his presentations and they make a lot of sense...the only  problem is that he does not do a whole lot of them. My only complaint about the course was that I found it very confusing, not necessarily because Hosang was a bad instructor, but rather because he did not instruct enough. In addition, the course material is challenging in and of itself. ",
            "\u00a0Professor HoSang did a wonderful job engaging the students, but at times it felt that the topics blended together so much so that we were just repeating the same statements. For example, I felt like we returned to colorblindness nonstop. Also, this class had a few more people than a typical seminar so it could be hard to get a word in sometimes. The readings, though, were selected extremely well. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. HoSang was really innovative in his decision to give students the opportunity to present on the material each week.  Preparing for my own presentation was a difficult process, and one that forced me to critically engage with the readings.  My only suggestion would be for Prof. HoSang to participate a bit more; I really loved his lectures and the insight he added to the class but would have appreciated even more. ",
            "\u00a0I think the assignments (synthetic paper) were super interesting and really pushed the students to do interesting thinking about the texts. The reading list for the class was fascinating, but I think that all the students could have used more context for the readings and the theory they were engaging with. Some of the concepts were pretty complicated, and it would have been useful to have more scaffolding for support. \r\n\r\nI think the final assignment didn't build or connect with the rest of the class in an interesting way. It was challenging to know how that fit with the other papers we were reading. This might have been my fault. My engagement with the course went in waves for a variety of personal reasons, but I think there could have been more thought to how the synthetic papers connected to the longer final paper. Using one of those papers to facilitate the final paper writing (more deliberately) might be an interesting thing for future classes. "

            "\u00a0Take this class! You will emerge a more critical thinker and, if you are advocacy- or legal-minded like the majority of my classmates, a more effective do-er. This was the highlight of my 5-credit semester. ",
            "\u00a0TAKE THIS CLASS!! You will learn so much both about yourself and about the discourse on critical race theory. This is literally one of the best if not the best classes I've ever taken at Yale. The synthesis papers are intellectually challenging and require a large amount of thought - similar to philosophy papers in that way. The syllabus is impressive and contains a great sampling of different topics, thoughts and ideas. If you're interested in criminal justice, immigration, indigenous persons' rights, or any other social justice issues this is a must take course. Even if you are just curious and want to better grapple with questions of race and how implicit bias functions, TAKE IT. This course requires that you read some interesting works each week and then discuss them in class for 2.5 hours. The first part of each class is Professor HoSang summing up the readings and setting the stage for discussion. This class elevated my mind - I now see race operating everywhere. It challenged me and left me shocked at how ignorant/ unaware of certain things I was even as a POC. Definitely, take this class!! HoSang is a great professor who wants every student to do well and he'll discuss ideas with you for hours outside of class. ",
            "\u00a0EVERYONE at yale should take this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Many courses promise to challenge your preconceptions about the world, but this one actually might. Prof. HoSang is a gem, with just the right mixture of supportiveness and refusal to let bullshit go unchallenged. Take it if you can! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely!! Professor HoSang is so great and you will learn so much, especially if you're interested in social justice, law, or political activism! ",
            "\u00a0If you already have some background in critical race theory, this course will expand handsomely on those topics. If you do not have such a background and you struggle with theoretical texts, then maybe stay away. The course did challenge a lot of my basic conceptions of race and power structures, which I greatly appreciate, but it felt unduly challenging, and I never felt really supported in my efforts to improve. ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely. Professor HoSang really cares about students and the material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This was one of the most interesting classes i've ever taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0This course is great and Professor HoSang is a very fair, engaging seminar leader. Do understand though, that you will not be going into case-law really, but exploring the more abstract links between race and the legal code. The readings are all very interesting and not too dense. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!  Tough but good. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would. I think it is an interesting subject. It touches on many themes that are present in most American Studies courses through an interesting lens, and I think that students could benefit from engaging with the texts presented. Also Professor HoSang is great. You should take his courses. "
