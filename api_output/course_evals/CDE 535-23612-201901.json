Although I do think the shark tank assignment could have been formally assigned earlier in the semester. I liked having speakers come in to share their knowledge but also their personal experiences with us. I would not make any major changes to the course. Perhaps capping the size to increase participation from everyone. Or also having a more engaged TF could have maybe helped to better understand the topics. "

The degree of her knowledge on the topic motivated me to actively work to understand the material too and generally held us as a group accountable. "
