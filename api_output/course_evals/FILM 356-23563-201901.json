            "\u00a0I learned more about narratives in documentary theory as well as the process of making a documentary film from pre-production to completion. The bulk of my learning I feel was focused on preproduction- an essential part of filmmaking that is so often neglected. "

            "\u00a0If you are interested In Documentary  filmmaking, self motivated, and can take criticism, then yes! This course is challenging in that you must put all of yourself into your project, be willing to devote as much a time and energy as it takes to succeed, and also to learn many things on your own as you go. The class is so rewarding though If you do do these things!! And you have much freedom in choosing a topic/project interesting to you! "
