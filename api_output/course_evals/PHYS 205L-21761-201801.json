            "\u00a0The labs are tedious and often go too long. They should be shortened to an appropriate length. ",
            "\u00a0The class stressed quantity over quality. The grading for the class was also very rubric based and did not provide any meaningful feedback other than noting that minor parts of questions were unanswered. Error analysis was the most meaningful part of the course. ",
            "\u00a0The BIGGEST weakness was the fact that we needed to write in a lab book. It was completely unnecessary and a waste of time, especially as we were also expected to produce a typed summary report in addition. I feel like this course would benefit immensely from doing away with the lab notebook system. \r\n\r\nAlso we didn't really get taught much in this class -- it was mostly a \"figure it out yourself\" course. \r\n\r\nThat said, the experiments we did were cool. But I'd have enjoyed a more rigorous experience. ",
            "\u00a0There should be more clearly defined guidelines for how everything should be written. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Good introduction to ideas of error analysis. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lab guides sometimes confusing/unclear, TF unengaged/uninterested in course. Graded lab reports do not contain clear feedback. As a result, I was unsure whether I was doing/understanding things correctly throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: This course is needed for some majors.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Canvas wasn't set up properly, so it looked like several assignments were due on the first day. As a result, I pulled an all-nighter, which became the first of many due to this course. Students without much preparation in physics or without much experience in a physics lab struggle throughout the course, and the assignments are terrible: Each lab write-up requires several hand-written pages, much of which repeats information from the experiment guides, and the lab reports are completely redundant. Furthermore, they're so time-consuming that students regularly have to pull all-nighters, and for the first few weeks there's also textbook work on error analysis, which is barely integrated into the labs and is practically abandoned until the final exam, where it features prominently. Poor communication resulted in confusion about the date of the final exam. The last lab write-up and report were originally due the day of the final exam, and although it was nice that the deadline was extended by one day, some students didn't know about the extension, some had to rearrange their schedules, and some had to finish the work during Spring Fling. Sometimes one lab partner does too much or proceeds too quickly, which hurts the other partner's understanding of the experiment and makes it difficult for that other partner to complete the lab write-up and report. Some Teaching Fellows are better than others, and feedback is minimal and slow. It wasn't clear what was expected for each lab write-up and report, since the instructions were spread across many documents on Canvas. The reference sheets were practically never used, and the experiment guides are old and poorly written. Worst of all, the course is only worth half a credit, but overall it takes at least as much time as a 1-credit course. ",
            "\u00a0While some of the labs are super interesting, a lot of the work in this lab is really tedious. None of it is terribly difficult, it just seems sort of pointless and like a waste of time. The lab reports, really, are just a combination of copying from the lab notebooks and the experiment instructions. I really never felt like I was learning anything new or gaining any new skills. \r\n\r\nAlso, the quality of your lab experience depends REALLY STRONGLY on who your TA is. I was lucky enough to have the wonderful Oskari as my TA. He is super helpful and does an awesome job of making the labs not horribly boring. Ben on the other hand, who subbed for my section a couple times, did LITERALLY NOTHING. He actually just sat at his computer and occasionally answered questions half-correctly in a begrudging manner. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: hands-on experience illustrating physical concepts\r\n\r\nweaknesses: time-limit and variety of physics preparation can often leave one lab student (either less mathematically prepared, a naturally slower learner, or a slow writer) far behind their lab partner. This lag in a partnership can often deprive one student of hands-on experience, which is a shame. For most students, they've already covered these physics equations once or even twice. The only real value of PHYS 205L lies in working out those equations came from using one's hands and brain.\r\n\r\npossible fixes: minimizing lab steps and in-lab actions, so that students don't have to rush through labs quite as much. (This complaint of \"ignoring concepts and hands-on experience to just get it in the lab book\" is something I've heard over and over again.)\r\n(more ambitious): Re-structuring the labs to have them be performed by a single student. This change would ensure that each student has received the maximum of lab concepts' physical illustration, which is the most meaningful part of PHYS 205L. All of the statistics can be performed somewhere else. Exploring how to derive values is, of course, best done when one has actually performed the physical operations to find those values. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The assignments were kindly graded, but this is really dependent on the TA you get. If you finish your lab early, you can leave right away. TAs and instructors are pretty chill.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The material is very, very dull. Labs are boring, the write ups are long, and the expectations are poorly put forth (what is the purpose of having the summary AND the lab report?). You'll likely spend the night before each lab writing up the summary and report for the next one. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Application of Physics\r\nWeaknesses: Summaries and Lab Notebooks are redundant busy work ",
            "\u00a0Many labs felt too long for he allotted time frame, as though instructors had continually tacked on small chucks over the years until they were pushing the limits of what we can cram in. We did get to play with a lot of cool equipment, though! ",
            "\u00a0The class is very comprehensive and teaches a lot, but it's a lot of work and feels very rushed. If the number of labs or number of full writeups was reduced, this problem could be avoided. Also, the problem sets could be spaced out throughout the semester rather than all at the beginning to give the students more time to work on them. ",
            "\u00a0Would be helpful if the TF were more engaged and making sure we were on track. Good breadth of topics and was manageable to follow even without learning those concepts beforehand. More clarity on how much to include in lab reports is needed. ",
            "\u00a0I think we should have focused less on exact answering of questions in the lab document and more on independent work. ",
            "\u00a0This course is mind-numbingly boring.  The lab consists of you sitting in a chair for three hours in a room without any windows and observing a tiny change.  By the end of each lab period, I could feel myself going crazy.  There was also too much in each lab to reasonably complete within the three hours and take good notes.  I found myself not taking notes so that I could finish the experiments on time and I would finish my \"in class notes\" at home. ",
            "\u00a0This class isn't that great, but everybody has to take it if you are planning to major in physics. You don't learn all that much in lab, its impossible to win with lab write-ups, and the math is tedious and boring. ",

Hands on experience illustrates physical equations well. ",
            "\u00a0Irrelevant, since its required for the major. If for some strange reason you aren't a physics major, see if you can take 206 or the advanced labs sequence instead; you really won't learn anything in this course and it will take up far to much of your time (the workload actually isn't that bad, but relative to what you get out of the class it's absurd). Thankfully, the TFs and professors all seem to be pretty chill, but don't expect that you'll enjoy the course itself. ",
            "\u00a0Really only if you are a physics major and it is required ",
            "\u00a0Its tough to recommend a lab, cause a student is either going to have to take it for their major or probably wont take it at all. This certainly isnt the worst class ever, but for your own sake start lab reports early. Our group would often spend a miserable, sleepless Thursday night writing up the books and lab reports for our Friday section, and it was enough to make me dread fridays when I shouldve been looking forward to them. This improved a lot towards the end of the course, but still, the experience couldve been more stress free with some time management. ",
            "\u00a0It was a bit much for me when it came to the workload - I would probably recommend opting for 165 if you can avoid this course. It wasn't all bad or anything, just more work than I was bargaining for. ",
            "\u00a0If it werent a requirement for physics, no. It wasnt terrible, but wasnt particularly exciting either. I felt like I couldve learned more if it were organized better. ",
            "\u00a0Avoid this class at all costs.  Before taking this class, see if you can substitute your lab requirement with a lower level physics lab.  I could have and I didn't notice.  Taking this class was a mistake. ",
            "\u00a0Don't take this lab unless you have to. I've heard 206 is more work but more fun and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0No. Didn't really feel like I got enough out of it. The work didn't feel stimulating most of the time. "
