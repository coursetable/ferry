            "\u00a0I learned about the genre of the history of the body. I gained valuable insight on how to write a research paper that really contributes to the literature that is already out there, and I learned how to do so in a timely and organized fashion. ",
            "\u00a0I learned that throughout history the 'ideal' body changes with what is going on at the time.I learned how the 'ideal' body became measured, calculated and portrayed, while the abnormal body was seen as something that should be rid from society. ",
            "\u00a0I developed my ability to effectively find and parse primary historical works and synthesize it into a mostly-novel paper which was the focus of the seminar. The seminar enabled me to think more critically about social construction around the body and to dig into the means with which those constructs are erected. ",
            "\u00a0Used the body as a lens to look at history. A lot of the course was spent conducting independent research on a topic of your choice (related to the body, ofc). Learned how to put together an unique argument based on primary sources. "

            "\u00a0Prof. Elder's syllabus is absolutely incredible. I found the class discussions to be student driven; although Prof. Elder facilitated conversation, I think a lot of times we didn't truly understand the guiding question and sort of went on our own tangents. I loved the flexibility and feedback that marked the final research paper. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: really interesting readings, engaging seminar discussions and a phenomenal instructor.\r\nweaknesses: I think that rather than just discussions every class, we could mix it up with different assignments so that everyone is engaged. I really like sharing our presentations to hear others ideas. ",
            "\u00a0The readings are very very very good. Dr. Elder is knowledgeable about the topic and gives plenty of room for students to discuss material. The only weakness would be that there are sometimes moments where students will begin in a very off-topic direction and sit there for a little too long as Dr. Elder doesn't seem to want to interrupt people (which is a pro and a con!). \r\n\r\nWorkshopping our papers in class was very helpful, and Dr. Elder gives good feedback on canvas for our submissions. It is nice how we are updated about midterm as to how we are doing in terms of participation etc. so that grading feels very transparent. ",
            "\u00a0The readings were interesting and engaging. The research paper was a new experience that took a lot of time to pull together, but we received clear instructions that made it more manageable. There were also deadlines that made sure you made progress on your paper so that you dont procrastinate and leave all of it until the last minute. However, the discussions in class werent always that engaging. The discussions were based on the readings; we went through each reading one by one. The professor didnt always seem to know how to direct the conversation so the discussion got dry at times. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely, would recommend this to any student at Yale who enjoys learning about the human body and how people have viewed it throughout history. It is such an interesting seminar and I learned so much in such a short amount of time. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this to anyone who is at all interested in the subject. The syllabus lays out exactly what the class will be like and it is an excellent class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. The subject matter was really interesting and I learned a lot about a variety of topics in relation to the history of the body and technology. Also, professor Elder is very knowledgable and kind! "
