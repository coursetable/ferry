            "\u00a0One significant weakness of this course was that the students enrolled had significantly different backgrounds in mathematics, so the professor had to constantly (attempt to) fill in material from other classes. It would be better if this course required familiarity with commutative algebra, at a bare minimum. ",
            "\u00a0I think I would still need more practice to feel comfortable using the tools we were taught. It would have been nice to see, and work on problem sets, more motivating examples.\r\nThe class did whet my appetite to learn more AlgGeom, and I would happily spend time self-studying it in the future. ",
            "\u00a0about twice as many psets would have been very helpful - I did not really learn from the lectures and had to then struggle to apply it to the infrequent psets ",
            "\u00a0Strength: the instructor tried to explain in detail\r\nWeakness: the instructor didn't provide sufficient motivation - why do people care about this subject? ",
            "\u00a0The only strength of this course is that algebraic geometry is a cool subject.  But I didn't really get that sense from this course.  On to the weaknesses: Kalina did not have a good enough understanding of the material to teach this course.  Even when she used lecture notes, she couldn't get through a single non-trivial proof without something going majorly wrong.  I honestly don't know where she found so many wrong and incomplete proofs--certainly not in any reasonable textbook.  Sometimes even definitions were wrong.  Almost every class, she would be unable to finish a main result or someone would point out that her proof was totally wrong.  She would have to postpone finishing the proof to the next class, which rarely happened at all and was even more rarely completely correctly.  Examples also worked only about half of the time.  On top of this, Kalina is just awful at presenting concepts.  Her board work is nearly passable (mostly legible, but she often erased stuff that she still needed), but otherwise she has no expository/teaching skills.  The way she explained things--even when they were correct--didn't make any sense.  This was exacerbated by sloppiness, like messing up indices or changing variables half way through a proof.  My class notes were about 25% wrong and 50% unintelligible, and not because I took bad notes.  You'd think that when a math class is hard, it's because the professor is moving through material quickly.  Not in this case: even though the class was impossible to follow, we made very little progress.  In the first 8 weeks of the course, we got to about week 3 in most reasonable online algebraic geometry lecture notes.  The last problem with this course was the problem sets.  There were 4: 2 extremely easy ones at the beginning of the semester and 2 at the end of the semester that were hard, but only because things in class hadn't been explained clearly.  This was the type of problem set where once you find a decent book and teach yourself the material, the problems are trivial.    Since there were only 4 problem sets, we weren't forced to engage with the material very often, which made each one more painful than the last.  Grading was also weird and sometimes wrong. ",
            "\u00a0The course covers interesting material which is reinforced by problem sets. However, lectures were 99% definitions with very few proofs or concrete examples, which made it easy to get lost for weeks. Although technically the only prerequisite was 350, the course actually drew on a lot of more advanced algebra and topology - which was fine for the grad students and students who had taken these courses (most of the class), such that Professor Mincheva usually assumed it was fine, but less fair for others. New terms were introduced (e.g. modules) without really defining them and I'd often open problem sets to realize I had very little understanding of the basic material. Lectures also often had incomplete proofs, or grad students would point out possible issues that weren't resolved. Here are some concrete recommendations for improvement: (1) there should have been far more problem sets, as this was the most effective way to learn the material, (2) cover less material but in more depth, with a lot more actual, concrete, simple examples and proofs, (3) define terms *right away* instead of using them to give an overview, and defining later - this became very confusing, (4) decide on prerequisites and stick firmly to them, (5) use *far* more consistent notation and terminology; even if the literature on algebraic geometry uses inconsistent notation, at the very least an intro course should be as consistent and clear as possible. This also applies to using different terms interchangeably with no justification, e.g. algebraic set/variety, singular locus/points, etc. (6) Return problem sets more promptly ",
            "\u00a0I didn't like the primary textbook, Shafarevich's \"Basic Algebraic Geometry,\" and neither did most of the other students. The material was interesting and the problem sets were useful, though there should have been far more of them (four problem sets isn't enough to really learn the material). I would have liked the course to move faster overall. The first few weeks were definitely the most well-organized and enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0This course was not very engaging and the lectures were often confusing. ",
            "\u00a0The material was very interesting and I would love to study it further.\r\nHow the class was taught/structured was unfortunately its main weakness.  The professor said it would be more computational in focus, which isn't what I expected from a 400-level math class but isn't necessarily a bad approach.  However, it was poorly executed, as the proofs that were given were often incomplete or wrong and generally did not provide the theoretical background I needed in order to put the examples in context.  As a result, I didn't really understand the motive behind any of the computations and as a result did not learn the material effectively.  For most of the class, I didn't have a solid grasp of what was going on. ",

        [
            "\u00a0This was an exceptionally bad class. The definitions made no sense, the theorems were incorrectly proved, and generally speaking lectures decreased my knowledge of the material. Often, we discussed theorems for which the class did not have the background to understand even the correct statement, or even the words. We weren't even given resources where we could look up a coherent treatment of the material. \r\n\r\nAdmittedly, it is difficult to teach algebraic geometry without assuming a lot of background in commutative algebra and things. However, it should be possible to do this without the class becoming an albatross, for example through just studying algebraic curves. ",
            "\u00a0With another professor, yes. Algebraic geometry is a very beautiful and important topic, but this class presented it in the most confusing way possible. Many of the definitions and theorems were incorrectly or incoherently stated, and almost none of the proofs were correct. It was not possible to do the problem sets using the material (or lack thereof) learned in class. ",
            "\u00a0Students considering this course ought to be very self-directed and willing to learn from the textbook and make themselves do examples. ",

            "\u00a0It is hard for me to recommend this course to another student. The material is interesting (I think), but the lectures lacked rigor, intuition, and examples to the extent that it was very difficult to learn or feel confident about the material. You could probably get more out of the course than I did by studying the textbooks rigorously (while going to lectures) and demanding a higher level of examples/rigor in lecture by constant questions, but it's not ideal (no pun intended). ",
            "\u00a0Algebraic geometry is a fascinating subject, but this course definitely left much to be desired. Professor Mincheva was often disorganized in lectures, there weren't enough homework assignments (I realized over the course of this class that homework actually DOES serve a distinct pedagogical value), and the course didn't move as quickly as I would have liked. Not a terrible experience, but I've definitely taken better math classes. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course. ",
