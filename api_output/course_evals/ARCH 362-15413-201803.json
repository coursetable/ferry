            "\u00a0In this course we were exposed to numerous different readings and discussions of the city in terms of exploring through history of science, anthropology and other fields. We also learned skills related to collaging and mapping transects using the adobe suite software. ",
            "\u00a0It's a bit hard to describe exactly what this class taught me. Our readings were on a wide variety of topics, all interesting. We learned how to analyze the bias or perspective of works, exercised our imagination in creating hypothetical situations, learned the value of fiction rather than fact, and how to be critics in a way that adds to the object of critique rather than takes away from it. We also explored the urban environment in relation to its natural environment, and the different components that make up a city. We learned from each other and by considering other classmate's work. We got to explore a ton, practiced different ways of documenting cities, and had a lot of fun! This course is not just for arch majors, and it really benefits from having students with diverse interests! The graphic novel at the end was really fun to make, and I love that I have a product that I can easily share with people to show my efforts in the course. ",
            "\u00a0Insights - This was an excellent course, which taught us to question the urban around us and the methods and systems by which this is constructed. As we moved in to the creating part of the course, this questioning in turn served as a foundation to construct a personal vision of what the urban might mean / could become. Readings equipped us with a strong understand of the fragility of human infrastructure. Infrastructure can be wielded as tool for social control or poetic symbol of governmental power  its main goal is not always service. Socratic seminars on the readings taught us to question the narratives we create about urbanism. Readings such as Manahatta and The World Without Us (Weisman) reveal our delicate state, and how much more care and caution is needed to manage natural resources and urban. Representation matters. Subjectivity in map-making and representation is important  must be questioned and studied just as carefully as the subject of the map itself. The pedagogical and practical aspects of the course were well balanced; we swung between each end almost weekly. It was a fantastic way to equip ourselves for future studies. \r\n\r\nWe developed skills in analysis of urban sites in the pre-visit, live-visit, and creative design phases: dissecting areas through figure/ground study, research, and transects. Extensive live fieldwork in New Haven and New Orleans taught us that a careful study of one part of the whole can reveal a lot about interconnected system. This served as a very practical tool for analysis. Finally, we each made a comic book and picked up skills in storyboarding, design tools (AI/Indesign/Photoshop etc), narrative, etc. Every student likely took something very different away from their experience doing this. Personally, I learned a ton about my own creative process, how important it is for me to have a deep cnxn with my topic, and to assert my narrative control \r\n\r\nKnowledge - Background on urban design, from the aesthetic<>human (e.g. readings on highway design and sprawl) to the operational and transactional (patterns of map making and creating transects). History on field of urban design. And lots of rich context about New Orleans. Lots of cool anecdotes and history on the design of the Ganges River hydraulic system. ",
            "\u00a0I learned new approaches to the visual analysis of space, and ways of documenting the city. The course involved drawing; use of adobe illustrator and photoshop; and some AutoCAD. I appreciated practicing these programs through class! ",
            "\u00a0The most important thing that this course taught me was how to deeply question and refine my own ideas, whether they were my ideas for projects or my ideas about the ethics of studying cities. Our highly personal work and hands-on experience traveling to New Orleans forced me to confront a lot of big, important questions about architecture and how I see myself in this field. \r\n\r\nThe course also taught me how to analyze the city with a broad architectural lens. I appreciated how the course attempted to address multiple perspectives on how to view and analyze cities, ultimately choosing an unconventional form of analysis for the final project: a graphic novel. \r\n\r\nIn terms of programs, I gained a much better working knowledge of Photoshop just through independent project work. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt a bunch about various architectural techniques (drawing transects, drawing in plan, drawing in section, axiometric views, collages, etc.). My skills in digital drawing also improved over the course of developing our graphic novels. Learnt a bunch about new orleans although perhaps not as much as I'd expected to. Throughout the course we thought a bunch about what it means to create a graphic novel about/ based on a visit to a city; how to give up on the project of 'representing' a place as opposed to simply responding to a place. ",
            "\u00a0Technically, I got really good at using photoshop, illustrator, and indesign. I also began to look at space and development within a city quite differently, but I'm not sure that is entirely due to the structure of the course, but rather other students, questions we came up with along the way, and the urging of our incredible TA. ",
            "\u00a0From Urban Lab 1 I learned how to critically understand a city from within, through drawings, photographs, textual research, and personal observation. I refined my skills at architectural drawing and at developing a thoughtful thesis and conveying it effectively through visual means. I feel as though I have a grasp on the practice of urban studies and can express informed claims about a city in an engaging manner. ",
            "\u00a0This is the first architecture course I've taken at Yale where I've taken away so many practical skills, particularly pertaining Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. For what I used these for, I learned to make digital collages, figure-ground maps, and at the end created a graphic novel that I ended up being very proud of, and it's something I can include in a portfolio. \r\n\r\nAlso, the trip the New Orleans was incredible formative for me and solidified my decision to become an architect in the future. I think going, and in particular visiting and talking to some residents, really made the conversations we had been having in section relevant. "

            "\u00a0This course could be improved if there was more of a guideline of when we would be discussing readings vs. working vs. critiquing. There were many weeks where I felt confused whether I should be focusing more on the texts or more on the assignments, but ultimately had to prioritize assignments because they were so time consuming. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course was basically everything. The material we read/watched, the assignments we had, the class discussions, and the professor and TAs. I think the weakness of the class is that it covers so many things broadly sometimes I wish we could have gone more into depth. Though assignments seemed lengthy at time, I don't think they could have been scheduled better and I gained a lot from all of them. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - There are too many of them to speak of! There was a fantastic selection of readings, that were diverse, eye-opening, and really ground you in the practice of urbanism, the history of human need, and the fragility of our practice. I loved the balance between readings, field work and creative practice. This interplay between theory < > practice was very strong. Discussions were fruitful  we learned a ton about how others think from our students combo of backgrounds, from American Studies to Anthropology to Architecture. TFs were wonderful, helpful, and for the most part challenging, and critical in constructive ways. I honestly think the two best things about the class were the (1) readings chosen by Anthony and (2) the fantastic projects, from the sectional flooding exercise to the open-ended study of a city through comic book production. The projects were really great. They pushed my peers to learn computer software they were not familiar with, and to question our urban condition in a very intimate and detailed way. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - the course was wonderful and I really wouldnt suggest any/many changes in the coming years. My feedback circulates around two points.\r\n\r\n(1) It would have been invaluable to hear more lectures from Anthony  each of the first 2-3 lectures we got were incredible, and so insightful! However, I believe this was made impossible due to the high enrollment. We had so many students, that many/eventually most Thursday meetings (the 3 hour day) could only be pinups. The few times we tried to do both pinups + a lecture from Anthony, we ran out of time for one or the other. It seems like enrollment needs to be lowered, or a second section offered. Second, we learned a lot about the infrastructure around the Ganges, but since we only had one live lecture about this it felt detached from our fieldwork in New Haven and NOLA. More lectures from Anthony would have lent further insight to our practice. \r\n\r\n(2) In a class with so many strengths and well-executed classes, I felt that the final critique for the comic book module might have been more productive. The nature of our 32-page novels made them hard to consume. Anthony distributed a PDF to critics ahead of time but it seemed that many had only quickly skimmed the most image-heavy editions by the time they showed up. Students were not able to share the single physical copy with all 4 jurors during our presentations, so the juror holding it would end up dominating the convo (usually before reading the whole thing!). I strongly felt that presenting one physical/bound copy should have been complemented by a (A) digital projection of our comic up on a screen, or even (B) just a normal pinup of a duplicate copy of the spread. Compared to other (pin-up) critiques at Yale, I feel that the critics had a hard time meaningfully reading/engaging with work they only skimmed briefly! ",
            "\u00a0One of the course's biggest strengths is that it pushes and encourages students to create highly original work that far surpasses what students originally thought they were capable of making. \r\n\r\nThe one-on-one time with TAs and with Professor Acciavati was incredibly important and very helpful. It was such a privilege to exchange ideas with them. \r\n\r\nThe weekly lectures at the beginning of studio sometimes seemed vague and disjointed from our work. Assignment descriptions were also often released during the weekend, giving us less than a week to complete sometimes hefty deliverables. It would be nice to have the assignments more in advance so we could plan our time. \r\n\r\nI also felt that there was not enough preparation for our trip to New Orleans. More straight-forward readings on the city and its history would have been helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Engaging and challenging, this class will push students to think for themselves and work on some cool projects. \r\nCan be a bit vague or unclear at times. Little time left for didactic lectures. Mostly a studio type class. ",
            "\u00a0In the first class/ the start of term, I think many of us were given the impression that the class would begin with short lectures on Thursdays before we broke off into small groups to discuss our assignments for the week. The first lecture that we had was interesting and useful. However, when we ran over time for that class, the structure of the class then switched quickly to just discussing the assignments. Additionally, since we often discussed the assignments in small groups, it felt like there was a lot of time for us to just be sitting around in class. Granted, it was useful to have that time to work on our assignments in the presence of our TAs and Anthony, who we could ask questions to if needed, but it just didn't feel like the best use of our time. I think many of us felt like we would have liked if the lectures continued at least in part. We recognize that the time constraint was a real thing, but it felt like there could have been better solutions. Additionally, we had all the readings which we discussed in part in section on Tuesdays but we never/ rarely spoke about them in class on Thursdays, which made it feel like they existed really separately from the rest of the class, which is a shame. \r\n\r\nHowever, I did really enjoy doing the various assignments, I feel like we had enough space to explore with whatever materials we wanted to, and try out various directions. I think the class also encouraged the creating of community within the class, where we got to develop a relationship with our classmates where we could each be useful sounding boards for each other. The TAs, especially Theo, were also really really useful in terms of developing our ideas. \r\n\r\nThat said, it did sometimes feel, especially as we were working towards our graphic novels, that there were particular approaches to creating the graphic novel that Anthony was partial to but was unwilling to articulate. And I think it would have been helpful, and less stressful, for us as a class, to have had that outlined more clearly or explicitly. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The section and freedom to explore what we were interested in. \r\nWeakness: A lack of reflexivity on our roles as students \"exploring\" New Orleans and New Haven. We did not interrogate the ways that Architecture could be a more responsible discipline and often relied on tired narratives of development, individual exploration and intellectual exploration, which felt like they came at the expense of the cities we were attempting to map. In the future, this course needs to make much more space for criticism of \"urbanism\" and the lived experiences of both students and the people who inhabit the city. ",
            "\u00a0Section discussion was excellent, and the assignments were unique. I would have liked more lecture-like sessions instead of review focus during class meetings. ",
            "\u00a0The course readings were excellent, and they were made all the more interesting by excellent teaching fellows who led useful and interesting discussions during our weekly section. The structure of the course was effective, in that learning about New Haven was a smart introduction to the topic and adequate preparation for studying NOLA, and in that weekly reviews with the course staff were much more productive than the typical sparse reviews by guest critics. The final graphic novel was an excellent medium for conveying our findings from the course. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course really come down to its unique approach of looking at the city and the role of the urbanist in its analysis. By looking through a more narrative lens in addition to using more traditional techniques, the politics and poetics of the city became intertwined with the morphologies of cities themselves. However, there were a few issues that limited Urban Lab from being what it could be. Firstly, it felt in some ways like the class couldn't really find a place between seminar and studio. With only one section and one class meeting per week, pretty much every class session ended up being a critique, whereas the sections were almost entirely focused on the readings. This made it feel like Anthony was almost more guest critic than teacher at points in the semester. The second problem with the course was the decision to treat New Orleans basically as Terra Incognita. Because we only had 3 days in the city, it was really challenging and overwhelming to come in knowing nearly nothing about it (for the more ignorant among us). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Although it was his first semester at Yale, Anthony really knows what he's doing. This class felt really structured and we hit all the marks the professor set out for us at the beginning, which I can't say for all of my studio classes I've taken. Also, because it was so small (14 ish students?) I am so grateful for the opportunity to get to know the other students and their work. Everyone thinks so differently and creates such interesting projects that also really informed my creative process. \r\n\r\nAlso, the mid-final crit was first of all, a great idea, and second of all, the best crit I've had at Yale. The critics who came gave the most constructive feedback I'd received on a project ever. It was so helpful! Not only that, but I was actually engaged in the feedback given for other projects as well since the suggestions were so fascinating and insightful. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I do wish Anthony gave more lectures throughout the semester. He gave one or two at the beginning, which I actually gained a lot from, but I wish he did do more later on, especially since we had more flexible class days later on in the semester. "

            "\u00a0Yes, it was a very interesting and fun course. However, it is a lot of work and can be intimidating to someone who is not familiar with the architecture school. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student, but I think they should know that it is more work than other classes, esp. since the type of work you do is more time consuming. It is 1.5 credits though, so that makes sense. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend! Take this course for a fun, engaging, grueling dive into the world of urban criticism and practice. This isnt a course for those who just want to read and criticise. Youre forced to provoke and create. It is a challenge, but the kind of challenge you learn most deeply from. You jump off the deep end over and over again, from the readings (ranging from bizarre but useful commentaries on the art of parafiction...to very grounded histories/anthologies on architectural design), to making a comic book from scratch, to literally diving into rainy New Orleans and learning about the city in 72 hours! My advice would be to push yourself, try wonky things, and iterate as much as possible. (Take advantage of each meeting. Dont show up empty-handed to crits, youll be wasting your own time and everyone elses.) Our world is changing, rapidly. Our governments, climate, and marginal environments are evolving. How will urbanism respond? How will we take part of it? This course seeks to ask these questions and more. Anthony does a fantastic job as a conductor (of an orchestra) or a moderator. He rigorously swings the class between theory and practice which, in my opinion, is the perfect breeding ground for fresh ideas, and the best sweet-spot in which to learn. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Studio classes are time-consuming and thus more to ponder for non-architecture students, but the class makes itself very open to all, and the nature of the work lends itself to tremendous growth. I don't think I would have ever sat down to make a 32-page graphic novel on my own, but am glad that this class called that of me! Overall, I really enjoyed this course. I also really enjoyed the trip to New Orleans (of course!!) but believe that many of the students felt that there could have been a bit more structure, curation, and critical social/historical/political discussion of what was being seen. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student that is ready to invest a lot of time, perseverance, and creative energy. If the student is willing to do that, the course will be very rewarding. \r\n\r\nI would also warn that if you are completely unversed in creating visual products, the course might be intimidating at first if you can't draw and don't know any computer programs. But it is not impossible! Just be prepared to learn quickly and push yourself. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are interested in Urban Planning or related fields. Otherwise, only if you are looking for a vastly different class, one which will be challenging but a welcome break from the monotony of essays and psets. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would. I personally just really enjoyed the task of creating a graphic novel and that was what fueled me throughout the process. I do think that if that's not a project you think you'd enjoy doing, you shouldn't take the class because it takes up so much of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Hard to say. It is a challenge on many levels and it is a lot of work. The students in the class became quite close by the end and I feel like I learned a lot in spite of the class structure, not necessarily due to the class structure. Without a fantastic TA (like we had) I would say probably not. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent class that covers a diverse range of topics, yet remains focused in its goals. ",
            "\u00a0This course is required for Urban Studies architecture students, but I would recommend that others take it as well. Anthony's version is excellent, though the course changes with the professor. I think anyone interested in the study of cities, especially those addressed in the syllabus but not limited to those, should take the course if they can get in and can accommodate the intense workload. ",
            "\u00a0YES wow. This class really exceeded my expectations and I gained so many new friends from it, as well as so many skills and a great project I can include in my portfolio. I also got to get to know Anthony a little more than I usually get to know my professors here, as well as the TAs. \r\n\r\n~however~ It is worth nothing that I also took this class in conjunction with the architecture design studio. I think a very small number of people would ever consider this, but for those who do, would I recommend it? I definitely had some back-to-back crit days and some long nights in a row. There were definitely nights where I wondered, why? However, I did it, came out alive, and don't regret it at all. It shelled me out creatively at times but resulted in my most productive semester, so you be the judge. "
