            "\u00a0All great except maybe format of everyone asking question in person could be changed to -- maybe Milan or the speaker can ask questions that seem the best, and people can feel free to ask small follow-up questions / different ones than they wrote down, to make the discussion more free-flowing and maximize the best kinds of questions actually discussed ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed hearing the various perspective of the faculty. It would have been enriching to hear more from my peers during class. ",
            "\u00a0I mean, the course is not a rough time. You read two articles per week and post a couple questions on Canvas. I did really enjoy when we talked more in the vein of professional development/career advice etc. I would definitely prioritize that over getting the responses to the questions. ",
            "\u00a0Milan was a very good moderator. He asked excellent questions of the speakers, and was great about asking speakers to elaborate on points that would be of particular interest to us.  I did not think the requirement of having us submit questions in advance was useful, as people ended up changing their minds about what they wanted to ask. I also didn't think it was useful to require us to ask questions during class--students got too hung up on declaring whether they were asking the same question as the one they submitted or whether they were asking a new question. As a result, the discussion did not flow as organically as it could have. Sometimes I wanted to ask more than one question, but felt that I shouldn't because I needed to allow time for other students to ask their required questions. Other times I did not want to ask my question, because it was no longer interesting given the trajectory of the class discussion, but I had to do so anyway because it was required. I would suggest doing away with the required question-asking aspect of the course. ",

            "\u00a0I mean, it's obligatory... ",
            "\u00a0No, not as it is currently structured, but it's not that Milan did a bad job with  it. He was a very good instructor and moderator, and very thoughtful with his questions. I just felt the class discussions were very disjointed because everyone was required to ask a question, even if their question was no longer interesting, or even if they didn't have genuine interest in that topic area. I think the class would have been much more interesting if people had been allowed to ask as many, or as few, questions as they liked.\r\nI did appreciate that Milan was very open about answering our \"nuts and bolts\" questions about becoming academics.
