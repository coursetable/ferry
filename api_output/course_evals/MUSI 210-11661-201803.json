            "\u00a0The science behind music and the array of rules needed to compose actually decent music in the style. Species counterpoint, figured base, periods, sentences, sequences, binary forms, theme and variations, minuet and trio, MuseScore software. I learned to separate the limitations my ear put on composing and trust the theory behind the music to make more interesting music. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: the breadth of the material and the emphasis on independent work on homework exercises. Encouragement to improve (From September I was spending 30 minutes + doing counterpoint exercises and by now I've learned to write entire compositions without taking an excessive amount of time). Knar's dedication to helping her students was one of a kind - e.g. making the time to meet students one on one for advice and help on their compositions. Getting the chance in class to share with your classmates what you have created.\r\nWeaknesses: Some more emphasis on analyzing existing works could be more valuable than focusing a great portion on learning rules to complete exercises and homework. More group work in class rather than more lecture-style working on exercises - would be really helpful to mix students of different skill levels and see how groups may analyze works differently. "

            "\u00a0Yes! Coming from a guitar player who couldn't even read bass clef before taking to 210, you'll really surprise yourself with what you can learn. Some exercises/homework may be frustrating but given a couple months you'll really be amazed at how much you've improved. Even if you think you might be better placed in 110, definitely give 210 a shot. Very rewarding whether you're a music major or a bio major or any major! "
