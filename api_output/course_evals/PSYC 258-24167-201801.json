            "\u00a0This course teaches you so much in such a short time it's incredible. If, like me, you have no neuroimaging experience whatsoever going into the course, you get familiar with the format of fMRI data. But beyond that, you'll learn both the concepts and implementation behind SVM classification, searchlight analysis, representational similarity analysis, dimensionality reduction, structural/functional alignment, real-time neurofeedback, and more. The Jupyter notebooks around which the course is structured are the ideal tool for introducing and experimenting with these methods. By the time the final project came around, I was shocked by just how much I was able to do on my own.\r\n\r\nOne thing to add: we cover a lot of machine learning techniques in this class, but we don't dive into the theory behind them as much as some might like. This isn't at all an indictment of the class  there's simply no time, and the implementation is more relevant  but if you're the kind of person who really likes a deep, principled, mathematical understanding of everything they're doing, consider taking something like S&DS 365 concurrently. ",

            "\u00a0Lots of useful, interesting computational techniques in this class! We learned about everything from classifiers to real-time fMRI. Challenging material, but highly relevant if you are doing fMRI research, and highly worth it. ",
            "\u00a0How to analyze fMRI data using the newest tools in Python ",
            "\u00a0I received a great deal of knowledge about machine learning and ways to analyze fMRI data. This was an extremely useful class. ",
            "\u00a0I gained exposure to a wide range of valuable techniques, including some of the most cutting edge analyses being applied in cognitive neuroimaging today.  CMHN helped me gain proficiency in Python, as well as familiarity with many of the essential libraries needed to perform advanced analysis of fMRI data (Numpy, SciKit Learn, NiLearn, SciPy, etc...)  After taking this course, I also feel like I can digest current fMRI literature with ease, since Nick and Cameron did such a great job hammering home fundamental concepts relating to data collection, preprocessing, classification, regression, as well as  fancier techniques like MVPA, searchlights, correlation analysis, and hyper-alignment. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt a lot about how to analyze fMRI data such as applying masks, transforming data to produce the relevant time series etc. I also picked up a lot of machine learning techniques such as k-mean clustering, SVC classification and applying these techniques to fMRI data using python toolkit. Overall, it is a good introduction of cutting edge methods in computational neuroscience. ",

            "\u00a0Everything about this course was fantastic. Such a class must be a logistical nightmare seeing as it puts such a drain on computational resources, and yet there were virtually no hiccups, even in the first year the course was offered at Yale. My only suggestion for how the course could be improved would be to introduce the final project earlier so that we have more time to think about potential ideas before we start working on it full steam. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Very well organized class, well designed assignments, clear lectures\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the assignments held our hand too much, so we didn't get much experience in using the respective packages. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Prof. Turk-Browne is a wonderful instructor, and the material is challenging but engaging. The labs each week and the final project help you to really learn the material.\r\nWeaknesses: Only complaint is that the weekly labs do run long, and they are due the day after class, so make sure you have time in your schedule for them! ",
            "\u00a0This class is set up in a great way. However, I wish it were a little more friendly to undergraduates who have not worked with fMRI data before. The deadlines and expectations of the class were really difficult to meet, although it would have been more reasonable for people who have done some of this before. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: truly superior course design, consistent focus on the most cutting-edge methods, Nick's lecturing, the opportunity to collaborate closely with grad students (as an undergrad), how fun the assignments were, integration of current best practices for data science (GitHub, data sharing, open-source software packages, etc...) \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: really none to report, other than occasional technical glitches probably arising from the fact that this was the first iteration of the course.  I would take this course again in its current format without question, just to have another crack at some of the assignments! ",
            "\u00a0The class is taught at a manageable pace and the data sets are generally very interesting. It is a blessing in disguise to have the work assigned on Tuesday and due on Wednesday as it forces us to spend one intense day on it and not worry about it for the rest of the week. It might be useful to go through the basic commands for nilearn and brainiak in the first few lessons as many of us are not that familiar with fMRI analysis using python. ",
            "\u00a0AMAZING course, phenomenal job by Nick Turk-Browne and the teaching staff Cameron Ellis.\r\n\r\nGood structure of a 3-hour class, with labs and papers and Nick's info.\r\nNo weaknesses. "

            "\u00a0This is hands down the best neuroscience course I have taken at Yale, and one of the best courses I have ever taken, period. (I say that as a second-semester senior.) Even if you have never gone near an fMRI scanner and have never taken Greg McCarthy's lab, you can still get a huge amount out of this class assuming you have at least a little bit of programming experience. Unlike all other lab classes I have ever been in, where you use very old techniques and/or produce relatively simple results, this class puts you at the cutting edge of human neuroscience. You'll use brand new tools like Full Correlation Matrix Analysis, developed by none other than Prof. Turk Browne in 2015. The notion that I could go from knowing nothing about fMRI data processing on Day 1 of the course to completing a relatively sophisticated final project is a testament to how much the course teaches you in such a short time.\r\n\r\nThe feel of the course is also delightful. Since it's about half grad students, people are far less concerned about their grades and more invested in learning the material. Class is always very collaborative. Assignments are due the day after class, which is actually a blessing in disguise because it forces you to be fully immersed in the assignment the day-of (usually 4-5 hours, 3 of which are class time).\r\n\r\nI don't plan to use fMRI at any point in my future research, but this class was nonetheless hugely helpful in that (1) I can now read pretty much any fMRI paper and get a sense of what the authors did and (2) I now have the tools to work with ANY high-dimensional data and relate it back to brain function. If you care at all about either of these two points, or if you just want to learn a lot of cool stuff really quickly, then you simply must take this course. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. It's a very unique class in that it combines programming/implementations , computational analysis, and neuroscience. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Whether you're a psychology/neuroscience major hoping to do fMRI research or a computer science student who wants to learn more about advanced computational methods for very large data sets, this class is a must-take. Every week is an organized module on a different method, and the material comes together nicely in the weekly Jupyter notebook assignments. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class! However, it is challenging. I would only recommend it to students with extensive programming knowledge and interest in doing a lot to advance their knowledge of fMRI research. ",
            "\u00a0As a senior undergraduate, I can say that CMHN was one of my top 3 favorite courses at Yale (and by far my favorite STEM course).  I began the semester having a superficial grasp of the basic fMRI concepts (mostly informed by what I learned in Intro Psych/Cogsci, Human Brain, etc.) and knowing barely any Python.  By semester's end, I found myself implementing entire analysis pipelines from scratch to accomplish tasks such as predicting accurately whether or not music was playing in the background of a TV episode shown to subjects in the scanner, or whether the main character was on-screen, etc.  If you have any interest in neuroimaging, cognitive science, machine learning, data science in general, coding, the list goes on... there will be something for you in CMHN. ",
            "\u00a0Yes if you have background in python and have read some papers using fMRI techniques. The content can be a little advance for someone without both background but this course is perfect for someone who has worked with machine learning and want to apply it to neuroscience. ",
            "\u00a0Walkin' through the DOOR, the CLASSROOM is a glow\r\nKaleidoscope of BRAIN WAVES and IMAGES\r\nEverybody here USES NUM-PYTHON\r\nSearchin' for a sound we hadn't heard before\r\nAnd it said\r\nWelcome BRAINIAK\r\nIt's been waitin' for you\r\nWelcome BRAINIAK, welcome to New York\r\nWelcome to New York\r\nIt's been waitin' for you\r\nWelcome to New York, welcome to New York\r\nIt's FMRI I could DO SOME SEARCHLIGHT, SOME SEARCHLIGHT\r\nThe lights are so bright but they never blind me, me\r\nWelcome to New York\r\nIt's been waitin' for you\r\nWelcome to New York, welcome to New York\r\nWhen we STARTED JUPYTER on THE CLUSTER\r\nTook our broken hearts, put them in a drawer\r\nEverybody here was someone else before\r\nAnd you can want who you want\r\n\r\n* just know that we can reverse-decode that image in your brain\r\n\r\nYa, I'd say take it if you 1) are comfortable learning Python or if you know it already, 2) want to know the state-of-the-art in fMRI, and the opportunity to talk to Nick and see what he's excited about, 3) the chance to spend a few hours every week with ~15 other students (range of experiences, some are undergrads, some work in labs) doing things like classification and blocks "
