            "\u00a0I gained an actual understanding of the history and current challenges of poverty policy in the United States. This class was so helpful because it actually taught us the facts of the policies behind the social trends and problems we see and attempt to evaluate in other classes. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the frameworks through which poverty was understood historically by poor people, politicians, and the general public. I also learned the types of issues that policymakers take into account when evaluating policy solutions. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so incredibly much about the history of poverty and anti-poverty policy the United States. It is a course that really makes you think about your personal experienced and politics. Had lots of whoa! moments throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about welfare policy. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly ,a lot. I learned so much about poverty, but also corollary issues such as racial and gendered dynamics in public policy. And extremely interesting course in many ways. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided a detailed exploration into the policy measures that have been implements or proposed to address poverty and the factors that impact these policy decisions. I also learned about the different disciplines and methods used to form such solutions (ex: economics, sociology, etc.). ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about the history of social policy as well as some tools for how to evaluate and criticize policy. ",
            "\u00a0SOCY 341 gives a comprehensive overview and analysis of poverty in the U.S. Starting from the recent history of poverty to current day, the course covers the measurement of poverty, welfare reform, the Great Recession, and various other facets central to poverty in the U.S. The readings cover not only policy briefs and the perspectives of the government/policymakers, but also incorporates more ethnographic studies and perspectives of those living \"on the grounds\" and on the receiving end of many of these policies. ",
            "\u00a0I have been a recipient of many social welfare policies my entire life, but this is the first time I truly understood what goes into policy as a general category and the specific policies that impact my family and communities on a daily basis. I learned to read policy makers and scholars alike to understand how these opinions and research inform the current policy we have. Honey, when you really break down everything that goes into policy, you don't wonder anymore about how we got where we are today. This class is absolutely phenomenal. "

            "\u00a0This is the best seminar I have taken so far at Yale. Professor Grieger is amazing! This is a great seminar because Professor Grieger allows students to lead discussion, and there is never a quiet or dull moment. The readings for the class are wonderful. There can be a lot of reading sometimes, but it is always worth your time to do. \r\n\r\nThe course is incredibly organized, which makes it easy to be dedicated to the work. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the course is designed in such a way that you do now need background in poverty to catch up, so it will introduce students to the main literature relevant to the topics discussed. That said, the course is not introductory and is not a survey. The course goes in depth (Through the readings and discussion) in every theme and ties it back to previous themes examined. \r\n\r\nThere are no major weaknesses in the course. I enjoyed it a lot. ",
            "\u00a0The course was organized extremely well in terms of the topics we covered per week (started with the construction of poverty and then continued more or less chronologically). I like that we had discussion leaders each week because we get to hear students thoughts all the time and discuss very interesting questions. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course could have been broken up differently. I did not love how the first half was history and second half themes, because when we were talking about history so much was left out that we wouldnt get to until themes and when we talked about themes our discussions were not really rooted in readings/policy. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Absolutely fascinating, GREAT professor, GREAT students selected from the class, discussions are moderated in a respectful and productive way. Ugh, amazing. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some readings might go over your hear, and some topics might be difficult to talk about, but this comes with the subject matter. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very fair amount of reading and course assignments, the readings were engaging and produced a lot of discussions, Professor Grieger is an amazing discussion leader and can guide the conversation very well \r\nWeaknesses: the only week that felt incomplete/unclear was Men, Fatherhood, and Poverty. I think that there was room to delve deeper into the ways fatherhood is viewed differently based on race and gender and how this drives a policy response (including a lack of policy response). ",
            "\u00a0This course was an invaluable survey of poverty and social welfare policy, and the readings helped with that, but I felt like I could have used less factual readings and more opinion-centered readings, especially in the first half of the course. That would have helped me get an idea of the deeper stakes and consequences involved in the policies. I also could have used more specific feedback on my response papers. ",
            "\u00a0The primary strength of the course is Professor Grieger -- his expertise in both academia and the private sector with experience in both sociology and statistics is a blessing for the students in that they are exposed to a wide range of readings/material and have the opportunity to learn from an expert with a more well-rounded perspective. While the readings can be a bit heavy (there will be about 150 pages minimum per week), Professor Grieger has taken the time to meticulously select specific readings from a wide range of sources that \"talk\" with each other (directly and indirectly) beautifully, and lend themselves to eye-opening and powerful discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Only strengths. This course was exhausting but AMAZING! ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Class facilitation and discussion "

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone that is interested in any social issue. Poverty and poverty policy is relevant to just about everything. You will learn so much from the readings, from Professor Grieger, and especially from the other students in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, you will be able to develop deep understanding on an issue that is so pertinent and will always be so. ",
            "\u00a0I would 100% recommend this course to another student. Even if you are not a sociology major or anything related to it, I think it is important to learn about poverty and inequality and be informed on all of that stuff before going into the real world. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!!! If you want to learn a LOT about welfare policy! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Absolutely great. If you want to engage in really stimulating discussions and think about how to solve issues in public policy and American poverty then this is the perfect class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This is an amazing course that will challenge your own assumptions about poverty and shed light on why the issue is so complicated. This was my favorite class of the semester and I looked forward to coming to class every week. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student -- I would basically consider this course a distributional requirement. All the readings are totally worthwhile, the workload (5 responses and individual components during the weeks in which you lead discussion, and a final paper) is completely manageable, and the discussions are some of the most eye-opening that I've had in a class during my time at Yale. Especially for those who haven't had much experience or exposure to what poverty looks like in the U.S., I would highly recommend (or even mandate) you take this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The TA and professor are excellent. Well-organized. It is actually ran as a seminar so you gain a lot from the people in the room. ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested in learning how policy works and also going deeper into what is actually behind them, this class is perfect for you. "
