            "\u00a0This course taught me how to approach international development from a multi-faceted perspective. I learned how to write policy memos and briefs and to discuss development issues on a country-level and regional-level. The \"sovereignty gap\" was a very meaningful concept that I can hopefully apply in a future career. ",
            "\u00a0Prof Lockhart brings a ton of practical experience from years working with global leaders in developed and developing countries. Her experience has been invaluable to understanding the shortcomings of todays approach to development. I learned a lot about current practices and developed a good framework to think about approaching countries that require assistance. ",

            "\u00a0practical insights into the array of challenges facing reformers, and a much improved ability to communicate succinctly but substantively ",
            "\u00a0Statecraft, effective statebuilding, weak states. ",
            "\u00a0Differnt perspective. Loved interacting with students from other schools. Completly differnt from traditional courses I am taking at SOM ",
            "\u00a0I learned a whole lot about the development of effective states in terms of best practice, cases, and meeting key people in the development space. This class was amazing ",
            "\u00a0I have learnt ten functions of a state and this course helps me to understand and evaluate the government. The visit to DC brought textbook discussions to life. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: strongly discussion-oriented, diverse group of students, the professor is an esteemed practitioner.\r\nWeaknesses: N/A. Students would show up late often. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: good balance between practice and theory, size of class, amazing professor, DC trip and in class speaker series \r\n\r\nWeakness: we should organize a more extensive trip given the success of the DC trip. ",
            "\u00a0The topic of the course was very interesting and relevant, and I appreciated the opportunity to learn from a distinguished practitioner like Clare. Really enjoyed the DC trip in particular as I thought it helpful to hear the perspectives and work of major stakeholders. However, the course suffered from serious organizational issues -- didn't often know what type of format we would get in class (guest speaker, seminar, or lecture) and whether we would discuss the required readings for that class or not. I often preferred the lecture format as seminar allowed for too many non sequitur or irrelevant comments from some students in the class. ",
            "\u00a0While learning from fellow students was great, it would also have been interesting to able to learn the more technical aspects of perhaps a specific function - how to evaluate or develop that. ",
            "\u00a0maintain a stricter schedule - put stricter time limits on topics discussed so that we can get to all scheduled topics in a session and avoid having to discuss things for which we did the readings a few weeks prior \r\n\r\nneedless to say, the DC trip was an absolute highlight of the class ",
            "\u00a0It's a greta class, no improvements necessary. ",

            "\u00a0Excellent use of class discussion, real lwife examples, very knowledgeable and experienced professor. Class trip to DC was amazing. Professor Lockhart is exceptional, very knowledgeable, but also has an excellent teaching style and makes students feel comfortable and empowered to participate. ",
            "\u00a0I like the element of bringing speakers to classroom but sometimes I found the sharing from speakers is not related to what we are learning in class. "
