            "\u00a0I think I was interested in tracking the secularization of hermeneutics throughout this course, and I think I got a better sense of what this looks like and how frameworks and methods broadened and narrowed and took influence from various places in order to re-formulate what constituted self-conscious 'hermeneutic' practice.  I think I also learned that 'hermeneutics' has become a term that beggars definition beyond a certain historical and cultural point of reference.  Gadamer's \"Truth and Method,\" for example seems to be a 'revivalist' work, in some sense, for a discipline that was--as a self-conscious and distinctive discipline--sort of short-lived and traceable in short order from Schleiermacher to Dilthey.  \r\n\r\nThe problematic of \"What *is* hermeneutics?\" was brought to life for me in this course.  As someone with an investment in whatever it is, I found this troubling but valuable. ",
            "\u00a0Insight into the general intellectual history of philosophical and theological hermeneutics. ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge of the overview of the hermeneutic method, from the Reformation through the 20th century; a professional engagement with the materials read and discussed; a deeper sense of connection between literary and biblical studies. ",
            "\u00a0I gleaned a robust survey of hermeneutics, and was able to write a paper on a topic that I was interested in, which allowed me to go further in depth. ",
            "\u00a0A historical understanding of the hermeneutic tradition, its crucial figures, attending problems and contemporary debates. ",

            "\u00a0knowledge of history of philosophy, history of text criticism, history of hermeneutics as a discipline, ways of reading, etc. "

            "\u00a0My own background made me think that I had some idea of what 'hermeneutics' was and what kind of things I could expect of the course.  For others, it seems that 'hermeneutics' can only be discussed as a troubled signifier; I imagine that many students will feel that still lack a go-to 'encyclopedia definition' for the term.  I'm not so bothered by that, but I can see how a certain kind of comparative approach week to week would be clarifying if this course were to be taught in a similar environment again: If a given week's reading was presented as a problematic that helped to define 'hermeneutics' against some more familiar discipline that overlaps with it, maybe that would help.  So, 'Translation as/or hermeneutics,' or 'Criticism as/or hermeneutics,' 'Historicism as/or hermeneutics' . . . along this line, I would only add that I think a week on psychoanalytic interpretation would present a useful point for discussion of continuity/renovation of 'interpretation' (as a clear example of what happens when a 'text' as such is removed as a necessary component of 'interpretation').\r\n\r\nThe 'interventions' in this course--where students were given the chance to bring in the works of scholars in whom they had some particular investment in order to question or otherwise affect the given trajectory of the course readings--were a real treat.  I got to know my fellow students better as a result of them and also got to be exposed to unexpected thinkers and ways of viewing the core course readings. ",
            "\u00a0It was taken for granted that most of the students in the class were operating at a high level; however, that made the course difficult because for students, like myself, who didn't have background or exposure in hermeneutics it was difficult to understand what was going on in the discussion. Moreover, I think the students and I could've benefited with some pedagogical guidance by the instructor to define terms, outline the arguments, and critically think about how some thinkers overlap with others. ",
            "\u00a0There could have been a bit more overall structurethat is, more discussion surrounding the coherency of the course's movement, chronologically and thematically. ",
            "\u00a0I would have appreciated more lecturing from Dr. Weidner. The presentation and intervention system was good, and I don't think that should be revised, but I would like to hear more of what Dr. Weidner has to say about the material (since he is the expert, after all!). ",
            "\u00a0The density of the course was sometimes excessively high in terms of reading speeds, but this was unavoidable due to unusual scheduling. Otherwise the course was excellent. ",
            "\u00a0Strength:  I enjoyed the presentation and intervention format, the readings were also interesting. \r\n\r\nWeakness: would have been helpful to have a little more about what exactly \"hermeneutics\" meant for the various authors we read  (some clearly had very different ideas on its meaning). Also some of the discussions became highly specific and many of the students could not contribute to the conversation. On the same line, it might have been useful to send the interventions to the class ahead of time to make engaging with the presentation more productive (especially for people who were not familiar with the person or text being used for the intervention). ",
            "\u00a0The discussions could get a little tedious and off topic, but the teacher was a great instructor. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very good introduction to hermeneutics. The introduction/intervention format was a good incentive to get students to talk and share ideas about certain authors or ideas.\r\n\r\nRoom for improvement:\r\nIf the class had not been an intensive seminar with an explicit focus on the German Reformation onward, it would have been nice to have spent a class looking at some classical/medieval authors to see what hermeneutics was like before the Reformation. Also, a few literary texts to be considered in light of the readings would have helped ground some of the more abstract, theoretical ideas on the concrete practice of reading. But alas, one could only ask for so much! "

            "\u00a0Yes. I really think that this kind of course is important for opening up conversation among people who interpret texts from a background in different disciplines.  I also think it's extremely important for people to become aware of the broad history of conditioning factors for the methods reading practices that they have unconsciously inherited in their own disciplines within the humanities; there are few opportunities for doing this in atmospheres that are collaborative among different disciplines in the humanities.  It is telling that this iteration of the course was populated almost entirely by divinity school students; this shows that 'hermeneutics' is registered in at an American university as more 'living' qua 'religious' discipline than anything else at this point in time.  This illustrates the degree to which discussion of 'interpretation' as its own monster has been subsumed by the specific heritages of disciplines and departments, and so also illustrates the need for attention to 'interpretation as such' among scholars who come from different but historically interdependent fields. ",
            "\u00a0Probably not; I am a Divinity School student, and though it did aid my studies well, I'm not sure how helpful it would've been to someone who hadn't previously studied literary theory or hermeneutics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend this course to other students if they are interested in learning more about some of the major trends in German hermeneutics, particularly in terms of biblical interpretation. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only if they had a sufficiently strong philosophical background. The readings and discussions were rewarding, but heavy and difficult to grasp without good preparation. Some knowledge of the authors read would also be useful, given that we fly by them so quickly. "
