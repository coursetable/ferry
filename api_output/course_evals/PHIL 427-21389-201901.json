            "\u00a0The bulk of the course deals with Turning machines and recursive functions. Then, in the last two weeks we breeze through G\\\"odel's incompleteness theorems. ",
            "\u00a0We proved Gdel's incompleteness theorems. ",
            "\u00a0An in-depth exposition of Godel's incompleteness theorems and the overall theory of computability, covering Church's thesis, Turing/Abacus machines, and recursive functions. ",
            "\u00a0A broad knowledge of the philosophical and mathematical underpinnings of computability theory. Covered how to make turing machines, various definitions of Recursive and Primitive Recursive functions, Abacus machines, computable functions, Church's Thesis, the Halting Problem, Gdel Numbering, Provability, Arithmetic, Lb's Theorem, axiomatizability, decidability, consistency, completeness. ",
            "\u00a0Over the course of the class, you go through the entire proof of Gdel's Incompleteness Theorems and other negative results about computability and logic. It is very beautiful material, and I appreciated the level of depth. ",
            "\u00a0The class is a great introduction to some of the most interesting questions in philosophy ",
            "\u00a0I learned about Godel's incompleteness theorem. The topic was broken down into the most general foundations of logic that built up to his conclusion. ",
            "\u00a0How Turing machines work. A very rushed and very loose run-through of Godel's Incompleteness Theorems. ",
            "\u00a0You learn more about the nature of computation, and how this subtly ties in to our ability to use logical systems to formally prove things. By doing this, you become more adept at thinking abstractly, and reading and understanding various mathematical formalisms. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the conceptual linkages between mathematics, philosophy, and computer science. ",
            "\u00a0This course closely followed the book Computability and Logic by George S. Boolos and Richard C. Jeffrey. We covered chapters 1-10, 15, and 16 as per the third edition.  The wholes course essentially serves to prepare you for the proofs of Gdel's incompleteness theorems. ",
            "\u00a0I developed an understanding of the theory of computation from a logical perspective, including major concepts such as Turing machines and Church's Thesis as well as key proofs, particularly Godel's Incompleteness Theorems. The course offered an excellent extension of other logic courses, as it explores the powers and limitations of different logical systems. "

            "\u00a0A weakness of the course is how it's structured; two hours is simply too long for a lecture format course. I found I could never pay attention for the full two hours. ",
            "\u00a0It was not well taught. The professor's lecture is well organized but it is hard to understand her. ",
            "\u00a0TA's were not helpful at all--they did not try to make the material approachable. If you did not understand with their first attempt at a poor explanation then you were screwed. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures are very engaging and entertaining, and the problem sets often went beyond the lecture to further explore a topic that was touched on in class. The end of the class felt a little rushed and I got a little lost in some of the proofs and derivations: I think the class could have benefitted from spending an extra lecture or two on the final set of theorems that we discussed. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course could have moved a little faster, but that's maybe because I have a math background (and students with more of a logic/philosophy background may feel otherwise).  I generally don't like the idea of group presentations, but they seemed to go well -- the only issue I had was there were too many interruptions (in the form of forced student questions and professor questions) and the flow kind of got lost.\r\nAs for positives, the lecture notes were very helpful and the course material was fascinating. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Sun-Joo is a great person and is very knowledgable about the course material. She also has a wicked sense of humor that makes coming to class each week really a treat. The material is interesting, and the workload is extremely manageable. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Grading can seem kinda nit-picky and arbitrary, so just be warned that they will deduct points on homework and the finals because of technicalities since those technicalities do actually matter. Also, it's pretty easy to walk away from the course without actually having understood anything. I feel like I can explain the general concepts to most people, but I couldn't really go into the proofs, and it took a lot of 'relearning' to study for the oral exam and the final project which kinda felt like learning it for the first time.\r\n\r\nThe grading system kinda depends on how much you like it: 5% for each of the 4 problem sets, 20% for a group presentation, 30% for an oral exam on the first half of the course content, and 30% for a written take-home final on the second half of the course content. The final does take a lot of time, so don't start it late. Also, definitely go see the TFs, they clearly know what they're talking about and moreover, know exactly how to help you on the psets. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Well-organized; stimulating but manageable homework; interesting material.\r\nWeaknesses: Significant portion of the class was taught through student presentations of varying quality and clarity; TAs were the worst I have encountered at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very well organized given the difficulty of teaching and testing the material. ",
            "\u00a0The classwork isn't astronomic and allow syou room to breath and understand the material. That being said, it only meets once a week for an extended period of time so if when you miss that class you fall behind very easily. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength of the class is the enthusiasm that Prof. Shin shows when she teaches. The main weakness, however, is that she rarely teaches. About 4 of the 12 weeks of the course are student presentations. You are held responsible for learning from your classmate's presentations. Prof. Shin also gives you an oral exam about a very difficult topic which she doesn't cover at all in class. So this class is basically a teach-yourself extravaganza. ",
            "\u00a0The teaching and varied assessment modes (oral test, presentation, psets) were great, and made class more lively while also acting as an incentive to really know the material well. Sun Joo is really enthusiastic and willing to help out students whenever necessary. In terms of weaknesses, I felt that the last 2 weeks of the course were slightly rushed, and we didn't delve deeply enough into the 'value' of Godel's incompleteness theorems and their consequences. It would also be nice to split the class up into 2 smaller periods, instead of a marathon 2 hour long session each Monday, since the material we learnt each week would mostly be promptly forgotten by the next. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Shin is an engaging and brilliant lecturer, and she masterfully explains the complex concepts of the course. However, the duration of student presentations turned out to be a bit overwhelming. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The results proven in this course are actually very cool, even if the methods and notation involved are a bit clunky or hard to conceptualize. Look up the topics in advance and decide if they interest you.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The in class instruction generally isn't very good - the lectures are scheduled in such a way that there's a painfully long lecture only once per week and it's difficult to stay awake. You might be better off just reading the textbook at times. Also, a lot of the semester consists of student presentations (perhaps even the majority of the lectures are presentations). What this means is that the instructor (Shin) is assessing you over material that she isn't even teaching you. And whenever you do give a presentation you're essentially teaching yourself the material. Basically the whole semester it felt like you were forced to teach yourself the material and then were assessed over it. Also, the graders were very harsh - much more so than even math dept graders tend to be. They were anal about the details so even though this class isn't too much work be warned that it can come back to bite you. ",
            "\u00a0The course was organized well, with useful assignments (particularly the oral midterm) and a clear lecture structure. The timeslot is slightly challenging -- a two-hour lecture in the late afternoon -- but Professor Shin's humor kept class sessions moving. "

            "\u00a0This course is taught by Professor Shin and she's a very strong lecturer/cares about her students/makes lecture productive. If you are interested in the material, it's absolutely a class worth taking. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would. The bulk of the course is pretty chill, and the material is fun and interesting. I will warn, though, that the take home final kinda came out of nowhere and was much more difficult than the rest of the work for the class. There's also a certain lack of precision in the way that Professor Shin presents the material that might irk math majors. Professor Shin's notation is idiosyncratic enough that one can't learn all the material through the textbook or seek help from an online resource. ",

            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Prof Shin is amazing. She is a great lecturer, a good person, and an approachable teacher. However, if this class is structured again such that you have minimal time with the professor and lots of time with (bad) TAs, then I would suggest avoiding this class unless you need it for your major. ",
            "\u00a0A great, relatively low-workload class that is of interest to people interested in computer science or the theory of computation. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class more to students with a math background than a philosophy background.  It's essentially a math class that's listed in the philosophy department and as such it's easier/more approachable for math majors.  The content is fascinating (more so than the previous logic classes in the sequence), so if you think you're interested in the material and are willing to do intense math/proofs, I'd take this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah, absolutely. I decided to take it at the last minute on a whim and I'm very glad I did. If you like Math, Philosophy, or CS, you'll fit right in. For the Philosophy students, be forewarned that it does deal with a lot of formal mathematical concepts, like induction, and assumes a solid background in Logic. I've never taken Logic before, I did fine, but I see where it could have helped. ",
            "\u00a0Would definitely recommend. It presents material that is important and fascinating for anyone studying mathematics, computer science, and/or philosophy. The material is well organized, and the class is manageable in terms of the workload. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend to anyone interested in Godel's Incompleteness Theorems. The material is quite challenging but worth the effort. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it if you're interested in pure logic and understanding theory. ",
            "\u00a0If you're thinking of taking this class for a gut QR/Hu, be wary. The material is conceptually difficult and only about half of it is taught to you. The assessments are fair. There are only 4 psets that are very easy, an oral exam that is difficult, an easy presentation, and a very difficult take-home exam.  The last week of the course surmounts to teaching yourself the incompleteness theorems. \r\n\r\nIf you're taking the class to actually learn about the incompleteness theorems then also be wary. This course focuses mostly on the concept of computability. The only thing we really learned during the semester is what is a Turing machine. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in the nature of computation or logical systems, then definitely! To fully appreciate the 2nd half of the course, I would strongly recommend taking Math Logic (PHIL 270) first. If not, understanding some of the syntax and results would require quite a bit of extra work. Also note that even though the course is listed under Philosophy, it is virtually a math course - you will mostly be solving problems or writing proofs. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. While I mostly do pure math, the opportunity to learn more about the philosophical underpinnings of challenges facing the field was exciting and worthwhile. It seemed to attract students from many different field of study, resulting in a class of diverse interests that improved my understanding of the material. ",
            "\u00a0If you're excited enough about the subject matter to teach it to yourself then sure, take this class. Just understand that the structure is very unorthodox, especially for what is essentially just a math class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students interested in learning more about logic. Professor Shin is a wonderful lecturer, uniquely capable of making complex material completely intuitive. (I recommend visiting her office hours as much as I do taking the course!) Also, I did not come to this course with a significant background in math or computer science, and I found the class wholly enjoyable, though often challenging. "
