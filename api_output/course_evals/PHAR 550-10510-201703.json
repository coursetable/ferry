            "\u00a0A strength of the course is it teaches a variety of topics.\r\n\r\nA downside to the course was that some of the lecturers were far inferior to others. For example, I learned nothing from the lectures on cardiac physiology.\r\n\r\nAlso, the tests were poorly worded in some parts and asked some obscure questions in some places. \r\n\r\nThe graduate sections were a complete waste of time. I gained nothing from them. They need to either be revamped or removed. ",
            "\u00a0I loved that different professors lectured throughout although Mark was definitely the best. I found the professor who lectured about the heart incredibly difficult to follow though. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very well-organized. Dr. Saltzman and other TAs are very approachable and are always willing to help. ",
            "\u00a0The lab portion of the course or graduate students is a waste of time and offers little to no insight on concepts. The TFs and instructors don't take it seriously so it is unclear why the labs are a part of the course at all. \r\n\r\nThe discussion sections could be more helpful if the instructor actually allowed students to discuss the concepts in the assigned papers. Instead students are asked questions and allowed to give 1-3 word answers before being cut off by the instructor restating what the student just said. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of this course were the great level of detail provided for most lectures. The exams were well designed to assess student understanding (though the final exam was ridiculous to be honest, just so incredibly boring having to write out these monotonous responses, it was a medium difficulty test, but it just wore you down, which is a bad way to assess knowledge--the midterms were much much better)\r\n\r\nThe weaknesses of this course were that I do not think it covered enough material. The nervous system and sensory system lectures were all fantastic--save for the somatosensory system which was not as well done as the others--with great amounts of detail. The cardiovascular lectures were rubbish (apologies to Dr. Boulpaep...he is much better suited for intimate lectures on a topic of narrow scope rather than broad topics) and this is a big problem because this system is extremely important. I think to improve the course, sadly Dr. Boulpaep's role should be taken over by someone else. The kidney, respiratory, and endocrine systems did not cover enough details and were allotted substantially more class time than needed considering the amount of material. For the kidney and respiratory systems, 5 lectures each is a reasonable time dedication, but so much more material could be included to make these sections more valuable to students. The endocrine system is of course important, but everything covered by Dr. Holt should be done in 3 lectures maximum, not 5. The endocrine system should not be allotted the same amount of class time as the cardiovascular system. There were additionally several lectures at the beginning of the course which were unneeded (e.g. plasma membrane, membrane transport) as essential information from these lectures could be conveyed in 10-15 minutes and the remaining lecture time could be devoted to additional topics not discussed in the course, such as a heavier focus on the liver or a discussion of the urea cycle or other important biochemical pathways.\r\n\r\nFor the graduate portions of the course, the papers with Dr. Boulpaep were a total waste of time. These could have been valuable as reading primary literature is important and informative, but unfortunately these sessions devolved into Dr. Boulpaep asking random, extremely straightforward questions such as \"what do the black squares on the graph indicate\" when there is a very obvious figure legend displayed which provides this information. For the MATLAB sessions, a couple were quite useful (kidney, endocrine), while others were not very good at all (respiratory, visual, cardiac electrophysiology), though the principal reason these were poor was because the code was far too complex and explained very poorly. These sessions could all be good and much more useful if more care was taken with explanation of the code, this would also benefit physiologists by learning additional marketable skills such as MATLAB and coding in general. This could be a whole course on its own, where students learn to design physiological systems by coding, and were this portion of the course executed better would benefit Yale Graduate Students greatly (as it currently stands, these sessions are entirely busy work and everyone I talked to despises them).\r\n\r\nFinally, in a similar vein, it would be more beneficial to graduate students if there were a different required physiology course of a higher level. As I mentioned earlier, there are several areas which could be expanded upon and additional topics to be covered. The course overall was useful, but it was fairly basic when it could be a lot better if there was more in depth. If changing the course structure so dramatically is not an option, perhaps graduate students could instead (or in addition) of the graduate papers/labs get additional lecture material which covers the topics in greater depth. ",
            "\u00a0It was taught quite well, Profs Saltzman and Aronson in particular were very good communicators. Class required quite a high direct workload/interaction. Late tutorials were too much in my opinion. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent organization, amazing areas to learn about !\r\nBut this is an undergraduate course that has been slightly modified to become a graduate course. This is scheme is very annoying, compared to my other two graduate courses, Physiological systems took as much time if not more to get the same  grade. The time commitment we put into this course should be less especially because classes are not priority as grad students any more. \r\n\r\nI would advise either design a graduate level version of the course more like what university in North America do, and try to address the needs of undergraduates and grad students at the same time. Or keep the 3 lecture per week, get rid of the undergraduate discussion and exams, give weekly assignments and paper to read and carry on with a evaluation scheme more like other graduate courses. ",
            "\u00a0The course is a good overview of how the human body works. The level of detail for each system is inconsistent. That is, some systems are studied in excruciating detail and the names of everything must be memorized, where as in other systems you only need to understand basic function. The graduate course lab did not add a great deal of understanding, but instead seemed to be forced study time for the exams. It did help, but I'm not certain it was necessary. It felt like busywork much of the time. The exams were not reflective of what was emphasized as important in the course. The short answer questions on the quizzes and exams were often unclear in what they were asking. ",
            "\u00a0The content is its main strength. I feel That it could be organized better. Making it more clear from the beginning what content matters and the level of specificity needed on tests and WHY. The lectures were not all consistent in quality and the point distribution of  exam questions did not make sense. ",
