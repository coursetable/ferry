            "\u00a0I learned a lot about signal transduction pathways and how to think about these not only in terms of sequence of events but cross talk and some of the biochemistry/structural biology as well "

            "\u00a0Strengths - broad range of signaling topics\r\nWeaknesses - broad range means low level of detail on any particular signaling pathway ",
            "\u00a0This course was extremely disorganized. Although the lecturers were enthusiastic, many of the professors had very little to no idea when the class was suppose to end or what lectures we already had/did not have. As a result, they would include way too much information/material (sometimes 90+ slides for a class thats 80 minutes long) and would wrap up their talk without having any form of a comprehensible conclusion. There was also an instance when we had the exact same lecture given by two different professors (~95% similarity, perhaps even higher). \r\n\r\nIt is almost impossible to decipher the information on the power point outside of class, as the slides are a fairly even mix between extremely low resolution pictures from a textbook or paper (without captions of course), incomplete thoughts that bear no intuitive connection to previous slides and hundred word summaries of a given topic. \r\n\r\nAlso forget about getting any sort of feedback. You get three exams for this class (one per each of the three modules). Exams are super vague... some questions are so broad you can write a whole 10 page paper on a certain topic, e.g. gas signaling, and you will still not get full credit. Do you want to know why you got something wrong? Well you will never find out. The only thing you get is a 2x7 excel spreadsheet that says what you got on each question. ",
            "\u00a0The course instructors continually had no idea what other course instructors were teaching and they voiced this repeatedly. There were two GPCR lectures that were entirely on the same topic. This was good in the sense that we received a lot of instruction on this topic but we could have learned about a different aspect of this topic had there been less redundancy. Also, some instructors assumed specialized knowledge on behalf of the students and this made learning certain topics difficult. The strengths included the topics chosen to dive into- these are highly relevant for many different types of biological problems and they were grouped into modules well to facilitate understanding. "

            "\u00a0Yes, as an introduction to signaling. But if you're a grad student whose lab focuses on signaling, you probably know most of these things already. ",
            "\u00a0Unless you need to take this course as a requirement, I would not recommend this class. Having a thorough understanding of signaling pathways (not just the ones directly related to your work) is crucial for any form of biological research. That was my reasoning for taking this course. After taking this course, my opinion about understanding signaling pathways hasn't changed. You just don't need to take this class. Take another course or even set aside sometime on the weekends to do some reading. Crack open a textbook once in a while and save yourself the trouble. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this because it's very useful and there is really no other way to gain the information taught in this course "
