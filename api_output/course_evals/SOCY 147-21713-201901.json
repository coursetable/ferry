            "\u00a0This class will certainly teach you new models of analyzing social policies. A lot of the material is new and Boorman offers many unique insights to the field, which I found to be a great benefit of the class. ",
            "\u00a0-policymaking history from New Deal-present \r\n-tools of policy \r\n-models for studying and evaluating policy ",
            "\u00a0An understanding of the underpinnings to policy. The course is broken down at its core into 4 principle tools of social policy making and then we analyze them historically and then look at models to get a deep understanding of each ones impact on policy. An abstract look at policy making that has many useful insights. ",
            "\u00a0Logistics management, model building, history of social policy in US ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think formally and rigorously about policy and social networks in a modeling context, and apply that way of thinking to historical circumstances. ",
            "\u00a0So much! A broad overview of American social policy at the federal level from the 1930s to present day; the tools that policy actors use to implement social policy (i.e., via social networks, market mechanisms, bureaucracy, and collective choice mechanisms); the limitations and pitfalls of using each kind of policy tool; basic \"formal models\" that illustrate how organizations fail and where social policymakers can intervene/fall short (don't be intimidated by this, it just refers to explanations of processes that occur in the social policy world using simple math and drawings); and the importance of policy implementation (as opposed to policy adoption) and logistics. ",
            "\u00a0Simply put, I learned the tools to \"change the face of a nation.\" While an ambitious course goal, I think it was met by Prof. Boorman's amazing class. This was the best course I have taken in my time here at Yale, and broadly impacts how I think about issues of policy. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor is super smart and well-studied in the topic; well-organized and structured; all the material ties back into each other; easy work load\r\n\r\nCons: Professor speaks at times very quietly and sometimes mumbles through things that are parenthetical, makes it hard to hear; squishes a ton of details into a single sentence when speaking, making his point hard to follow at times; very dry lecture, uses no presentation or anything, just gives the lecture raw ",
            "\u00a0So boring. It's a small sized class that should just be converted to a larger style lecture. ",
            "\u00a0The course is a hidden gem. It should be better advertised so that more people can take it. ",
            "\u00a0This courses strength is in the brilliance of Professor Boorman. He is top notch, and anyone should take it if they want to sit and listen to a brilliant man talk. However at times the structure of the course feels very scattered and hard to follow. Also the only grade is the final so this makes it tough to gauge progress or stay engaged at all in the course. The content can seem unrelated and wont connect at times, and classes can drag on but it is a very fascinating course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Participation encouraged but def not required, very well organized, engaging if you like the material\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: class discussion could definitely get more interesting if it was required like in a seminar format ",
            "\u00a0A strength was the organization of the materials. A weakness was a lack of clarity in what readings were expected or assigned. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Uniqueness, relevance, and panoramic scope of the course material. Weaknesses: Sometimes unclear where Prof. Boorman is going or what the purpose of some information is. Also at times the course material was too overwhelming to wrap my head around, and I felt like I had to sacrifice learning some pieces of information to retain others. ",
            "\u00a0This course was particularly strong and well organized. Weaknesses are not readily identifiable, as this course kept a strict schedule which gave a robust overview of the area. "

        [
            "\u00a0Yes, for Credit D. The true grade is the final. He is very hard to follow at times, but the material isn't terribly complicated, so paying attention in lecture should be most if not all the work you have to do. ",
            "\u00a0No. Very boring. Class in not interactive in any way. Only grade is a final if you dont take optinal midterms. ",
            "\u00a0Given the material is more complex than I originally believed it to be, I would recommend that someone shops this course to be certain this it is the teaching style and level of challenge that they are prepared for. If the material interests you, I absolutely recommend you to learn it from such a knowledgable professor! ",
            "\u00a0Certainly! You learn so much, it is a very rewarding experience. The instructor is fantastic and the material is very interesting for all majors and background levels. ",
            "\u00a0If you take this, take it Credit/D. Theres no reason to put yourself through the stress of the literal only grade being the final exam. Once you do that you can appreciate the course for what it is: a good intro to policy work and principles of policy making. Honestly I feel like I have a superficial understanding of a lot of topics in policy analysis, and not much in depth knowledge. Prof Boorman is a brilliant man, but at times he carries on and can lose the class in his lecturing. Also he sends out course emails which are convoluted and lengthy. So its a decent class but i dont know if I would recommend to someone else. ",
            "\u00a0Yes if interesting in grand strategy thinking particularly in a social values sphere ",
            "\u00a0Its an interesting class. Its worth it if you invest some time into it. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. SOCY 147 is the most realistic public policy course I've taken in my four years at Yale. Highly recommend for anyone seriously interested in getting things done in life and making organizations accomplish their missions better, whether they are related to social policy or not. ",
            "\u00a0I would enthusiastically recommend this course to all with even a slight interest in the subject manner. While it might initially seem intense, Prof. Boorman works hard to keep the course at the level of an introductory course and the payoff is immense. "
