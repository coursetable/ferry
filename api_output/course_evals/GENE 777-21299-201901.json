            "\u00a0The strength of the course is the combination of lecture, discussion, individual reading, and research. A minor weakness is that the homework assignments were not evenly spaced through the semester. ",
            "\u00a0One weakness of this course was that all of the instructors were very focused on teaching the biology behind their particular research. It makes sense for professors to teach their own research, as that is what they are most expert in, however this resulted in us learning very niche and specialized information about particular processes without a broader focus on the principles and techniques central to the field. Overall, I do not think this resulted in a very unified course and there didn't seem to a be much communication between professors about what had already been taught.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, there was a lot of variation in the homework questions in terms of how clearly they were written and in how much background research they required to answer. In general, instructors posed questions that required understanding of the field beyond what was covered in class, so with background reading and writing a well-written and thoughtful answer I actually found the homework to be quite demanding. About half of the instructors graded these assignments fairly harshly and didn't always provide feedback. ",
            "\u00a0some of the lecturers opted out of teaching about straight development to instead talk about their own research. They then assign for homework essentially a grant for their own lab's research, even if it has very little to do with straight development\r\nThe TA was very good "

            "\u00a0Overall, I would probably not recommend this course to another student because the workload was so heavy and I didn't think the lectures were broad enough to be useful for me in the future. That being said, I did learn a lot from answering the take home questions. ",
