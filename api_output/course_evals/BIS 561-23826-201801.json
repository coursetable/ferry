            "\u00a0Very interactive class ",
            "\u00a0This course is very well organized. The textbook used in this course offers a very good introduction to multicentre clinical trials - it was written by the primary instructor too! The primary instructor is super knowledgeable and cares a lot about his students. ",
            "\u00a0Course was great. Felt that there was a lot more on the agenda, but this was interrupted by inclement weather. Instructor could've been more engaging with students to make things interesting. ",
            "\u00a0great ",
            "\u00a0I really learned everything useful for clinical trial in this class. It worth my tuition fee. Professor Peter is also very kind to international students. I appreciate this. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, it was an interesting topic. I took this class because I was interested in taking the clinical trials class in the fall semester but could not. This course does not require that one as a prerequisite and I was told by a classmate that this one was much more enjoyable. We had a very small and intimate class. There were definitely things that I learned from this class, but it was not very rigorous and did not really add a semester's worth of knowledge for me (someone who has minimal understanding of statistics, etc). It is a good class to take when you want to gain some knowledge in this area but do not want a rigorous class (its somewhat like a filler class thats an easy A in undergrad, but looks like you've taken something really useful). Overall, I appreciated the class content, but perhaps something with more rigor would be even more valuable at the Masters level. "

            "\u00a0Dr. Peduzzi is a super supportive and knowledgeable professor. He put in a lot of efforts in organizing the course, very clear of his expectations from his students, and very good at explaining concepts relating to multicentre clinical trials. ",
            "\u00a0Great knowledge of subject matter with practical experience. Perfect credentials to teach the course. ",

            "\u00a0He was very nice and caring towards his students. He was of course more interested in the fact that we learned something than he was interested in making sure that we were tested severely. His exams were incredibly fair, and on the easier side - he was very forthcoming about what he expected us to know on both the exams. I appreciated the time he took to go through some of the calculations that were more difficult to understand. "

And you'll find you don't need lots of after-class time since you've already digested everything in the class ",
