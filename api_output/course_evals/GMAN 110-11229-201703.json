            "\u00a0This course provides a good grasps of the basics of German. By the end of the course you can hold and understand some brief conversations. ",
            "\u00a0I learned basic German Grammar and how to speak German. ",
            "\u00a0I feel that I gained a much greater understanding of both the German language and culture. I developed an enhanced ability to learn in an immersive language environment. I now know how to conjugate in German and a lot of German vocabulary. I think I would feel comfortable walking around in Germany now. ",
            "\u00a0I am confident to speak German with simple phrases ",
            "\u00a0I love this question in this context. I didn't know any German before, now I know some German and a little more about German culture too. "

            "\u00a0The class is pretty cookie-cutter. Perhaps more focus on vocabulary in class? ",
            "\u00a0I think students should learn how to talk about food sooner. ",
            "\u00a0MORE SONGS ",
            "\u00a0The course involved a lot of practice speaking with classmates which helped to get used to using the language practically. Hearing so much German from the professor also helped us to get used to patterns and phrases important to the language. However, the dedication to language immersion sometimes made understanding difficult. Occasionally I couldn't decipher the instructions for an activity or a grammar explanation. ",
            "\u00a0I felt that at times we spent too much time on one unit and not enough on the other. I also wish there was more written work that we had to complete daily. I feel like the written work would have been more beneficial than the online homework. ",
            "\u00a0Although I see the benefits of an immersive language and firemen, I feel as though it wouldve been a lot easier to understand what was going on if our instructor also occasionally spoke in English. It wouldve cleared up a lot of confusion immediately as opposed to later on when we fully understood what we were learning. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Thorsten was great at engaging the class\r\n\r\nWeakness: would have preferred tests at each week to lower the overall percentage for each class ",
            "\u00a0Overall the course is great. The only improvement I could ask for would be to let the teachers have a slight bit more leeway on tests/class material, but I know the whole department has to be on the same page so its really not an issue with the class itself. "

            "\u00a0Yes! Take German! ",
            "\u00a0YES TAKE IT WITH THORSTEN GERMAN IS SO FUN ALSO USE DUOLINGO I PROMISE IT HELPS ",
            "\u00a0If you want to learn German, go for it. I enjoy the process of learning languages, and German has been an interesting one to learn so far. It has more grammar than English or Spanish, but there are many similar words. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0I would most certainly recommend this course to someone. It's definitely not the easiest languages to take, but by far it has been one of the most rewarding. It has forced me to learn how to study, and more importantly, to have confidence. Having confidence is one key to succeeding when speaking. Everyone struggles with speaking; you're not alone, even if you feel like you are. It took me a while to learn this. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to other students. If you are interested in learning a language, especially one with a rich history, this is the class for you. The German department is well organized and the professors are fantastic. Its a really interesting class and its cool to see the similarities with English. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! The best language class at Yale ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I don't really know how to explain that--take it if you want to learn German! "
