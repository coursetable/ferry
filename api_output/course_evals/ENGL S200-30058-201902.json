            "\u00a0I learned an incredible amount on Shakespeare in a very short period of time. I also feel my writing skills have improved from Professor Brismans feedback, and I am also positive I have developed my critical and close reading skills in many ways. ",
            "\u00a0The ability to understand Shakespeare in a different light. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about managing time with reading and helped improve my personal sense of discipline. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to analyze not only a piece of literature, but also how to incorporate outside literary critique in my arguments. I learned how to develop my arguments to be more substantial, and how to focus on something small and branch out rather than choose a broad idea and go all over the place. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about what it means to deeply analyze Shakespeare's works, and the workload was some of the heftiest I have encountered in an English class before. At times it felt too demanding, but I chose to see it as an opportunity to challenge and exercise self-discipline. I was not let down in this regard. I was exposed to a great deal of interpretations of the works in the form of actual productions of the plays, which I have had very little exposure to in the past. This was perhaps the most important thing I took away from the course. "

            "\u00a0This course is very fast paced in the Summer. While that allowed us the opportunity to learn as much as possible, it also made for a lot of stress at times. Perhaps lessening the amount of required writing for the term could help, especially for students balancing two course credits (which is, I think, the case of most Summer Session students). Its biggest strength was Brisman himself - he is a wonderful section leader, and not once did I get that dreadful when is this gonna end feeling, even though our sections were very long. That is a real talent - at times, its easy to get that feeling from much shorter classes. Professor Brisman never had me looking at the clock, not even once. Professor Spargo, who came in as a guest lecturer, was also great. ",
            "\u00a0strength: massive amount of discussions &screenings\r\nweakness: no group projects\r\n\r\nIn the future, may involve group projects and group assignment ",
            "\u00a0The course is almost too fast paced. I think the three 90-minute class meetings for each book were Monday, Monday evening, and Tuesday, and then two meetings on Thursday night and Friday this would pace the class time more manageably. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nMeaningful discussions\r\nLoved the screening sessions\r\nOuting to Lennox was incredibly enjoyable\r\nImprovements:\r\nI wish we had screening sessions throughout the whole course since they really improved my analysis of the plays ",
            "\u00a0The workload was overbearing for many students in the class, and I found myself struggling to manage at times. Perhaps a more selective list of material could be chosen in the future. Class discussions were incredibly long, and this was difficult for me as well because of my ability to stay attentive and engaged for the entirety of the 4 hour period. I do, however, understand that this is a drawback of the summer course experience; perhaps the university could explore other options for making changes in this regard. The class was very strong in challenging students to engage with the literature in terms of perspective and thematic quality, specifically as it relates to character development. This is a vague statement, but to truly understand, one must simply engage in conversation with this course's brilliant professor. "

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this for any student interested in learning about Shakespeare. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It is a immersion in literature and probably the best example of how to learn Shakespeare western educational system can provide. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I learned a lot and was exposed to a lot of literature. ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely. I feel that Shakespeare is something every student should take at least one course in when at college/university. This is the perfect course to do so. The discussion based aspect of the course allows space for brilliant discussion and intelligent insight. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to anyone who is not prepared to work very hard, both in the amount of reading that is required as well as the demands of constant essay-writing. However, if students are looking to challenge themselves and have a truly one-of-a-kind experience with Shakespeare, this is the class for them. "
