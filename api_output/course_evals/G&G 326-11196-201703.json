            "\u00a0I learned a little bit about a lot of different topics in planetary physics. It was a good course and I feel like I came away having learned a lot overall. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught a wide range physics concepts relating to the Earth.  This course teaches you to use the physics you'd learn in an intro physics course and apply to a real-world environment.  The material was all interesting and applicable to geology and many physical sciences. "

            "\u00a0This course was really small, and I think the grad students and the undergrad students were at different levels which was a little strange sometimes. The lectures were good. I think the lab portion of the class could be improved. We couldn't always use the time efficiently because of the instruments we were using. ",
            "\u00a0This course is driven by lecture and powerpoint slides.  This is great.  Prof. Lee is a good lecturer and she can hold the attention of the class.  However, sometimes class would derive some equation/relationship/rule et cetera and the math would drag on for a long time.  The lab components of the course were often haphazard.  The material was easy to learn using the lab exercises, but the lab equipment was often very frustrating. "

            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend it! A lot of interesting topics are covered. Keep in mind that it's a bit of a survey course of planetary physics so we didn't really go in depth into any one thing. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course about the Earth.  If you are interested in applying physics to the natural world this is a great course. "
