            "\u00a0I learned about some of the basic research methods used to design a research question, execute and experiment, and present findings. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to conduct field research in the tropics. ",
            "\u00a0I learned lots of fun facts about Panama! \r\nI already knew how to write a formal scientific paper, but this class provided an opportunity to improve that skill. ",
            "\u00a0What an amazing course! Invaluable Field skills. Incredible experiences in the tropics. In a short time I went from being a novice to feeling like I really understand what goes into tropical ecology. I feel more experienced and ready to explore this career. I also feel like they did an incredible job helping us craft research in the field and supporting us with writing and statistics when we got back. ",
            "\u00a0A better understanding of plant research and basic knowledge of tropical ecology (mostly plants). I also developed my scientific writing skills and learned more about the peer review process. "

            "\u00a0This course met my expectations...and the field trip exceeded them! ",
            "\u00a0I expected the class to be focused on ecology, but it turned out to be more focused on the field component. That being said, I was extremely pleased that that was the case and this class experience was very helpful in my own research and in completing work for other classes. ",
            "\u00a0There was a greater emphasis on the presentation of research and results than I was expecting, but that was actually a nice surprise. ",
            "\u00a0They aligned well with my expectations. ",

            "\u00a0The strength of the course was definitely the field trip, it was amazing. I also appreciated that we had to finish our final papers early (Liza and Simon said we'd thank them, and we do). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Wonderfully practical and interactive, worked closely with professors and TA to complete our projects, very well organized field trip experience, professors and TA were great and very approachable\r\nWeakness: Could have discussed more about Panama's history, indigenous people, and land use history of field trip sites ",
            "\u00a0This is a good field course that goes through the process of research fairly well. I think the change of having the trip at the beginning of the semester is an excellent decision.  However, I think it would be better if students had more time to develop their projects and collect data in the field, possibly doing one project instead of two. I also think more time and discussion needs to be devoted to the socio-economic context in which our field work occurs. I respect the instructors wishes to focus on the science for the course, but I firmly believe in the importance of the social side of environmental studies and that the student experience would be so much richer if it is more intersectional. ",
            "\u00a0The trip to Panama was fantastic and Liza and Simon are the perfect people to lead it.  It was also a great way to get to know some of my classmates in a way I wouldn't have been able to otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe course was quite a bit more work than I expected, considering the fact that we spent so much time on it in Panama.  This wasn't necessarily a problem, but if I had had a more accurate idea of how much time I would need to allocate to it once back in New Haven, I might have designed my schedule for the semester a little differently. ",
            "\u00a0I love the field trip portion it was a great opportunity to experience the rainforest and see BCI. I also really liked crafting the papers from our field research it was great experience for me in preparation for my own field work. ",
            "\u00a0The field trip portion (which is most of the class) is excellent. I enjoyed the activities, the guest speakers, the places that we went. It was interesting and lots of fun. Also, doing it in January and then having the semester afterward worked great. \r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to include a speaker that could talk more about the political and social history of the Panama Canal, Gamboa, and BCI. Or at least to read some articles on this topic. BCI exists as a research site due to US military occupation of Panama and US-led massive environmental destruction in the region in building the canal. What does this mean ethically, socially, politically, and scientifically for those doing research in BCI and Gamboa? It would have loved to hear more of Liza's thoughts on this, as well as other speakers. ",
            "\u00a0One weakness of the course is that there was too much work near the end of the semester. I would have rather done our presentations closer to the trip. It felt like years later when we finished the course. More or less I'd want more of the semester work to be pushed into the actual trip. Maybe a final day where we put together presentations and give them in the field? This was by far the heaviest workload for my class. also groupwork was hard. I had two classmates who did very little. ",
            "\u00a0The Panama trip was really well organized and lots of fun while also allowing for a lot of learning. I liked working on our own individual research projects -  I think there could be better communication of the steps we took for writing final papers (data analysis, presentations, drafts, etc) while still in Panama so perhaps we'd get thinking about that a bit earlier.

            "\u00a0Make the most of the field trip and interact with your classmates. The great dynamic between students, professors, and TA was formed during the field trip and was a key reason in the class being as great as it was. ",
            "\u00a0Don't make the mistake of thinking that the bulk of the work will happen in Panama.  There is a lot of research, analysis, and writing to be done throughout the semester.  And make sure that everyone in each of your research groups understands this too; you'll have to coordinate well once you get back to New Haven and one person not pulling their weight on the assignments creates a lot of extra work for everyone else.
