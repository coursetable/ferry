            "\u00a0The ability to read papers and to openly participate without fear of being ridiculed. ",
            "\u00a0This class really taught be how to dissect a scientific paper. I am floored by how much more confident I feel analyzing and reading science. I find that this level of critical reading has really helped me gauge how closely I should be reading all literature too. This is so useful because I would like to have an academic public health career and I find that this skill applies to all disciplines. ",
            "\u00a0Talking about science with scientists in a rather intense way -- a strong focus on understanding paper methodology and research approach. If you don't speak up in seminars, this class will force you to, in a very good way. ",
            "\u00a01) Reading primary scientific literature with an analytical lens\r\n2) Learning to critique methods and experiments \r\n3) Presenting papers for discussion\r\n4) Defending and articulating opinions in front of peers and professors ",
            "\u00a0In taking MCDB 435, I learned a great deal about how some of today's most preeminent methods and integral understandings came to be, and I had the pleasure of learning alongside a group of engaged peers from two distinguished scientists in the field. I feel like I became much more comfortable reading, interpreting, and presenting scientific literature, and definitely improved my confidence in speaking as the semester progressed. ",
            "\u00a0Great class to learn how to read academic literature ",
            "\u00a0This course accomplished exactly what it set out to do: to make students extremely comfortable with, and proficient in, reading papers in cell bio (and other related disciplines). The material we covered was intellectually challenging but never overwhelming. ",
            "\u00a0I became much more comfortable tackling dense cell biology papers and recognizing common reagents and methods used in the lab. It was really cool to gain a more in-depth understanding of certain techniques I do on a daily basis in lab research but didnt really know to a full extent what each of the steps entailed. I also came out feeling much more confident in speaking up in class since you really have to put yourself out there, with your grade being based on how much you talk (not even necessarily on whether or not what you say is always correct). ",
            "\u00a0This class is unique and teaches cell bio in the best way- through experiments. You learn better than you would in 102 and cell bio lecture because its all applied and its all in the real world. Also learn scientific discourse skills. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a must-take for biology majors! It is a ton of work, but you get used to it towards the end of the semester. Get ready to put in a lot of time, but it is very much worth it! ",
            "\u00a0I have gained a lot of skill in being able to break down molecular biology papers, as well as being able to accurately analyze and present data in front of a room. ",
            "\u00a0Ive learned a lot about the history of cell biology - some of the key players and happenstance that went into landmark discoveries. "

            "\u00a0A fantastic class in my opinion. The only real weakness is the timing - 7 to 9pm is not ideal, but it's also not the worst thing in the world. I always just felt a little tired during class, but it didn't destroy me. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The teachers, the formats\r\nWeaknesses: don't change a thing! ",
            "\u00a0The weakness of this course is the fact that some students really derail conversation. The strength is in the professors -- neither Mooseker nor Rosenbaum will let a point get away without being investigated. Every figure and method will be understood by the class no matter what. ",
            "\u00a0Great class, very student driven, professors did a great job facilitating personal growth. The people who make up the class can make or break the class. That being said, seniors should be given absolute preference in the future. ",
            "\u00a0I think the greatest strength of this course is the discourse and dialogue between Professor Mooseker and Professor Rosenbaum. They do not agree on everything, and that's what makes this course so great. Hearing their perspectives, as well as the observations and opinions of your peers, makes for an engaging course where you truly learn and deeply think about the material. The papers were interesting, and discussion was easily facilitated. The only weakness I can think of is the time of day the course is offered, but that is convenient in its own right as well. ",
            "\u00a0A very enjoyable classroom experience ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: encouraging professors who, although might put you on the spot and ask you to answer a tough question, really want to share tons of information (and fun stories of how landmark papers came to be, since they know a lot of the paper authors); an atmosphere in which students encourage others to participate (two students lead the paper discussion each week and call on others for input); interesting papers from pivotal moments in cell biology that help you see how weve come to what we know today \r\n\r\nNeutral area: If you wanted to know how you were doing in the class, you needed to speak to Professors Rosenbaum and Mooseker directly about it  otherwise, there wasnt too much indication of how well everyone was doing. It wasnt difficult to know if you werent speaking up enough compared to your classmates, but if youre someone who gets anxious about your grade, dont hesitate to reach out to the professors. They offered meetings at the halfway point of the class for people who wanted to know about their performance. ",
            "\u00a0The professors are great, chill, and there to help you learn. ",
            "\u00a0There is no quantitiative feedback, so you dont really know how well you do in the class until you get your final grade. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this class are definitely the two professors leading it, Mark Mooseker and Joel Rosenbaum. They are able to make every class light hearted no matter the topic, but also can guide both presenters and student discussion effectively. They also have various tidbits to share about the careers of the authors of the papers we read, who often spent part of their academic careers at Yale! \r\n\r\nIn the same line of thought, sometimes the professors can drag out the significance of relatively simple figures and conclusions of data from these papers. Some of our class times together could had effective hour long discussions instead of being stretched out to the full two hours we were there. ",
            "\u00a0This course allowed immersion in the material and a productive discussion between student and instructor. The evening meeting time and occasionally stuffy room sometimes conspired to make focusing a bit difficult, so make sure to bring caffeine if you think youll need it! "

            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to any MCDB major. 435 can fulfill your upper level requirement, but even if you've already fulfilled it, I would still recommend taking the course so that you can gain a better grasp of how to read scientific papers. Moose and Rosie have a wealth of knowledge and can help you to learn so much. ",
            "\u00a0I am already recommending this class to all the MCDB undergrads I know! I am so happy to have taken it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to anyone, but only MCDB/MBB seniors will probably get in. You need to have a strong background in understanding research to really get the most out of this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if Moose and Rosy are teaching! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Landmark Papers in Cell Biology was far and away my favorite MCDB class, and I developed strong relationships with the professors and my peers through taking this course. Both professors went above and beyond in facilitating and providing us information that carried us through an interwoven history of landmark papers in cell biology, and I thoroughly enjoyed my time in the course! Taking the time to conduct a deep dive into 1-3 papers per week is incredibly valuable and I feel that I came away from this class a much better [informed] scientist. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this course! One of my favorite ",
            "\u00a0Yes! A great, chill senior seminar, whether or not youre in MCDB. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this, if you can get in (class size was 18 this year)! Its a lot of fun once you realize how things work during seminar and how you should be preparing for each class. Professors Rosenbaum and Mooseker really make the class a fun time. ",
            "\u00a0TAKE IT FOR MCDB SENIOR REQUIREMENT. You won't find a better one out there. ",
            "\u00a0It's a great senior MCDB class! If you can get it, you really should take it. The theme of the MCDB department at Yale is not to digest and regurgitate the biology we've learned since high school, but to uncover how those facts were discovered. This class is the epitome of that idea, covering everything from the discovery of CDK proteins to kinetochores to kinesin and even gene therapy. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take it! Professors Mooseker and Rosenbaum are fantastic and the discussion can be lively. ",
            "\u00a0this is a great course--all you have to do is read a paper a week and present once or twice. it really helps solidify cell biology concepts and is a good exercise in reading papers. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Definitely take this course to feel comfortable reading journal articles thoroughly. "
