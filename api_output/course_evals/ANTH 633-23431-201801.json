            "\u00a0I was a relative novice when it came to all things related to ethnography and reproductive justice. Over the course of the semester I gained a deeper knowledge of how to read an analyze ethnography and research methodologies. I also learned quite a bit about how to apply the reproductive justice framework in various contexts. I gained a greater insight into the world of obstetrics and reproductive health across various parts of the world, and I learned how to ask incisive questions about the course materials. "

            "\u00a0A strength of the course is its simple, straightforward structure. Knowing exactly how to prepare for each week's discussions was easy, and I enjoyed the fact that each week's lecture was presented by a different member of the class. Professor Newman did a great job of \"co-teaching\" with students and leading the conversation after each week's presentation. I also felt the use of a blog as the primary space for written responses was really useful. The class was able to write thoughtful responses to each week's reading and also share info about events on campus, other forms of media related to reproductive justice, etc.\r\n\r\nI think perhaps a weakness of the course is the amount of reading material assigned each week as compared to the time allotted to discuss the reading assignments. Often times we'd be assigned an entire book, and only had about 80-90 minutes to discuss it fully. We often had to end class right as the discussion was getting really interesting. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I learned quite a bit, and I found the syllabus to be engaging and well-balanced. The conversations each week were thought-provoking and full of robust analysis. "
