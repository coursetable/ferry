            "\u00a0Strengths: consistent work load following same pattern for each unit, interesting ways of learning (class discussion, projects, essays, presentations, etc.), small class size\r\nWeaknesses: too difficult, I think that since we meet everyday and the homework is a lot, normal quia assignments should be graded for completion. The tests were also a little too hard. You have to sacrifice A LOT of time to do well in this class, and the problem is that it then prevents you from pursuing a lot of other amazing things at Yale deeply. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were the variety of learning styles used, including powerpoints, home exercises, essays, etc. The biggest strength for my course, however, was Liang Laoshi! The only weakness I can think of is that maybe the tutorial sessions aren't necessary EVERY week (maybe twice a month?), though that might just be a me thing. "

            "\u00a0If you're looking to truly devote yourself to Chinese, then definitely. If you're not willing to commit wholeheartedly, I wouldn't recommend it, just because it is so much work each night. "
